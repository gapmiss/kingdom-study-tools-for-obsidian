### 1
But in the last [[H319]] days [[H3117]] it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] the mountain [[H2022]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] in the top [[H7218]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] and it [[H1931]] shall be exalted [[H5375]] above the hills; [[H1389]] and people [[H5971]] shall flow [[H5102]] unto [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 2
And many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] shall come, [[H1980]] and say, [[H559]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the God [[H430]] of Jacob; [[H3290]] and he will teach [[H3384]] us of his ways, [[H1870]] and we will walk [[H1980]] in his paths: [[H734]] for [[H3588]] the law [[H8451]] shall go forth [[H3318]] of Zion, [[H6726]] and the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] from Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
And he shall judge [[H8199]] among [[H996]] many [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] and rebuke [[H3198]] strong [[H6099]] nations [[H1471]] afar off; [[H7350]] and they shall beat [[H3807]] their swords [[H2719]] into plowshares, [[H855]] and their spears [[H2595]] into pruninghooks: [[H4211]] nation [[H1471]] shall not [[H3808]] lift up [[H5375]] a sword [[H2719]] against [[H413]] nation, [[H1471]] neither [[H3808]] shall they learn [[H3925]] war [[H4421]] any more. [[H4421]]

### 4
But they shall sit [[H3427]] every man [[H376]] under [[H8478]] his vine [[H1612]] and under [[H8478]] his fig tree; [[H8384]] and none [[H369]] shall make afraid: [[H2729]] for [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath spoken [[H1696]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] people [[H5971]] will walk [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] in the name [[H8034]] of his god, [[H430]] and we [[H587]] will walk [[H1980]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

### 6
In that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] will I assemble [[H622]] her that halteth, [[H6760]] and I will gather [[H6908]] her that is driven out, [[H5080]] and her that [[H834]] I have afflicted; [[H7489]]

### 7
And I will make [[H7760]] her that halted [[H6760]] a remnant, [[H7611]] and her that was cast far off [[H1972]] a strong [[H6099]] nation: [[H1471]] and the Lord [[H3068]] shall reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] them in mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] from henceforth, [[H6258]] even for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 8
And thou, [[H859]] O tower [[H4026]] of the flock, [[H5739]] the strong hold [[H6076]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] unto [[H5704]] thee shall it come, [[H857]] even the first [[H7223]] dominion; [[H4475]] the kingdom [[H4467]] shall come [[H935]] to the daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 9
Now [[H6258]] why [[H4100]] dost thou cry out [[H7321]] aloud? [[H7452]] no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in thee? is thy counseller [[H3289]] perished? [[H6]] for [[H3588]] pangs [[H2427]] have taken [[H2388]] thee as a woman in travail. [[H3205]]

### 10
Be in pain, [[H2342]] and labour to bring forth, [[H1518]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] like a woman in travail: [[H3205]] for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] shalt thou go forth [[H3318]] out of the city, [[H7151]] and thou shalt dwell [[H7931]] in the field, [[H7704]] and thou shalt go [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Babylon; [[H894]] there [[H8033]] shalt thou be delivered; [[H5337]] there [[H8033]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall redeem [[H1350]] thee from the hand [[H3709]] of thine enemies. [[H341]]

### 11
Now [[H6258]] also many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] are gathered [[H622]] against [[H5921]] thee, that say, [[H559]] Let her be defiled, [[H2610]] and let our eye [[H5869]] look [[H2372]] upon Zion. [[H6726]]

### 12
But they [[H1992]] know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the thoughts [[H4284]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] neither [[H3808]] understand [[H995]] they his counsel: [[H6098]] for [[H3588]] he shall gather [[H6908]] them as the sheaves [[H5995]] into the floor. [[H1637]]

### 13
Arise [[H6965]] and thresh, [[H1758]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion: [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] I will make [[H7760]] thine horn [[H7161]] iron, [[H1270]] and I will make [[H7760]] thy hoofs [[H6541]] brass: [[H5154]] and thou shalt beat in pieces [[H1854]] many [[H7227]] people: [[H5971]] and I will consecrate [[H2763]] their gain [[H1215]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and their substance [[H2428]] unto the Lord [[H113]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth.
