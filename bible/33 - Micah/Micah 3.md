### 1
And I said, [[H559]] Hear, [[H8085]] I pray you, [[H4994]] O heads [[H7218]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and ye princes [[H7101]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] not [[H3808]] for you to know [[H3045]] judgment? [[H4941]]

### 2
Who hate [[H8130]] the good, [[H2896]] and love [[H157]] the evil; [[H7451]] who pluck off [[H1497]] their skin [[H5785]] from off [[H5921]] them, and their flesh [[H7607]] from off [[H5921]] their bones; [[H6106]]

### 3
Who [[H834]] also eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H7607]] of my people, [[H5971]] and flay [[H6584]] their skin [[H5785]] from off [[H5921]] them; and they break [[H6476]] their bones, [[H6106]] and chop them in pieces, [[H6566]] as [[H834]] for the pot, [[H5518]] and as flesh [[H1320]] within [[H8432]] the caldron. [[H7037]]

### 4
Then [[H227]] shall they cry [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] but he will not [[H3808]] hear [[H6030]] them: he will even hide [[H5641]] his face [[H6440]] from them at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] as [[H834]] they have behaved themselves ill [[H7489]] in their doings. [[H4611]]

### 5
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] concerning [[H5921]] the prophets [[H5030]]  that make [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] err, [[H8582]] that bite [[H5391]] with their teeth, [[H8127]] and cry, [[H7121]] Peace; [[H7965]] and he that [[H834]] putteth [[H5414]] not [[H3808]] into [[H5921]] their mouths, [[H6310]] they even prepare [[H6942]] war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] night [[H3915]] unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; [[H2377]] and it shall be dark [[H2821]] unto you, that ye shall not divine; [[H7080]] and the sun [[H8121]] shall go down [[H935]] over [[H5921]] the prophets, [[H5030]] and the day [[H3117]] shall be dark [[H6937]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 7
Then shall the seers [[H2374]] be ashamed, [[H954]] and the diviners [[H7080]] confounded: [[H2659]] yea, they shall all [[H3605]] cover [[H5844]] their lips; [[H8222]] for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] answer [[H4617]] of God. [[H430]]

### 8
But truly [[H199]] I [[H595]] am full [[H4390]] of power [[H3581]] by [[H853]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and of judgment, [[H4941]] and of might, [[H1369]] to declare [[H5046]] unto Jacob [[H3290]] his transgression, [[H6588]] and to Israel [[H3478]] his sin. [[H2403]]

### 9
Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] I pray you, [[H4994]] ye heads [[H7218]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and princes [[H7101]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that abhor [[H8581]] judgment, [[H4941]] and pervert [[H6140]] all [[H3605]] equity. [[H3477]]

### 10
They build up [[H1129]] Zion [[H6726]] with blood, [[H1818]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] with iniquity. [[H5766]]

### 11
The heads [[H7218]] thereof judge [[H8199]] for reward, [[H7810]] and the priests [[H3548]] thereof teach [[H3384]] for hire, [[H4242]] and the prophets [[H5030]] thereof divine [[H7080]] for money: [[H3701]] yet will they lean [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and say, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] among [[H7130]] us? none [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] can come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 12
Therefore [[H3651]] shall Zion [[H6726]] for your sake [[H1558]] be plowed [[H2790]] a field, [[H7704]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall become [[H1961]] heaps, [[H5856]] and the mountain [[H2022]] of the house [[H1004]] as the high places [[H1116]] of the forest. [[H3293]]
