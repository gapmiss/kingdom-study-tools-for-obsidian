[[Micah 6|←]] • [[Nahum 1|→]]

---

### 1
Woe [[H480]] is me! for [[H3588]] I am [[H1961]] as when they have gathered [[H625]] the summer fruits, [[H7019]] as the grapegleanings [[H5955]] of the vintage: [[H1210]] no [[H369]] cluster [[H811]] to eat: [[H398]] my soul [[H5315]] desired [[H183]] the firstripe fruit. [[H1063]]

### 2
The good [[H2623]] is perished [[H6]] out of [[H4480]] the earth: [[H776]] and none [[H369]] upright [[H3477]] among men: [[H120]] they all [[H3605]] lie in wait [[H693]] for blood; [[H1818]] they hunt [[H6679]] every man [[H376]] his brother [[H251]] with a net. [[H2764]]

### 3
That they may do evil [[H7451]] with both hands [[H3709]] earnestly, [[H3190]] the prince [[H8269]] asketh, [[H7592]] and the judge [[H8199]] for a reward; [[H7966]] and the great [[H1419]] he [[H1931]] uttereth [[H1696]] his mischievous [[H1942]] desire: [[H5315]] so they wrap it up. [[H5686]]

### 4
The best [[H2896]] of them as a brier: [[H2312]] the most upright [[H3477]] than a thorn hedge: [[H4534]] the day [[H3117]] of thy watchmen [[H6822]] thy visitation [[H6486]] cometh; [[H935]] now [[H6258]] shall be [[H1961]] their perplexity. [[H3998]]

### 5
Trust [[H539]] ye not [[H408]] in a friend, [[H7453]] put ye not confidence [[H982]] in a guide: [[H441]] keep [[H8104]] the doors [[H6607]] of thy mouth [[H6310]] from her that lieth [[H7901]] in thy bosom. [[H2436]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] the son [[H1121]] dishonoureth [[H5034]] the father, [[H1]] the daughter [[H1323]] riseth up [[H6965]] against her mother, [[H517]] the daughter in law [[H3618]] against her mother in law; [[H2545]] a man's [[H376]] enemies [[H341]] the men [[H582]] of his own house. [[H1004]]

### 7
Therefore I [[H589]] will look [[H6822]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] I will wait [[H3176]] for the God [[H430]] of my salvation: [[H3468]] my God [[H430]] will hear [[H8085]] me. [[H8085]]

### 8
Rejoice [[H8056]] not [[H408]] against me, O mine enemy: [[H341]] when [[H3588]] I fall, [[H5307]] I shall arise; [[H6965]] when [[H3588]] I sit [[H3427]] in darkness, [[H2822]] the Lord [[H3068]] a light [[H216]] unto me. [[H216]]

### 9
I will bear [[H5375]] the indignation [[H2197]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] I have sinned [[H2398]] against him, until [[H5704]] he plead [[H7378]] my cause, [[H7379]] and execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] for me: he will bring me forth [[H3318]] to the light, [[H216]] I shall behold [[H7200]] his righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 10
Then mine enemy [[H341]] shall see [[H7200]] and shame [[H955]] shall cover [[H3680]] her which said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Where [[H346]] is the Lord [[H3068]] thy God? [[H430]] mine eyes [[H5869]] shall behold [[H7200]] her: now [[H6258]] shall she be [[H1961]] trodden down [[H4823]] as the mire [[H2916]] of the streets. [[H2351]]

### 11
the day [[H3117]] that thy walls [[H1447]] are to be built, [[H1129]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall the decree [[H2706]] be far removed. [[H7368]]

### 12
that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] he shall come [[H935]] even to [[H5704]] thee from [[H4480]] Assyria, [[H804]] and the fortified cities, [[H5892]] and from [[H4480]] the fortress [[H4693]] even to [[H5704]] the river, [[H5104]] and from sea [[H3220]] to sea, [[H3220]] and mountain [[H2022]] to mountain. [[H2022]]

### 13
Notwithstanding the land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] because of [[H5921]] them that dwell [[H3427]] therein, for the fruit [[H6529]] of their doings. [[H4611]]

### 14
Feed [[H7462]] thy people [[H5971]] with thy rod, [[H7626]] the flock [[H6629]] of thine heritage, [[H5159]] which dwell [[H7931]] solitarily [[H910]] the wood, [[H3293]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Carmel: [[H3760]] let them feed [[H7462]] Bashan [[H1316]] and Gilead, [[H1568]] as in the days [[H3117]] of old. [[H5769]]

### 15
According to the days [[H3117]] of thy coming out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will I shew [[H7200]] unto him marvellous [[H6381]]

### 16
The nations [[H1471]] shall see [[H7200]] and be confounded [[H954]] at all [[H3605]] their might: [[H1369]] they shall lay [[H7760]] hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] mouth, [[H6310]] their ears [[H241]] shall be deaf. [[H2790]]

### 17
They shall lick [[H3897]] the dust [[H6083]] like a serpent, [[H5175]] they shall move [[H7264]] out of their holes [[H4526]] like worms [[H2119]] of the earth: [[H776]] they shall be afraid [[H6342]] of [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and shall fear [[H3372]] because of [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 18
Who [[H4310]] a God [[H410]] like unto thee, [[H3644]] that pardoneth [[H5375]] iniquity, [[H5771]] and passeth by [[H5674]] the transgression [[H6588]] of the remnant [[H7611]] of his heritage? [[H5159]] he retaineth [[H2388]] not [[H3808]] his anger [[H639]] for ever, [[H5703]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] delighteth [[H2654]] mercy. [[H2617]]

### 19
He will turn again, [[H7725]] he will have compassion [[H7355]] upon us; he will subdue [[H3533]] our iniquities; [[H5771]] and thou wilt cast [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] their sins [[H2403]] into the depths [[H4688]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 20
Thou wilt perform [[H5414]] the truth [[H571]] to Jacob, [[H3290]] the mercy [[H2617]] to Abraham, [[H85]] which [[H834]] thou hast sworn [[H7650]] unto our fathers [[H1]] from the days [[H3117]] of old. [[H6924]]
