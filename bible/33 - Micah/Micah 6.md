### 1
Hear [[H8085]] ye now [[H4994]] what [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] saith; [[H559]] Arise, [[H6965]] contend [[H7378]] thou before [[H854]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and let the hills [[H1389]] hear [[H8085]] thy voice. [[H6963]]

### 2
Hear [[H8085]] ye, O mountains, [[H2022]] the Lord's [[H3068]] controversy, [[H7379]] and ye strong [[H386]] foundations [[H4146]] of the earth: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath a controversy [[H7379]] with [[H5973]] his people, [[H5971]] and he will plead [[H3198]] with [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
O my people, [[H5971]] what [[H4100]] have I done [[H6213]] unto thee? and wherein [[H4100]] have I wearied [[H3811]] thee? testify [[H6030]] against me. [[H6030]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] I brought thee up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and redeemed [[H6299]] thee out of the house [[H1004]] of servants; [[H5650]] and I sent [[H7971]] before [[H6440]]  thee [[H853]] Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and Miriam. [[H4813]]

### 5
O my people, [[H5971]] remember [[H2142]] now [[H4994]] what [[H4100]] Balak [[H1111]] king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] consulted, [[H3289]] and what [[H4100]] Balaam [[H1109]] the son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] answered [[H6030]] him from [[H4480]] Shittim [[H7851]] unto [[H5704]] Gilgal; [[H1537]] that [[H4616]] ye may know [[H3045]] the righteousness [[H6666]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
Wherewith [[H4100]] shall I come before [[H6923]] the Lord, [[H3068]] bow myself [[H3721]] before the high [[H4791]] God? [[H430]] shall I come before [[H6923]] him with burnt offerings, [[H5930]] with calves [[H5695]] of a year [[H8141]] old? [[H1121]]

### 7
Will the Lord [[H3068]] be pleased [[H7521]] with thousands [[H505]] of rams, [[H352]] with ten thousands [[H7233]] of rivers [[H5158]] of oil? [[H8081]] shall I give [[H5414]] my firstborn [[H1060]] my transgression, [[H6588]] the fruit [[H6529]] of my body [[H990]] the sin [[H2403]] of my soul? [[H5315]]

### 8
He hath shewed [[H5046]] thee, O man, [[H120]] what [[H4100]] good; [[H2896]] and what [[H4100]] doth the Lord [[H3068]] require [[H1875]] of [[H4480]] thee, but [[H3588]] to do [[H6213]] justly, [[H4941]] and to love [[H160]] mercy, [[H2617]] and to walk [[H1980]] humbly [[H6800]] with [[H5973]] thy God? [[H430]]

### 9
The Lord's [[H3068]] voice [[H6963]] crieth [[H7121]] unto the city, [[H5892]] and wisdom [[H8454]] shall see [[H7200]] thy name: [[H8034]] hear [[H8085]] ye the rod, [[H4294]] and who [[H4310]] hath appointed it. [[H3259]]

### 10
Are there [[H786]] yet [[H5750]] the treasures [[H214]] of wickedness [[H7562]] in the house [[H1004]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] and the scant [[H7332]] measure [[H374]] abominable? [[H2194]]

### 11
Shall I count pure [[H2135]] with the wicked [[H7562]] balances, [[H3976]] and with the bag [[H3599]] of deceitful [[H4820]] weights? [[H68]]

### 12
For [[H834]] the rich men [[H6223]] thereof are full [[H4390]] of violence, [[H2555]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof have spoken [[H1696]] lies, [[H8267]] and their tongue [[H3956]] deceitful [[H7423]] in their mouth. [[H6310]]

### 13
Therefore also [[H1571]] will I [[H589]] make sick [[H2470]] in smiting [[H5221]] thee, in making desolate [[H8074]] because of [[H5921]] thy sins. [[H2403]]

### 14
Thou [[H859]] shalt eat, [[H398]] but not [[H3808]] be satisfied; [[H7646]] and thy casting down [[H3445]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee; and thou shalt take hold, [[H5253]] but shalt not [[H3808]] deliver; [[H6403]] and which [[H834]] thou deliverest [[H6403]] will I give up [[H5414]] to the sword. [[H2719]]

### 15
Thou [[H859]] shalt sow, [[H2232]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] reap; [[H7114]] thou [[H859]] shalt tread [[H1869]] the olives, [[H2132]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] anoint [[H5480]] thee with oil; [[H8081]] and sweet wine, [[H8492]] but shalt not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] wine. [[H3196]]

### 16
For the statutes [[H2708]] of Omri [[H6018]] are kept, [[H8104]] and all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] and ye walk [[H1980]] in their counsels; [[H4156]] that [[H4616]] I should make [[H5414]] thee a desolation, [[H8047]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof an hissing: [[H8322]] therefore ye shall bear [[H5375]] the reproach [[H2781]] of my people.
