Now [[H6258]] gather thyself in troops, [[H1413]] O daughter [[H1323]] of troops: [[H1416]] he hath laid [[H7760]] siege [[H4692]] against [[H5921]] us: they shall smite [[H5221]] the judge [[H8199]] of Israel [[H3478]] with a rod [[H7626]] upon [[H5921]] the cheek. [[H3895]]

### 2
But thou, [[H859]] Bethlehem [[H1035]] Ephratah, [[H672]] thou be [[H1961]] little [[H6810]] among the thousands [[H505]] of Judah, [[H3063]] out of [[H4480]] thee shall he come forth [[H3318]] unto me to be [[H1961]] ruler [[H4910]] in Israel; [[H3478]] whose goings forth [[H4163]] from of old, [[H6924]] from everlasting. [[H3117]]

### 3
Therefore [[H3651]] will he give them up, [[H5414]] until [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] she which travaileth [[H3205]] hath brought forth: [[H3205]] then the remnant [[H3499]] of his brethren [[H251]] shall return [[H7725]] unto [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
And he shall stand [[H5975]] and feed [[H7462]] in the strength [[H5797]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] in the majesty [[H1347]] of the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his God; [[H430]] and they shall abide: [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] shall he be great [[H1431]] unto [[H5704]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 5
And this [[H2088]] shall be [[H1961]] the peace, [[H7965]] when [[H3588]] the Assyrian [[H804]] shall come [[H935]] into our land: [[H776]] and when [[H3588]] he shall tread [[H1869]] in our palaces, [[H759]] then shall we raise [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] him seven [[H7651]] shepherds, [[H7462]] and eight [[H8083]] principal [[H5257]] men. [[H120]]

### 6
And they shall waste [[H7489]] the land [[H776]] of Assyria [[H804]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and the land [[H776]] of Nimrod [[H5248]] in the entrances [[H6607]] thereof: thus shall he deliver [[H5337]] from the Assyrian, [[H804]] when [[H3588]] he cometh [[H935]] into our land, [[H776]] and when [[H3588]] he treadeth [[H1869]] within our borders. [[H1366]]

### 7
And the remnant [[H7611]] of Jacob [[H3290]] shall be [[H1961]] in the midst [[H7130]] of many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] as a dew [[H2919]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as the showers [[H7241]] upon [[H5921]] the grass, [[H6212]] that [[H834]] tarrieth [[H6960]] not [[H3808]] for man, [[H376]] nor [[H3808]] waiteth [[H3176]] for the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 8
And the remnant [[H7611]] of Jacob [[H3290]] shall be [[H1961]] among the Gentiles [[H1471]] in the midst [[H7130]] of many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] as a lion [[H738]] among the beasts [[H929]] of the forest, [[H3293]] as a young lion [[H3715]] among the flocks [[H5739]] of sheep: [[H6629]] who, [[H834]] if [[H518]] he go through, [[H5674]] both treadeth down, [[H7429]] and teareth in pieces, [[H2963]] and none [[H369]] can deliver. [[H5337]]

### 9
Thine hand [[H3027]] shall be lifted up [[H7311]] upon [[H5921]] thine adversaries, [[H6862]] and all [[H3605]] thine enemies [[H341]] shall be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 10
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will cut off [[H3772]] thy horses [[H5483]] out of the midst [[H7130]] of thee, and I will destroy [[H6]] thy chariots: [[H4818]]

### 11
And I will cut off [[H3772]] the cities [[H5892]] of thy land, [[H776]] and throw down [[H2040]] all [[H3605]] thy strong holds: [[H4013]]

### 12
And I will cut off [[H3772]] witchcrafts [[H3785]] out of thine hand; [[H3027]] and thou shalt have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] soothsayers: [[H6049]]

### 13
Thy graven images [[H6456]] also will I cut off, [[H3772]] and thy standing images [[H4676]] out of the midst [[H7130]] of thee; and thou shalt no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] worship [[H7812]] the work [[H4639]] of thine hands. [[H3027]]

### 14
And I will pluck up [[H5428]] thy groves [[H842]] out of the midst of thee: [[H7130]] so will I destroy [[H8045]] thy cities. [[H5892]]

### 15
And I will execute [[H6213]] vengeance [[H5359]] in anger [[H639]] and fury [[H2534]]  upon [[H853]] the heathen, [[H1471]] such as [[H834]] they have not [[H3808]] heard. [[H8085]]
