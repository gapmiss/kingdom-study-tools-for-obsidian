[[Jonah 4|←]] • [[Micah 2|→]]

### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Micah [[H4318]] the Morasthite [[H4183]] in the days [[H3117]] of Jotham, [[H3147]] Ahaz, [[H271]] Hezekiah, [[H3169]] kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which [[H834]] he saw [[H2372]] concerning [[H5921]] Samaria [[H8111]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 2
Hear, [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] ye people; [[H5971]] hearken, [[H7181]] O earth, [[H776]] and all that therein is: [[H4393]] and let the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] be [[H1961]] witness [[H5707]] against you, the Lord [[H136]] from his holy [[H6944]] temple. [[H1964]]

### 3
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] cometh forth [[H3318]] out of his place, [[H4725]] and will come down, [[H3381]] and tread [[H1869]] upon [[H5921]] the high places [[H1116]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 4
And the mountains [[H2022]] shall be molten [[H4549]] under [[H8478]] him, and the valleys [[H6010]] shall be cleft, [[H1234]] as wax [[H1749]] before [[H6440]] the fire, [[H784]] as the waters [[H4325]] poured down [[H5064]] a steep place. [[H4174]]

### 5
For the transgression [[H6588]] of Jacob [[H3290]] all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] and for the sins [[H2403]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] What [[H4310]] the transgression [[H6588]] of Jacob? [[H3290]] not [[H3808]] Samaria? [[H8111]] and what [[H4310]] the high places [[H1116]] of Judah? [[H3063]] not [[H3808]] Jerusalem? [[H3389]]

### 6
Therefore I will make [[H7760]] Samaria [[H8111]] as an heap [[H5856]] of the field, [[H7704]] as plantings [[H4302]] of a vineyard: [[H3754]] and I will pour down [[H5064]] the stones [[H68]] thereof into the valley, [[H1516]] and I will discover [[H1540]] the foundations [[H3247]] thereof. [[H3247]]

### 7
And all [[H3605]] the graven images [[H6456]] thereof shall be beaten to pieces, [[H3807]] and all [[H3605]] the hires [[H868]] thereof shall be burned [[H8313]] with the fire, [[H784]] and all [[H3605]] the idols [[H6091]] thereof will I lay [[H7760]] desolate: [[H8077]] for [[H3588]] she gathered [[H6908]] of the hire [[H868]] of an harlot, [[H2181]] and they shall return [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the hire [[H868]] of an harlot. [[H2181]]

### 8
Therefore [[H5921]] I will wail [[H5594]] and howl, [[H3213]] I will go [[H1980]] stripped [[H7758]] and naked: [[H6174]] I will make [[H6213]] a wailing [[H4553]] like the dragons, [[H8577]] and mourning [[H60]] as the owls. [[H1323]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] her wound [[H4347]] incurable; [[H605]] for [[H3588]] it is come [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] Judah; [[H3063]] he is come [[H5060]] unto [[H5704]] the gate [[H8179]] of my people, [[H5971]] to [[H5704]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
Declare [[H5046]] ye not [[H408]] at Gath, [[H1661]] weep ye [[H1058]] not [[H408]] at all: [[H1058]] in the house [[H1004]] of Aphrah [[H1036]] roll thyself [[H6428]] in the dust. [[H6083]]

### 11
Pass ye away, [[H5674]] thou inhabitant [[H3427]] of Saphir, [[H8208]] having thy shame [[H1322]] naked: [[H6181]] the inhabitant [[H3427]] of Zaanan [[H6630]] came [[H3318]] not [[H3808]] forth in the mourning [[H4553]] of Beth-ezel; [[H1009]] he shall receive [[H3947]] of [[H4480]] you his standing. [[H5979]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] the inhabitant [[H3427]] of Maroth [[H4796]] waited carefully [[H2470]] for good: [[H2896]] but [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto the gate [[H8179]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 13
O thou inhabitant [[H3427]] of Lachish, [[H3923]] bind [[H7573]] the chariot [[H4818]] to the swift beast: [[H7409]] she [[H1931]] the beginning [[H7225]] of the sin [[H2403]] to the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion: [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] the transgressions [[H6588]] of Israel [[H3478]] were found [[H4672]] in thee. [[H4672]]

### 14
Therefore [[H3651]] shalt thou give [[H5414]] presents [[H7964]] to [[H5921]] Moresheth-gath: [[H4182]] the houses [[H1004]] of Achzib [[H392]] a lie [[H391]] to the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
Yet [[H5750]] will I bring [[H935]] an heir [[H3423]] unto thee, O inhabitant [[H3427]] of Mareshah: [[H4762]] he shall come [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] Adullam [[H5725]] the glory [[H3519]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 16
Make thee bald, [[H7139]] and poll [[H1494]] thee for [[H5921]] thy delicate [[H8588]] children; [[H1121]] enlarge [[H7337]] thy baldness [[H7144]] as the eagle; [[H5404]] for [[H3588]] they are gone into captivity [[H1540]] from [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]
