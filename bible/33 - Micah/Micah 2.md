### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to them that devise [[H2803]] iniquity, [[H205]] and work [[H6466]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] their beds! [[H4904]] when the morning [[H1242]] is light, [[H216]] they practise [[H6213]] it, because [[H3588]] it is [[H3426]] in the power [[H410]] of their hand. [[H3027]]

### 2
And they covet [[H2530]] fields, [[H7704]] and take by violence; [[H1497]] and houses, [[H1004]] and take away: [[H5375]] so they oppress [[H6231]] a man [[H1397]] and his house, [[H1004]] even a man [[H376]] and his heritage. [[H5159]]

### 3
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] family [[H4940]] do I devise [[H2803]] an evil, [[H7451]] from [[H8033]] which [[H834]] ye shall not [[H3808]] remove [[H4185]] your necks; [[H6677]] neither [[H3808]] shall ye go [[H1980]] haughtily: [[H7317]] for [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 4
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall take up [[H5375]] a parable [[H4912]] against you, [[H5921]] and lament [[H5091]] with a doleful [[H5093]] lamentation, [[H5092]] say, [[H559]] We be utterly [[H7703]] spoiled: [[H7703]] he hath changed [[H4171]] the portion [[H2506]] of my people: [[H5971]] how [[H349]] hath he removed [[H4185]] from me! turning away [[H7728]] he hath divided [[H2505]] our fields. [[H7704]]

### 5
Therefore [[H3651]] thou shalt have [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] that shall cast [[H7993]] a cord [[H2256]] by lot [[H1486]] in the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
Prophesy [[H5197]] ye not, [[H408]] prophesy: [[H5197]] they shall not [[H3808]] prophesy [[H5197]] to them, [[H428]] they shall not [[H3808]] take [[H5253]] shame. [[H3639]]

### 7
O named [[H559]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] is the spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] straitened? [[H7114]] these [[H428]] his doings? [[H4611]] do not [[H3808]] my words [[H1697]] do good [[H3190]] to [[H5973]] him that walketh [[H1980]] uprightly? [[H3477]]

### 8
Even of late [[H865]] my people [[H5971]] is risen up [[H6965]] as an enemy: [[H341]] ye pull off [[H6584]] the robe [[H145]] with [[H4136]] the garment [[H8008]] from them that pass by [[H5674]] securely [[H983]] as men averse [[H7725]] from war. [[H4421]]

### 9
The women [[H802]] of my people [[H5971]] have ye cast out [[H1644]] from their pleasant [[H8588]] houses; [[H1004]] from [[H5921]] their children [[H5768]] have ye taken away [[H3947]] my glory [[H1926]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 10
Arise [[H6965]] ye, and depart; [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] not [[H3808]] rest: [[H4496]] because [[H5668]] it is polluted, [[H2930]] it shall destroy [[H2254]] even with a sore [[H4834]] destruction. [[H2256]]

### 11
If [[H3863]] a man [[H376]] walking [[H1980]] in the spirit [[H7307]] and falsehood [[H8267]] do lie, [[H3576]] I will prophesy [[H5197]] unto thee of wine [[H3196]] and of strong drink; [[H7941]] he shall even be [[H1961]] the prophet [[H5197]] of this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]

### 12
I will surely [[H622]] assemble, [[H622]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] all [[H3605]] of thee; I will surely [[H6908]] gather [[H6908]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel; [[H3478]] I will put [[H7760]] them together [[H3162]] as the sheep [[H6629]] of Bozrah, [[H1223]] as the flock [[H5739]] in the midst [[H8432]] of their fold: [[H1699]] they shall make great noise [[H1949]] by reason of men. [[H120]]

### 13
The breaker [[H6555]] is come up [[H5927]] before [[H6440]] them: they have broken up, [[H6555]] and have passed through [[H5674]] the gate, [[H8179]] and are gone out [[H3318]] by it: and their king [[H4428]] shall pass [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] them, and the Lord [[H3068]] on the head [[H7218]] of them.
