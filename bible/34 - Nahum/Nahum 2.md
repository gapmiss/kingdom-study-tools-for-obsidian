He that dasheth in pieces [[H6327]] is come up [[H5927]] before [[H5921]] thy face: [[H6440]] keep [[H5341]] the munition, [[H4694]] watch [[H6822]] the way, [[H1870]] make loins [[H4975]] strong, [[H2388]] fortify [[H553]] power [[H3581]] mightily. [[H3966]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath turned away [[H7725]] the excellency [[H1347]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] as the excellency [[H1347]] of Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] the emptiers [[H1238]] have emptied out, [[H1238]] them and marred [[H7843]] their vine branches. [[H2156]]

### 3
The shield [[H4043]] of his mighty men [[H1368]] is made red, [[H119]] the valiant [[H2428]] men [[H376]] in scarlet: [[H8529]] the chariots [[H7393]] with flaming [[H784]] torches [[H6393]] in the day [[H3117]] of his preparation, [[H3559]] and the fir trees [[H1265]] shall be terribly shaken. [[H7477]]

### 4
The chariots [[H7393]] shall rage [[H1984]] in the streets, [[H2351]] they shall justle one against another [[H8264]] in the broad ways: [[H7339]] they shall seem [[H4758]] like torches, [[H3940]] they shall run [[H7323]] like the lightnings. [[H1300]]

### 5
He shall recount [[H2142]] his worthies: [[H117]] they shall stumble [[H3782]] in their walk; [[H1979]] they shall make haste [[H4116]] to the wall [[H2346]] thereof, and the defence [[H5526]] shall be prepared. [[H3559]]

### 6
The gates [[H8179]] of the rivers [[H5104]] shall be opened, [[H6605]] and the palace [[H1964]] shall be dissolved. [[H4127]]

### 7
And Huzzab [[H5324]] shall be led away captive, [[H1540]] she shall be brought up, [[H5927]] and her maids [[H519]] shall lead [[H5090]] as with the voice [[H6963]] of doves, [[H3123]] tabering [[H8608]] upon [[H5921]] their breasts. [[H3824]]

### 8
But Nineveh [[H5210]] of old [[H3117]] like a pool [[H1295]] of water: [[H4325]] yet they [[H1992]] shall flee away. [[H5127]] Stand, [[H5975]] stand, [[H5975]] but none [[H369]] shall look back. [[H6437]]

### 9
Take ye the spoil [[H962]] of silver, [[H3701]] take the spoil [[H962]] of gold: [[H2091]] for none [[H369]] end [[H7097]] of the store [[H8498]] glory [[H3519]] out of all [[H3605]] the pleasant [[H2532]] furniture. [[H3627]]

### 10
She is empty, [[H950]] and void, [[H4003]] and waste: [[H1110]] and the heart [[H3820]] melteth, [[H4549]] and the knees [[H1290]] smite together, [[H6375]] and much pain [[H2479]] in all [[H3605]] loins, [[H4975]] and the faces [[H6440]] of them all [[H3605]] gather [[H6908]] blackness. [[H6289]]

### 11
Where [[H346]] the dwelling [[H4583]] of the lions, [[H738]] and the feedingplace [[H4829]] of the young lions, [[H3715]] where [[H834]] the lion, [[H738]] the old lion, [[H3833]] walked, [[H1980]] the lion's [[H738]] whelp, [[H1482]] and none [[H369]] made afraid? [[H2729]]

### 12
The lion [[H738]] did tear in pieces [[H2963]] enough [[H1767]] for his whelps, [[H1484]] and strangled [[H2614]] for his lionesses, [[H3833]] and filled [[H4390]] his holes [[H2356]] with prey, [[H2964]] and his dens [[H4585]] with ravin. [[H2966]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and I will burn [[H1197]] her chariots [[H7393]] in the smoke, [[H6227]] and the sword [[H2719]] shall devour [[H398]] thy young lions: [[H3715]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] thy prey [[H2964]] from the earth, [[H776]] and the voice [[H6963]] of thy messengers [[H4397]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be heard.
