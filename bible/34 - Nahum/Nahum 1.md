# Nahum 1

[[Micah 7|←]] • [[Nahum 2|→]]

---

### 1
The burden [[H4853]] of Nineveh. [[H5210]] The book [[H5612]] of the vision [[H2377]] of Nahum [[H5151]] the Elkoshite. [[H512]]

### 2
God [[H410]] jealous, [[H7072]] and the Lord [[H3068]] revengeth; [[H5358]] the Lord [[H3068]] revengeth, [[H5358]] and furious; [[H1167]] the Lord [[H3068]] will take vengeance [[H5358]] on his adversaries, [[H6862]] and he [[H1931]] reserveth [[H5201]] for his enemies. [[H341]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] and great [[H1419]] in power, [[H3581]] and not [[H3808]] at all [[H5352]] will acquit [[H5352]] the Lord [[H3068]] his way [[H1870]] in the whirlwind [[H5492]] and in the storm, [[H8183]] and the clouds [[H6051]] the dust [[H80]] of his feet. [[H7272]]

### 4
He rebuketh [[H1605]] the sea, [[H3220]] and maketh it dry, [[H2717]] and drieth up [[H3001]] all [[H3605]] the rivers: [[H5104]] Bashan [[H1316]] languisheth, [[H535]] and Carmel, [[H3760]] and the flower [[H6525]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] languisheth. [[H535]]

### 5
The mountains [[H2022]] quake [[H7493]] at [[H4480]] him, and the hills [[H1389]] melt, [[H4127]] and the earth [[H776]] is burned [[H5375]] at his presence, [[H6440]] yea, the world, [[H8398]] and all [[H3605]] that dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 6
Who [[H4310]] can stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] his indignation? [[H2195]] and who [[H4310]] can abide [[H6965]] in the fierceness [[H2740]] of his anger? [[H639]] his fury [[H2534]] is poured out [[H5413]] like fire, [[H784]] and the rocks [[H6697]] are thrown down [[H5422]] by [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] good, [[H2896]] a strong hold [[H4581]] in the day [[H3117]] of trouble; [[H6869]] and he knoweth [[H3045]] them that trust [[H2620]] in him. [[H2620]]

### 8
But with an overrunning [[H5674]] flood [[H7858]] he will make [[H6213]] an utter end [[H3617]] of the place [[H4725]] thereof, and darkness [[H2822]] shall pursue [[H7291]] his enemies. [[H341]]

### 9
What [[H4100]] do ye imagine [[H2803]] against [[H413]] the Lord? [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] will make [[H6213]] an utter end: [[H3617]] affliction [[H6869]] shall not [[H3808]] rise up [[H6965]] the second time. [[H6471]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] while [[H5704]] folden together [[H5440]] thorns, [[H5518]] and while they are drunken [[H5433]] drunkards, [[H5435]] they shall be devoured [[H398]] as stubble [[H7179]] fully [[H4390]] dry. [[H3002]]

### 11
There is come out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] thee, that imagineth [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] a wicked [[H1100]] counseller. [[H3289]]

### 12
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Though [[H518]] quiet, [[H8003]] and likewise [[H3651]] many, [[H7227]] yet thus [[H3651]] shall they be cut down, [[H1494]] when he shall pass through. [[H5674]] Though I have afflicted [[H6031]] thee, I will afflict [[H6031]] thee no [[H3808]] more. [[H3808]]

### 13
For now [[H6258]] will I break [[H7665]] his yoke [[H4132]] from off [[H5921]] thee, and will burst sunder. [[H5423]] thy bonds [[H4147]] in [[H4147]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] hath given a commandment [[H6680]] concerning [[H5921]] thee, no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] of thy name [[H8034]] be sown: [[H2232]] out of the house [[H1004]] of thy gods [[H430]] will I cut off [[H3772]] the graven image [[H6459]] and the molten image: [[H4541]] I will make [[H7760]] thy grave; [[H6913]] for [[H3588]] thou art vile. [[H7043]]

### 15
Behold [[H2009]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] the feet [[H7272]] of him that bringeth good tidings, [[H1319]] that publisheth [[H8085]] peace! [[H7965]] O Judah, [[H3063]] keep [[H2287]] thy solemn feasts, [[H2282]] perform [[H7999]] thy vows: [[H5088]] for [[H3588]] the wicked [[H1100]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] pass through [[H5674]] thee; he is utterly [[H3605]] cut off.
