### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to the bloody [[H1818]] city! [[H5892]] it all [[H3605]] full [[H4392]] of lies [[H3585]] robbery; [[H6563]] the prey [[H2964]] departeth [[H4185]] not; [[H3808]]

### 2
The noise [[H6963]] of a whip, [[H7752]] and the noise [[H6963]] of the rattling [[H7494]] of the wheels, [[H212]] and of the pransing [[H1725]] horses, [[H5483]] and of the jumping [[H7540]] chariots. [[H4818]]

### 3
The horseman [[H6571]] lifteth up [[H5927]] both the bright [[H3851]] sword [[H2719]] and the glittering [[H1300]] spear: [[H2595]] and a multitude [[H7230]] of slain, [[H2491]] and a great number [[H3514]] of carcases; [[H6297]] and none [[H369]] end [[H7097]] of corpses; [[H1472]] they stumble [[H3782]] upon their corpses: [[H1472]]

### 4
Because of the multitude [[H7230]] of the whoredoms [[H2183]] of the wellfavoured [[H2896]] harlot, [[H2181]] the mistress [[H1172]] of witchcrafts, [[H3785]] that selleth [[H4376]] nations [[H1471]] through her whoredoms, [[H2183]] and families [[H4940]] through her witchcrafts. [[H3785]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] and I will discover [[H1540]] thy skirts [[H7757]] upon [[H5921]] thy face, [[H6440]] and I will shew [[H7200]] the nations [[H1471]] thy nakedness, [[H4626]] and the kingdoms [[H4467]] thy shame. [[H7036]]

### 6
And I will cast [[H7993]] abominable filth [[H8251]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and make thee vile, [[H5034]] and will set [[H7760]] thee as a gazingstock. [[H7210]]

### 7
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] they that look upon [[H7200]] thee shall flee [[H5074]] from [[H4480]] thee, and say, [[H559]] Nineveh [[H5210]] is laid waste: [[H7703]] who [[H4310]] will bemoan [[H5110]] her? whence [[H370]] shall I seek [[H1245]] comforters [[H5162]] for thee? [[H5162]]

### 8
Art thou better [[H3190]] than populous [[H527]] No, [[H4996]] that was situate [[H3427]] among the rivers, [[H2975]] the waters [[H4325]] round about [[H5439]] it, whose [[H834]] rampart [[H2426]] the sea, [[H3220]] her wall [[H2346]] from the sea? [[H3220]]

### 9
Ethiopia [[H3568]] and Egypt [[H4714]] her strength, [[H6109]] and infinite; [[H369]] Put [[H6316]] and Lubim [[H3864]] were [[H1961]] thy helpers. [[H5833]]

### 10
Yet [[H1571]] she [[H1931]] carried away, [[H1473]] she went [[H1980]] into captivity: [[H7628]] her young children [[H5768]] also [[H1571]] were dashed in pieces [[H7376]] at the top [[H7218]] of all [[H3605]] the streets: [[H2351]] and they cast [[H3032]] lots [[H1486]] for [[H5921]] her honourable men, [[H3513]] and all [[H3605]] her great men [[H1419]] were bound [[H7576]] in chains. [[H2131]]

### 11
Thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] shalt be drunken: [[H7937]] thou shalt be [[H1961]] hid, [[H5956]] thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] shalt seek [[H1245]] strength [[H4581]] because of the enemy. [[H341]]

### 12
All [[H3605]] thy strong holds [[H4013]] fig trees [[H8384]] with [[H5973]] the firstripe figs: [[H1061]] if [[H518]] they be shaken, [[H5128]] they shall even fall [[H5307]] into [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the eater. [[H398]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] thy people [[H5971]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee women: [[H802]] the gates [[H8179]] of thy land [[H776]] shall be set wide [[H6605]] open [[H6605]] unto thine enemies: [[H341]] the fire [[H784]] shall devour [[H398]] thy bars. [[H1280]]

### 14
Draw [[H7579]] thee waters [[H4325]] for the siege, [[H4692]] fortify [[H2388]] thy strong holds: [[H4013]] go [[H935]] into clay, [[H2916]] and tread [[H7429]] the morter, [[H2563]] make strong [[H2388]] the brickkiln. [[H4404]]

### 15
There [[H8033]] shall the fire [[H784]] devour [[H398]] thee; the sword [[H2719]] shall cut thee off, [[H3772]] it shall eat thee up [[H398]] like the cankerworm: [[H3218]] make thyself many [[H3513]] as the cankerworm, [[H3218]] make thyself many [[H3513]] as the locusts. [[H697]]

### 16
Thou hast multiplied [[H7235]] thy merchants [[H7402]] above the stars [[H3556]] of heaven: [[H8064]] the cankerworm [[H3218]] spoileth, [[H6584]] and flieth away. [[H5774]]

### 17
Thy crowned [[H4502]] as the locusts, [[H697]] and thy captains [[H2951]] as the great grasshoppers, [[H1462]] which camp [[H2583]] in the hedges [[H1448]] in the cold [[H7135]] day, [[H3117]] when the sun [[H8121]] ariseth [[H2224]] they flee away, [[H5074]] and their place [[H4725]] is not known [[H3045]] where [[H335]] they [[H335]]

### 18
Thy shepherds [[H7462]] slumber, [[H5123]] O king [[H4428]] of Assyria: [[H804]] thy nobles [[H117]] shall dwell [[H7931]] thy people [[H5971]] is scattered [[H6335]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and no man [[H369]] gathereth [[H6908]]
