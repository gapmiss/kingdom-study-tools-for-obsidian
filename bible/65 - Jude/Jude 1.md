[[3 John 1|←]] • [[Revelation 1|→]]

### 1
Jude, [[G2455]] the servant [[G1401]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] brother [[G80]] of James, [[G2385]] to them that are sanctified [[G37]] by [[G1722]] God [[G2316]] the Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] preserved [[G5083]] in Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] called: [[G2822]]

### 2
Mercy [[G1656]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] peace, [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] love, [[G26]] be multiplied. [[G4129]]

### 3
Beloved, [[G27]] when I gave [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] diligence [[G4710]] to write [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] common [[G2839]] salvation, [[G4991]] it was for me [[G2192]] needful [[G318]] to write [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] and exhort [[G3870]] that ye should earnestly contend [[G1864]] for [[G4102]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] once [[G530]] which was [[G3860]] delivered [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G40]] saints. [[G40]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] there are in unawares, [[G3921]] certain [[G5100]] men [[G444]] crept [[G3921]] who [[G3588]] before of old [[G3819]] were [[G4270]] ordained [[G4270]] to [[G1519]] this [[G5124]] condemnation, [[G2917]] ungodly men, [[G765]] turning [[G3346]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2257]] our [[G2257]] God [[G2316]] into [[G1519]] lasciviousness, [[G766]] and [[G2532]] denying [[G720]] the [[G3588]] only [[G3441]] Lord [[G1203]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 5
I will [[G1014]] therefore [[G1161]] put in remembrance, [[G5279]] you [[G5209]] though [[G1492]] ye [[G5209]] once [[G530]] knew [[G1492]] this, [[G5124]] how that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] having saved [[G4982]] the people [[G2992]] out of [[G1537]] the land [[G1093]] of Egypt, [[G125]] afterward [[G1208]] destroyed [[G622]] them that believed [[G4100]] not. [[G3361]]

### 6
And [[G5037]] the angels [[G32]] which kept [[G5083]] not [[G3361]] their [[G1438]] first estate, [[G746]] but [[G235]] left [[G620]] their own [[G2398]] habitation, [[G3613]] he hath reserved [[G5083]] in [[G1199]] everlasting [[G126]] chains [[G1199]] under [[G5259]] darkness [[G2217]] unto [[G1519]] the judgment [[G2920]] great [[G3173]] of the [[G2250]] day. [[G2250]]

### 7
Even as [[G5613]] Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] Gomorrha, [[G1116]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cities [[G4172]] about [[G4012]] them [[G846]] in [[G5158]] like [[G3664]] manner, [[G5158]] giving themselves over to fornication, [[G1608]] and [[G2532]] going [[G565]] after [[G3694]] strange [[G2087]] flesh, [[G4561]] are set forth [[G4295]] for an example, [[G1164]] suffering [[G5254]] the vengeance [[G1349]] of [[G4442]] eternal [[G166]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 8
Likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] dreamers [[G1797]] defile [[G3392]] the flesh, [[G4561]] despise [[G114]] dominion, [[G2963]] and [[G1161]] of [[G1391]] speak evil [[G987]] dignities. [[G1391]]

### 9
Yet [[G1161]] Michael [[G3413]] the [[G3588]] archangel, [[G743]] when [[G3753]] contending [[G1252]] the [[G3588]] with [[G1228]] devil [[G1228]] he disputed [[G1256]] about [[G4012]] the of [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] Moses, [[G3475]] durst [[G5111]] not [[G3756]] bring against him [[G2018]] a [[G2920]] railing [[G988]] accusation, [[G2920]] but [[G235]] said, [[G2036]] The Lord [[G2962]] rebuke [[G2008]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] these [[G3778]] of those things [[G3745]] speak evil [[G987]] which [[G3745]] they know [[G1492]] not: [[G3756]] but [[G1161]] what [[G3745]] they know [[G1987]] naturally, [[G5447]] as [[G5613]] brute [[G249]] beasts, [[G2226]] in [[G1722]] those things [[G5125]] they corrupt themselves. [[G5351]]

### 11
Woe [[G3759]] unto them! [[G846]] for [[G3754]] they have gone [[G4198]] in the [[G3588]] way of [[G3598]] Cain, [[G2535]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3588]] ran greedily [[G1632]] the [[G3588]] error of [[G4106]] Balaam [[G903]] for reward, [[G3408]] and [[G2532]] perished [[G622]] in the [[G3588]] gainsaying of [[G485]] Core. [[G2879]]

### 12
These [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] spots [[G4694]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] feasts of charity, [[G26]] when they feast with you, [[G4910]] feeding [[G4165]] themselves [[G1438]] without fear: [[G870]] clouds [[G3507]] without water, [[G504]] carried about [[G4064]] of [[G5259]] winds; [[G417]] trees [[G1186]] whose fruit withereth, [[G5352]] without fruit, [[G175]] twice [[G1364]] dead, [[G599]] plucked up by the roots; [[G1610]]

### 13
Raging [[G66]] waves [[G2949]] of the sea, [[G2281]] foaming out [[G1890]] their [[G3588]] own [[G1438]] shame; [[G152]] wandering [[G4107]] stars, [[G792]] to whom [[G3739]] is reserved [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] blackness [[G2217]] of [[G4655]] darkness [[G4655]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] Enoch [[G1802]] also, [[G2532]] the seventh [[G1442]] from [[G575]] Adam, [[G76]] prophesied [[G4395]] of these, [[G5125]] saying, [[G3004]] Behold, [[G2400]] the Lord [[G2962]] cometh [[G2064]] with [[G1722]] ten thousands [[G3461]] of [[G40]] his [[G846]] saints, [[G40]]

### 15
To execute [[G4160]] judgment [[G2920]] upon [[G2596]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] to convince [[G1827]] all [[G3956]] that are ungodly [[G765]] among them [[G846]] of [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] their [[G846]] ungodly [[G763]] deeds [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] they have ungodly committed, [[G764]] and [[G2532]] of [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] their hard [[G4642]] which [[G3739]] ungodly [[G765]] sinners [[G268]] have spoken [[G2980]] against [[G2596]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
These [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] murmurers, [[G1113]] complainers, [[G3202]] walking [[G4198]] after [[G2596]] their own [[G846]] lusts; [[G1939]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] speaketh [[G2980]] great swelling [[G5246]] having in [[G2296]] men's persons [[G4383]] admiration [[G2296]] because of [[G5484]] advantage. [[G5622]]

### 17
But, [[G1161]] beloved, [[G27]] remember [[G3415]] ye [[G5210]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] were spoken [[G4280]] which [[G3588]] before [[G4280]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 18
How that [[G3754]] they told [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] there should be [[G2071]] mockers [[G1703]] in [[G1722]] last [[G2078]] the [[G5550]] time, [[G5550]] who should walk [[G4198]] after [[G2596]] their own [[G1438]] ungodly [[G763]] lusts. [[G1939]]

### 19
These [[G3778]] be [[G1526]] they who [[G3588]] separate [[G592]] themselves, [[G592]] sensual, [[G5591]] having [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] the Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] ye, [[G5210]] beloved, [[G27]] building up [[G2026]] yourselves [[G1438]] your [[G5216]] on [[G4102]] most holy [[G40]] faith, [[G4102]] praying [[G4336]] in [[G1722]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]]

### 21
Keep [[G5083]] yourselves [[G1438]] in [[G1722]] the love [[G26]] of God, [[G2316]] looking for [[G4327]] the [[G3588]] mercy [[G1656]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] unto [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] of some [[G3739]] have compassion, [[G1653]] making a difference: [[G1252]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] others [[G3739]] save [[G4982]] with [[G1722]] fear, [[G5401]] pulling [[G726]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fire; [[G4442]] hating [[G3404]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] garment [[G5509]] spotted [[G4695]] by [[G575]] the [[G3588]] flesh. [[G4561]]

### 24
Now [[G1161]] unto him that is able [[G1410]] to keep [[G5442]] you [[G5209]] from falling, [[G679]] and [[G2532]] to present [[G2476]] faultless [[G299]] before the presence [[G2714]] of [[G1391]] his [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] with [[G1722]] exceeding joy, [[G20]]

### 25
only [[G3441]] To the [[G2316]] wise [[G4680]] God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Saviour, [[G4990]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] majesty, [[G3172]] dominion [[G2904]] and [[G2532]] power, [[G1849]] both [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] and [[G2532]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
