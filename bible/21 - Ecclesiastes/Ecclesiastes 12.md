[[Ecclesiastes 11|←]] • [[Song of Solomon 1|→]]

---

### 1
Remember [[H2142]]  now [[H853]] thy Creator [[H1254]] in the days [[H3117]] of thy youth, [[H979]] while [[H5704]] the evil [[H7451]] days [[H3117]] come [[H935]] not, [[H3808]] nor the years [[H8141]] draw nigh, [[H5060]] when [[H834]] thou shalt say, [[H559]] I have no [[H369]] pleasure [[H2656]] in them; [[H2656]]

### 2
While [[H5704]] the sun, [[H8121]] or the light, [[H216]] or the moon, [[H3394]] or the stars, [[H3556]] be not [[H3808]] darkened, [[H2821]] nor the clouds [[H5645]] return [[H7725]] after [[H310]] the rain: [[H1653]]

### 3
In the day [[H3117]] when the keepers [[H8104]] of the house [[H1004]] shall tremble, [[H2111]] and the strong [[H2428]] men [[H376]] shall bow themselves, [[H5791]] and the grinders [[H2912]] cease [[H988]] because [[H3588]] they are few, [[H4591]] and those that look out [[H7200]] of the windows [[H699]] be darkened, [[H2821]]

### 4
And the doors [[H1817]] shall be shut [[H5462]] in the streets, [[H7784]] when the sound [[H6963]] of the grinding [[H2913]] is low, [[H8217]] and he shall rise up [[H6965]] at the voice [[H6963]] of the bird, [[H6833]] and all [[H3605]] the daughters [[H1323]] of musick [[H7892]] shall be brought low; [[H7817]]

### 5
Also [[H1571]] they shall be afraid [[H3372]] of high, [[H1364]] and fears [[H2849]] in the way, [[H1870]] and the almond tree [[H8247]] shall flourish, [[H5006]] and the grasshopper [[H2284]] shall be a burden, [[H5445]] and desire [[H35]] shall fail: [[H6565]] because [[H3588]] man [[H120]] goeth [[H1980]] to [[H413]] his long [[H5769]] home, [[H1004]] and the mourners [[H5594]] go about [[H5437]] the streets: [[H7784]]

### 6
Or [[H5704]] ever [[H3808]] the silver [[H3701]] cord [[H2256]] be loosed, [[H7368]] or the golden [[H2091]] bowl [[H1543]] be broken, [[H7533]] or the pitcher [[H3537]] be broken [[H7665]] at [[H5921]] the fountain, [[H4002]] or the wheel [[H1534]] broken [[H7533]] at [[H413]] the cistern. [[H953]]

### 7
Then shall the dust [[H6083]] return [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] as it was: [[H1961]] and the spirit [[H7307]] shall return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] God [[H430]] who [[H834]] gave [[H5414]] it. [[H5414]]

### 8
Vanity [[H1892]] of vanities, [[H1892]] saith [[H559]] the preacher; [[H6953]] all [[H3605]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 9
And moreover, [[H3148]] because the preacher [[H6953]] was [[H1961]] wise, [[H2450]] he still [[H5750]] taught [[H3925]] the people [[H5971]] knowledge; [[H1847]] yea, he gave good heed, [[H238]] and sought out, [[H2713]] set in order [[H8626]] many [[H7235]] proverbs. [[H4912]]

### 10
The preacher [[H6953]] sought [[H1245]] to find out [[H4672]] acceptable [[H2656]] words: [[H1697]] and written [[H3789]] upright, [[H3476]] words [[H1697]] of truth. [[H571]]

### 11
The words [[H1697]] of the wise [[H2450]] as goads, [[H1861]] and as nails [[H4930]] fastened [[H5193]] the masters [[H1167]] of assemblies, [[H627]] are given [[H5414]] from one [[H259]] shepherd. [[H7462]]

### 12
And further, [[H3148]] by these, [[H1992]] my son, [[H1121]] be admonished: [[H2094]] of making [[H6213]] many [[H7235]] books [[H5612]] no [[H369]] end; [[H7093]] and much [[H7235]] study [[H3854]] a weariness [[H3024]] of the flesh. [[H1320]]

### 13
Let us hear [[H8085]] the conclusion [[H5490]] of the whole [[H3605]] matter: [[H1697]] Fear [[H3372]] God, [[H430]] and keep [[H8104]] his commandments: [[H4687]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] the whole [[H3605]] of man. [[H120]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] shall bring [[H935]] every [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] into judgment, [[H4941]] with [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] secret thing, [[H5956]] whether [[H518]] good, [[H2896]] or whether [[H518]] evil. [[H7451]]
