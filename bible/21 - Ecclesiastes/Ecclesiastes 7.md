# Ecclesiastes 7

[[Ecclesiastes 6|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 8|→]]

---

### 1
A good name [[H8034]] better [[H2896]] than precious [[H2896]] ointment; [[H8081]] and the day [[H3117]] of death [[H4194]] than the day [[H3117]] of one's birth. [[H3205]]

### 2
better [[H2896]] to go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of mourning, [[H60]] than to go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of feasting: [[H4960]] for [[H834]] that [[H1931]] the end [[H5490]] of all [[H3605]] men; [[H120]] and the living [[H2416]] will lay [[H5414]] to [[H413]] his heart. [[H3820]]

### 3
Sorrow [[H3708]] better [[H2896]] than laughter: [[H7814]] for [[H3588]] by the sadness [[H7455]] of the countenance [[H6440]] the heart [[H3820]] is made better. [[H3190]]

### 4
The heart [[H3820]] of the wise [[H2450]] in the house [[H1004]] of mourning; [[H60]] but the heart [[H3820]] of fools [[H3684]] in the house [[H1004]] of mirth. [[H8057]]

### 5
better [[H2896]] to hear [[H8085]] the rebuke [[H1606]] of the wise, [[H2450]] than for a man [[H376]] to hear [[H8085]] the song [[H7892]] of fools. [[H3684]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] as the crackling [[H6963]] of thorns [[H5518]] under [[H8478]] a pot, [[H5518]] so [[H3651]] the laughter [[H7814]] of the fool: [[H3684]] this [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 7
Surely [[H3588]] oppression [[H6233]] maketh a wise man [[H2450]] mad; [[H1984]] and a gift [[H4979]] destroyeth [[H6]] the heart. [[H3820]]

### 8
Better [[H2896]] the end [[H319]] of a thing [[H1697]] than the beginning [[H7225]] thereof: the patient [[H750]] in spirit [[H7307]] better [[H2896]] than the proud [[H1362]] in spirit. [[H7307]]

### 9
Be not [[H408]] hasty [[H926]] in thy spirit [[H7307]] to be angry: [[H3707]] for [[H3588]] anger [[H3708]] resteth [[H5117]] in the bosom [[H2436]] of fools. [[H3684]]

### 10
Say [[H559]] not [[H408]] thou, What [[H4100]] is [[H1961]] that the former [[H7223]] days [[H3117]] were [[H1961]] better [[H2896]] than these? [[H428]] for [[H3588]] thou dost not [[H3808]] inquire [[H7592]] wisely [[H2451]] concerning [[H5921]] this. [[H5921]]

### 11
Wisdom [[H2451]] good [[H2896]] with [[H5973]] an inheritance: [[H5159]] and profit [[H3148]] to them that see [[H7200]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] wisdom [[H2451]] a defence, [[H6738]] money [[H3701]] a defence: [[H6738]] but the excellency [[H3504]] of knowledge [[H1847]] wisdom [[H2451]] giveth life [[H2421]] to them that have [[H1167]] it. [[H1167]]

### 13
Consider [[H7200]] the work [[H4639]] of God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] can [[H3201]] make straight, [[H8626]] which [[H834]] he hath made crooked? [[H5791]]

### 14
In the day [[H3117]] of prosperity [[H2896]] be [[H1961]] joyful, [[H2896]] but in the day [[H3117]] of adversity [[H7451]] consider: [[H7200]] God [[H430]] also [[H1571]] hath set [[H6213]] the one [[H2088]] over against [[H5980]] the other, [[H2088]] to [[H5921]] the end [[H1700]] that man [[H120]] should find [[H4672]] nothing [[H3972]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 15
All [[H3605]] have I seen [[H7200]] in the days [[H3117]] of my vanity: [[H1892]] there is [[H3426]] a just [[H6662]] that perisheth [[H6]] in his righteousness, [[H6664]] and there is [[H3426]] a wicked [[H7563]] that prolongeth [[H748]] in his wickedness. [[H7451]]

### 16
Be [[H1961]] not [[H408]] righteous [[H6662]] over much; [[H7235]] neither [[H408]] make thyself over [[H3148]] wise: [[H2449]] why [[H4100]] shouldest thou destroy [[H8074]] thyself? [[H8074]]

### 17
Be not [[H408]] over much [[H7235]] wicked, [[H7561]] neither [[H408]] be [[H1961]] thou foolish: [[H5530]] why [[H4100]] shouldest thou die [[H4191]] before [[H3808]] thy time? [[H6256]]

### 18
good [[H2896]] that [[H834]] thou shouldest take hold [[H270]] of this; [[H2088]] yea, also [[H1571]] from this [[H2088]] withdraw [[H3240]] not [[H408]] thine hand: [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] he that feareth [[H3373]] God [[H430]] shall come forth [[H3318]] of them all. [[H3605]]

### 19
Wisdom [[H2451]] strengtheneth [[H5810]] the wise [[H2450]] more than ten [[H6235]] mighty [[H7989]] which [[H834]] are [[H1961]] in the city. [[H5892]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] not [[H369]] a just [[H6662]] man [[H120]] upon earth, [[H776]] that [[H834]] doeth [[H6213]] good, [[H2896]] and sinneth [[H2398]] not. [[H2398]]

### 21
Also [[H1571]] take [[H5414]] no [[H408]] heed [[H3820]] unto all [[H3605]] words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] are spoken; [[H1696]] lest [[H834]] thou hear [[H8085]] thy servant [[H5650]] curse [[H7043]] thee: [[H7043]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] oftentimes [[H6471]] also [[H1571]] thine own heart [[H3820]] knoweth [[H3045]] that [[H834]] thou thyself [[H859]] likewise [[H1571]] hast cursed [[H7043]] others. [[H312]]

### 23
All [[H3605]] this [[H2090]] have I proved [[H5254]] by wisdom: [[H2451]] I said, [[H559]] I will be wise; [[H2449]] but it [[H1931]] far [[H7350]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 24
That which is [[H4100]] far off, [[H7350]] and exceeding deep, [[H6013]] who [[H4310]] can find it out? [[H4672]]

### 25
I [[H589]] applied [[H5437]] mine heart [[H3820]] to know, [[H3045]] and to search, [[H8446]] and to seek out [[H1245]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and the reason [[H2808]] and to know [[H3045]] the wickedness [[H7562]] of folly, [[H3689]] even of foolishness [[H5531]] madness: [[H1947]]

### 26
And I [[H589]] find [[H4672]] more bitter [[H4751]] than death [[H4194]] the woman, [[H802]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3820]] snares [[H4685]] and nets, [[H2764]] her hands [[H3027]] bands: [[H612]] whoso pleaseth [[H2896]] God [[H430]] shall escape [[H4422]] from [[H4480]] her; but the sinner [[H2398]] shall be taken [[H3920]] by her. [[H3920]]

### 27
Behold, [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] have I found, [[H4672]] saith [[H559]] the preacher, [[H6953]] one [[H259]] by one, [[H259]] to find out [[H4672]] the account: [[H2808]]

### 28
Which [[H834]] yet [[H5750]] my soul [[H5315]] seeketh, [[H1245]] but I find [[H4672]] not: [[H3808]] one [[H259]] man [[H120]] among a thousand [[H505]] have I found; [[H4672]] but a woman [[H802]] among all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] have I not [[H3808]] found. [[H4672]]

### 29
Lo, [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] only [[H905]] have I found, [[H4672]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] hath made [[H6213]] man [[H120]] upright; [[H3477]] but they [[H1992]] have sought out [[H1245]] many [[H7227]] inventions. [[H2810]]
