[[Ecclesiastes 4|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 6|→]]

---

### 1
Keep [[H8104]] thy foot [[H7272]] when [[H834]] thou goest [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and be more ready [[H7138]] to hear, [[H8085]] than to give [[H5414]] the sacrifice [[H2077]] of fools: [[H3684]] for they consider [[H3045]] not [[H369]] that [[H3588]] they do [[H6213]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 2
Be not [[H408]] rash [[H926]] with [[H5921]] thy mouth, [[H6310]] and let not [[H408]] thine heart [[H3820]] be hasty [[H4116]] to utter [[H3318]] thing [[H1697]] before [[H6440]] God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] in heaven, [[H8064]] and thou [[H859]] upon [[H5921]] earth: [[H776]] therefore [[H5921]] let thy words [[H1697]] be [[H1961]] few. [[H4592]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] a dream [[H2472]] cometh [[H935]] through the multitude [[H7230]] of business; [[H6045]] and a fool's [[H3684]] voice [[H6963]] by multitude [[H7230]] of words. [[H1697]]

### 4
When [[H834]] thou vowest [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] unto God, [[H430]] defer [[H309]] not [[H408]] to pay [[H7999]] it; for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] pleasure [[H2656]] in fools: [[H3684]] pay [[H7999]] that which [[H834]] thou hast vowed. [[H5087]]

### 5
Better [[H2896]] that [[H834]] thou shouldest not [[H3808]] vow, [[H5087]] than that thou shouldest vow [[H5087]] and not [[H3808]] pay. [[H7999]]

### 6
Suffer [[H5414]] not [[H408]] thy mouth [[H6310]]  to cause [[H853]] thy flesh [[H1320]] to sin; [[H2398]] neither [[H408]] say [[H559]] thou before [[H6440]] the angel, [[H4397]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] an error: [[H7684]] wherefore [[H4100]] should God [[H430]] be angry [[H7107]] at [[H5921]] thy voice, [[H6963]] and destroy [[H2254]] the work [[H4639]] of thine hands? [[H3027]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] in the multitude [[H7230]] of dreams [[H2472]] and many [[H7235]] words [[H1697]] also vanities: [[H1892]] but [[H3588]] fear [[H3372]]  thou [[H853]] God. [[H430]]

### 8
If [[H518]] thou seest [[H7200]] the oppression [[H6233]] of the poor, [[H7326]] and violent perverting [[H1499]] of judgment [[H4941]] and justice [[H6664]] in a province, [[H4082]] marvel [[H8539]] not [[H408]] at [[H5921]] the matter: [[H2656]] for [[H3588]] higher [[H1364]] than the highest [[H1364]] regardeth; [[H8104]] and higher [[H1364]] than [[H5921]] they. [[H5921]]

### 9
Moreover the profit [[H3504]] of the earth [[H776]] is for all: [[H3605]] the king [[H4428]] is served [[H5647]] by the field. [[H7704]]

### 10
He that loveth [[H157]] silver [[H3701]] shall not [[H3808]] be satisfied [[H7646]] with silver; [[H3701]] nor he [[H4310]] that loveth [[H157]] abundance [[H1995]] with increase: [[H8393]] this [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 11
When goods [[H2896]] increase, [[H7235]] they are increased [[H7231]] that eat [[H398]] them: and what [[H4100]] good [[H3788]] to the owners [[H1167]] thereof, saving [[H518]] the beholding [[H7200]] with their eyes? [[H5869]]

### 12
The sleep [[H8142]] of a labouring man [[H5647]] sweet, [[H4966]] whether [[H518]] he eat [[H398]] little [[H4592]] or [[H518]] much: [[H7235]] but the abundance [[H7647]] of the rich [[H6223]] will not [[H369]] suffer [[H3240]] him to sleep. [[H3462]]

### 13
There is [[H3426]] a sore [[H2470]] evil [[H7451]] I have seen [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] riches [[H6239]] kept [[H8104]] for the owners [[H1167]] thereof to their hurt. [[H7451]]

### 14
But those [[H1931]] riches [[H6239]] perish [[H6]] by evil [[H7451]] travail: [[H6045]] and he begetteth [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and nothing [[H3972]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 15
As [[H834]] he came forth [[H3318]] of his mother's [[H517]] womb, [[H990]] naked [[H6174]] shall he return [[H7725]] to go [[H1980]] as he came, [[H935]] and shall take [[H5375]] nothing [[H3972]] of his labour, [[H5999]] which he may carry away [[H3212]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 16
And this [[H2090]] also [[H1571]] a sore [[H2470]] evil, [[H7451]] in all [[H3605]] points [[H5980]] as he came, [[H935]] so [[H3651]] shall he go: [[H1980]] and what [[H4100]] profit [[H3504]] hath he that hath laboured [[H5998]] for the wind? [[H7307]]

### 17
All [[H3605]] his days [[H3117]] also [[H1571]] he eateth [[H398]] in darkness, [[H2822]] and much [[H7235]] sorrow [[H3707]] and wrath [[H7110]] with his sickness. [[H2483]]

### 18
Behold [[H2009]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] have seen: [[H7200]] good [[H2896]] and comely [[H3303]] to eat [[H398]] and to drink, [[H8354]] and to enjoy [[H7200]] the good [[H2896]] of all [[H3605]] his labour [[H5999]] that he taketh [[H5998]] under [[H8478]] the sun [[H8121]] all [[H4557]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] him: for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] his portion. [[H2506]]

### 19
Every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] also [[H1571]] to whom [[H834]] God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] riches [[H6239]] and wealth, [[H5233]] and hath given him power [[H7980]] to eat [[H398]] thereof, [[H4480]] and to take [[H5375]] his portion, [[H2506]] and to rejoice [[H8055]] in his labour; [[H5999]] this [[H2090]] the gift [[H4991]] of God. [[H430]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] he shall not [[H3808]] much [[H7235]] remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of his life; [[H2416]] because [[H3588]] God [[H430]] answereth [[H6031]] in the joy [[H8057]] of his heart. [[H3820]]
