### 1
To every [[H3605]] a season, [[H2165]] and a time [[H6256]] to every [[H3605]] purpose [[H2656]] under [[H8478]] the heaven: [[H8064]]

### 2
A time [[H6256]] to be born, [[H3205]] and a time [[H6256]] to die; [[H4191]] a time [[H6256]] to plant, [[H5193]] and a time [[H6256]] to pluck up [[H6131]] planted; [[H5193]]

### 3
A time [[H6256]] to kill, [[H2026]] and a time [[H6256]] to heal; [[H7495]] a time [[H6256]] to break down, [[H6555]] and a time [[H6256]] to build up; [[H1129]]

### 4
A time [[H6256]] to weep, [[H1058]] and a time [[H6256]] to laugh; [[H7832]] a time [[H6256]] to mourn, [[H5594]] and a time [[H6256]] to dance; [[H7540]]

### 5
A time [[H6256]] to cast away [[H7993]] stones, [[H68]] and a time [[H6256]] to gather together; [[H3664]] stones [[H68]] a time [[H6256]] to embrace, [[H2263]] and a time [[H6256]] to refrain [[H7368]] from embracing; [[H2263]]

### 6
A time [[H6256]] to get, [[H1245]] and a time [[H6256]] to lose; [[H6]] a time [[H6256]] to keep, [[H8104]] and a time [[H6256]] to cast away; [[H7993]]

### 7
A time [[H6256]] to rend, [[H7167]] and a time [[H6256]] to sew; [[H8609]] a time [[H6256]] to keep silence, [[H2814]] and a time [[H6256]] to speak; [[H1696]]

### 8
A time [[H6256]] to love, [[H157]] and a time [[H6256]] to hate; [[H8130]] a time [[H6256]] of war, [[H4421]] and a time [[H6256]] of peace. [[H7965]]

### 9
What [[H4100]] profit [[H3504]] hath he that worketh [[H6213]] in that wherein [[H834]] he [[H1931]] laboureth? [[H6001]]

### 10
I have seen [[H7200]] the travail, [[H6045]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] to the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] to be exercised [[H6031]] in it. [[H6031]]

### 11
He hath made [[H6213]] every [[H3605]] beautiful [[H3303]] in his time: [[H6256]] also [[H1571]] he hath set [[H5414]] the world [[H5769]] in their heart, [[H3820]] so that [[H1097]] no man [[H120]] can find out [[H4672]] the work [[H4639]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] maketh [[H6213]] from the beginning [[H7218]] to [[H5704]] the end. [[H5490]]

### 12
I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] no [[H369]] good [[H2896]] in them, but [[H518]] for [[H3588]] to rejoice, [[H8055]] and to do [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] in his life. [[H2416]]

### 13
And also [[H1571]] that every man [[H120]] should eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and enjoy [[H7200]] the good [[H2896]] of all [[H3605]] his labour, [[H5999]] it [[H1931]] the gift [[H4991]] of God. [[H430]]

### 14
I know [[H3045]] that, [[H3588]] whatsoever [[H3605]] God [[H430]] doeth, [[H6213]] it [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] for ever: [[H5769]] nothing [[H369]] can be put [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] it, nor [[H369]] any thing taken [[H1639]] from [[H4480]] it: and God [[H430]] doeth [[H6213]] that should fear [[H3372]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 15
That which hath been [[H4100]] is now; [[H3528]] and that [[H1931]] which [[H834]] is to be [[H1961]] hath already [[H3528]] been; [[H1961]] and God [[H430]] requireth [[H1245]] that which is past. [[H7291]]

### 16
And moreover [[H5750]] I saw [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun [[H8121]] the place [[H4725]] of judgment, [[H4941]] wickedness [[H7562]] there; [[H8033]] and the place [[H4725]] of righteousness, [[H6664]] iniquity [[H7562]] there. [[H7562]]

### 17
I [[H589]] said [[H559]] in mine heart, [[H3820]] God [[H430]] shall judge [[H8199]] the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked: [[H7563]] for [[H3588]] a time [[H6256]] there [[H8033]] for every [[H3605]] purpose [[H2656]] and for [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] work. [[H4639]]

### 18
I [[H589]] said [[H559]] in mine heart [[H3820]] concerning [[H5921]] the estate [[H1700]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] that God [[H430]] might manifest [[H1305]] them, and that they [[H1992]] might see [[H7200]] that they [[H1992]] themselves are beasts. [[H929]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] that which befalleth [[H4745]] the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] befalleth [[H4745]] beasts; [[H929]] even one thing [[H259]] befalleth [[H4745]] them: as the one [[H2088]] dieth, [[H4194]] so [[H3651]] dieth [[H4194]] the other; [[H2088]] yea, they have all [[H3605]] one [[H259]] breath; [[H7307]] so that a man [[H120]] hath no [[H369]] preeminence [[H4195]] above [[H4480]] a beast: [[H929]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 20
All [[H3605]] go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] one [[H259]] place; [[H4725]] all [[H3605]] are [[H1961]] of [[H4480]] the dust, [[H6083]] and all [[H3605]] turn [[H7725]] to dust [[H6083]] again. [[H6083]]

### 21
Who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] the spirit [[H7307]] of man [[H1121]] that [[H1931]] goeth [[H5927]] upward, [[H4605]] and the spirit [[H7307]] of the beast [[H929]] that [[H1931]] goeth [[H3381]] downward [[H4295]] to the earth? [[H776]]

### 22
Wherefore I perceive [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] nothing [[H369]] better, [[H2896]] than that [[H834]] a man [[H120]] should rejoice [[H8055]] in his own works; [[H4639]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] his portion: [[H2506]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] shall bring [[H935]] him to see [[H7200]] what shall be [[H4100]] after [[H310]] him?
