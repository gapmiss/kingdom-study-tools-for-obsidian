### 1
The words [[H1697]] of the Preacher, [[H6953]] the son [[H1121]] of David, [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 2
Vanity [[H1892]] of vanities, [[H1892]] saith [[H559]] the Preacher, [[H6953]] vanity [[H1892]] of vanities; [[H1892]] all [[H3605]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 3
What [[H4100]] profit [[H3504]] hath a man [[H120]] of all [[H3605]] his labour [[H5999]] which he taketh [[H5998]] under [[H8478]] the sun? [[H8121]]

### 4
generation [[H1755]] passeth away, [[H1980]] and generation [[H1755]] cometh: [[H935]] but the earth [[H776]] abideth [[H5975]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 5
The sun [[H8121]] also ariseth, [[H2224]] and the sun [[H8121]] goeth down, [[H935]] and hasteth [[H7602]] to [[H413]] his place [[H4725]] where [[H8033]] he [[H1931]] arose. [[H2224]]

### 6
The wind [[H7307]] goeth [[H1980]] toward [[H413]] the south, [[H1864]] and turneth about [[H5437]] unto [[H413]] the north; [[H6828]] it whirleth about continually, [[H1980]] and the wind [[H7307]] returneth again [[H7725]] according [[H5921]] to his circuits. [[H5439]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] the rivers [[H5158]] run [[H1980]] into [[H413]] the sea; [[H3220]] yet the sea [[H3220]] not [[H369]] full; [[H4392]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] from whence the rivers [[H5158]] come, [[H1980]] thither [[H8033]] they [[H1992]] return [[H7725]] again. [[H1980]]

### 8
All [[H3605]] things [[H1697]] full of labour; [[H3023]] man [[H376]] cannot [[H3201]] utter [[H1696]] the eye [[H5869]] is not [[H3808]] satisfied [[H7646]] with seeing, [[H7200]] nor [[H3808]] the ear [[H241]] filled [[H4390]] with hearing. [[H8085]]

### 9
The thing [[H4100]]  that hath been, [[H1961]] it [[H1931]]  which shall be; [[H1961]] and that [[H4100]] which is done [[H6213]] that [[H1931]] which shall be done: [[H6213]] and no [[H369]] new [[H2319]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 10
Is there [[H3426]] thing [[H1697]] whereof it may be said, [[H559]] See, [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] new? [[H2319]] it [[H1931]] hath been [[H1961]] already [[H3528]] of old time, [[H5769]] which [[H834]] was [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] us. [[H6440]]

### 11
no [[H369]] remembrance [[H2146]] of former [[H7223]] neither [[H1571]] shall there be [[H1961]] remembrance [[H2146]] of that are to come [[H314]] with [[H5973]] that shall come [[H1961]] after. [[H314]]

### 12
I [[H589]] the Preacher [[H6953]] was [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 13
And I gave [[H5414]] my heart [[H3820]] to seek [[H1875]] and search out [[H8446]] by wisdom [[H2451]] concerning [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] are done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] heaven: [[H8064]] this [[H1931]] sore [[H7451]] travail [[H6045]] hath God [[H430]] given [[H5414]] to the sons [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] to be exercised [[H6031]] therewith. [[H6031]]

### 14
I have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] that are done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun; [[H8121]] and, behold, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] vanity [[H1892]] and vexation [[H7469]] of spirit. [[H7307]]

### 15
crooked [[H5791]] cannot [[H3201]] be made straight: [[H8626]] and that which is wanting [[H2642]] cannot [[H3201]] be numbered. [[H4487]]

### 16
I [[H589]] communed [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] mine own heart, [[H3820]] saying, [[H559]] Lo, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] am come to great estate, [[H1431]] and have gotten more [[H3254]] wisdom [[H2451]] than [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] have been [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] me in [[H5921]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]] yea, my heart [[H3820]] had great [[H7235]] experience [[H7200]] of wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 17
And I gave [[H5414]] my heart [[H3820]] to know [[H3045]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and to know [[H3045]] madness [[H1947]] and folly: [[H5531]] I perceived [[H3045]] that [[H1931]] this [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] is vexation [[H7475]] of spirit. [[H7307]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] in much [[H7230]] wisdom [[H2451]] much [[H7227]] grief: [[H3708]] and he that increaseth [[H3254]] knowledge [[H1847]] increaseth [[H3254]] sorrow. [[H4341]]
