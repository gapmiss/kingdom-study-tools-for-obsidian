### 1
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] I considered [[H5414]] in [[H413]] my heart [[H3820]] even to declare [[H952]] all [[H3605]] this, [[H2088]] that [[H834]] the righteous, [[H6662]] and the wise, [[H2450]] and their works, [[H5652]] in the hand [[H3027]] of God: [[H430]] no [[H369]] man [[H120]] knoweth [[H3045]] either [[H1571]] love [[H160]] or [[H1571]] hatred [[H8135]] all [[H3605]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 2
All [[H3605]] alike [[H834]] to all: [[H3605]] one [[H259]] event [[H4745]] to the righteous, [[H6662]] and to the wicked; [[H7563]] to the good [[H2896]] and to the clean, [[H2889]] and to the unclean; [[H2931]] to him that sacrificeth, [[H2076]] and to him that [[H834]] sacrificeth [[H2076]] not: [[H369]] as the good, [[H2896]] so the sinner; [[H2398]] he that sweareth, [[H7650]] as [[H834]] that feareth [[H3372]] an oath. [[H7621]]

### 3
This [[H2088]] an evil [[H7451]] among all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] are done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] that [[H3588]] one [[H259]] event [[H4745]] unto all: [[H3605]] yea, also [[H1571]] the heart [[H3820]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] is full [[H4390]] of evil, [[H7451]] and madness [[H1947]] in their heart [[H3824]] while they live, [[H2416]] and after [[H310]] that to [[H413]] the dead. [[H4191]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] to him [[H4310]] that [[H834]] is joined [[H977]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the living [[H2416]] there is [[H3426]] hope: [[H986]] for [[H3588]] a living [[H2416]] dog [[H3611]] is better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] a dead [[H4191]] lion. [[H738]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] the living [[H2416]] know [[H3045]] that they shall die: [[H4191]] but the dead [[H4191]] know [[H3045]] not [[H369]] any thing, [[H3972]] neither [[H369]] have they any more [[H5750]] a reward; [[H7939]] for [[H3588]] the memory [[H2143]] of them is forgotten. [[H7911]]

### 6
Also [[H1571]] their love, [[H160]] and [[H1571]] their hatred, [[H8135]] and [[H1571]] their envy, [[H7068]] is now [[H3528]] perished; [[H6]] neither [[H369]] have they any more [[H5750]] a portion [[H2506]] for ever [[H5769]] in any [[H3605]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 7
Go thy way, [[H3212]] eat [[H398]] thy bread [[H3899]] with joy, [[H8057]] and drink [[H8354]] thy wine [[H3196]] with a merry [[H2896]] heart; [[H3820]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] now [[H3528]] accepteth [[H7521]] thy works. [[H4639]]

### 8
Let thy garments [[H899]] be [[H1961]] always [[H6256]] white; [[H3836]] and let thy head [[H7218]] lack [[H2637]] no [[H408]] ointment. [[H8081]]

### 9
Live [[H2416]] joyfully [[H7200]] with [[H5973]] the wife [[H802]] whom [[H834]] thou lovest [[H157]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the life [[H2416]] of thy vanity, [[H1892]] which [[H834]] he hath given [[H5414]] thee under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of thy vanity: [[H1892]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] thy portion [[H2506]] in life, [[H2416]] and in thy labour [[H5999]] which [[H834]] thou [[H859]] takest [[H6001]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 10
Whatsoever [[H3605]] thy hand [[H3027]] findeth [[H4672]] to do, [[H6213]] do [[H6213]] with thy might; [[H3581]] for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] work, [[H4639]] nor device, [[H2808]] nor knowledge, [[H1847]] nor wisdom, [[H2451]] in the grave, [[H7585]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest. [[H1980]]

### 11
I returned, [[H7725]] and saw [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] that [[H3588]] the race [[H4793]] not [[H3808]] to the swift, [[H7031]] nor [[H3808]] the battle [[H4421]] to the strong, [[H1368]] neither [[H3808]] yet [[H1571]] bread [[H3899]] to the wise, [[H2450]] nor [[H3808]] yet [[H1571]] riches [[H6239]] to men of understanding, [[H995]] nor [[H3808]] yet [[H1571]] favour [[H2580]] to men of skill; [[H3045]] but [[H3588]] time [[H6256]] and chance [[H6294]] happeneth [[H7136]]  to [[H853]] them all. [[H853]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] man [[H120]] also [[H1571]] knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] his time: [[H6256]] as the fishes [[H1709]] that are taken [[H270]] in an evil [[H7451]] net, [[H4686]] and as the birds [[H6833]] that are caught [[H270]] in the snare; [[H6341]] so [[H1992]] the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] snared [[H3369]] in an evil [[H7451]] time, [[H6256]] when it falleth [[H5307]] suddenly [[H6597]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 13
This [[H2090]] wisdom [[H2451]] have I seen [[H7200]] also [[H1571]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] and it [[H1931]] great [[H1419]] unto [[H413]] me: [[H413]]

### 14
a little [[H6996]] city, [[H5892]] and few [[H4592]] men [[H582]] within it; and there came [[H935]] a great [[H1419]] king [[H4428]] against [[H413]] it, and besieged [[H5437]] it, and built [[H1129]] great [[H1419]] bulwarks [[H4685]] against [[H5921]] it: [[H5921]]

### 15
Now there was found [[H4672]] in it a poor [[H4542]] wise [[H2450]] man, [[H376]] and he [[H1931]] by his wisdom [[H2451]] delivered [[H4422]] the city; [[H5892]] yet no [[H3808]] man [[H120]] remembered [[H2142]] that same [[H1931]] poor [[H4542]] man. [[H376]]

### 16
Then said [[H559]] I, [[H589]] Wisdom [[H2451]] better [[H2896]] than strength: [[H1369]] nevertheless the poor man's [[H4542]] wisdom [[H2451]] despised, [[H959]] and his words [[H1697]] are not [[H369]] heard. [[H8085]]

### 17
The words [[H1697]] of wise [[H2450]] heard [[H8085]] in quiet [[H5183]] more than the cry [[H2201]] of him that ruleth [[H4910]] among fools. [[H3684]]

### 18
Wisdom [[H2451]] better [[H2896]] than weapons [[H3627]] of war: [[H7128]] but one [[H259]] sinner [[H2398]] destroyeth [[H6]] much [[H7235]] good. [[H2896]]
