[[Ecclesiastes 7|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 9|→]]

### 1
Who [[H4310]] as the wise [[H2450]] and who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] the interpretation [[H6592]] of a thing? [[H1697]] a man's [[H120]] wisdom [[H2451]] maketh his face [[H6440]] to shine, [[H215]] and the boldness [[H5797]] of his face [[H6440]] shall be changed. [[H8132]]

### 2
I [[H589]] to keep [[H8104]] the king's [[H4428]] commandment, [[H6310]] and in regard [[H1700]] of the oath [[H7621]] of God. [[H430]]

### 3
Be not [[H408]] hasty [[H926]] to go out [[H1980]] of his sight: [[H6440]] stand [[H5975]] not [[H408]] in an evil [[H7451]] thing; [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] he doeth [[H6213]] whatsoever [[H3605]] pleaseth [[H2654]] him. [[H2654]]

### 4
Where [[H834]] the word [[H1697]] of a king [[H4428]] power: [[H7983]] and who [[H4310]] may say [[H559]] unto him, What [[H4100]] doest [[H6213]] thou? [[H6213]]

### 5
Whoso keepeth [[H8104]] the commandment [[H4687]] shall feel [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] thing: [[H1697]] and a wise man's [[H2450]] heart [[H3820]] discerneth [[H3045]] both time [[H6256]] and judgment. [[H4941]]

### 6
Because [[H3588]] to every [[H3605]] purpose [[H2656]] there is [[H3426]] time [[H6256]] and judgment, [[H4941]] therefore [[H3588]] the misery [[H7451]] of man [[H120]] great [[H7227]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] he knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H369]] that [[H4100]] which shall be: [[H1961]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] can tell [[H5046]] him when [[H834]] it shall be? [[H834]]

### 8
no [[H369]] man [[H120]] that hath power [[H7989]] over the spirit [[H7307]] to retain [[H3607]] the spirit; [[H7307]] neither [[H369]] power [[H7983]] in the day [[H3117]] of death: [[H4194]] and no [[H369]] discharge [[H4917]] in war; [[H4421]] neither [[H3808]] shall wickedness [[H7562]] deliver [[H4422]] those that are given [[H1167]] to it. [[H1167]]

### 9
All [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] have I seen, [[H7200]] and applied [[H5414]] my heart [[H3820]] unto every [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun: [[H8121]] a time [[H6256]] wherein [[H834]] one man [[H120]] ruleth over [[H7980]] another [[H120]] to his own hurt. [[H7451]]

### 10
And so [[H3651]] I saw [[H7200]] the wicked [[H7563]] buried, [[H6912]] who had come [[H935]] and gone [[H1980]] from the place [[H4725]] of the holy, [[H6918]] and they were forgotten [[H7911]] in the city [[H5892]] where [[H834]] they had so [[H3651]] done: [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 11
Because [[H834]] sentence against [[H6599]] an evil [[H7451]] work [[H4639]] is not [[H369]] executed [[H6213]] speedily, [[H4120]] therefore [[H5921]] the heart [[H3820]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] is fully set [[H4390]] in them to do [[H6213]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 12
Though [[H834]] a sinner [[H2398]] do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] an hundred times, [[H3967]] and his be prolonged, [[H748]] yet [[H3588]] surely [[H1571]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] that [[H834]] it shall be [[H1961]] well [[H2896]] with them that fear [[H3372]] God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] fear [[H3372]] before [[H6440]] him: [[H6440]]

### 13
But it shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] well [[H2896]] with the wicked, [[H7563]] neither [[H3808]] shall he prolong [[H748]] days, [[H3117]] as a shadow; [[H6738]] because [[H834]] he feareth [[H3373]] not [[H369]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]]

### 14
There is [[H3426]] a vanity [[H1892]] which [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] upon [[H5921]] the earth; [[H776]] that [[H834]] there be [[H3426]] just [[H6662]] unto whom [[H834]] it happeneth [[H5060]] according to the work [[H4639]] of the wicked; [[H7563]] again, there be [[H3426]] wicked [[H7563]] to [[H413]] whom it happeneth [[H5060]] according to the work [[H4639]] of the righteous: [[H6662]] I said [[H559]] that this also [[H1571]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 15
Then I [[H589]] commended [[H7623]] mirth, [[H8057]] because [[H834]] a man [[H120]] hath no [[H369]] better thing [[H2896]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] than [[H3588]] to eat, [[H398]] and to drink, [[H8354]] and to be merry: [[H8055]] for that [[H1931]] shall abide [[H3867]] with him of his labour [[H5999]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] him under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 16
When [[H834]] I applied [[H5414]] mine heart [[H3820]] to know [[H3045]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and to see [[H7200]] the business [[H6045]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] upon [[H5921]] the earth: [[H776]] (for [[H3588]] also [[H1571]] neither [[H369]] day [[H3117]] nor night [[H3915]] seeth [[H7200]] sleep [[H8142]] with his eyes:) [[H5869]]

### 17
Then I beheld [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of God, [[H430]] that [[H3588]] a man [[H120]] cannot [[H3201]] find out [[H4672]] the work [[H4639]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun: [[H8121]] because [[H834]] though [[H7945]] a man [[H120]] labour [[H5998]] to seek out, [[H1245]] yet he shall not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] yea [[H1571]] further; though [[H518]] a wise [[H2450]] think [[H559]] to know [[H3045]] yet shall he not [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to find [[H4672]]
