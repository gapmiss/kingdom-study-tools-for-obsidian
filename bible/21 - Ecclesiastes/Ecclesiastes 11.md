Cast [[H7971]] thy bread [[H3899]] upon [[H6440]] the waters: [[H4325]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt find [[H4672]] it after many [[H7230]] days. [[H3117]]

### 2
Give [[H5414]] a portion [[H2506]] to seven, [[H7651]] and also [[H1571]] to eight; [[H8083]] for [[H3588]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] evil [[H7451]] shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

If [[H518]] the clouds [[H5645]] be full [[H4390]] of rain, [[H1653]] they empty [[H7324]] upon [[H5921]] the earth: [[H776]] and if [[H518]] the tree [[H6086]] fall [[H5307]] toward the south, [[H1864]] or [[H518]] toward the north, [[H6828]] in the place [[H4725]] where the tree [[H6086]] falleth, [[H5307]] there [[H8033]] it shall be.

As [[H834]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not [[H369]] what [[H4100]] the way [[H1870]] of the spirit, [[H7307]] how the bones [[H6106]] in the womb [[H990]] of her that is with child: [[H4392]] even so [[H3602]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the works [[H4639]] of God [[H430]] who [[H834]] maketh [[H6213]] all. [[H853]]

### 6
In the morning [[H1242]] sow [[H2232]] thy seed, [[H2233]] and in the evening [[H6153]] withhold [[H3240]] not [[H408]] thine hand: [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not [[H369]] whether [[H335]] shall prosper, [[H3787]] either this [[H2088]] or [[H176]] that, [[H2088]] or whether [[H518]] they both [[H8147]] alike [[H259]] good. [[H2896]]

Truly the light [[H216]] sweet, [[H4966]] and a pleasant [[H2896]] for the eyes [[H5869]] to behold [[H7200]] the sun: [[H8121]]

But [[H3588]] if [[H518]] a man [[H120]] live [[H2421]] many [[H7235]] years, [[H8141]] rejoice [[H8055]] in them all; [[H3605]] yet let him remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of darkness; [[H2822]] for [[H3588]] they shall be [[H1961]] many. [[H7235]] All [[H3605]] that cometh [[H935]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 9
Rejoice, [[H8055]] O young man, [[H970]] in thy youth; [[H3208]] and let thy heart [[H3820]] cheer [[H3190]] thee in the days [[H3117]] of thy youth, [[H979]] and walk [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of thine heart, [[H3820]] and in the sight [[H4758]] of thine eyes: [[H5869]] but know [[H3045]] thou, that [[H3588]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] God [[H430]] will bring [[H935]] thee into judgment. [[H4941]]
