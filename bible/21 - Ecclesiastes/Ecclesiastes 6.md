[[Ecclesiastes 5|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 7|→]]

---

### 1
There is [[H3426]] an evil [[H7451]] which [[H834]] I have seen [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] and it [[H1931]] common [[H7227]] among [[H5921]] men: [[H120]]

### 2
A man [[H376]] to whom [[H834]] God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] riches, [[H6239]] wealth, [[H5233]] and honour, [[H3519]] so that he wanteth [[H2638]] nothing [[H369]] for his soul [[H5315]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he desireth, [[H183]] yet God [[H430]] giveth him not power [[H7980]] to eat [[H398]] thereof, [[H4480]] but [[H3588]] a stranger [[H376]] eateth [[H398]] it: this [[H2088]] vanity, [[H1892]] and it [[H1931]] an evil [[H7451]] disease. [[H2483]]

### 3
If [[H518]] a man [[H376]] beget [[H3205]] an hundred [[H3967]] and live [[H2421]] many [[H7227]] years, [[H8141]] so that the days [[H3117]] of his years [[H8141]] be [[H1961]] many, [[H7227]] and his soul [[H5315]] be not [[H3808]] filled [[H7646]] with [[H4480]] good, [[H2896]] and also [[H1571]] he have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] burial; [[H6900]] I say, [[H559]] an untimely birth [[H5309]] better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] he. [[H4480]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] he cometh [[H935]] in with vanity, [[H1892]] and departeth [[H1980]] in darkness, [[H2822]] and his name [[H8034]] shall be covered [[H3680]] with darkness. [[H2822]]

### 5
Moreover [[H1571]] he hath not [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] the sun, [[H8121]] nor [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] this [[H2088]] hath more rest [[H5183]] than [[H2088]] the other. [[H2088]]

### 6
Yea, though [[H432]] he live [[H2421]] a thousand [[H505]] years [[H8141]] twice [[H6471]] yet hath he seen [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] good: [[H2896]] do not [[H3808]] all [[H3605]] go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] one [[H259]] place? [[H4725]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] the labour [[H5999]] of man [[H120]] for his mouth, [[H6310]] and yet [[H1571]] the appetite [[H5315]] is not [[H3808]] filled. [[H4390]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] hath the wise [[H2450]] more [[H3148]] than [[H4480]] the fool? [[H3684]] what [[H4100]] hath the poor, [[H6041]] that knoweth [[H3045]] to walk [[H1980]] before [[H5048]] the living? [[H2416]]

### 9
Better [[H2896]] the sight [[H4758]] of the eyes [[H5869]] than the wandering [[H1980]] of the desire: [[H5315]] this [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity [[H1892]] and vexation [[H7469]] of spirit. [[H7307]]

### 10
That [[H4100]] which hath been [[H1961]] is named [[H7121]] already, [[H3528]] and it is known [[H3045]] that [[H834]] it [[H1931]] man: [[H120]] neither [[H3808]] may [[H3201]] he contend [[H1777]] with [[H5973]] him that is mightier [[H8623]] than [[H4480]] he. [[H4480]]

### 11
Seeing [[H3588]] there be [[H3426]] many [[H7235]] things [[H1697]] that increase [[H7235]] vanity, [[H1892]] what [[H4100]] man [[H120]] the better? [[H3148]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] good [[H2896]] for man [[H120]] in life, [[H2416]] all [[H4557]] the days [[H3117]] of his vain [[H1892]] life [[H2416]] which he spendeth [[H6213]] as a shadow? [[H6738]] for [[H834]] who [[H4310]] can tell [[H5046]] a man [[H120]] what [[H4100]] shall be [[H1961]] after [[H310]] him under [[H8478]] the sun? [[H8121]]
