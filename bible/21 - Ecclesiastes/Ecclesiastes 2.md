### 1
I [[H589]] said [[H559]] in mine heart, [[H3820]] Go to [[H1980]] now, [[H4994]] I will prove [[H5254]] thee with mirth, [[H8057]] therefore enjoy [[H7200]] pleasure: [[H2896]] and, behold, [[H2009]] this [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 2
I said [[H559]] of laughter, [[H7814]] mad: [[H1984]] and of mirth, [[H8057]] What [[H2090]] doeth [[H6213]] it? [[H6213]]

### 3
I sought [[H8446]] in mine heart [[H3820]] to give [[H4900]] myself [[H1320]] unto wine, [[H3196]] yet acquainting [[H5090]] mine heart [[H3820]] with wisdom; [[H2451]] and to lay hold [[H270]] on folly, [[H5531]] till [[H5704]] I might see [[H7200]] what [[H335]] that [[H2088]] good [[H2896]] for the sons [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] which [[H834]] they should do [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the heaven [[H8064]] all [[H4557]] the days [[H3117]] of their life. [[H2416]]

### 4
I made me great [[H1431]] works; [[H4639]] I builded [[H1129]] me houses; [[H1004]] I planted [[H5193]] me vineyards: [[H3754]]

### 5
I made [[H6213]] me gardens [[H1593]] and orchards, [[H6508]] and I planted [[H5193]] trees [[H6086]] in them of all [[H3605]] fruits: [[H6529]]

### 6
I made [[H6213]] me pools [[H1295]] of water, [[H4325]] to water [[H8248]] therewith the wood [[H3293]] that bringeth forth [[H6779]] trees: [[H6086]]

### 7
I got [[H7069]] servants [[H5650]] and maidens, [[H8198]] and had [[H1961]] servants born [[H1121]] in my house; [[H1004]] also [[H1571]] I had [[H1961]] great [[H7235]] possessions [[H4735]] of great [[H1241]] and small cattle [[H6629]] above all [[H3605]] that were [[H1961]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] before [[H6440]] me: [[H6440]]

### 8
I gathered [[H3664]] me also [[H1571]] silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and the peculiar treasure [[H5459]] of kings [[H4428]] and of the provinces: [[H4082]] I gat [[H6213]] me men singers [[H7891]] and women singers, [[H7891]] and the delights [[H8588]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] musical instruments, [[H7705]] and that of all sorts. [[H7705]]

### 9
So I was great, [[H1431]] and increased more [[H3254]] than all [[H3605]] that were [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] me in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] also [[H637]] my wisdom [[H2451]] remained [[H5975]] with me. [[H5975]]

### 10
And whatsoever [[H3605]] mine eyes [[H5869]] desired [[H7592]] I kept [[H680]] not [[H3808]] from them, I withheld [[H4513]] not [[H3808]] my heart [[H3820]] from any [[H3605]] joy; [[H8057]] for [[H3588]] my heart [[H3820]] rejoiced [[H8056]] in all [[H3605]] my labour: [[H5999]] and this [[H2088]] was [[H1961]] my portion [[H2506]] of all [[H3605]] my labour. [[H5999]]

### 11
Then I [[H589]] looked [[H6437]] on all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] that my hands [[H3027]] had wrought, [[H6213]] and on the labour [[H5999]] that I had laboured [[H5998]] to do: [[H6213]] and, behold, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] vanity [[H1892]] and vexation [[H7469]] of spirit, [[H7307]] and no [[H369]] profit [[H3504]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 12
And I [[H589]] turned [[H6437]] myself to behold [[H7200]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and madness, [[H1947]] and folly: [[H5531]] for [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] the man [[H120]] that cometh [[H935]] after [[H310]] the king? [[H4428]] that which [[H834]] hath been already [[H3528]] done. [[H6213]]

### 13
Then I [[H589]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3426]] wisdom [[H2451]] excelleth [[H3504]] folly, [[H5531]] as far as light [[H216]] excelleth [[H3504]] darkness. [[H2822]]

### 14
The wise man's [[H2450]] eyes [[H5869]] in his head; [[H7218]] but the fool [[H3684]] walketh [[H1980]] in darkness: [[H2822]] and I myself [[H589]] perceived [[H3045]] also [[H1571]] that one [[H259]] event [[H4745]] happeneth [[H7136]] to [[H853]] them all. [[H853]]

### 15
Then said [[H559]] I [[H589]] in my heart, [[H3820]] As it happeneth [[H4745]] to the fool, [[H3684]] so it happeneth [[H7136]] even [[H1571]] to me; and why [[H4100]] was I [[H589]] then [[H227]] more [[H3148]] wise? [[H2449]] Then I said [[H1696]] in my heart, [[H3820]] that this [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] no [[H369]] remembrance [[H2146]] of the wise [[H2450]] more than [[H5973]] of the fool [[H3684]] for ever; [[H5769]] seeing that which now [[H3528]] in the days [[H3117]] to come [[H935]] shall all [[H3605]] be forgotten. [[H7911]] And how [[H349]] dieth [[H4191]] the wise [[H2450]] as [[H5973]] the fool. [[H3684]]

### 17
Therefore I hated [[H8130]] life; [[H2416]] because [[H3588]] the work [[H4639]] that is wrought [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun [[H8121]] grievous [[H7451]] unto [[H5921]] me: for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] vanity [[H1892]] and vexation [[H7469]] of spirit. [[H7307]]

### 18
Yea, I [[H589]] hated [[H8130]] all [[H3605]] my labour [[H5999]] which I [[H589]] had taken [[H6001]] under [[H8478]] the sun: [[H8121]] because I should leave [[H3240]] it unto the man [[H120]] that shall be [[H1961]] after [[H310]] me. [[H310]]

### 19
And who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] whether he shall be [[H1961]] a wise [[H2450]] or [[H176]] a fool? [[H5530]] yet shall he have rule [[H7980]] over all [[H3605]] my labour [[H5999]] wherein I have laboured, [[H5998]] and wherein I have shewed myself wise [[H2449]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]] This [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 20
Therefore I [[H589]] went about [[H5437]]  to cause [[H853]] my heart [[H3820]] to despair [[H2976]] of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the labour [[H5999]] which I took [[H5998]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a man [[H120]] whose labour [[H5999]] in wisdom, [[H2451]] and in knowledge, [[H1847]] and in equity; [[H3788]] yet to a man [[H120]] that hath not [[H3808]] laboured [[H5998]] therein shall he leave [[H5414]] it his portion. [[H2506]] This [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity [[H1892]] and a great [[H7227]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] hath [[H1933]] man [[H120]] of all [[H3605]] his labour, [[H5999]] and of the vexation [[H7475]] of his heart, [[H3820]] wherein [[H1931]] he hath laboured [[H6001]] under [[H8478]] the sun? [[H8121]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] his days [[H3117]] sorrows, [[H4341]] and his travail [[H6045]] grief; [[H3708]] yea, [[H1571]] his heart [[H3820]] taketh not [[H3808]] rest [[H7901]] in the night. [[H3915]] This [[H2088]] is also [[H1571]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 24
nothing [[H369]] better [[H2896]] for a man, [[H120]] that he should eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and he should make his soul [[H5315]] enjoy [[H3318]] good [[H2896]] in his labour. [[H5999]] This [[H2090]] also [[H1571]] I [[H589]] saw, [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] from the hand [[H3027]] of God. [[H430]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] can eat, [[H398]] or who [[H4310]] else can hasten [[H2363]] more [[H2351]] than [[H4480]] I? [[H4480]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] giveth [[H5414]] to a man [[H120]] that good [[H2896]] in his sight [[H6440]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and knowledge, [[H1847]] and joy: [[H8057]] but to the sinner [[H2398]] he giveth [[H5414]] travail, [[H6045]] to gather [[H622]] and to heap up, [[H3664]] that he may give [[H5414]] to good [[H2896]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]] This [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity [[H1892]] and vexation [[H7469]] of spirit. [[H7307]]
