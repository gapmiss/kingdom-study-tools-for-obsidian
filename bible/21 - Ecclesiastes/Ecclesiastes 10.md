# Ecclesiastes 10

[[Ecclesiastes 9|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 11|→]]

---

### 1
Dead [[H4194]] flies [[H2070]] cause the ointment [[H8081]] of the apothecary [[H7543]] to send forth [[H5042]] a stinking savour: [[H887]] a little [[H4592]] folly [[H5531]] him that is in reputation [[H3368]] for wisdom [[H2451]] honour. [[H3519]]

### 2
A wise man's [[H2450]] heart [[H3820]] at his right hand; [[H3225]] but a fool's [[H3684]] heart [[H3820]] at his left. [[H8040]]

### 3
Yea also, [[H1571]] when he that is a fool [[H5530]] walketh [[H1980]] by the way, [[H1870]] his wisdom [[H3820]] faileth [[H2638]] and he saith [[H559]] to every one [[H3605]] he [[H1931]] a fool. [[H5530]]

### 4
If [[H518]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the ruler [[H4910]] rise up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] thee, leave [[H3240]] not [[H408]] thy place; [[H4725]] for [[H3588]] yielding [[H4832]] pacifieth [[H3240]] great [[H1419]] offences. [[H2399]]

### 5
There is [[H3426]] an evil [[H7451]] I have seen [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] as an error [[H7684]] proceedeth [[H3318]] from [[H6440]] the ruler: [[H7989]]

### 6
Folly [[H5529]] is set [[H5414]] in great [[H7227]] dignity, [[H4791]] and the rich [[H6223]] sit [[H3427]] in low place. [[H8216]]

### 7
I have seen [[H7200]] servants [[H5650]] upon [[H5921]] horses, [[H5483]] and princes [[H8269]] walking [[H1980]] as servants [[H5650]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
He that diggeth [[H2658]] a pit [[H1475]] shall fall [[H5307]] into it; and whoso breaketh [[H6555]] an hedge, [[H1447]] a serpent [[H5175]] shall bite [[H5391]] him. [[H5391]]

### 9
Whoso removeth [[H5265]] stones [[H68]] shall be hurt [[H6087]] therewith; he that cleaveth [[H1234]] wood [[H6086]] shall be endangered [[H5533]] thereby. [[H5533]]

### 10
If [[H518]] the iron [[H1270]] be blunt, [[H6949]] and he [[H1931]] do not [[H3808]] whet [[H7043]] the edge, [[H6440]] then must he put to [[H1396]] more strength: [[H2428]] but wisdom [[H2451]] profitable [[H3504]] to direct. [[H3787]]

### 11
Surely [[H518]] the serpent [[H5175]] will bite [[H5391]] without [[H3808]] enchantment; [[H3908]] and a babbler [[H3956]] is no [[H369]] better. [[H3504]]

### 12
The words [[H1697]] of a wise man's [[H2450]] mouth [[H6310]] gracious; [[H2580]] but the lips [[H8193]] of a fool [[H3684]] will swallow up [[H1104]] himself. [[H1104]]

### 13
The beginning [[H8462]] of the words [[H1697]] of his mouth [[H6310]] foolishness: [[H5531]] and the end [[H319]] of his talk [[H6310]] mischievous [[H7451]] madness. [[H1948]]

### 14
A fool [[H5530]] also is full [[H7235]] of words: [[H1697]] a man [[H120]] cannot [[H3808]] tell [[H3045]] what shall be; [[H4100]] and what [[H834]] shall be [[H1961]] after [[H310]] him, who [[H4310]] can tell [[H5046]] him? [[H5046]]

### 15
The labour [[H5999]] of the foolish [[H3684]] wearieth [[H3021]] every one of them, because [[H834]] he knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] how to go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 16
Woe [[H337]] to thee, O land, [[H776]] when thy king [[H4428]] a child, [[H5288]] and thy princes [[H8269]] eat [[H398]] in the morning! [[H1242]]

### 17
Blessed [[H835]] thou, O land, [[H776]] when thy king [[H4428]] the son [[H1121]] of nobles, [[H2715]] and thy princes [[H8269]] eat [[H398]] in due season, [[H6256]] for strength, [[H1369]] and not [[H3808]] for drunkenness! [[H8358]]

### 18
By much slothfulness [[H6103]] the building [[H4746]] decayeth; [[H4355]] and through idleness [[H8220]] of the hands [[H3027]] the house [[H1004]] droppeth through. [[H1811]]

### 19
A feast [[H3899]] is made [[H6213]] for laughter, [[H7814]] and wine [[H3196]] maketh merry: [[H8055]] but money [[H3701]] answereth [[H6030]] all [[H3605]]

### 20
Curse [[H7043]] not [[H408]] the king, [[H4428]] no [[H1571]] not in thy thought; [[H4093]] and curse [[H7043]] not [[H408]] the rich [[H6223]] in thy bedchamber: [[H2315]] for [[H3588]] a bird [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] shall carry [[H1980]] the voice, [[H6963]] and that which hath [[H1167]] wings [[H3671]] shall tell [[H5046]] the matter.
