### 1
So I [[H589]] returned, [[H7725]] and considered [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the oppressions [[H6217]] that [[H834]] are done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun: [[H8121]] and behold [[H2009]] the tears [[H1832]] of oppressed, [[H6217]] and they had no [[H369]] comforter; [[H5162]] and on the side [[H3027]] of their oppressors [[H6231]] power; [[H3581]] but they had no [[H369]] comforter. [[H5162]]

### 2
Wherefore I [[H589]] praised [[H7623]] the dead [[H4191]] which are already [[H3528]] dead [[H4191]] more than [[H4480]] the living [[H2416]] which [[H834]] are yet [[H5728]] alive. [[H2416]]

### 3
Yea, better [[H2896]] than both [[H8147]]  they, [[H853]] which [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] yet [[H5728]] been, [[H1961]] who [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] the evil [[H7451]] work [[H4639]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 4
Again, I [[H589]] considered [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] travail, [[H5999]] and every [[H3605]] right [[H3788]] work, [[H4639]] that [[H3588]] for this [[H1931]] a man [[H376]] is envied [[H7068]] of his neighbour. [[H7453]] This [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity [[H1892]] and vexation [[H7469]] of spirit. [[H7307]]

### 5
The fool [[H3684]] foldeth together, [[H2263]] his hands [[H3027]] and eateth [[H398]] his own flesh. [[H1320]]

### 6
Better [[H2896]] an handful [[H3709]] quietness, [[H5183]] than both the hands [[H2651]] full [[H4393]] travail [[H5999]] and vexation [[H7469]] of spirit. [[H7307]]

### 7
Then I [[H589]] returned, [[H7725]] and I saw [[H7200]] vanity [[H1892]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 8
There is [[H3426]] one [[H259]] and not [[H369]] a second; [[H8145]] yea, [[H1571]] he hath neither [[H369]] child [[H1121]] nor brother: [[H251]] yet no [[H369]] end [[H7093]] of all [[H3605]] his labour; [[H5999]] neither [[H3808]] is his eye [[H5869]] satisfied [[H7646]] with riches; [[H6239]] neither For whom [[H4310]] do I [[H589]] labour, [[H6001]] and bereave [[H2637]] my soul [[H5315]] of good? [[H2896]] This [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity, [[H1892]] yea, it [[H1931]] a sore [[H7451]] travail. [[H6045]]

### 9
Two [[H8147]] better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] one; [[H259]] because [[H834]] they have [[H3426]] a good [[H2896]] reward [[H7939]] for their labour. [[H5999]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] they fall, [[H5307]] the one [[H259]] will lift up [[H6965]] his fellow: [[H2270]] but woe [[H337]] to him alone [[H259]] when he falleth; [[H5307]] for not [[H369]] another [[H8145]] to help him up. [[H6965]]

### 11
Again, [[H1571]] if [[H518]] two [[H8147]] lie together, [[H7901]] then they have heat: [[H2552]] but how [[H349]] can one [[H259]] be warm [[H3179]]

### 12
And if [[H518]] one [[H259]] prevail against [[H8630]] him, two [[H8147]] shall withstand [[H5975]] him; and a threefold [[H8027]] cord [[H2339]] is not [[H3808]] quickly [[H4120]] broken. [[H5423]]

### 13
Better [[H2896]] a poor [[H4542]] and a wise [[H2450]] child [[H3206]] than an old [[H2205]] and foolish [[H3684]] king, [[H4428]] who [[H834]] will [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be admonished. [[H2094]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] out of prison [[H1004]] he cometh [[H3318]] to reign; [[H4427]] whereas [[H3588]] also [[H1571]] born [[H3205]] in his kingdom [[H4438]] becometh poor. [[H7326]]

### 15
I considered [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the living [[H2416]] which walk [[H1980]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] with [[H5973]] the second [[H8145]] child [[H3206]] that [[H834]] shall stand up [[H5975]] in his stead. [[H5975]]

### 16
no [[H369]] end [[H7093]] of all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] have been [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] them: they also [[H1571]] that come after [[H314]] shall not [[H3808]] rejoice [[H8055]] in him. Surely [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] vanity [[H1892]] and vexation [[H7475]] of spirit. [[H7307]]
