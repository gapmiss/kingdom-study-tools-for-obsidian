### 1
Then Nahash [[H5176]] the Ammonite [[H5984]] came up, [[H5927]] and encamped [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] Jabesh-gilead: [[H3003]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Jabesh [[H3003]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Nahash, [[H5176]] Make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with us, and we will serve [[H5647]] thee. [[H5647]]

### 2
And Nahash [[H5176]] the Ammonite [[H5984]] answered [[H559]] them, On this [[H2063]] will I make [[H3772]] with you, that I may thrust out [[H5365]] all [[H3605]] your right [[H3225]] eyes, [[H5869]] and lay [[H7760]] it a reproach [[H2781]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
And the elders [[H2205]] of Jabesh [[H3003]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Give us seven [[H7651]] days' [[H3117]] respite, [[H7503]] that we may send [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and then, if [[H518]] no man [[H369]] to save [[H3467]] us, we will come out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 4
Then came [[H935]] the messengers [[H4397]] to Gibeah [[H1390]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and told [[H1696]] the tidings [[H1697]] in the ears [[H241]] of the people: [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] lifted up [[H5375]] their voices, [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 5
And, behold, [[H2009]] Saul [[H7586]] came [[H935]] after [[H310]] the herd [[H1241]] out of [[H4480]] the field; [[H7704]] and Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] they weep? [[H1058]] And they told [[H5608]]  him [[H853]] the tidings [[H1697]] of the men [[H582]] of Jabesh. [[H3003]]

### 6
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came [[H6743]] upon [[H5921]] Saul [[H7586]] when he heard [[H8085]] those [[H428]] tidings, [[H1697]] and his anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] greatly. [[H3966]]

### 7
And he took [[H3947]] a yoke [[H6776]] of oxen, [[H1241]] and hewed them in pieces, [[H5408]] and sent [[H7971]] throughout all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Israel [[H3478]] by the hands [[H3027]] of messengers, [[H4397]] saying, [[H559]] Whosoever [[H834]] cometh not forth [[H3318]] after [[H310]] Saul [[H7586]] and after [[H310]] Samuel, [[H8050]] so [[H3541]] shall it be done [[H6213]] unto his oxen. [[H1241]] And the fear [[H6343]] of the Lord [[H3068]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] the people, [[H5971]] and they came out [[H3318]] with one [[H259]] consent. [[H376]]

### 8
And when he numbered [[H6485]] them in Bezek, [[H966]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand, [[H505]] and the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] thirty [[H7970]] thousand. [[H505]]

### 9
And they said [[H559]] unto the messengers [[H4397]] that came, [[H935]] Thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] unto the men [[H376]] of Jabesh-gilead, [[H3003]] To morrow, [[H4279]] by the sun [[H8121]] be hot, [[H2527]] ye shall have [[H1961]] help. [[H8668]] And the messengers [[H4397]] came [[H935]] and shewed [[H5046]] to the men [[H376]] of Jabesh; [[H3003]] and they were glad. [[H8055]]

### 10
Therefore the men [[H582]] of Jabesh [[H3003]] said, [[H559]] To morrow [[H4279]] we will come out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] you, and ye shall do [[H6213]] with us all [[H3605]] that seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] unto you. [[H2896]]

### 11
And it was [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that Saul [[H7586]] put [[H7760]] the people [[H5971]] in three [[H7969]] companies; [[H7218]] and they came [[H935]] into the midst [[H8432]] of the host [[H4264]] in the morning [[H1242]] watch, [[H821]] and slew [[H5221]] the Ammonites [[H5983]] until [[H5704]] the heat [[H2527]] of the day: [[H3117]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] that they which remained [[H7604]] were scattered, [[H6327]] so that two [[H8147]] of them were not [[H3808]] left [[H7604]] together. [[H3162]]

### 12
And the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Who [[H4310]] he that said, [[H559]] Shall Saul [[H7586]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] us? bring [[H5414]] the men, [[H376]] that we may put them to death. [[H4191]]

### 13
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] There shall not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] be put to death [[H4191]] this [[H2088]] day: [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] to day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath wrought [[H6213]] salvation [[H8668]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 14
Then said [[H559]] Samuel [[H8050]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us go [[H1980]] to Gilgal, [[H1537]] and renew [[H2318]] the kingdom [[H4410]] there. [[H8033]]

### 15
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] went [[H1980]] to Gilgal; [[H1537]] and there [[H8033]] they made Saul [[H7586]] king [[H4427]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] in Gilgal; [[H1537]] and there [[H8033]] they sacrificed [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] of peace offerings [[H8002]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and there [[H8033]] Saul [[H7586]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] rejoiced [[H8055]] greatly.
