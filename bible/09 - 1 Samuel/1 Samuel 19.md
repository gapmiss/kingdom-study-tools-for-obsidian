### 1
And Saul [[H7586]] spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Jonathan [[H3129]] his son, [[H1121]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5650]] that they should kill [[H4191]] David. [[H1732]]

### 2
But Jonathan Saul's son [[H3083]] delighted much in David: and Jonathan told [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] my father [[H1]] seeketh [[H1245]] to kill [[H4191]] thee: now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] take heed [[H8104]] to thyself until the morning, [[H1242]] and abide [[H3427]] in a secret [[H5643]] and hide thyself: [[H2244]]

### 3
And I [[H589]] will go out [[H3318]] and stand [[H5975]] beside [[H3027]] my father [[H1]] in the field [[H7704]] where [[H834]] thou [[H859]] and I [[H589]] will commune [[H1696]] with [[H413]] my father [[H1]] of thee; and what [[H4100]] I see, [[H7200]] that I will tell [[H5046]] thee. [[H5046]]

### 4
And Jonathan [[H3083]] spake [[H1696]] good [[H2896]] of David [[H1732]] unto [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] his father, [[H1]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Let not [[H408]] the king [[H4428]] sin [[H2398]] against his servant, [[H5650]] against David; [[H1732]] because [[H3588]] he hath not [[H3808]] sinned [[H2398]] against thee, and because [[H3588]] his works [[H4639]] to thee-ward very [[H3966]] good: [[H2896]]

### 5
For he did put [[H7760]] his life [[H5315]] in his hand, [[H3709]] and slew [[H5221]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] and the Lord [[H3068]] wrought [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] salvation [[H8668]] for all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]] thou sawest [[H7200]] and didst rejoice: [[H8055]] wherefore [[H4100]] then wilt thou sin [[H2398]] against innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]] to slay [[H4191]] David [[H1732]] without a cause? [[H2600]]

### 6
And Saul [[H7586]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of Jonathan: [[H3083]] and Saul [[H7586]] sware, [[H7650]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] he shall not [[H518]] be slain. [[H4191]]

### 7
And Jonathan [[H3083]] called [[H7121]] David, [[H1732]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] shewed [[H5046]]  him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] things. [[H1697]] And Jonathan [[H3083]] brought [[H935]] David [[H1732]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] and he was [[H1961]] in his presence, [[H6440]] as in times past. [[H865]]

### 8
And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] again: [[H3254]] and David [[H1732]] went out, [[H3318]] and fought [[H3898]] with the Philistines, [[H6430]] and slew [[H5221]] them with a great [[H1419]] slaughter; [[H4347]] and they fled [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 9
And the evil [[H7451]] spirit [[H7307]] from the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] as he [[H1931]] sat [[H3427]] in his house [[H1004]] with his javelin [[H2595]] in his hand: [[H3027]] and David [[H1732]] played [[H5059]] with hand. [[H3027]]

### 10
And Saul [[H7586]] sought [[H1245]] to smite [[H5221]] David [[H1732]] even to the wall [[H7023]] with the javelin; [[H2595]] but he slipped away [[H6362]] out of Saul's [[H7586]] presence, [[H6440]] and he smote [[H5221]] the javelin [[H2595]] into the wall: [[H7023]] and David [[H1732]] fled, [[H5127]] and escaped [[H4422]] that [[H1931]] night. [[H3915]]

### 11
Saul [[H7586]] also sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] David's [[H1732]] house, [[H1004]] to watch [[H8104]] him, and to slay [[H4191]] him in the morning: [[H1242]] and Michal [[H4324]] David's [[H1732]] wife [[H802]] told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou save [[H4422]] not [[H369]] thy life [[H5315]] to night, [[H3915]] to morrow [[H4279]] thou [[H859]] shalt be slain. [[H4191]]

### 12
So Michal [[H4324]] let David [[H1732]] down [[H3381]] through [[H1157]] a window: [[H2474]] and he went, [[H1980]] and fled, [[H1272]] and escaped. [[H4422]]

### 13
And Michal [[H4324]] took [[H3947]] an image, [[H8655]] and laid [[H7760]] in [[H413]] the bed, [[H4296]] and put [[H7760]] a pillow [[H3523]] of goats' [[H5795]] for his bolster, [[H4763]] and covered [[H3680]] with a cloth. [[H899]]

### 14
And when Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to take [[H3947]] David, [[H1732]] she said, [[H559]] He [[H1931]] sick. [[H2470]]

### 15
And Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] the messengers [[H4397]] to see [[H7200]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Bring him up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] me in the bed, [[H4296]] that I may slay [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 16
And when the messengers [[H4397]] were come in, [[H935]] behold, [[H2009]] an image [[H8655]] in [[H413]] the bed, [[H4296]] with a pillow [[H3523]] of goats' [[H5795]] for his bolster. [[H4763]]

### 17
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Michal, [[H4324]] Why [[H4100]] hast thou deceived so, [[H7411]]  me [[H3602]] and sent away [[H7971]] mine enemy, [[H341]] that he is escaped? [[H4422]] And Michal [[H4324]] answered [[H559]] Saul, [[H7586]] He [[H1931]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Let me go; [[H7971]] why [[H4100]] should I kill [[H4191]] thee? [[H4191]]

### 18
So David [[H1732]] fled, [[H1272]] and escaped, [[H4422]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Samuel [[H8050]] to Ramah, [[H7414]] and told [[H5046]]  him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] had done [[H6213]] to him. And he [[H1931]] and Samuel [[H8050]] went [[H1980]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in Naioth. [[H5121]]

### 19
And it was told [[H5046]] Saul, [[H7586]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] David [[H1732]] at Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah. [[H7414]]

### 20
And Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to take [[H3947]] David: [[H1732]] and when they saw [[H7200]] the company [[H3862]] of the prophets [[H5030]] prophesying, [[H5012]] and Samuel [[H8050]] standing [[H5975]] appointed [[H5324]] over [[H5921]] them, the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the messengers [[H4397]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] prophesied. [[H5012]]

### 21
And when it was told [[H5046]] Saul, [[H7586]] he sent [[H7971]] other [[H312]] messengers, [[H4397]] and they [[H1992]] prophesied [[H5012]] likewise. [[H1571]] And Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] again [[H3254]] the third [[H7992]] time, and they [[H1992]] prophesied [[H5012]] also. [[H1571]]

### 22
Then went [[H1980]] he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] to Ramah, [[H7414]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] a great [[H1419]] well [[H953]] that [[H834]] in Sechu: [[H7906]] and he asked [[H7592]] and said, [[H559]] Where [[H375]] Samuel [[H8050]] and David? [[H1732]] And said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] at Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah. [[H7414]]

### 23
And he went [[H1980]] thither [[H8033]] to [[H413]] Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah: [[H7414]] and the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] him [[H1931]] also, [[H1571]] and he went [[H3212]] on, [[H1980]] and prophesied, [[H5012]] until [[H5704]] he came [[H935]] to Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah. [[H7414]]

### 24
And he [[H1931]] stripped off [[H6584]] his clothes [[H899]] also, [[H1571]] and prophesied [[H5012]] before [[H6440]] Samuel [[H8050]] in like manner, [[H1571]] and lay down [[H5307]] naked [[H6174]] all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] and all [[H3605]] that night. [[H3915]] Wherefore [[H5921]] they say, [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] also [[H1571]] among the prophets? [[H5030]]
