And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] in [[H413]] his heart, [[H3820]] I shall now [[H6258]] perish [[H5595]] one [[H259]] day [[H3117]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Saul: [[H7586]] nothing [[H369]] better [[H2896]] for me than that [[H3588]] I should speedily [[H4422]] escape [[H4422]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Philistines; [[H6430]] and Saul [[H7586]] shall despair [[H2976]] of [[H4480]] me, to seek [[H1245]] me any more [[H5750]] in any [[H3605]] coast [[H1366]] of Israel: [[H3478]] so shall I escape [[H4422]] out of his hand. [[H3027]]

And David [[H1732]] dwelt [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] Achish [[H397]] at Gath, [[H1661]] he [[H1931]] and his men, [[H376]] every man [[H376]] with his household, [[H1004]] David [[H1732]] with his two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] Ahinoam [[H293]] the Jezreelitess, [[H3159]] and Abigail [[H26]] the Carmelitess, [[H3762]] Nabal's [[H5037]] wife.

And it was told [[H5046]] Saul [[H7586]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] was fled [[H1272]] to Gath: [[H1661]] and he sought [[H1245]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] again [[H3254]] for him. [[H3254]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Achish, [[H397]] If [[H518]] I have now [[H4994]] found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thine eyes, [[H5869]] let them give [[H5414]] me a place [[H4725]] in some [[H259]] town [[H5892]] in the country, [[H7704]] that I may dwell [[H3427]] there: [[H8033]] for why [[H4100]] should thy servant [[H5650]] dwell [[H3427]] in the royal [[H4467]] city [[H5892]] with [[H5973]] thee? [[H5973]]

### 6
Then Achish [[H397]] gave [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] Ziklag [[H6860]] that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] wherefore [[H3651]] Ziklag [[H6860]] pertaineth [[H1961]] unto the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 7
And the time [[H4557]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] dwelt [[H3427]] in the country [[H7704]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] was [[H1961]] a full year [[H3117]] and four [[H702]] months. [[H2320]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] and his men [[H582]] went up, [[H5927]] and invaded [[H6584]] the Geshurites, [[H1651]] and the Gezrites, [[H1511]] and the Amalekites: [[H6003]] for [[H3588]] those [[H2007]] of old [[H5769]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] as thou goest [[H935]] to Shur, [[H7793]] even unto [[H5704]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

And David [[H1732]] smote [[H5221]] the land, [[H776]] and left neither [[H3808]] man [[H376]] nor woman [[H802]] alive, [[H2421]] and took away [[H3947]] the sheep, [[H6629]] and the oxen, [[H1241]] and the asses, [[H2543]] and the camels, [[H1581]] and the apparel, [[H899]] and returned, [[H7725]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Achish. [[H397]]

### 10
And Achish [[H397]] said, [[H559]] Whither [[H408]] have ye made a road [[H6584]] to day? [[H3117]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Against [[H5921]] the south [[H5045]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and against [[H5921]] the south [[H5045]] of the Jerahmeelites, [[H3397]] and against [[H413]] the south [[H5045]] of the Kenites. [[H7017]]

### 11
And David [[H1732]] saved [[H2421]] neither [[H3808]] man [[H376]] nor woman [[H802]] alive, to bring [[H935]] to Gath, [[H1661]] saying, [[H559]] Lest [[H6435]] they should tell [[H5046]] on [[H5921]] us, saying, [[H559]] So [[H3541]] did [[H6213]] David, [[H1732]] and so [[H3541]] his manner [[H4941]] all [[H3605]] the while [[H3117]] he dwelleth [[H3427]] in the country [[H7704]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 12
And Achish [[H397]] believed [[H539]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] He hath made his people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] utterly [[H887]] to abhor [[H887]] him; therefore he shall be [[H1961]] my servant [[H5650]] for ever. [[H5769]]
