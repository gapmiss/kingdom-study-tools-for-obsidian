### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] How long [[H5704]] wilt thou [[H859]] mourn [[H56]] for [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] seeing I [[H589]] have rejected [[H3988]] him from reigning [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel? [[H3478]] fill [[H4390]] thine horn [[H7161]] with oil, [[H8081]] and go, [[H1980]] I will send [[H7971]] thee to [[H413]] Jesse [[H3448]] the Bethlehemite: [[H1022]] for [[H3588]] I have provided [[H7200]] me a king [[H4428]] among his sons. [[H1121]]

### 2
And Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] How [[H349]] can I go? [[H1980]] if Saul [[H7586]] hear [[H8085]] he will kill [[H2026]] me. And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] an heifer [[H1241]] with thee, [[H3027]] and say, [[H559]] I am come [[H935]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
And call [[H7121]] Jesse [[H3448]] to the sacrifice, [[H2077]] and I [[H595]] will shew [[H3045]]  thee [[H853]] what [[H834]] thou shalt do: [[H6213]] and thou shalt anoint [[H4886]]  unto me [[H853]] whom [[H834]] I name [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 4
And Samuel [[H8050]] did [[H6213]] that which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake, [[H1696]] and came [[H935]] to Bethlehem. [[H1035]] And the elders [[H2205]] of the town [[H5892]] trembled [[H2729]] at his coming, [[H7122]] and said, [[H559]] Comest [[H935]] thou peaceably? [[H7965]]

### 5
And he said, [[H559]] Peaceably: [[H7965]] I am come [[H935]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] sanctify yourselves, [[H6942]] and come [[H935]] with [[H854]] me to the sacrifice. [[H2077]] And he sanctified [[H6942]] Jesse [[H3448]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and called [[H7121]] them to the sacrifice. [[H2077]]

### 6
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they were come, [[H935]] that he looked on [[H7200]] Eliab, [[H446]] and said, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed [[H4899]] before [[H5048]] him. [[H5048]]

### 7
But the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Look [[H5027]] not [[H408]] on [[H413]] his countenance, [[H4758]] or on [[H413]] the height [[H1364]] of his stature; [[H6967]] because [[H3588]] I have refused [[H3988]] him: for [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] as [[H834]] man [[H120]] seeth; [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] man [[H120]] looketh [[H7200]] on the outward appearance, [[H5869]] but the Lord [[H3068]] looketh [[H7200]] on the heart. [[H3824]]

### 8
Then Jesse [[H3448]] called [[H7121]] Abinadab, [[H41]] and made him pass [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] Samuel. [[H8050]] And he said, [[H559]] Neither [[H1571]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] chosen [[H977]] this. [[H2088]]

### 9
Then Jesse [[H3448]] made Shammah [[H8048]] to pass by. [[H5674]] And he said, [[H559]] Neither [[H1571]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] chosen [[H977]] this. [[H2088]]

### 10
Again, Jesse [[H3448]] made seven [[H7651]] of his sons [[H1121]] to pass [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] Samuel. [[H8050]] And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jesse, [[H3448]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] chosen [[H977]] these. [[H428]]

### 11
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jesse, [[H3448]] Are here all [[H8552]] children? [[H5288]] And he said, [[H559]] There remaineth [[H7604]] yet [[H5750]] the youngest, [[H6996]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he keepeth [[H7462]] the sheep. [[H6629]] And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jesse, [[H3448]] Send [[H7971]] and fetch [[H3947]] him: for [[H3588]] we will not [[H3808]] sit down [[H5437]] till [[H5704]] he come [[H935]] hither. [[H6311]]

### 12
And he sent, [[H7971]] and brought in. [[H935]] him Now he [[H1931]] ruddy, [[H132]] withal [[H5973]] of a beautiful [[H3303]] countenance, [[H5869]] and goodly [[H2896]] to look to. [[H7210]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Arise, [[H6965]] anoint [[H4886]] him: for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] he. [[H1931]]

### 13
Then Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] the horn [[H7161]] of oil, [[H8081]] and anointed [[H4886]] him in the midst [[H7130]] of his brethren: [[H251]] and the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H6743]] upon [[H413]] David [[H1732]] from that day [[H3117]] forward. [[H4605]] So Samuel [[H8050]] rose up, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Ramah. [[H7414]]

### 14
But the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] departed [[H5493]] from [[H5973]] Saul, [[H7586]] and an evil [[H7451]] spirit [[H7307]] from [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] troubled [[H1204]] him. [[H1204]]

### 15
And Saul's [[H7586]] servants [[H5650]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] an evil [[H7451]] spirit [[H7307]] from God [[H430]] troubleth [[H1204]] thee. [[H1204]]

### 16
Let our lord [[H113]] now [[H4994]] command [[H559]] thy servants, [[H5650]] before [[H6440]] thee, to seek out [[H1245]] a man, [[H376]] a cunning [[H3045]] player [[H5059]] on an harp: [[H3658]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H1961]] the evil [[H7451]] spirit [[H7307]] from God [[H430]] is upon [[H5921]] thee, that he shall play [[H5059]] with his hand, [[H3027]] and thou shalt be well. [[H2895]]

### 17
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] Provide [[H7200]] me now [[H4994]] a man [[H376]] that can play [[H5059]] well, [[H3190]] and bring [[H935]] to [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 18
Then answered [[H6030]] one [[H259]] of the servants, [[H5288]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have seen [[H7200]] a son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] the Bethlehemite, [[H1022]] cunning [[H3045]] in playing, [[H5059]] and a mighty [[H1368]] valiant man, [[H2428]] and a man [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] and prudent [[H995]] in matters, [[H1697]] and a comely [[H8389]] person, [[H376]] and the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 19
Wherefore Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] Jesse, [[H3448]] and said, [[H559]] Send [[H7971]]  me [[H853]] David [[H1732]] thy son, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] with the sheep. [[H6629]]

### 20
And Jesse [[H3448]] took [[H3947]] an ass [[H2543]] with bread, [[H3899]] and a bottle [[H4997]] of wine, [[H3196]] and a [[H259]] kid, [[H1423]] and sent [[H7971]] by [[H3027]] David [[H1732]] his son [[H1121]] unto [[H413]] Saul. [[H7586]]

### 21
And David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him: and he loved [[H157]] him greatly; [[H3966]] and he became [[H1961]] his armourbearer. [[H5375]]

### 22
And Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Jesse, [[H3448]] saying, [[H559]] Let David, [[H1732]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] me; for [[H3588]] he hath found [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in my sight. [[H5869]]

### 23
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H1961]] the spirit [[H7307]] from God [[H430]] was upon [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] that David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] an harp, [[H3658]] and played [[H5059]] with his hand: [[H3027]] so Saul [[H7586]] was refreshed, [[H7304]] and was well, [[H2895]] and the evil [[H7451]] spirit [[H7307]] departed [[H5493]] from him.
