### 1
Now it came to pass [[H1961]] upon a day, [[H3117]] that Jonathan [[H3129]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the young man [[H5288]] that bare [[H5375]] his armour, [[H3627]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us go over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the Philistines' [[H6430]] garrison, [[H4673]] that [[H834]] on the other side. [[H5676]] But he told [[H5046]] not [[H3808]] his father. [[H1]]

### 2
And Saul [[H7586]] tarried [[H3427]] in the uttermost part [[H7097]] of Gibeah [[H1390]] under [[H8478]] a pomegranate tree [[H7416]] which [[H834]] in Migron: [[H4051]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him about six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men; [[H376]]

### 3
And Ahiah, [[H281]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahitub, [[H285]] Ichabod's [[H350]] brother, [[H251]] the son [[H1121]] of Phinehas, [[H6372]] the son [[H1121]] of Eli, [[H5941]] the Lord's [[H3068]] priest [[H3548]] in Shiloh, [[H7887]] wearing [[H5375]] an ephod. [[H646]] And the people [[H5971]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] Jonathan [[H3129]] was gone. [[H1980]]

### 4
And between [[H996]] the passages, [[H4569]] by which [[H834]] Jonathan [[H3129]] sought [[H1245]] to go over [[H5674]] unto [[H5921]] the Philistines' [[H6430]] garrison, [[H4673]] a sharp [[H8127]] rock [[H5553]] on the one [[H2088]] side, [[H5676]] and a sharp [[H8127]] rock [[H5553]] on the other [[H2088]] side: [[H5676]] and the name [[H8034]] of the one [[H259]] Bozez, [[H949]] and the name [[H8034]] of the other [[H259]] Seneh. [[H5573]]

### 5
The forefront [[H8127]] of the one [[H259]] situate [[H4690]] northward [[H6828]] over against [[H4136]] Michmash, [[H4363]] and the other [[H259]] southward [[H5045]] over against [[H4136]] Gibeah. [[H1387]]

### 6
And Jonathan [[H3083]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the young man [[H5288]] that bare [[H5375]] his armour, [[H3627]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us go over [[H5674]] unto [[H413]] the garrison [[H4673]] of these [[H428]] uncircumcised: [[H6189]] it may be that [[H194]] the Lord [[H3068]] will work [[H6213]] for us: for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] restraint [[H4622]] to the Lord [[H3068]] to save [[H3467]] by many [[H7227]] or [[H176]] by few. [[H4592]]

### 7
And his armourbearer [[H5375]] said [[H559]] unto him, Do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in thine heart: [[H3824]] turn [[H5186]] thee; behold, [[H2005]] I with [[H5973]] thee according to thy heart. [[H3824]]

### 8
Then said [[H559]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] Behold, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] will pass over [[H5674]] unto [[H413]] men, [[H582]] and we will discover ourselves [[H1540]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 9
If [[H518]] they say [[H559]] thus [[H3541]] unto [[H413]] us, Tarry [[H1826]] until [[H5704]] we come [[H5060]] to [[H413]] you; then we will stand still [[H5975]] in our place, [[H8478]] and will not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 10
But if [[H518]] they say [[H559]] thus, [[H3541]] Come up [[H5927]] unto [[H5921]] us; then we will go up: [[H5927]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] them into our hand: [[H3027]] and this [[H2088]] a sign [[H226]] unto us. [[H226]]

### 11
And both [[H8147]] of them discovered themselves [[H1540]] unto [[H413]] the garrison [[H4673]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the Hebrews [[H5680]] come forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] the holes [[H2356]] where [[H834]] they had hid themselves. [[H2244]]

### 12
And the men [[H376]] of the garrison [[H4675]] answered [[H6030]] Jonathan [[H3129]] and his armourbearer, [[H5375]] and said, [[H559]] Come up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] us, and we will shew [[H3045]] you a thing. [[H1697]] And Jonathan [[H3129]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his armourbearer, [[H5375]] Come up [[H5927]] after [[H310]] me: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 13
And Jonathan [[H3129]] climbed up [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] his hands [[H3027]] and upon [[H5921]] his feet, [[H7272]] and his armourbearer [[H5375]] after [[H310]] him: and they fell [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] Jonathan; [[H3129]] and his armourbearer [[H5375]] slew [[H4191]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 14
And that first [[H7223]] slaughter, [[H4347]] which [[H834]] Jonathan [[H3129]] and his armourbearer [[H5375]] made, [[H5221]] was [[H1961]] about twenty [[H6242]] men, [[H376]] within as it were an half [[H2677]] acre [[H4618]] of land, [[H7704]] a yoke [[H6776]]

### 15
And there was [[H1961]] trembling [[H2731]] in the host, [[H4264]] in the field, [[H7704]] and among all [[H3605]] the people: [[H5971]] the garrison, [[H4673]] and the spoilers, [[H7843]] they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] trembled, [[H2729]] and the earth [[H776]] quaked: [[H7264]] so it was [[H1961]] a very great [[H430]] trembling. [[H2731]]

### 16
And the watchmen [[H6822]] of Saul [[H7586]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] looked; [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the multitude [[H1995]] melted away, [[H4127]] and they went [[H1980]] on beating down [[H1986]]

### 17
Then said [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] unto the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, Number [[H6485]] now, [[H4994]] and see [[H7200]] who [[H4310]] is gone [[H1980]] from [[H5973]] us. And when they had numbered, [[H6485]] behold, [[H2009]] Jonathan [[H3129]] and his armourbearer [[H5375]] not [[H369]]

### 18
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto Ahiah, [[H281]] Bring hither [[H5066]] the ark [[H727]] of God. [[H430]] For [[H3588]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] with the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 19
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] while [[H5704]] Saul [[H7586]] talked [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] that the noise [[H1995]] that [[H834]] in the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] went [[H3212]] on [[H1980]] and increased: [[H7227]] and Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] Withdraw [[H622]] thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 20
And Saul [[H7586]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him assembled themselves, [[H2199]] and they came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the battle: [[H4421]] and, behold, [[H2009]] every man's [[H376]] sword [[H2719]] was [[H1961]] against his fellow, [[H7453]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] discomfiture. [[H4103]]

### 21
Moreover the Hebrews [[H5680]] were [[H1961]] with the Philistines [[H6430]] before [[H865]] that time, [[H8032]] which [[H834]] went up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] them into the camp [[H4264]] round about, [[H5439]] even they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] to be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] the Israelites [[H3478]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan. [[H3129]]

### 22
Likewise all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] which had hid themselves [[H2244]] in mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] they heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the Philistines [[H6430]] fled, [[H5127]] even they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] followed hard [[H1692]] after [[H310]] them in the battle. [[H4421]]

### 23
So the Lord [[H3068]] saved [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] and the battle [[H4421]] passed over [[H5674]] unto Beth-aven. [[H1007]]

### 24
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] were distressed [[H5065]] that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] for Saul [[H7586]] had adjured [[H422]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Cursed [[H779]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] eateth [[H398]] food [[H3899]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] that I may be avenged [[H5358]] on mine enemies. [[H341]] So none [[H3808]] of the people [[H5971]] tasted [[H2938]] food. [[H3899]]

### 25
And all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] came [[H935]] to a wood; [[H3293]] and there was [[H1961]] honey [[H1706]] upon [[H6440]] the ground. [[H7704]]

### 26
And when the people [[H5971]] were come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the wood, [[H3293]] behold, [[H2009]] the honey [[H1706]] dropped; [[H1982]] but no [[H369]] man put [[H5381]] his hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] his mouth: [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] feared [[H3372]] the oath. [[H7621]]

### 27
But Jonathan [[H3129]] heard [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] when his father [[H1]] charged [[H7650]] the people [[H5971]]  with the oath: [[H853]] wherefore he put forth [[H7971]] the end [[H7097]] of the rod [[H4294]] that [[H834]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and dipped [[H2881]] it [[H853]] in an honeycomb, [[H3295]] and put [[H7725]] his hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] his mouth; [[H6310]] and his eyes [[H5869]] were enlightened. [[H215]]

### 28
Then answered [[H6030]] one [[H376]] of the people, [[H5971]] and said, [[H559]] Thy father [[H1]] straitly charged [[H7650]] the people [[H5971]] with an oath, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] Cursed [[H779]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] eateth [[H398]] food [[H3899]] this day. [[H3117]] And the people [[H5971]] were faint. [[H5774]]

### 29
Then said [[H559]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] My father [[H1]] hath troubled [[H5916]] the land: [[H776]] see, [[H7200]] I pray you, [[H4994]] how [[H3588]] mine eyes [[H5869]] have been enlightened, [[H215]] because [[H3588]] I tasted [[H2938]] a little [[H4592]] of this [[H2088]] honey. [[H1706]]

### 30
How much more, [[H637]] if haply [[H3863]] the people [[H5971]] had eaten [[H398]] freely [[H398]] to day [[H3117]] of the spoil [[H7998]] of their enemies [[H341]] which [[H834]] they found? [[H4672]] for had there not [[H3808]] been now [[H6258]] a much greater [[H7235]] slaughter [[H4347]] among the Philistines? [[H6430]]

### 31
And they smote [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H6430]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] from Michmash [[H4363]] to Aijalon: [[H357]] and the people [[H5971]] were very [[H3966]] faint. [[H5774]]

### 32
And the people [[H5971]] flew [[H6213]] upon [[H413]] the spoil, [[H7998]] and took [[H3947]] sheep, [[H6629]] and oxen, [[H1241]] and calves, [[H1121]] and slew [[H7819]] on the ground: [[H776]] and the people [[H5971]] did eat [[H398]] with [[H5921]] the blood. [[H1818]]

### 33
Then they told [[H5046]] Saul, [[H7586]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the people [[H5971]] sin [[H2398]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] in that they eat [[H398]] with [[H5921]] the blood. [[H1818]] And he said, [[H559]] Ye have transgressed: [[H898]] roll [[H1556]] a great [[H1419]] stone [[H68]] unto [[H413]] me this day. [[H3117]]

### 34
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Disperse yourselves [[H6327]] among the people, [[H5971]] and say [[H559]] unto them, Bring me hither [[H5066]] every man [[H376]] his ox, [[H7794]] and every man [[H376]] his sheep, [[H7716]] and slay [[H7819]] here, [[H2088]] and eat; [[H398]] and sin [[H2398]] not [[H3808]] against the Lord [[H3068]] in eating [[H398]] with [[H413]] the blood. [[H1818]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] brought [[H5066]] every man [[H376]] his ox [[H7794]] with him [[H3027]] that night, [[H3915]] and slew [[H7819]] there. [[H8033]]

### 35
And Saul [[H7586]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] the same was the first [[H2490]] altar [[H4196]] that he built [[H1129]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 36
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Let us go down [[H3381]] after [[H310]] the Philistines [[H6430]] by night, [[H3915]] and spoil [[H962]] them until [[H5704]] the morning [[H1242]] light, [[H216]] and let us not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] a man [[H376]] of them. And they said, [[H559]] Do [[H6213]] whatsoever [[H3605]] seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] unto thee. Then said [[H559]] the priest, [[H3548]] Let us draw near [[H7126]] hither [[H1988]] unto [[H413]] God. [[H430]]

### 37
And Saul [[H7586]] asked counsel [[H7592]] of God, [[H430]] Shall I go down [[H3381]] after [[H310]] the Philistines? [[H6430]] wilt thou deliver [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel? [[H3478]] But he answered [[H6030]] him not [[H3808]] that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

### 38
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Draw ye near [[H5066]] hither, [[H1988]] all [[H3605]] the chief [[H6438]] of the people: [[H5971]] and know [[H3045]] and see [[H7200]] wherein [[H4100]] this sin [[H2403]] hath been [[H1961]] this [[H2063]] day. [[H3117]]

### 39
For, [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] which saveth [[H3467]] Israel, [[H3478]] though [[H3588]] it be [[H3426]] in Jonathan [[H3129]] my son, [[H1121]] he shall surely [[H4191]] die. [[H4191]] But not a man [[H369]] among all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] answered [[H6030]] him. [[H6030]]

### 40
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] Be [[H1961]] ye [[H859]] on one [[H259]] side, [[H5676]] and I [[H589]] and Jonathan [[H3129]] my son [[H1121]] will be [[H1961]] on the other [[H259]] side. [[H5676]] And the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Do [[H6213]] what seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] unto thee. [[H2896]]

### 41
Therefore Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Give [[H3051]] a perfect [[H8549]] And Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3129]] were taken: [[H3920]] but the people [[H5971]] escaped. [[H3318]]

### 42
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Cast [[H5307]] between [[H996]] me and Jonathan [[H3129]] my son. [[H1121]] And Jonathan [[H3129]] was taken. [[H3920]]

### 43
Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] Tell [[H5046]] me what [[H4100]] thou hast done. [[H6213]] And Jonathan [[H3129]] told [[H5046]] him, and said, [[H559]] I did but [[H2938]] taste [[H2938]] a little [[H4592]] honey [[H1706]] with the end [[H7097]] of the rod [[H4294]] that [[H834]] in mine hand, [[H3027]] lo, [[H2005]] I must die. [[H4191]]

### 44
And Saul [[H7586]] answered, [[H559]] God [[H430]] do so [[H6213]] and more also: [[H3254]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die, [[H4191]] Jonathan. [[H3129]]

### 45
And the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Shall Jonathan [[H3129]] die, [[H4191]] who [[H834]] hath wrought [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] salvation [[H3444]] in Israel? [[H3478]] God forbid: [[H2486]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] there shall not [[H518]] one hair [[H8185]] of his head [[H7218]] fall [[H5307]] to the ground; [[H776]] for [[H3588]] he hath wrought [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] God [[H430]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] So the people [[H5971]] rescued [[H6299]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] that he died [[H4191]] not. [[H3808]]

### 46
Then Saul [[H7586]] went up [[H5927]] from following [[H310]] the Philistines: [[H6430]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] went [[H1980]] to their own place. [[H4725]]

### 47
So Saul [[H7586]] took [[H3920]] the kingdom [[H4410]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and fought [[H3898]] against all [[H3605]] his enemies [[H341]] on every side, [[H5439]] against Moab, [[H4124]] and against the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and against Edom, [[H123]] and against the kings [[H4428]] of Zobah, [[H6678]] and against the Philistines: [[H6430]] and whithersoever [[H3605]] he turned [[H6437]] himself, he vexed [[H7561]]

### 48
And he gathered [[H6213]] an host, [[H2428]] and smote [[H5221]] the Amalekites, [[H6002]] and delivered [[H5337]] Israel [[H3478]] out of the hands [[H3027]] of them that spoiled [[H8154]] them. [[H8154]]

### 49
Now the sons [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] were [[H1961]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] and Ishui, [[H3440]] and Melchi-shua: [[H4444]] and the names [[H8034]] of his two [[H8147]] daughters [[H1323]] the name [[H8034]] of the firstborn [[H1067]] Merab, [[H4764]] and the name [[H8034]] of the younger [[H6996]] Michal: [[H4324]]

### 50
And the name [[H8034]] of Saul's [[H7586]] wife [[H802]] Ahinoam, [[H293]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Ahimaaz: [[H290]] and the name [[H8034]] of the captain [[H8269]] of his host [[H6635]] Abner, [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] Saul's [[H7586]] uncle. [[H1730]]

### 51
And Kish [[H7027]] the father [[H1]] of Saul; [[H7586]] and Ner [[H5369]] the father [[H1]] of Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Abiel. [[H22]]

### 52
And there was [[H1961]] sore [[H2389]] war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] the Philistines [[H6430]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Saul: [[H7586]] and when Saul [[H7586]] saw [[H7200]] any [[H3605]] strong [[H1368]] man, [[H376]] or any [[H3605]] valiant [[H2428]] man, [[H1121]] he took [[H622]] him unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]
