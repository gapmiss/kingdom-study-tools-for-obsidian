### 1
Then they told [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the Philistines [[H6430]] fight [[H3898]] against Keilah, [[H7084]] and they [[H1992]] rob [[H8154]] the threshingfloors. [[H1637]]

### 2
Therefore David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Shall I go [[H1980]] and smite [[H5221]] these [[H428]] Philistines? [[H6430]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Go, [[H1980]] and smite [[H5221]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and save [[H3467]] Keilah. [[H7084]]

### 3
And David's [[H1732]] men [[H376]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] be afraid [[H3372]] here [[H6311]] in Judah: [[H3063]] how much [[H637]] more then if [[H3588]] we come [[H1980]] to Keilah [[H7084]] against [[H413]] the armies [[H4634]] of the Philistines? [[H6430]]

### 4
Then David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord [[H3068]] yet [[H5750]] again. [[H3254]] And the Lord [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] him and said, [[H559]] Arise, [[H6965]] go down [[H3381]] to Keilah; [[H7084]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will deliver [[H5414]] the Philistines [[H6430]] into thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 5
So David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] to Keilah, [[H7084]] and fought [[H3898]] with the Philistines, [[H6430]] and brought away [[H5090]] their cattle, [[H4735]] and smote [[H5221]] them with a great [[H1419]] slaughter. [[H4347]] So David [[H1732]] saved [[H3467]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Keilah. [[H7084]]

### 6
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Abiathar [[H54]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahimelech [[H288]] fled [[H1272]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] to Keilah, [[H7084]] he came down [[H3381]] an ephod [[H646]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 7
And it was told [[H5046]] Saul [[H7586]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] was come [[H935]] to Keilah. [[H7084]] And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] hath delivered [[H5234]] him into mine hand; [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] he is shut in, [[H5462]] by entering [[H935]] into a town [[H5892]] that hath gates [[H1817]] and bars. [[H1280]]

### 8
And Saul [[H7586]] called together [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] to war, [[H4421]] to go down [[H3381]] to Keilah, [[H7084]] to besiege [[H6696]] David [[H1732]] and his men. [[H376]]

### 9
And David [[H1732]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] secretly practised [[H2790]] mischief [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] him; and he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abiathar [[H54]] the priest, [[H3548]] Bring hither [[H5066]] the ephod. [[H646]]

### 10
Then said [[H559]] David, [[H1732]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] thy servant [[H5650]] hath certainly [[H8085]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] seeketh [[H1245]] to come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Keilah, [[H7084]] to destroy [[H7843]] the city [[H5892]] for my sake. [[H5668]]

### 11
Will the men [[H1167]] of Keilah [[H7084]] deliver me up [[H5462]] into his hand? [[H3027]] will Saul [[H7586]] come down, [[H3381]] as [[H834]] thy servant [[H5650]] hath heard? [[H8085]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] tell [[H5046]] thy servant. [[H5650]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] He will come down. [[H3381]]

### 12
Then said [[H559]] David, [[H1732]] Will the men [[H1167]] of Keilah [[H7084]] deliver [[H5462]] me and my men [[H376]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Saul? [[H7586]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] They will deliver up. [[H5462]]

### 13
Then David [[H1732]] and his men, [[H376]] about six [[H8337]] hundred, [[H3967]] arose [[H6965]] and departed [[H3318]] out of Keilah, [[H7084]] and went [[H1980]] whithersoever [[H834]] they could go. [[H1980]] And it was told [[H5046]] Saul [[H7586]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] was escaped [[H4422]] from Keilah; [[H7084]] and he forbare [[H2308]] to go forth. [[H3318]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] abode [[H3427]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] in strong holds, [[H4679]] and remained [[H3427]] in a mountain [[H2022]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Ziph. [[H2128]] And Saul [[H7586]] sought [[H1245]] him every [[H3605]] day, [[H3117]] but God [[H430]] delivered [[H5414]] him not [[H3808]] into his hand. [[H3027]]

### 15
And David [[H1732]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] was come out [[H3318]] to seek [[H1245]] his life: [[H5315]] and David [[H1732]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Ziph [[H2128]] in a wood. [[H2793]]

### 16
And Jonathan [[H3083]] Saul's [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] into the wood, [[H2793]] and strengthened [[H2388]] his hand [[H3027]] in God. [[H430]]

### 17
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of Saul [[H7586]] my father [[H1]] shall not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] thee; and thou [[H859]] shalt be king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and I [[H595]] shall be [[H1961]] next [[H4932]] unto thee; and that [[H3651]] also [[H1571]] Saul [[H7586]] my father [[H1]] knoweth. [[H3045]]

### 18
And they two [[H8147]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and David [[H1732]] abode [[H3427]] in the wood, [[H2793]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] went [[H1980]] to his house. [[H1004]]

### 19
Then came up [[H5927]] the Ziphites [[H2130]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] to Gibeah, [[H1390]] saying, [[H559]] Doth not [[H3808]] David [[H1732]] hide himself [[H5641]] with [[H5973]] us in strong holds [[H4679]] in the wood, [[H2793]] in the hill [[H1389]] of Hachilah, [[H2444]] which [[H834]] on the south [[H3225]] of Jeshimon? [[H3452]]

### 20
Now [[H6258]] therefore, O king, [[H4428]] come down [[H3381]] according to all [[H3605]] the desire [[H185]] of thy soul [[H5315]] to come down; [[H3381]] and our part to deliver [[H5462]] him into the king's [[H4428]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 21
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] ye [[H859]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] ye have compassion [[H2550]] on [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 22
Go, [[H1980]] I pray you, [[H4994]] prepare [[H3559]] yet, [[H5750]] and know [[H3045]] and see [[H7200]] his place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] his haunt [[H7272]] is, [[H1961]] who [[H4310]] hath seen [[H7200]] him there: [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] it is told me [[H559]] he [[H1931]] very [[H6191]] dealeth subtilly. [[H6196]]

### 23
See [[H7200]] therefore, and take knowledge [[H3045]] of all [[H3605]] the lurking places [[H4224]] where [[H834]] he hideth himself, [[H2244]] and come ye again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] me with [[H413]] the certainty, [[H3559]] and I will go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] you: and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] he be [[H3426]] in the land, [[H776]] that I will search [[H2664]]  him out [[H853]] throughout all [[H3605]] the thousands [[H505]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 24
And they arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Ziph [[H2128]] before [[H6440]] Saul: [[H7586]] but David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Maon, [[H4584]] in the plain [[H6160]] on [[H413]] the south [[H3225]] of Jeshimon. [[H3452]]

### 25
Saul [[H7586]] also and his men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] to seek [[H1245]] And they told [[H5046]] David: [[H1732]] wherefore he came down [[H3381]] into a rock, [[H5553]] and abode [[H3427]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Maon. [[H4584]] And when Saul [[H7586]] heard [[H8085]] he pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] David [[H1732]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Maon. [[H4584]]

### 26
And Saul [[H7586]] went [[H1980]] on this side [[H6654]] of the mountain, [[H2022]] and David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] on that side [[H6654]] of the mountain: [[H2022]] and David [[H1732]] made haste [[H2648]] to get away [[H1980]] for fear [[H6440]] of Saul; [[H7586]] for Saul [[H7586]] and his men [[H376]] compassed about [[H5849]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] round to take [[H8610]] them. [[H8610]]

### 27
But there came [[H935]] a messenger [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] saying, [[H559]] Haste [[H4116]] thee, and come; [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] the Philistines [[H6430]] have invaded [[H6584]] the land. [[H776]]

### 28
Wherefore Saul [[H7586]] returned [[H7725]] from pursuing [[H7291]] after [[H310]] David, [[H1732]] and went [[H1980]] against [[H7125]] the Philistines: [[H6430]] therefore [[H5921]] they called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Sela-hammahlekoth. [[H5555]]

### 29
And David [[H1732]] went up [[H5927]] from thence, [[H8033]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in strong holds [[H4679]] at En-gedi. [[H5872]]
