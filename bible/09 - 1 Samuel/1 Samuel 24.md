### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] was returned [[H7725]] from following [[H310]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] that it was told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] David [[H1732]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of En-gedi. [[H5872]]

### 2
Then Saul [[H7586]] took [[H3947]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] chosen [[H977]] men [[H376]] out of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and went [[H1980]] to seek [[H1245]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] upon [[H6440]] the rocks [[H6697]] of the wild goats. [[H3277]]

### 3
And he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the sheepcotes [[H1448]] by [[H5921]] the way, [[H1870]] where [[H8033]] a cave; [[H4631]] and Saul [[H7586]] went in [[H935]] to cover [[H5526]] his feet: [[H7272]] and David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] remained [[H3427]] in the sides [[H3411]] of the cave. [[H4631]]

### 4
And the men [[H376]] of David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] of which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will deliver [[H5414]] thine enemy [[H341]] into thine hand, [[H3027]] that thou mayest do [[H6213]] to him as [[H834]] it shall seem good [[H3190]] unto thee. [[H5869]] Then David [[H1732]] arose, [[H6965]] and cut off [[H3772]] the skirt [[H3671]] of Saul's [[H7586]] robe [[H4598]] privily. [[H3909]]

### 5
And it came to pass [[H1961]] afterward, [[H310]] that David's [[H1732]] heart [[H3820]] smote [[H5221]] him, because [[H5921]] he had cut off [[H3772]] Saul's [[H7586]] skirt. [[H3671]]

### 6
And he said [[H559]] unto his men, [[H582]] The Lord [[H3068]] forbid [[H2486]] that [[H518]] I should do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] unto my master, [[H113]] the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed, [[H4899]] to stretch forth [[H7971]] mine hand [[H3027]] against him, seeing [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the anointed [[H4899]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
So David [[H1732]] stayed [[H8156]] his servants [[H376]] with these words, [[H1697]] and suffered [[H5414]] them not [[H3808]] to rise [[H6965]] against [[H413]] Saul. [[H7586]] But Saul [[H7586]] rose up [[H6965]] out of the cave, [[H4631]] and went [[H1980]] on way. [[H1870]]

### 8
David [[H1732]] also arose [[H6965]] afterward, [[H310]] and went out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the cave, [[H4631]] and cried [[H7121]] after [[H310]] Saul, [[H7586]] saying, [[H559]] My lord [[H113]] the king. [[H4428]] And when Saul [[H7586]] looked [[H5027]] behind [[H310]] him, David [[H1732]] stooped [[H6915]] with his face [[H639]] to the earth, [[H776]] and bowed himself. [[H7812]]

### 9
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Saul, [[H7586]] Wherefore [[H4100]] hearest [[H8085]]  thou [[H853]] men's [[H120]] words, [[H1697]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] David [[H1732]] seeketh [[H1245]] thy hurt? [[H7451]]

### 10
Behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] thine eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] how [[H834]] that the Lord [[H3068]] had delivered [[H5414]] thee to day [[H3117]] into mine hand [[H3027]] in the cave: [[H4631]] and bade [[H559]] kill [[H2026]] thee: but spared [[H2347]] thee; and I said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] put forth [[H7971]] mine hand [[H3027]] against my lord; [[H113]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed. [[H4899]]

### 11
Moreover, my father, [[H1]] see, [[H7200]] yea, [[H1571]] see [[H7200]] the skirt [[H3671]] of thy robe [[H4598]] in my hand: [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] in that I cut off [[H3772]] the skirt [[H3671]] of thy robe, [[H4598]] and killed [[H2026]] thee not, [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] thou and see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] neither [[H369]] evil [[H7451]] nor transgression [[H6588]] in mine hand, [[H3027]] and I have not [[H3808]] sinned [[H2398]] against thee; yet thou [[H859]] huntest [[H6658]] my soul [[H5315]] to take [[H3947]] it. [[H3947]]

### 12
The Lord [[H3068]] judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] me and thee, and the Lord [[H3068]] avenge [[H5358]] me of [[H4480]] thee: but mine hand [[H3027]] shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] upon thee. [[H1961]]

### 13
As [[H834]] saith [[H559]] the proverb [[H4912]] of the ancients, [[H6931]] Wickedness [[H7562]] proceedeth [[H3318]] from the wicked: [[H7563]] but mine hand [[H3027]] shall not [[H3808]] be upon thee. [[H1961]]

### 14
After [[H310]] whom [[H4310]] is the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] come out? [[H3318]] after [[H310]] whom [[H4310]] dost thou [[H859]] pursue? [[H7291]] after [[H310]] a dead [[H4191]] dog, [[H3611]] after [[H310]] a [[H259]] flea. [[H6550]]

### 15
The Lord [[H3068]] therefore be [[H1961]] judge, [[H1781]] and judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] me and thee, and see, [[H7200]] and plead [[H7378]] my cause, [[H7379]] and deliver [[H8199]] me out of thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 16
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when David [[H1732]] had made an end [[H3615]] of speaking [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] that Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] this [[H2088]] thy voice, [[H6963]] my son [[H1121]] David? [[H1732]] And Saul [[H7586]] lifted up [[H5375]] his voice, [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 17
And he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Thou [[H859]] more righteous [[H6662]] than [[H4480]] I: for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast rewarded [[H1580]] me good, [[H2896]] whereas I [[H589]] have rewarded [[H1580]] thee evil. [[H7451]]

### 18
And thou [[H859]] hast shewed [[H5046]] this day [[H3117]] how that [[H834]] thou hast dealt [[H6213]] well [[H2896]] with [[H854]]  me: [[H853]] forasmuch as when [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had delivered [[H5462]] me into thine hand, [[H3027]] thou killedst [[H2026]] me not. [[H3808]]

### 19
For if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] find [[H4672]] his enemy, [[H341]] will he let him go [[H7971]] well [[H2896]] away? [[H1870]] wherefore the Lord [[H3068]] reward [[H7999]] thee good [[H2896]] for [[H8478]] that [[H834]] thou hast done [[H6213]] unto me this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 20
And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] I know well [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou shalt surely [[H4427]] be king, [[H4427]] and that the kingdom [[H4467]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall be established [[H6965]] in thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 21
Swear [[H7650]] now [[H6258]] therefore unto me by the Lord, [[H3068]] that thou wilt not [[H518]] cut off [[H3772]] my seed [[H2233]] after me, [[H310]] and that thou wilt not [[H518]] destroy [[H8045]] my name [[H8034]] out of my father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 22
And David [[H1732]] sware [[H7650]] unto Saul. [[H7586]] And Saul [[H7586]] went [[H1980]] home; [[H1004]] but David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] gat them up [[H5927]] unto [[H5921]] the hold. [[H4686]]
