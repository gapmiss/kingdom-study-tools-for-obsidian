### 1
And Hannah [[H2584]] prayed, [[H6419]] and said, [[H559]] My heart [[H3820]] rejoiceth [[H5970]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] mine horn [[H7161]] is exalted [[H7311]] in the Lord: [[H3068]] my mouth [[H6310]] is enlarged [[H7337]] over [[H5921]] mine enemies; [[H341]] because [[H3588]] I rejoice [[H8055]] in thy salvation. [[H3444]]

### 2
none [[H369]] holy [[H6918]] as the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] none [[H369]] beside [[H1115]] thee: neither [[H369]] any rock [[H6697]] like our God. [[H430]]

### 3
Talk [[H1696]] no [[H408]] more [[H7235]] so exceeding [[H1364]] proudly; [[H1364]] let arrogancy [[H6277]] come out [[H3318]] of your mouth: [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] a God [[H410]] of knowledge, [[H1844]] and by him actions [[H5949]] are weighed. [[H8505]]

### 4
The bows [[H7198]] of the mighty men [[H1368]] broken, [[H2844]] and they that stumbled [[H3782]] are girded [[H247]] with strength. [[H2428]]

### 5
full [[H7649]] have hired out themselves [[H7936]] for bread; [[H3899]] and hungry [[H7457]] ceased: [[H2308]] so that [[H5704]] the barren [[H6135]] hath born [[H3205]] seven; [[H7651]] and she that hath many [[H7227]] children [[H1121]] is waxed feeble. [[H535]]

### 6
The Lord [[H3068]] killeth, [[H4191]] and maketh alive: [[H2421]] he bringeth down [[H3381]] to the grave, [[H7585]] and bringeth up. [[H5927]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] maketh poor, [[H3423]] and maketh rich: [[H6238]] he bringeth low, [[H8213]] and [[H637]] lifteth up. [[H7311]]

### 8
He raiseth up [[H6965]] the poor [[H1800]] out of the dust, [[H6083]] lifteth up [[H7311]] the beggar [[H34]] from the dunghill, [[H830]] to set [[H3427]] among [[H5973]] princes, [[H5081]] and to make them inherit [[H5157]] the throne [[H3678]] of glory: [[H3519]] for [[H3588]] the pillars [[H4690]] of the earth [[H776]] the Lord's, [[H3068]] and he hath set [[H7896]] the world [[H8398]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 9
He will keep [[H8104]] the feet [[H7272]] of his saints, [[H2623]] and the wicked [[H7563]] shall be silent [[H1826]] in darkness; [[H2822]] for [[H3588]] by strength [[H3581]] shall no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] prevail. [[H1396]]

### 10
The adversaries [[H7378]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be broken to pieces; [[H2865]] out of heaven [[H8064]] shall he thunder [[H7481]] upon [[H5921]] them: the Lord [[H3068]] shall judge [[H1777]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth; [[H776]] and he shall give [[H5414]] strength [[H5797]] unto his king, [[H4428]] and exalt [[H7311]] the horn [[H7161]] of his anointed. [[H4899]]

### 11
And Elkanah [[H511]] went [[H1980]] to Ramah [[H7414]] to [[H5921]] his house. [[H1004]] And the child [[H5288]] did [[H1961]] minister [[H8334]]  unto [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] Eli [[H5941]] the priest. [[H3548]]

### 12
Now the sons [[H1121]] of Eli [[H5941]] sons [[H1121]] of Belial; [[H1100]] they knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And the priests' [[H3548]] custom [[H4941]] with [[H854]] the people [[H5971]] when any [[H3605]] man [[H376]] offered [[H2076]] sacrifice, [[H2077]] the priest's [[H3548]] servant [[H5288]] came, [[H935]] while the flesh [[H1320]] was in seething, [[H1310]] with a fleshhook [[H4207]] of three [[H7969]] teeth [[H8127]] in his hand; [[H3027]]

### 14
And he struck [[H5221]] into the pan, [[H3595]] or [[H176]] kettle, [[H1731]] or [[H176]] caldron, [[H7037]] or [[H176]] pot; [[H6517]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the fleshhook [[H4207]] brought up [[H5927]] the priest [[H3548]] took [[H3947]] for himself. So [[H3602]] they did [[H6213]] in Shiloh [[H7887]] unto all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] that came [[H935]] thither. [[H8033]]

### 15
Also [[H1571]] before [[H2962]] they burnt [[H6999]] the fat, [[H2459]] the priest's [[H3548]] servant [[H5288]] came, [[H935]] and said [[H559]] to the man [[H376]] that sacrificed, [[H2076]] Give [[H5414]] flesh [[H1320]] to roast [[H6740]] for the priest; [[H3548]] for he will not [[H3808]] have [[H3947]] sodden [[H1310]] flesh [[H1320]] of [[H4480]] thee, but [[H3588]] raw. [[H2416]]

### 16
And any man [[H376]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Let them not fail [[H6999]] to burn [[H6999]] the fat [[H2459]] presently, [[H3117]] and take [[H3947]] as [[H834]] thy soul [[H5315]] desireth; [[H8378]] then he would answer [[H559]] him, but [[H3588]] thou shalt give [[H5414]] now: [[H6258]] and if [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] I will take [[H3947]] by force. [[H2394]]

### 17
Wherefore the sin [[H2403]] of the young men [[H5288]] was [[H1961]] very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] men [[H582]] abhorred [[H5006]] the offering [[H4503]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
But Samuel [[H8050]] ministered [[H8334]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] a child, [[H5288]] girded [[H2296]] with a linen [[H906]] ephod. [[H646]]

### 19
Moreover his mother [[H517]] made [[H6213]] him a little [[H6996]] coat, [[H4598]] and brought [[H5927]] to him from year [[H3117]] to year, [[H3117]] when she came up [[H5927]] with [[H854]] her husband [[H376]] to offer [[H2076]] the yearly [[H3117]] sacrifice. [[H2077]]

### 20
And Eli [[H5941]] blessed [[H1288]] Elkanah [[H511]] and his wife, [[H802]] and said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] give [[H7760]] thee seed [[H2233]] of [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] woman [[H802]] for [[H8478]] the loan [[H7596]] which [[H834]] is lent [[H7592]] to the Lord. [[H3068]] And they went [[H1980]] unto their own home. [[H4725]]

### 21
And [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] visited [[H6485]] Hannah, [[H2584]] so that she conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] and two [[H8147]] daughters. [[H1323]] And the child [[H5288]] Samuel [[H8050]] grew [[H1431]] before [[H5973]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
Now Eli [[H5941]] was very [[H3966]] old, [[H2204]] and heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] his sons [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] unto all [[H3605]] Israel; [[H3478]] and how [[H834]] they lay [[H7901]] with [[H854]] the women [[H802]] that assembled [[H6633]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 23
And he said [[H559]] unto them, Why [[H4100]] do [[H6213]] ye such [[H428]] things? [[H1697]] for [[H834]] I [[H595]] hear [[H8085]]  of [[H853]] your evil [[H7451]] dealings [[H1697]] by [[H853]] all [[H3605]] this [[H428]] people. [[H5971]]

### 24
Nay, [[H408]] my sons; [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] report [[H8052]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] hear: [[H8085]] ye make the Lord's [[H3068]] people [[H5971]] to transgress. [[H5674]]

### 25
If [[H518]] one man [[H376]] sin [[H2398]] against another, [[H376]] the judge [[H430]] shall judge [[H6419]] him: but if [[H518]] a man [[H376]] sin [[H2398]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H4310]] shall intreat [[H6419]] for him? Notwithstanding [[H3808]] they hearkened [[H8085]] not unto the voice [[H6963]] of their father, [[H1]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] would [[H2654]] slay [[H4191]] them. [[H4191]]

### 26
And the child [[H5288]] Samuel [[H8050]] grew [[H1432]] on, [[H1980]] and was in favour [[H2896]] both [[H1571]] with [[H5973]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and also [[H1571]] with [[H5973]] men. [[H376]]

### 27
And there came [[H935]] a man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] unto [[H413]] Eli, [[H5941]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Did I plainly [[H1540]] appear [[H1540]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of thy father, [[H1]] when they were [[H1961]] in Egypt [[H4714]] in Pharaoh's [[H6547]] house? [[H1004]]

### 28
And did I choose [[H977]] him out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] my priest, [[H3548]] to offer [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] mine altar, [[H4196]] to burn [[H6999]] incense, [[H7004]] to wear [[H5375]] an ephod [[H646]] before [[H6440]] me? and did I give [[H5414]] unto the house [[H1004]] of thy father [[H1]] all [[H3605]] the offerings made by fire [[H801]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 29
Wherefore [[H4100]] kick [[H1163]] ye at my sacrifice [[H2077]] and at mine offering, [[H4503]] which [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] habitation; [[H4583]] and honourest [[H3513]] thy sons [[H1121]] above [[H4480]] me, to make yourselves fat [[H1254]] with the chiefest [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] the offerings [[H4503]] of Israel [[H3478]] my people? [[H5971]]

### 30
Wherefore [[H3651]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] saith, [[H5002]] I said [[H559]] indeed [[H559]] thy house, [[H1004]] and the house [[H1004]] of thy father, [[H1]] should walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] me for [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]] but now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] saith, [[H5002]] Be it far [[H2486]] from me; for [[H3588]] them that honour [[H3513]] me I will honour, [[H3513]] and they that despise [[H959]] me shall be lightly esteemed. [[H7043]]

### 31
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] that I will cut off [[H1438]] thine arm, [[H2220]] and the arm [[H2220]] of thy father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] that there shall not be [[H1961]] an old man [[H2205]] in thine house. [[H1004]]

### 32
And thou shalt see [[H5027]] an enemy [[H6862]] habitation, [[H4583]] in all [[H3605]] which [[H834]] shall give [[H3190]] Israel: [[H3478]] and there shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] an old man [[H2205]] in thine house [[H1004]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 33
And the man [[H376]] of thine, I shall not [[H3808]] cut off [[H3772]] from [[H5973]] mine altar, [[H4196]] to consume [[H3615]] thine eyes, [[H5869]] and to grieve [[H109]] thine heart: [[H5315]] and all [[H3605]] the increase [[H4768]] of thine house [[H1004]] shall die [[H4191]] in the flower of their age. [[H376]]

### 34
And this [[H2088]] a sign [[H226]] unto thee, that [[H834]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] thy two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] on [[H413]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas; [[H6372]] in one [[H259]] day [[H3117]] they shall die [[H4191]] both [[H8147]] of them. [[H8147]]

### 35
And I will raise me up [[H6965]] a faithful [[H539]] priest, [[H3548]] shall do [[H6213]] according to which [[H834]] in mine heart [[H3824]] and in my mind: [[H5315]] and I will build [[H1129]] him a sure [[H539]] house; [[H1004]] and he shall walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] mine anointed [[H4899]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 36
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] every one [[H3605]] that is left [[H3498]] in thine house [[H1004]] shall come [[H935]] crouch [[H7812]] to him for a piece [[H95]] of silver [[H3701]] and a morsel [[H3603]] of bread, [[H3899]] and shall say, [[H559]] Put [[H5596]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] into [[H413]] one [[H259]] of the priests' offices, [[H3550]] that I may eat [[H398]] a piece [[H6595]] of bread. [[H3899]]
