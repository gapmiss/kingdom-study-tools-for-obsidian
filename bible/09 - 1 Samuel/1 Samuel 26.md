### 1
And the Ziphites [[H2130]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] to Gibeah, [[H1390]] saying, [[H559]] Doth not [[H3808]] David [[H1732]] hide himself [[H5641]] in the hill [[H1389]] of Hachilah, [[H2444]] before [[H6440]] Jeshimon? [[H3452]]

### 2
Then Saul [[H7586]] arose, [[H6965]] and went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the wilderness [[H4057]] of Ziph, [[H2128]] having three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] chosen [[H977]] men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] with [[H854]] him, to seek [[H1245]] David [[H1732]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Ziph. [[H2128]]

### 3
And Saul [[H7586]] pitched [[H2583]] in the hill [[H1389]] of Hachilah, [[H2444]] which [[H834]] before [[H6440]] Jeshimon, [[H3452]] by [[H5921]] the way. [[H1870]] But David [[H1732]] abode [[H3427]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and he saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] came [[H935]] after [[H310]] him into the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 4
David [[H1732]] therefore sent out [[H7971]] spies, [[H7270]] and understood [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] was come in [[H935]] very deed. [[H3559]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] arose, [[H6965]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] had pitched: [[H2583]] and David [[H1732]] beheld [[H7200]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] lay, [[H7901]] and Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] the captain [[H8269]] of his host: [[H6635]] and Saul [[H7586]] lay [[H7901]] in the trench, [[H4570]] and the people [[H5971]] pitched [[H2583]] round about [[H5439]] him. [[H5439]]

### 6
Then answered [[H6030]] David [[H1732]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahimelech [[H288]] the Hittite, [[H2850]] and to [[H413]] Abishai [[H52]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] brother [[H251]] to Joab, [[H3097]] saying, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] will go down [[H3381]] with [[H854]] me to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] to [[H413]] the camp? [[H4264]] And Abishai [[H52]] said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] will go down [[H3381]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 7
So David [[H1732]] and Abishai [[H52]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] by night: [[H3915]] and, behold, [[H2009]] Saul [[H7586]] lay [[H7901]] sleeping [[H3463]] within the trench, [[H4570]] and his spear [[H2595]] stuck [[H4600]] in the ground [[H776]] at his bolster: [[H4763]] but Abner [[H74]] and the people [[H5971]] lay [[H7901]] round about [[H5439]] him. [[H5439]]

### 8
Then said [[H559]] Abishai [[H52]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] God [[H430]] hath delivered [[H5462]] thine enemy [[H341]] into thine hand [[H3027]] this day: [[H3117]] now [[H6258]] therefore let me smite [[H5221]] him, I pray thee, [[H4994]] with the spear [[H2595]] even to the earth [[H776]] at once, [[H6471]] and I will not [[H3808]] him the second time. [[H8138]]

### 9
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abishai, [[H52]] Destroy [[H7843]] him not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] can stretch forth [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] against the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed, [[H4899]] and be guiltless? [[H5352]]

### 10
David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] furthermore, [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall smite [[H5062]] him; or [[H176]] his day [[H3117]] shall come [[H935]] to die; [[H4191]] or [[H176]] he shall descend [[H3381]] into battle, [[H4421]] and perish. [[H5595]]

### 11
The Lord [[H3068]] forbid [[H2486]] that I should stretch forth [[H7971]] mine hand [[H3027]] against the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed: [[H4899]] but, I pray thee, [[H4994]] take [[H3947]] thou now [[H6258]] the spear [[H2595]] that [[H834]] at his bolster, [[H4763]] and the cruse [[H6835]] of water, [[H4325]] and let us go. [[H1980]]

### 12
So David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the spear [[H2595]] and the cruse [[H6835]] of water [[H4325]] from Saul's [[H7586]] bolster; [[H7226]] and they gat them away, [[H1980]] and no [[H369]] man saw [[H7200]] nor [[H369]] knew [[H3045]] neither [[H369]] awaked: [[H6974]] for [[H3588]] they all [[H3605]] asleep; [[H3463]] because [[H3588]] a deep sleep [[H8639]] from the Lord [[H3068]] was fallen [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 13
Then David [[H1732]] went over [[H5674]] to the other side, [[H5676]] and stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of an hill [[H2022]] afar off; [[H7350]] a great [[H7227]] space [[H4725]] between [[H996]] them: [[H996]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] cried [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] and to [[H413]] Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] saying, [[H559]] Answerest [[H6030]] thou not, [[H3808]] Abner? [[H74]] Then Abner [[H74]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] thou [[H859]] criest [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the king? [[H4428]]

### 15
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abner, [[H74]] not [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] a man? [[H376]] and who [[H4310]] like to thee [[H3644]] in Israel? [[H3478]] wherefore [[H4100]] then hast thou not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] thy lord [[H113]] the king? [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] there came [[H935]] one [[H259]] of the people [[H5971]] in to destroy [[H7843]] the king [[H4428]] thy lord. [[H113]]

### 16
This [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] that [[H834]] thou hast done. [[H6213]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] ye [[H859]] worthy [[H1121]] to die, [[H4194]] because [[H834]] ye have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] your master, [[H113]] the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed. [[H4899]] And now [[H6258]] see [[H7200]] where [[H335]] the king's [[H4428]] spear [[H2595]] and the cruse [[H6835]] of water [[H4325]] that [[H834]] at his bolster. [[H4763]]

### 17
And Saul [[H7586]] knew [[H5234]] David's [[H1732]] voice, [[H6963]] and said, [[H559]] this [[H2088]] thy voice, [[H6963]] my son [[H1121]] David? [[H1732]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] my voice, [[H6963]] my lord, [[H113]] O king. [[H4428]]

### 18
And he said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] doth my lord [[H113]] thus [[H2088]] pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] his servant? [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] have I done? [[H6213]] or what [[H4100]] evil [[H7451]] in mine hand? [[H3027]]

### 19
Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] let my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of his servant. [[H5650]] If [[H518]] the Lord [[H3068]] have stirred thee up [[H5496]] against me, let him accept [[H7306]] an offering: [[H4503]] but if [[H518]] the children [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] cursed [[H779]] they [[H1992]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] they have driven [[H1644]] me out this day [[H3117]] from abiding [[H5596]] in the inheritance [[H5159]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

### 20
Now [[H6258]] therefore, let not [[H408]] my blood [[H1818]] fall [[H5307]] to the earth [[H776]] before [[H5048]] the face [[H6440]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] is come out [[H3318]] to seek [[H1245]] a flea, [[H6550]] as when [[H834]] one [[H259]] doth hunt [[H7291]] a partridge [[H7124]] in the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 21
Then said [[H559]] Saul, [[H7586]] I have sinned: [[H2398]] return, [[H7725]] my son [[H1121]] David: [[H1732]] for [[H3588]] I will no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] do thee harm, [[H7489]] because [[H8478]] my soul [[H5315]] was precious [[H3365]] in thine eyes [[H5869]] this [[H2088]] day: [[H3117]] behold, [[H2009]] I have played the fool, [[H5528]] and have erred [[H7686]] exceedingly. [[H7235]]

### 22
And David [[H1732]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] the king's [[H4428]] spear! [[H2595]] and let one [[H259]] of the young men [[H5288]] come over [[H5674]] and fetch [[H3947]] it. [[H3947]]

### 23
The Lord [[H3068]] render [[H7725]] to every man [[H376]] his righteousness [[H6666]] and his faithfulness: [[H530]] for [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] thee into hand [[H3027]] to day, [[H3117]] but I would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] stretch forth [[H7971]] mine hand [[H3027]] against the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed. [[H4899]]

### 24
And, behold, [[H2009]] as [[H834]] thy life [[H5315]] was much set by [[H1431]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] in mine eyes, [[H5869]] so [[H3651]] let my life [[H5315]] be much set by [[H1431]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and let him deliver [[H5337]] me out of all tribulation. [[H6869]]

### 25
Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Blessed [[H1288]] thou, [[H859]] my son [[H1121]] David: [[H1732]] thou shalt both [[H1571]] do [[H6213]] great [[H6213]] and also [[H1571]] shalt still [[H3201]] prevail. [[H3201]] So David [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] on his way, [[H1870]] and Saul [[H7586]] returned [[H7725]] to his place. [[H4725]]
