### 1
And David [[H1732]] fled [[H1272]] from Naioth [[H5121]] in Ramah, [[H7414]] and came [[H935]] and said [[H559]] before [[H6440]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] What [[H4100]] have I done? [[H6213]] what [[H4100]] mine iniquity? [[H5771]] and what [[H4100]] my sin [[H2403]] before [[H6440]] thy father, [[H1]] that [[H3588]] he seeketh [[H1245]] my life? [[H5315]]

### 2
And he said [[H559]] unto him, God forbid; [[H2486]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] die: [[H4191]] behold, [[H2009]] my father [[H1]] will do [[H6213]] nothing [[H3808]] great [[H1419]] or [[H176]] either small, [[H6996]] but that he will shew [[H1540]]  it [[H853]] me: [[H241]] and why [[H4069]] should my father [[H1]] hide [[H5641]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] from [[H4480]] me? it [[H2063]] not [[H369]]

### 3
And David [[H1732]] sware [[H7650]] moreover, [[H5750]] and said, [[H559]] Thy father [[H1]] certainly [[H3045]] knoweth [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thine eyes; [[H5869]] and he saith, [[H559]] Let not [[H408]] Jonathan [[H3083]] know [[H3045]] this, [[H2063]] lest [[H6435]] he be grieved: [[H6087]] but truly [[H199]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] and thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] but a step [[H6587]] between [[H996]] me and death. [[H4194]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] Jonathan [[H3083]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Whatsoever [[H4100]] thy soul [[H5315]] desireth, [[H559]] I will even do [[H6213]] for thee. [[H6213]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] Behold, [[H2009]] to morrow [[H4279]] the new moon, [[H2320]] and I [[H595]] should not fail [[H3427]] to sit [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] at meat: [[H398]] but let me go, [[H7971]] that I may hide myself [[H5641]] in the field [[H7704]] unto [[H5704]] the third [[H7992]] at even. [[H6153]]

### 6
If [[H518]] thy father [[H1]] at all [[H6485]] miss [[H6485]] me, then say, [[H559]] David [[H1732]] earnestly [[H7592]] asked [[H7592]] of [[H4480]] me that he might run [[H7323]] to Bethlehem [[H1035]] his city: [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] a yearly [[H3117]] sacrifice [[H2077]] there [[H8033]] for all [[H3605]] the family. [[H4940]]

### 7
If [[H518]] he say [[H559]] thus, [[H3541]] well; [[H2896]] thy servant [[H5650]] shall have peace: [[H7965]] but if [[H518]] he be very [[H2734]] wroth, [[H2734]] be sure [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] is determined [[H3615]] by him. [[H5973]]

### 8
Therefore thou shalt deal [[H6213]] kindly [[H2617]] with [[H5921]] thy servant; [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] thou hast brought [[H935]] thy servant [[H5650]] into a covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] thee: notwithstanding, if [[H518]] there be [[H3426]] in me iniquity, [[H5771]] slay [[H4191]] me thyself; [[H859]] for [[H5704]] why [[H4100]] shouldest thou bring [[H935]] me to thy father? [[H1]]

### 9
And Jonathan [[H3083]] said, [[H559]] Far be it [[H2486]] from thee: [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] if [[H518]] I knew [[H3045]] certainly [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] were determined [[H3615]] by [[H5973]] my father [[H1]] to come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee, then would not [[H3808]] I tell [[H5046]] it thee? [[H5046]]

### 10
Then said [[H559]] David [[H1732]] to [[H413]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] Who [[H4310]] shall tell [[H5046]] me? or [[H176]] what [[H4100]] thy father [[H1]] answer [[H6030]] thee roughly? [[H7186]]

### 11
And Jonathan [[H3083]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us go out [[H3318]] into the field. [[H7704]] And they went out [[H3318]] both [[H8147]] of them into the field. [[H7704]]

### 12
And Jonathan [[H3083]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] when [[H3588]] I have sounded [[H2713]] my father [[H1]] about to morrow [[H4279]] any time, [[H6256]] the third [[H7992]] and, behold, [[H2009]] good [[H2896]] toward [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and I then [[H227]] send [[H7971]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] thee, and shew [[H1540]] it thee; [[H241]]

### 13
The Lord [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] so [[H3541]] and much [[H3541]] more [[H3254]] to Jonathan: [[H3083]] but if [[H3588]] it please [[H3190]] my father [[H1]]  thee [[H853]] evil, [[H7451]] then I will shew [[H1540]] it thee, [[H241]] and send thee away, [[H7971]] that thou mayest go [[H1980]] in peace: [[H7965]] and the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee, as [[H834]] he hath been [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] my father. [[H1]]

### 14
And thou shalt not [[H3808]] only while yet [[H518]] I live [[H2416]] shew [[H6213]] me the kindness [[H2617]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that I die [[H4191]] not: [[H3808]]

### 15
But thou shalt not [[H3808]] cut off [[H3772]] thy kindness [[H2617]] from [[H5973]] my house [[H1004]] for [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]] no, not [[H3808]] when the Lord [[H3068]] hath cut off [[H3772]] the enemies [[H341]] of David [[H1732]] every one [[H376]] from the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 16
So Jonathan [[H3083]] made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] Let the Lord [[H3068]] even require [[H1245]] at the hand [[H3027]] of David's [[H1732]] enemies. [[H341]]

### 17
And Jonathan [[H3083]]  caused [[H853]] David [[H1732]] to swear [[H7650]] again, [[H3254]] because he loved [[H160]] him: for [[H3588]] he loved [[H157]] him as he loved [[H160]] his own soul. [[H5315]]

### 18
Then Jonathan [[H3083]] said to David, [[H559]] To morrow [[H4279]] the new moon: [[H2320]] and thou shalt be missed, [[H6485]] because [[H3588]] thy seat [[H4186]] will be empty. [[H6485]]

### 19
And thou hast stayed three days, [[H8027]] thou shalt go down [[H3381]] quickly, [[H3966]] and come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] thou didst hide thyself [[H5641]] when [[H3117]] the business [[H4639]] was and shalt remain [[H3427]] by [[H681]] the stone [[H68]] Ezel. [[H237]]

### 20
And I [[H589]] will shoot [[H3384]] three [[H7969]] arrows [[H2671]] on the side [[H6654]] as though I shot [[H7971]] at a mark. [[H4307]]

### 21
And, behold, [[H2009]] I will send [[H7971]] a lad, [[H5288]] Go, [[H1980]] find out [[H4672]] the arrows. [[H2671]] If [[H518]] I expressly [[H559]] say [[H559]] unto the lad, [[H5288]] Behold, [[H2009]] the arrows [[H2671]] on this side [[H2008]] of thee, take [[H3947]] them; then come [[H935]] thou: for [[H3588]] peace [[H7965]] to thee, and no [[H369]] hurt; [[H1697]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth. [[H2416]]

### 22
But if [[H518]] I say [[H559]] thus [[H3541]] unto the young man, [[H5958]] Behold, [[H2009]] the arrows [[H2671]] beyond [[H1973]] thee; go thy way: [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent thee away. [[H7971]]

### 23
And the matter [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thou [[H859]] and I [[H589]] have spoken [[H1696]] of, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] between [[H996]] thee and me for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 24
So David [[H1732]] hid himself [[H5641]] in the field: [[H7704]] and when the new moon [[H2320]] was come, [[H1961]] the king [[H4428]] sat him down [[H3427]] to eat [[H398]] meat. [[H3899]]

### 25
And the king [[H4428]] sat [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] his seat, [[H4186]] as at other times, [[H6471]] upon [[H413]] a seat [[H4186]] by the wall: [[H7023]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] arose, [[H6965]] and Abner [[H74]] sat [[H3427]] by Saul's [[H7586]] side, [[H6654]] and David's [[H1732]] place [[H4725]] was empty. [[H6485]]

### 26
Nevertheless Saul [[H7586]] spake [[H1696]] not [[H3808]] any thing [[H3972]] that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] he thought, [[H559]] Something hath befallen [[H4745]] him, he [[H1931]] not [[H1115]] clean; [[H2889]] surely [[H3588]] he not [[H3808]] clean. [[H2889]]

### 27
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] the second [[H8145]] of the month, [[H2320]] that David's [[H1732]] place [[H4725]] was empty: [[H6485]] and Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jonathan [[H3083]] his son, [[H1121]] Wherefore [[H4069]] cometh [[H935]] not [[H3808]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] to [[H413]] meat, [[H3899]] neither [[H1571]] yesterday, [[H8543]] nor [[H1571]] to day? [[H3117]]

### 28
And Jonathan [[H3083]] answered [[H6030]] Saul, [[H7586]] David [[H1732]] earnestly [[H7592]] asked [[H7592]] of me [[H5978]] to [[H5704]] Bethlehem: [[H1035]]

### 29
And he said, [[H559]] Let me go, [[H7971]] I pray thee; [[H4994]] for [[H3588]] our family [[H4940]] hath a sacrifice [[H2077]] in the city; [[H5892]] and my brother, [[H251]] he [[H1931]] hath commanded [[H6680]] me and now, [[H6258]] if [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in thine eyes, [[H5869]] let me get away, [[H4422]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and see [[H7200]] my brethren. [[H251]] Therefore [[H5921]] he cometh [[H935]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] table. [[H7979]]

### 30
Then Saul's [[H7586]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Jonathan, [[H3083]] and he said [[H559]] unto him, Thou son [[H1121]] of the perverse [[H5753]] rebellious [[H4780]] do not [[H3808]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast chosen [[H977]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] to thine own confusion, [[H1322]] and unto the confusion [[H1322]] of thy mother's [[H517]] nakedness? [[H6172]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] as long [[H3605]] as [[H3117]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] liveth [[H2416]] upon [[H5921]] the ground, [[H127]] thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] be established, [[H3559]] nor thy kingdom. [[H4438]] Wherefore now [[H6258]] send [[H7971]] and fetch [[H3947]] him unto [[H413]] me, for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] shall surely die. [[H1121]]

### 32
And Jonathan [[H3083]] answered [[H6030]] Saul [[H7586]] his father, [[H1]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Wherefore [[H4100]] shall he be slain? [[H4191]] what [[H4100]] hath he done? [[H6213]]

### 33
And Saul [[H7586]] cast [[H2904]] a javelin [[H2595]] at [[H5921]] him to smite [[H5221]] him: whereby Jonathan [[H3083]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] was determined [[H3617]] of [[H5973]] his father [[H1]] to slay [[H4191]] David. [[H1732]]

### 34
So Jonathan [[H3083]] arose [[H6965]] from [[H5973]] the table [[H7979]] in fierce [[H2750]] anger, [[H639]] and did eat [[H398]] no [[H3808]] meat [[H3899]] the second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] of the month: [[H2320]] for [[H3588]] he was grieved [[H6087]] for [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] because [[H3588]] his father [[H1]] had done him shame. [[H3637]]

### 35
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the morning, [[H1242]] that Jonathan [[H3083]] went out [[H3318]] into the field [[H7704]] at the time appointed [[H4150]] with David, [[H1732]] and a little [[H6996]] lad [[H5288]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 36
And he said [[H559]] unto his lad, [[H5288]] Run, [[H7323]] find out [[H4672]] now [[H4994]] the arrows [[H2671]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] shoot. [[H3384]] as the lad [[H5288]] ran, [[H7323]] he [[H1931]] shot [[H3384]] an arrow [[H2678]] beyond [[H5674]] him. [[H5674]]

### 37
And when the lad [[H5288]] was come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the place [[H4725]] of the arrow [[H2678]] which [[H834]] Jonathan [[H3083]] had shot, [[H3384]] Jonathan [[H3083]] cried [[H7121]] after [[H310]] the lad, [[H5288]] and said, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] the arrow [[H2678]] beyond [[H1973]] thee? [[H4480]]

### 38
And Jonathan [[H3083]] cried [[H7121]] after [[H310]] the lad, [[H5288]] Make speed, [[H4120]] haste, [[H2363]] stay [[H5975]] not. [[H408]] And Jonathan's [[H3083]] lad [[H5288]] gathered up [[H3950]] the arrows, [[H2678]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] his master. [[H113]]

### 39
But the lad [[H5288]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] any thing: [[H3972]] only [[H389]] Jonathan [[H3083]] and David [[H1732]] knew [[H3045]] the matter. [[H1697]]

### 40
And Jonathan [[H3083]] gave [[H5414]] his artillery [[H3627]] unto [[H413]] his [[H834]] lad, [[H5288]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Go, [[H1980]] carry [[H935]] to the city. [[H5892]]

### 41
as soon as the lad [[H5288]] was gone, [[H935]] David [[H1732]] arose [[H6965]] out of toward [[H681]] the south, [[H5045]] and fell [[H5307]] on his face [[H639]] to the ground, [[H776]] and bowed himself [[H7812]] three [[H7969]] times: [[H6471]] and they kissed [[H5401]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] and wept [[H1058]] one [[H376]] with [[H853]] another, [[H7453]] until [[H5704]] David [[H1732]] exceeded. [[H1431]]

### 42
And Jonathan [[H3083]] said [[H559]] to David, [[H1732]] Go [[H1980]] in peace, [[H7965]] forasmuch as [[H834]] we have sworn [[H7650]] both [[H8147]] of us [[H587]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] between [[H996]] me and thee, and between [[H996]] my seed [[H2233]] and thy seed [[H2233]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]] And he arose [[H6965]] and departed: [[H1980]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] went [[H935]] into the city. [[H5892]]
