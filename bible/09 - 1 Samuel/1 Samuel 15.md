### 1
Samuel [[H8050]] also said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] The Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] me to anoint [[H4886]] thee king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] his people, [[H5971]] over [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] now [[H6258]] therefore hearken [[H8085]] thou unto the voice [[H6963]] of the words [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] I remember [[H6485]] which [[H834]] Amalek [[H6002]] did [[H6213]] to Israel, [[H3478]] how [[H834]] he laid [[H7760]] for him in the way, [[H1870]] when he came up [[H5927]] from Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 3
Now [[H6258]] go [[H1980]] and smite [[H5221]] Amalek, [[H6002]] and utterly destroy [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they have, and spare [[H2550]] them not; [[H3808]] but slay [[H4191]] both man [[H376]] and [[H5704]] woman, [[H802]] infant [[H5768]] and suckling, [[H3243]] ox [[H7794]] and sheep, [[H7716]] camel [[H1581]] and ass. [[H2543]]

### 4
And Saul [[H7586]] gathered together, [[H8085]] the people [[H5971]] and numbered [[H6485]] them in Telaim, [[H2923]] two hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] footmen, [[H7273]] and ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 5
And Saul [[H7586]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] a city [[H5892]] of Amalek, [[H6002]] and laid wait [[H7378]] in the valley. [[H5158]]

### 6
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Kenites, [[H7017]] Go, [[H1980]] depart, [[H5493]] get you down [[H3381]] from among [[H8432]] the Amalekites, [[H6002]] lest [[H6435]] I destroy [[H622]] you with [[H5973]] them: for ye [[H859]] shewed [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] when they came up [[H5927]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]] So the Kenites [[H7017]] departed [[H5493]] from among [[H8432]] the Amalekites. [[H6003]]

### 7
And Saul [[H7586]] smote [[H5221]] the Amalekites [[H6002]] from Havilah [[H2341]] thou comest [[H935]] to Shur, [[H7793]] that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] against [[H6440]] Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 8
And he took [[H8610]] Agag [[H90]] the king [[H4428]] of the Amalekites [[H6002]] alive, [[H2416]] and utterly destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 9
But Saul [[H7586]] and the people [[H5971]] spared [[H2550]] Agag, [[H90]] and the best [[H4315]] of the sheep, [[H6629]] and of the oxen, [[H1241]] and of the fatlings, [[H4932]] and the lambs, [[H3733]] and all [[H3605]] good, [[H2896]] and would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] utterly destroy [[H2763]] them: but every [[H3605]] thing [[H4399]] vile [[H5240]] and refuse, [[H4549]] that they destroyed utterly. [[H2763]]

### 10
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] saying, [[H559]]

### 11
It repenteth me [[H5162]] that [[H3588]] I have set up [[H4427]] Saul [[H7586]] king: [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] he is turned back [[H7725]] from following [[H310]] me, and hath not [[H3808]] performed [[H6965]] my commandments. [[H1697]] And it grieved [[H2734]] Samuel; [[H8050]] and he cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] night. [[H3915]]

### 12
And when Samuel [[H8050]] rose early [[H7925]] to meet [[H7125]] Saul [[H7586]] in the morning, [[H1242]] it was told [[H5046]] Samuel, [[H8050]] saying, [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] came [[H935]] to Carmel, [[H3760]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he set him up [[H5324]] a place, [[H3027]] and is gone about, [[H5437]] and passed on, [[H5674]] and gone down [[H3381]] to Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 13
And Samuel [[H8050]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Saul: [[H7586]] and Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto him, Blessed [[H1288]] thou [[H859]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] I have performed [[H6965]] the commandment [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
And Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] then this [[H2088]] bleating [[H6963]] of the sheep [[H6629]] in mine ears, [[H241]] and the lowing [[H6963]] of the oxen [[H1241]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] hear? [[H8085]]

### 15
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] They have brought [[H935]] them from the Amalekites: [[H6003]] for [[H834]] the people [[H5971]] spared [[H2550]] the best [[H4315]] of the sheep [[H6629]] and of the oxen, [[H1241]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God; [[H430]] and the rest [[H3498]] we have utterly destroyed. [[H2763]]

### 16
Then Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Stay, [[H7503]] and I will tell [[H5046]]  thee [[H853]] what [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] me this night. [[H3915]] And he said [[H559]] unto him, Say on. [[H1696]]

### 17
And Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] When [[H518]] thou [[H859]] little [[H6996]] in thine own sight, [[H5869]] thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] the head [[H7218]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the Lord [[H3068]] anointed [[H4886]] thee king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel? [[H3478]]

### 18
And the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] thee on a journey, [[H1870]] and said, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and utterly destroy [[H2763]] the sinners [[H2400]] the Amalekites, [[H6002]] and fight [[H3898]] against them until [[H5704]] they be consumed. [[H3615]]

### 19
Wherefore [[H4100]] then didst thou not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] but didst fly [[H5860]] upon [[H413]] the spoil, [[H7998]] and didst [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 20
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Yea, [[H834]] I have obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and have gone [[H1980]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] me, and have brought [[H935]] Agag [[H90]] the king [[H4428]] of Amalek, [[H6002]] and have utterly destroyed [[H2763]] the Amalekites. [[H6002]]

### 21
But the people [[H5971]] took [[H3947]] of the spoil, [[H7998]] sheep [[H6629]] and oxen, [[H1241]] the chief [[H7225]] of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, [[H2764]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] in Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 22
And Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] Hath the Lord [[H3068]] delight [[H2656]] in burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrifices, [[H2077]] as in obeying [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord? [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] to obey [[H8085]] better [[H2896]] than sacrifice, [[H2077]] to hearken [[H7181]] than the fat [[H2459]] of rams. [[H352]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] rebellion [[H4805]] the sin [[H2403]] of witchcraft, [[H7081]] and stubbornness [[H6484]] iniquity [[H205]] and idolatry. [[H8655]] Because [[H3282]] thou hast rejected [[H3988]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] he hath also rejected [[H3988]] thee from king. [[H4428]]

### 24
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] I have sinned: [[H2398]] for [[H3588]] I have transgressed [[H5674]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and thy words: [[H1697]] because [[H3588]] I feared [[H3372]] the people, [[H5971]] and obeyed [[H8085]] their voice. [[H6963]]

### 25
Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] pardon [[H5375]] my sin, [[H2403]] and turn again [[H7725]] with [[H5973]] me, that I may worship [[H7812]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 26
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] I will not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] with [[H5973]] thee: for [[H3588]] thou hast rejected [[H3988]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath rejected [[H3988]] thee from being [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
And as Samuel [[H8050]] turned about [[H5437]] to go away, [[H1980]] he laid hold [[H2388]] upon the skirt [[H3671]] of his mantle, [[H4598]] and it rent. [[H7167]]

### 28
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The Lord [[H3068]] hath rent [[H7167]] the kingdom [[H4468]] of Israel [[H3478]] from [[H5921]] thee this day, [[H3117]] and hath given [[H5414]] it to a neighbour [[H7453]] of thine, better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] thou. [[H4480]]

### 29
And also [[H1571]] the Strength [[H5331]] of Israel [[H3478]] will not [[H3808]] lie [[H8266]] nor [[H3808]] repent: [[H5162]] for [[H3588]] he not [[H3808]] a man, [[H120]] that he [[H1931]] should repent. [[H5162]]

### 30
Then he said, [[H559]] I have sinned: [[H2398]] honour [[H3513]] me now, [[H6258]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] before [[H5048]] the elders [[H2205]] of my people, [[H5971]] and before [[H5048]] Israel, [[H3478]] and turn again [[H7725]] with [[H5973]] me, that I may worship [[H7812]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 31
So Samuel [[H8050]] turned again [[H7725]] after [[H310]] Saul; [[H7586]] and Saul [[H7586]] worshipped [[H7812]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 32
Then said [[H559]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Bring ye hither [[H5066]] to [[H413]]  me [[H853]] Agag [[H90]] the king [[H4428]] of the Amalekites. [[H6002]] And Agag [[H90]] came [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] him delicately. [[H4574]] And Agag [[H90]] said, [[H559]] Surely [[H403]] the bitterness [[H4751]] of death [[H4194]] is past. [[H5493]]

### 33
And Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] As [[H834]] thy sword [[H2719]] hath made women [[H802]] childless, [[H7921]] so [[H3651]] shall thy mother [[H517]] be childless [[H7921]] among women. [[H802]] And Samuel [[H8050]] hewed pieces [[H8158]] Agag [[H90]]  in [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] in Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 34
Then Samuel [[H8050]] went [[H1980]] to Ramah; [[H7414]] and Saul [[H7586]] went up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] his house [[H1004]] to Gibeah [[H1390]] of Saul. [[H7586]]

### 35
And Samuel [[H8050]] came no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] to see [[H7200]] Saul [[H7586]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of his death: [[H4194]] nevertheless [[H3588]] Samuel [[H8050]] mourned [[H56]] for [[H413]] Saul: [[H7586]] and the Lord [[H3068]] repented [[H5162]] that [[H3588]] he had made Saul [[H7586]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel.
