### 1
And Samuel [[H8050]] died; [[H4191]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] were gathered together, [[H6908]] and lamented [[H5594]] him, and buried [[H6912]] him in his house [[H1004]] at Ramah. [[H7414]] And David [[H1732]] arose, [[H6965]] and went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran. [[H6290]]

### 2
And a man [[H376]] in Maon, [[H4584]] whose possessions [[H4639]] in Carmel; [[H3760]] and the man [[H376]] very [[H3966]] great, [[H1419]] and he had three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] sheep, [[H6629]] and a thousand [[H505]] goats: [[H5795]] and he was [[H1961]] shearing [[H1494]] his sheep [[H6629]] in Carmel. [[H3760]]

### 3
Now the name [[H8034]] of the man [[H376]] Nabal; [[H5037]] and the name [[H8034]] of his wife [[H802]] Abigail: [[H26]] and a woman [[H802]] of good [[H2896]] understanding, [[H7922]] and of a beautiful [[H3303]] countenance: [[H8389]] but the man [[H376]] churlish [[H7186]] and evil [[H7451]] in his doings; [[H4611]] and he [[H1931]] of the house of Caleb. [[H3614]]

### 4
And David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] that [[H3588]] Nabal [[H5037]] did shear [[H1494]] his sheep. [[H6629]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] sent out [[H7971]] ten [[H6235]] young men, [[H5288]] and David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto the young men, [[H5288]] Get you up [[H5927]] to Carmel, [[H3760]] and go [[H935]] to [[H413]] Nabal, [[H5037]] and greet [[H7592]] him in my name: [[H8034]]

### 6
And thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] to him that liveth [[H2416]] Peace [[H7965]] both to thee, [[H859]] and peace [[H7965]] to thine house, [[H1004]] and peace [[H7965]] unto all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast. [[H834]]

### 7
And now [[H6258]] I have heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] thou hast shearers: [[H1494]] now [[H6258]] thy shepherds [[H7462]] which [[H834]] were [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] us, we hurt [[H3637]] them not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] was there ought [[H3972]] missing [[H6485]] unto them, all [[H3605]] the while [[H3117]] they were [[H1961]] in Carmel. [[H3760]]

### 8
Ask [[H7592]] thy young men, [[H5288]] and they will shew [[H5046]] thee. Wherefore let the young men [[H5288]] find [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in thine eyes: [[H5869]] for [[H3588]] we come [[H935]] in [[H5921]] a good [[H2896]] day: [[H3117]] give, [[H5414]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] whatsoever [[H834]] cometh [[H4672]] to thine hand [[H3027]] unto thy servants, [[H5650]] and to thy son [[H1121]] David. [[H1732]]

### 9
And when David's [[H1732]] young men [[H5288]] came, [[H935]] they spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Nabal [[H5037]] according to all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in the name [[H8034]] of David, [[H1732]] and ceased. [[H5117]]

### 10
And Nabal [[H5037]] answered [[H6030]] David's [[H1732]] servants, [[H5650]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] David? [[H1732]] and who [[H4310]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse? [[H3448]] there be many [[H7231]] servants [[H5650]] now a days [[H3117]] that break away [[H6555]] every man [[H376]] from [[H6440]] his master. [[H113]]

### 11
Shall I then take [[H3947]] my bread, [[H3899]] and my water, [[H4325]] and my flesh [[H2878]] that [[H834]] I have killed [[H2873]] for my shearers, [[H1494]] and give [[H5414]] unto men, [[H376]] whom [[H834]] I know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] whence [[H335]] they [[H1992]]

### 12
So David's [[H1732]] young men [[H5288]] turned [[H2015]] their way, [[H1870]] and went again, [[H7725]] and came [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] him all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] sayings. [[H1697]]

### 13
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto his men, [[H376]] Gird ye on [[H2296]] every man [[H376]] his sword. [[H2719]] And they girded on [[H2296]] every man [[H376]] his sword; [[H2719]] and David [[H1732]] also [[H1571]] girded on [[H2296]] his sword: [[H2719]] and there went up [[H5927]] after [[H310]] David [[H1732]] about four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men; [[H376]] and two hundred [[H3967]] abode [[H3427]] by [[H5921]] the stuff. [[H3627]]

### 14
But one [[H259]]  of the young men [[H5288]] told [[H5046]] Abigail, [[H26]] Nabal's [[H5037]] wife, [[H802]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] out of the wilderness [[H4057]] to salute [[H1288]] our master; [[H113]] and he railed [[H5860]] on them. [[H5860]]

### 15
But the men [[H582]] very [[H3966]] good [[H2896]] unto us, and we were not [[H3808]] hurt, [[H3637]] neither [[H3808]] missed [[H6485]] we any thing, [[H3972]] as long as [[H3117]] we were conversant [[H1980]] with [[H854]] them, when we were [[H1961]] in the fields: [[H7704]]

### 16
They were [[H1961]] a wall [[H2346]] unto [[H5921]] us both [[H1571]] by night [[H3915]] and [[H1571]] day, [[H3119]] all [[H3605]] the while [[H3117]] we were [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] them keeping [[H7462]] the sheep. [[H6629]]

### 17
Now [[H6258]] therefore know [[H3045]] and consider [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] thou wilt do; [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] is determined [[H3615]] against [[H413]] our master, [[H113]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his household: [[H1004]] for he [[H1931]] a son [[H1121]] of Belial, [[H1100]] that cannot speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 18
Then Abigail [[H26]] made haste, [[H4116]] and took [[H3947]] two hundred [[H3967]] loaves, [[H3899]] and two [[H8147]] bottles [[H5035]] of wine, [[H3196]] and five [[H2568]] sheep [[H6629]] ready dressed, [[H6213]] and five [[H2568]] measures [[H5429]] of parched [[H7039]] and an hundred [[H3967]] clusters of raisins, [[H6778]] and two hundred [[H3967]] cakes [[H1690]] of figs, and laid [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] asses. [[H2543]]

### 19
And she said [[H559]] unto her servants, [[H5288]] Go on [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] me; behold, [[H2005]] I come [[H935]] after [[H310]] you. But she told [[H5046]] not [[H3808]] her husband [[H376]] Nabal. [[H5037]]

### 20
And it was [[H1961]] she [[H1931]] rode [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] the ass, [[H2543]] that she came down [[H3381]] by the covert [[H5643]] of the hill, [[H2022]] and, behold, [[H2009]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] came down [[H3381]] against [[H7125]] her; and she met [[H6298]] them. [[H6298]]

### 21
Now David [[H1732]] had said, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] in vain [[H8267]] have I kept [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] this [[H2088]] hath in the wilderness, [[H4057]] so that nothing [[H3972]] was missed [[H6485]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] unto him: and he hath requited [[H7725]] me evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good. [[H2896]]

### 22
So [[H3541]] and more [[H3254]] also [[H3541]] do [[H6213]] God [[H430]] unto the enemies [[H341]] of David, [[H1732]] if [[H518]] I leave [[H7604]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] to him by [[H5704]] the morning light [[H1242]] any that pisseth [[H8366]] against the wall. [[H7023]]

### 23
And when Abigail [[H26]] saw [[H7200]] David, [[H1732]] she hasted, [[H4116]] and lighted off [[H3381]] the ass, [[H2543]] and fell [[H5307]] before [[H639]] David [[H1732]] on [[H5921]] her face, [[H6440]] and bowed herself [[H7812]] to the ground, [[H776]]

### 24
And fell [[H5307]] at [[H5921]] his feet, [[H7272]] and said, [[H559]] Upon me, [[H589]] my lord, [[H113]] me iniquity [[H5771]] and let thine handmaid, [[H519]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] speak [[H1696]] in thine audience, [[H241]] and hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of thine handmaid. [[H519]]

### 25
Let [[H7760]] not [[H408]] my lord, [[H113]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] regard [[H3820]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] of Belial, [[H1100]] Nabal: [[H5037]] for [[H3588]] as his name [[H8034]] so [[H3651]] he; [[H1931]] Nabal [[H5037]] his name, [[H8034]] and folly [[H5039]] with [[H5973]] him: but I [[H589]] thine handmaid [[H519]] saw [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] the young men [[H5288]] of my lord, [[H113]] whom [[H834]] thou didst send. [[H7971]]

### 26
Now [[H6258]] therefore, my lord, [[H113]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] and thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] seeing [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath withholden [[H4513]] thee from coming [[H935]] to blood, [[H1818]] and from avenging [[H3467]] thyself with thine own hand, [[H3027]] now [[H6258]] let thine enemies, [[H341]] and they that seek [[H1245]] evil [[H7451]] to [[H413]] my lord, [[H113]] be [[H1961]] as Nabal. [[H5037]]

### 27
And now [[H6258]] this [[H2063]] blessing [[H1293]] which [[H834]] thine handmaid [[H8198]] hath brought [[H935]] unto my lord, [[H113]] let it even be given [[H5414]] unto the young men [[H5288]] that follow [[H1980]] my lord. [[H113]]

### 28
I pray thee, [[H4994]] forgive [[H5375]] the trespass [[H6588]] of thine handmaid: [[H519]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will certainly [[H6213]] make [[H6213]] my lord [[H113]] a sure [[H539]] house; [[H1004]] because [[H3588]] my lord [[H113]] fighteth [[H3898]] the battles [[H4421]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and evil [[H7451]] hath not [[H3808]] been found [[H4672]] in thee thy days. [[H3117]]

### 29
Yet a man [[H120]] is risen [[H6965]] to pursue [[H7291]] thee, and to seek [[H1245]] thy soul: [[H5315]] but the soul [[H5315]] of my lord [[H113]] shall be [[H1961]] bound [[H6887]] in the bundle [[H6872]] of life [[H2416]] with [[H854]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God; [[H430]] and the souls [[H5315]] of thine enemies, [[H341]] them shall he sling out, [[H7049]] of the middle [[H8432]] of a sling. [[H7050]]

### 30
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall have done [[H6213]] to my lord [[H113]] according to all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] that [[H834]] he hath spoken [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] thee, and shall have appointed [[H6680]] thee ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] Israel; [[H3478]]

### 31
That this [[H2063]] shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] grief [[H6330]] unto thee, nor offence [[H4383]] of heart [[H3820]] unto my lord, [[H113]] either that thou hast shed [[H8210]] blood [[H1818]] causeless, [[H2600]] or that my lord [[H113]] hath avenged [[H3467]] himself: but when the Lord [[H3068]] shall have dealt well [[H3190]] with my lord, [[H113]] then remember [[H2142]] thine handmaid. [[H519]]

### 32
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Abigail, [[H26]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] sent [[H7971]] thee this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] to meet [[H7125]] me: [[H7125]]

### 33
And blessed [[H1288]] thy advice, [[H2940]] and blessed [[H1288]] thou, [[H859]] which [[H834]] hast kept [[H3607]] me this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] from coming [[H935]] to blood, [[H1818]] and from avenging [[H3467]] myself with mine own hand. [[H3027]]

### 34
For in very deed, [[H199]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] liveth, [[H2416]] which [[H834]] hath kept me back [[H4513]] from hurting [[H7489]] thee, except [[H3884]] thou hadst hasted [[H4116]] and come [[H935]] to meet [[H7125]] me, surely [[H3588]] there had not [[H518]] been left [[H3498]] unto Nabal [[H5037]] by [[H5704]] the morning [[H1242]] light [[H216]] any that pisseth [[H8366]] against the wall. [[H7023]]

### 35
So David [[H1732]] received [[H3947]] of her hand [[H3027]] which [[H834]] she had brought [[H935]] him, and said [[H559]] unto her, Go up [[H5927]] in peace [[H7965]] to thine house; [[H1004]] see, [[H7200]] I have hearkened [[H8085]] to thy voice, [[H6963]] and have accepted [[H5375]] thy person. [[H6440]]

### 36
And Abigail [[H26]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Nabal; [[H5037]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he held a feast [[H4960]] in his house, [[H1004]] like the feast [[H4960]] of a king; [[H4428]] and Nabal's [[H5037]] heart [[H3820]] merry [[H2896]] within [[H5921]] him, for he [[H1931]] very [[H3966]] drunken: [[H7910]] wherefore she told [[H5046]] him nothing, [[H1697]] less [[H6996]] or more, [[H1419]] until [[H5704]] the morning [[H1242]] light. [[H216]]

### 37
But it came to pass [[H1961]] in the morning, [[H1242]] when the wine [[H3196]] was gone out [[H3318]] of Nabal, [[H5037]] and his wife [[H802]] had told [[H5046]]  him [[H853]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] that his heart [[H3820]] died [[H4191]] within [[H7130]] him, and he [[H1931]] became [[H1961]] a stone. [[H68]]

### 38
And it came to pass [[H1961]] about ten [[H6235]] days [[H3117]] that the Lord [[H3068]] smote [[H5062]] Nabal, [[H5037]] that he died. [[H4191]]

### 39
And when David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Nabal [[H5037]] was dead, [[H4191]] he said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] hath pleaded [[H7378]] the cause [[H7379]] of my reproach [[H2781]] from the hand [[H3027]] of Nabal, [[H5037]] and hath kept [[H2820]] his servant [[H5650]] from evil: [[H7451]] for the Lord [[H3068]] hath returned [[H7725]] the wickedness [[H7451]] of Nabal [[H5037]] upon his own head. [[H7218]] And David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] and communed [[H1696]] with Abigail, [[H26]] to take [[H3947]] her to him to wife. [[H802]]

### 40
And when the servants [[H5650]] of David [[H1732]] were come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Abigail [[H26]] to Carmel, [[H3760]] they spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] her, saying, [[H559]] David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] us unto [[H413]] thee, to take [[H3947]] thee to him to wife. [[H802]]

### 41
And she arose, [[H6965]] and bowed herself [[H7812]] on face [[H639]] to the earth, [[H776]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] thine handmaid [[H519]] a servant [[H8198]] to wash [[H7364]] the feet [[H7272]] of the servants [[H5650]] of my lord. [[H113]]

### 42
And Abigail [[H26]] hasted, [[H4116]] and arose, [[H6965]] and rode [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] an ass, [[H2543]] with five [[H2568]] damsels [[H5291]] of hers that went [[H1980]] after [[H7272]] her; and she went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the messengers [[H4397]] of David, [[H1732]] and became [[H1961]] his wife. [[H802]]

### 43
David [[H1732]] also took [[H3947]] Ahinoam [[H293]] of Jezreel; [[H3157]] and they were [[H1961]] also [[H1571]] both [[H8147]] of them his wives. [[H802]]

### 44
But Saul [[H7586]] had given [[H5414]] Michal [[H4324]] his daughter, [[H1323]] David's [[H1732]] wife, [[H802]] to Phalti [[H6406]] the son [[H1121]] of Laish, [[H3919]] which [[H834]] of Gallim. [[H1554]]
