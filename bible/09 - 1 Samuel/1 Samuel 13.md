### 1
Saul [[H7586]] reigned [[H4427]] one year; [[H8141]] and when he had reigned [[H4427]] two [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]]

### 2
Saul [[H7586]] chose [[H977]] him three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] of Israel; [[H3478]] two thousand [[H505]] were [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] in Michmash [[H4363]] and in mount [[H2022]] Beth-el, [[H1008]] and a thousand [[H505]] were [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Jonathan [[H3129]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] of Benjamin: [[H1144]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] he sent [[H7971]] every man [[H376]] to his tent. [[H168]]

### 3
And Jonathan [[H3129]] smote [[H5221]] the garrison [[H5333]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] that [[H834]] in Geba, [[H1387]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [[H8085]] And Saul [[H7586]] blew [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] saying, [[H559]] Let the Hebrews [[H5680]] hear. [[H8085]]

### 4
And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] say [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] had smitten [[H5221]] a garrison [[H5333]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and Israel [[H3478]] also [[H1571]] was had in abomination [[H887]] with the Philistines. [[H6430]] And the people [[H5971]] were called together [[H6817]] after [[H310]] Saul [[H7586]] to Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 5
And the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered themselves together [[H622]] to fight [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] Israel, [[H3478]] thirty [[H7970]] thousand [[H505]] chariots, [[H7393]] and six [[H8337]] thousand [[H505]] horsemen, [[H6571]] and people [[H5971]] as the sand [[H2344]] which [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] shore [[H8193]] in multitude: [[H7230]] and they came up, [[H5927]] and pitched [[H2583]] in Michmash, [[H4363]] eastward [[H6926]] from Beth-aven. [[H1007]]

### 6
When the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they were in a strait, [[H6887]] (for [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] were distressed,) [[H5065]] then the people [[H5971]] did hide themselves [[H2244]] in caves, [[H4631]] and in thickets, [[H2336]] and in rocks, [[H5553]] and in high places, [[H6877]] and in pits. [[H953]]

### 7
And the Hebrews [[H5680]] went over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] to the land [[H776]] of Gad [[H1410]] and Gilead. [[H1568]] As for Saul, [[H7586]] he yet [[H5750]] in Gilgal, [[H1537]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] followed [[H310]] him trembling. [[H2729]]

### 8
And he tarried [[H3176]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] according to the set time [[H4150]] that [[H834]] Samuel [[H8050]] but Samuel [[H8050]] came [[H935]] not [[H3808]] to Gilgal; [[H1537]] and the people [[H5971]] were scattered [[H6327]] from him. [[H5921]]

### 9
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Bring hither [[H5066]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] to [[H413]] me, and peace offerings. [[H8002]] And he offered [[H5927]] the burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 10
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that as soon as he had made an end [[H3615]] of offering [[H5927]] the burnt offering, [[H5930]] behold, [[H2009]] Samuel [[H8050]] came; [[H935]] and Saul [[H7586]] went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] him, that he might salute [[H1288]] him. [[H1288]]

### 11
And Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] hast thou done? [[H6213]] And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] I saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] were scattered [[H5310]] from [[H5921]] me, and thou [[H859]] camest [[H935]] not [[H3808]] within the days [[H3117]] appointed, [[H4150]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered themselves together [[H622]] at Michmash; [[H4363]]

### 12
Therefore said [[H559]] I, The Philistines [[H6430]] will come down [[H3381]] now [[H6258]] upon [[H413]] me to Gilgal, [[H1537]] and I have not [[H3808]] made supplication [[H2470]] unto [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] I forced myself [[H662]] therefore, and offered [[H5927]] a burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 13
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Thou hast done foolishly: [[H5528]] thou hast not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the commandment [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] thee: for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] would the Lord [[H3068]] have established [[H3559]] thy kingdom [[H4467]] upon [[H413]] Israel [[H3478]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 14
But now [[H6258]] thy kingdom [[H4467]] shall not [[H3808]] continue: [[H6965]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sought [[H1245]] him a man [[H376]] after his own heart, [[H3824]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath commanded [[H6680]] him captain [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] his people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] thou hast not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] thee. [[H6680]]

### 15
And Samuel [[H8050]] arose, [[H6965]] and gat him up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal [[H1537]] unto Gibeah [[H1390]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]] And Saul [[H7586]] numbered [[H6485]] the people [[H5971]] present [[H4672]] with [[H5973]] him, about six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men. [[H376]]

### 16
And Saul, [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3129]] his son, [[H1121]] and the people [[H5971]] present [[H4672]] with [[H5973]] them, abode [[H3427]] in Gibeah [[H1387]] of Benjamin: [[H1144]] but the Philistines [[H6430]] encamped [[H2583]] in Michmash. [[H4363]]

### 17
And the spoilers [[H7843]] came out [[H3318]] of the camp [[H4264]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] in three [[H7969]] companies: [[H7218]] one [[H259]] company [[H7218]] turned [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] the way [[H1870]] Ophrah, [[H6084]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Shual: [[H7777]]

### 18
And another [[H259]] company [[H7218]] turned [[H6437]] the way [[H1870]] Beth-horon: [[H1032]] and another [[H259]] company [[H7218]] turned [[H6437]] the way [[H1870]] of the border [[H1366]] that looketh [[H8259]] to [[H5921]] the valley [[H1516]] of Zeboim [[H6650]] toward the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 19
Now there was no [[H3808]] smith [[H2796]] found [[H4672]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] the Philistines [[H6430]] said, [[H559]] Lest [[H6435]] the Hebrews [[H5680]] make [[H6213]] swords [[H2719]] or [[H176]] spears: [[H2595]]

### 20
But all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] went down [[H3381]] to the Philistines, [[H6430]] to sharpen [[H3913]] every man [[H376]] his share, [[H4282]] and his coulter, [[H855]] and his axe, [[H7134]] and his mattock. [[H4281]]

### 21
Yet they had [[H1961]] a file [[H6477]] for the mattocks, [[H4281]] and for the coulters, [[H855]] and for the forks, [[H7969]] and for the axes, [[H7134]] and to sharpen [[H5324]] the goads. [[H1861]]

### 22
So it came to pass [[H1961]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle, [[H4421]] that there was neither [[H3808]] sword [[H2719]] nor spear [[H2595]] found [[H4672]] in the hand [[H3027]] of any [[H3605]] of the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan: [[H3129]] but with Saul [[H7586]] and with Jonathan [[H3129]] his son [[H1121]] was there found. [[H4672]]

### 23
And the garrison [[H4673]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the passage [[H4569]] of Michmash. [[H4363]]
