### 1
And the child [[H5288]] Samuel [[H8050]] ministered [[H8334]]  unto [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] Eli. [[H5941]] And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] precious [[H3368]] in those [[H1992]] days; [[H3117]] no [[H369]] open [[H6555]] vision. [[H2377]]

### 2
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at that time, [[H3117]] when [[H1931]] Eli [[H5941]] laid down [[H7901]] in his place, [[H4725]] and his eyes [[H5869]] began [[H2490]] to wax dim, [[H3544]] he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] see; [[H7200]]

### 3
And ere [[H2962]] the lamp [[H5216]] of God [[H430]] went out [[H3518]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] where [[H834]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] and Samuel [[H8050]] was laid down [[H7901]]

### 4
That the Lord [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] Samuel: [[H8050]] and he answered, [[H559]] Here [[H2005]] I. [[H2005]]

### 5
And he ran [[H7323]] unto [[H413]] Eli, [[H5941]] and said, [[H559]] Here [[H2009]] I; for [[H3588]] thou calledst [[H7121]] me. And he said, [[H559]] I called [[H7121]] not; [[H3808]] lie down [[H7901]] again. [[H7725]] And he went [[H1980]] and lay down. [[H7901]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] yet [[H5750]] again, [[H3254]] Samuel. [[H8050]] And Samuel [[H8050]] arose [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Eli, [[H5941]] and said, [[H559]] Here [[H2005]] I; for [[H3588]] thou didst call [[H7121]] me. And he answered, [[H559]] I called [[H7121]] not, [[H3808]] my son; [[H1121]] lie down [[H7901]] again. [[H7725]]

### 7
Now Samuel [[H8050]] did not yet [[H2962]] know [[H3045]] the Lord, [[H3068]] neither was the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] yet [[H2962]] revealed [[H1540]] unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] Samuel [[H8050]] again [[H3254]] the third time. [[H7992]] And he arose [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Eli, [[H5941]] and said, [[H559]] Here [[H2005]] I; for [[H3588]] thou didst call [[H7121]] me. And Eli [[H5941]] perceived [[H995]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had called [[H7121]] the child. [[H5288]]

### 9
Therefore Eli [[H5941]] said [[H559]] unto Samuel, [[H8050]] Go, [[H1980]] lie down: [[H7901]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] he call [[H7121]] thee, that thou shalt say, [[H559]] Speak, [[H1696]] Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] heareth. [[H8085]] So Samuel [[H8050]] went [[H1980]] and lay down [[H7901]] in his place. [[H4725]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] came, [[H935]] and stood, [[H3320]] and called [[H7121]] as at other times, [[H6471]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Samuel. [[H8050]] Then Samuel [[H8050]] answered, [[H559]] Speak; [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] heareth. [[H8085]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will do [[H6213]] a thing [[H1697]] in Israel, [[H3478]] at which [[H834]] both [[H8147]] the ears [[H241]] of every one [[H3605]] that heareth [[H8085]] it shall tingle. [[H6750]]

### 12
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will perform [[H6965]] against [[H413]] Eli [[H5941]] all [[H3605]] which [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] concerning [[H413]] his house: [[H1004]] when I begin, [[H2490]] I will also make an end. [[H3615]]

### 13
For I have told [[H5046]] him that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will judge [[H8199]] his house [[H1004]] for [[H5704]] ever [[H5769]] for the iniquity [[H5771]] which [[H834]] he knoweth; [[H3045]] because [[H3588]] his sons [[H1121]] made themselves vile, [[H7043]] and he restrained [[H3543]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 14
And therefore [[H3651]] I have sworn [[H7650]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Eli, [[H5941]] that the iniquity [[H5771]] of Eli's [[H5941]] house [[H1004]] shall not [[H518]] be purged [[H3722]] with sacrifice [[H2077]] nor offering [[H4503]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 15
And Samuel [[H8050]] lay [[H7901]] until [[H5704]] the morning, [[H1242]] and opened [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And Samuel [[H8050]] feared [[H3372]] to shew [[H5046]] Eli [[H5941]] the vision. [[H4759]]

### 16
Then Eli [[H5941]] called [[H7121]] Samuel, [[H8050]] and said, [[H559]] Samuel, [[H8050]] my son. [[H1121]] And he answered, [[H559]] Here [[H2005]] I. [[H2005]]

### 17
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] hath said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee? I pray thee [[H4994]] hide [[H3582]] not [[H408]] from [[H4480]] me: God [[H430]] do so [[H6213]] to thee, and more also, [[H3254]] if [[H518]] thou hide [[H3582]] thing [[H1697]] from [[H4480]] me of all [[H3605]] the things [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 18
And Samuel [[H8050]] told [[H5046]]  him [[H853]] every [[H3605]] whit, [[H1697]] and hid [[H3582]] nothing [[H3808]] from [[H4480]] him. And he said, [[H559]] It [[H1931]] the Lord: [[H3068]] let him do [[H6213]] what seemeth [[H5869]] him good. [[H2896]]

### 19
And Samuel [[H8050]] grew, [[H1431]] and the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] him, and did let none [[H3808]] of his words [[H1697]] fall [[H5307]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 20
And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] from Dan [[H1835]] even to [[H5704]] Beer-sheba [[H884]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Samuel [[H8050]] established [[H539]] a prophet [[H5030]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] again [[H3254]] in Shiloh: [[H7887]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] revealed himself [[H1540]] to [[H413]] Samuel [[H8050]] in Shiloh [[H7887]] by the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
