### 1
Then Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] a vial [[H6378]] of oil, [[H8081]] and poured [[H3332]] upon [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and kissed [[H5401]] him, and said, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath anointed [[H4886]] thee captain [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] his inheritance? [[H5159]]

### 2
When thou art departed [[H1980]] from me [[H5978]] to day, [[H3117]] then thou shalt find [[H4672]] two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] by [[H5973]] Rachel's [[H7354]] sepulchre [[H6900]] in the border [[H1366]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] at Zelzah; [[H6766]] and they will say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, The asses [[H860]] which [[H834]] thou wentest [[H1980]] to seek [[H1245]] are found: [[H4672]] and, lo, [[H2009]] thy father [[H1]] hath left [[H5203]] the care [[H1697]] of the asses, [[H860]] and sorroweth [[H1672]] for you, saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] for my son? [[H1121]]

### 3
Then shalt thou go on [[H2498]] forward [[H1973]] from thence, [[H8033]] and thou shalt come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the plain [[H436]] of Tabor, [[H8396]] and there [[H8033]] shall meet [[H4672]] thee three [[H7969]] men [[H582]] going up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] God [[H430]] to Beth-el, [[H1008]] one [[H259]] carrying [[H5375]] three [[H7969]] kids, [[H1423]] and another [[H259]] carrying [[H5375]] three [[H7969]] loaves [[H3603]] of bread, [[H3899]] and another [[H259]] carrying [[H5375]] a bottle [[H5035]] of wine: [[H3196]]

### 4
And they will [[H7592]] salute [[H7965]] thee, and give [[H5414]] thee two [[H8147]] of bread; [[H3899]] which thou shalt receive [[H3947]] of their hands. [[H3027]]

### 5
After that [[H310]] thou shalt come [[H935]] to the hill [[H1389]] of God, [[H430]] where [[H834]] the garrison [[H5333]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when thou art come thither [[H935]] to the city, [[H5892]] that thou shalt meet [[H6293]] a company [[H2256]] of prophets [[H5030]] coming down [[H3381]] from the high place [[H1116]] with a psaltery, [[H5035]] and a tabret, [[H8596]] and a pipe, [[H2485]] and a harp, [[H3658]] before [[H6440]] them; and they [[H1992]] shall prophesy: [[H5012]]

### 6
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] will come [[H6743]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and thou shalt prophesy [[H5012]] with them, [[H5973]] and shalt be turned [[H2015]] into another [[H312]] man. [[H376]]

### 7
And let it be, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] these [[H428]] signs [[H226]] are come [[H935]] unto thee, thou do [[H6213]] as occasion [[H4672]] serve [[H3027]] thee; for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 8
And thou shalt go down [[H3381]] before [[H6440]] me to Gilgal; [[H1537]] and, behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will come down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] thee, to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] of peace offerings: [[H8002]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] shalt thou tarry, [[H3176]] till [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] to [[H413]] thee, and shew [[H3045]]  thee [[H853]] what [[H834]] thou shalt do. [[H6213]]

### 9
And it was [[H1961]] that when he had turned [[H6437]] his back [[H7926]] to go [[H1980]] from [[H5973]] Samuel, [[H8050]] God [[H430]] gave [[H2015]] him another [[H312]] heart: [[H3820]] and all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] signs [[H226]] came to pass [[H935]] that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

### 10
And when they came [[H935]] thither [[H8033]] to the hill, [[H1389]] behold, [[H2009]] a company [[H2256]] of prophets [[H5030]] met [[H7125]] him; and the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came [[H6743]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he prophesied [[H5012]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when all [[H3605]] that knew [[H3045]] him beforetime [[H865]] saw [[H7200]] that, behold, [[H2009]] he prophesied [[H5012]] among [[H5973]] the prophets, [[H5030]] then the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H7453]] What [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] is come [[H1961]] unto the son [[H1121]] of Kish? [[H7027]] Saul [[H7586]] also [[H1571]] among the prophets? [[H5030]]

### 12
And one [[H376]] of the same place [[H8033]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] But who [[H4310]] their father? [[H1]] Therefore [[H5921]] it became [[H1961]] a proverb, [[H4912]] Saul [[H7586]] also [[H1571]] among the prophets? [[H5030]]

### 13
And when he had made an end [[H3615]] of prophesying, [[H5012]] he came [[H935]] to the high place. [[H1116]]

### 14
And Saul's [[H7586]] uncle [[H1730]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him and to [[H413]] his servant, [[H5288]] Whither [[H575]] went [[H1980]] ye? And he said, [[H559]] To seek [[H1245]] the asses: [[H860]] and when we saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] no where, [[H369]] we came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Samuel. [[H8050]]

### 15
And Saul's [[H7586]] uncle [[H1730]] said, [[H559]] Tell [[H5046]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] what [[H4100]] Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto you. [[H559]]

### 16
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his uncle, [[H1730]] He told [[H5046]] us plainly [[H5046]] that [[H3588]] the asses [[H860]] were found. [[H4672]] But of the matter [[H1697]] of the kingdom, [[H4410]] whereof [[H834]] Samuel [[H8050]] spake, [[H559]] he told [[H5046]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 17
And Samuel [[H8050]] called [[H6817]] the people [[H5971]]  together [[H853]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] to Mizpeh; [[H4709]]

### 18
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I [[H595]] brought up [[H5927]] Israel [[H3478]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and delivered [[H5337]] you out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and out of the hand [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] kingdoms, [[H4467]] of them that oppressed [[H3905]] you: [[H3905]]

### 19
And ye [[H859]] have this day [[H3117]] rejected [[H3988]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] himself [[H1931]] saved [[H3467]] you out of all [[H3605]] your adversities [[H7451]] and your tribulations; [[H6869]] and ye have said [[H559]] unto him, but [[H3588]] set [[H7760]] a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] us. Now [[H6258]] therefore present yourselves [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] by your tribes, [[H7626]] and by your thousands. [[H505]]

### 20
And when Samuel [[H8050]]  had caused [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] to come near, [[H7126]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] was taken. [[H3920]]

### 21
When he had caused [[H853]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] to come near [[H7126]] by their families, [[H4940]] the family [[H4940]] of Matri [[H4309]] was taken, [[H3920]] and Saul [[H7586]] the son [[H1121]] of Kish [[H7027]] was taken: [[H3920]] and when they sought [[H1245]] him, he could not [[H3808]] be found. [[H4672]]

### 22
Therefore they inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord [[H3068]] further, [[H5750]] if the man [[H376]] should yet [[H5750]] come [[H935]] thither. [[H1988]] And the Lord [[H3068]] answered, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] hath hid himself [[H2244]] among [[H413]] the stuff. [[H3627]]

### 23
And they ran [[H7323]] and fetched [[H3947]] him thence: [[H8033]] and when he stood [[H3320]] among [[H8432]] the people, [[H5971]] he was higher [[H1361]] than any [[H3605]] of the people [[H5971]] from his shoulders [[H7926]] and upward. [[H4605]]

### 24
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] See [[H7200]] ye him whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath chosen, [[H977]] that [[H3588]] none [[H369]] like him [[H3644]] among all [[H3605]] the people? [[H5971]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] shouted, [[H7321]] and said, [[H559]] God save [[H2421]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 25
Then Samuel [[H8050]] told [[H1696]] the people [[H5971]] the manner [[H4941]] of the kingdom, [[H4410]] and wrote [[H3789]] in a book, [[H5612]] and laid up [[H3240]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]] And Samuel [[H8050]] sent [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] away, every man [[H376]] to his house. [[H1004]]

### 26
And Saul [[H7586]] also [[H1571]] went [[H1980]] home [[H1004]] to Gibeah; [[H1390]] and there went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] him a band of men, [[H2428]] whose [[H834]] hearts [[H3820]] God [[H430]] had touched. [[H5060]]

### 27
But the children [[H1121]] of Belial [[H1100]] said, [[H559]] How [[H4100]] shall this [[H2088]] man save [[H3467]] us? And they despised [[H959]] him, and brought [[H935]] him no [[H3808]] presents. [[H4503]] But he held his peace. [[H2790]]
