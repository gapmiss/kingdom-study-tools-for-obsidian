### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he had made an end [[H3615]] of speaking [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] that the soul [[H5315]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] was knit [[H7194]] with the soul [[H5315]] of David, [[H1732]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] loved [[H157]] him as his own soul. [[H5315]]

### 2
And Saul [[H7586]] took [[H3947]] him that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and would let [[H5414]] him go no more home [[H7725]] to his father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 3
Then Jonathan [[H3083]] and David [[H1732]] made [[H3772]] a covenant, [[H1285]] because he loved [[H160]] him as his own soul. [[H5315]]

### 4
And Jonathan [[H3083]] stripped himself [[H6584]]  of [[H853]] the robe [[H4598]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] him, and gave [[H5414]] it to David, [[H1732]] and his garments, [[H4055]] even to [[H5704]] his sword, [[H2719]] and to [[H5704]] his bow, [[H7198]] and to [[H5704]] his girdle. [[H2290]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] went out [[H3318]] whithersoever [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] him, behaved himself wisely: [[H7919]] and Saul [[H7586]] set [[H7760]] him over [[H5921]] the men [[H582]] of war, [[H4421]] and he was accepted [[H3190]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] and also [[H1571]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Saul's [[H7586]] servants. [[H5650]]

### 6
And it came to pass [[H1961]] as they came, [[H935]] when David [[H1732]] was returned [[H7725]] from the slaughter [[H5221]]  of [[H853]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] that the women [[H802]] came out [[H3318]] of all [[H3605]] cities [[H5892]] of Israel, [[H3478]] singing [[H7891]] and dancing, [[H4246]] to meet [[H7125]] king [[H4428]] Saul, [[H7586]] with tabrets, [[H8596]] with joy, [[H8057]] and with instruments of musick. [[H7991]]

### 7
And the women [[H802]] answered [[H6030]] as they played, [[H7832]] and said, [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] hath slain [[H5221]] his thousands, [[H505]] and David [[H1732]] his ten thousands. [[H7233]]

### 8
And Saul [[H7586]] was very [[H3966]] wroth, [[H2734]] and the [[H2088]] saying [[H1697]] displeased [[H3415]] him; and he said, [[H559]] They have ascribed [[H5414]] unto David [[H1732]] ten thousands, [[H7233]] and to me they have ascribed [[H5414]] thousands: [[H505]] and can he have more [[H5750]] but [[H389]] the kingdom? [[H4410]]

### 9
And [[H1961]] Saul [[H7586]] eyed [[H5770]] David [[H1732]] from that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] and forward. [[H1973]]

### 10
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that the evil [[H7451]] spirit [[H7307]] from God [[H430]] came [[H6743]] upon [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] and he prophesied [[H5012]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the house: [[H1004]] and David [[H1732]] played [[H5059]] with his hand, [[H3027]] as at other times: [[H3117]] and a javelin [[H2595]] in Saul's [[H7586]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
And Saul [[H7586]] cast [[H2904]] the javelin; [[H2595]] for he said, [[H559]] I will smite [[H5221]] David [[H1732]] even to the wall [[H7023]] And David [[H1732]] avoided out [[H5437]] of his presence [[H6440]] twice. [[H6471]]

### 12
And Saul [[H7586]] was afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] David, [[H1732]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] him, and was departed [[H5493]] from Saul. [[H7586]]

### 13
Therefore Saul [[H7586]] removed [[H5493]] him from [[H5973]] him, and made [[H7760]] him his captain [[H8269]] over a thousand; [[H505]] and he went out [[H3318]] and came in [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] behaved himself wisely [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] his ways; [[H1870]] and the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 15
Wherefore when Saul [[H7586]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H834]] he [[H1931]] behaved himself [[H7919]] very [[H3966]] wisely, he was afraid [[H1481]] of him. [[H6440]]

### 16
But all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah [[H3063]] loved [[H157]] David, [[H1732]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] went out [[H3318]] and came in [[H935]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 17
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Behold [[H2009]] my elder [[H1419]] daughter [[H1323]] Merab, [[H4764]] her will I give [[H5414]] thee to wife: [[H802]] only [[H389]] be [[H1961]] thou valiant [[H1121]] for me, and fight [[H3898]] the Lord's [[H3068]] battles. [[H4421]] For Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Let not [[H408]] mine hand [[H3027]] be [[H1961]] upon him, but let the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] be [[H1961]] upon him. [[H1961]]

### 18
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Who [[H4310]] I? [[H595]] and what [[H4310]] my life, [[H2416]] my father's [[H1]] family [[H4940]] in Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H3588]] I should be [[H1961]] son in law [[H2860]] to the king? [[H4428]]

### 19
But it came to pass [[H1961]] at the time [[H6256]]  when [[H853]] Merab [[H4764]] Saul's [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] should have been given [[H5414]] to David, [[H1732]] that she [[H1931]] was given [[H5414]] unto Adriel [[H5741]] the Meholathite [[H4259]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 20
And Michal [[H4324]] Saul's [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] loved [[H157]] David: [[H1732]] and they told [[H5046]] Saul, [[H7586]] and the thing [[H1697]] pleased [[H3474]] him. [[H5869]]

### 21
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] I will give [[H5414]] him her, that she may be [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] to him, and that the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] may be [[H1961]] against him. Wherefore Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Thou shalt this day [[H3117]] be my son in law [[H2859]] in the twain. [[H8147]]

### 22
And Saul [[H7586]] commanded [[H6680]] his servants, [[H5650]] Commune [[H1696]] with [[H413]] David [[H1732]] secretly, [[H3909]] and say, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] hath delight [[H2654]] in thee, and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] love [[H157]] thee: now [[H6258]] therefore be the king's [[H4428]] son in law. [[H2859]]

### 23
And Saul's [[H7586]] servants [[H5650]] spake [[H1696]] those [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in the ears [[H241]] of David. [[H1732]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Seemeth [[H5869]] it to you light [[H7043]] to be a king's [[H4428]] son in law, [[H2859]] seeing that I [[H595]] a poor [[H7326]] man, [[H376]] and lightly esteemed? [[H7034]]

### 24
And the servants [[H5650]] of Saul [[H7586]] told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] On this [[H428]] manner [[H1697]] spake [[H1696]] David. [[H1732]]

### 25
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] to David, [[H1732]] The king [[H4428]] desireth [[H2656]] not [[H369]] any dowry, [[H4119]] but [[H3588]] an hundred [[H3967]] foreskins [[H6190]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] to be avenged [[H5358]] of the king's [[H4428]] enemies. [[H341]] But Saul [[H7586]] thought [[H2803]]  to make [[H853]] David [[H1732]] fall [[H5307]] by the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 26
And when his servants [[H5650]] told [[H5046]] David [[H1732]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] it pleased [[H1697]] David [[H1732]] well to be the king's [[H4428]] son in law: [[H2859]] and the days [[H3117]] were not [[H3808]] expired. [[H4390]]

### 27
Wherefore David [[H1732]] arose [[H6965]] and went, [[H1980]] he [[H1931]] and his men, [[H376]] and slew [[H5221]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] two hundred [[H3967]] men; [[H376]] and David [[H1732]] brought [[H935]] their foreskins, [[H6190]] and they gave them in full tale [[H4390]] to the king, [[H4428]] that he might be the king's [[H4428]] son in law. [[H2859]] And Saul [[H7586]] gave [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] Michal [[H4324]] his daughter [[H1323]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 28
And Saul [[H7586]] saw [[H7200]] and knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] and Michal [[H4324]] Saul's [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] loved [[H157]] him. [[H157]]

### 29
And Saul [[H7586]] was yet [[H5750]] the more [[H3254]] afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] David; [[H1732]] and Saul [[H7586]] became [[H1961]] David's [[H1732]] enemy [[H341]] continually. [[H3117]]

### 30
Then the princes [[H8269]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] went forth: [[H3318]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] after [[H1767]] they went forth, [[H3318]] David [[H1732]] behaved himself more wisely [[H7919]] than all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] of Saul; [[H7586]] so that his name [[H8034]] was much [[H3966]] set by.
