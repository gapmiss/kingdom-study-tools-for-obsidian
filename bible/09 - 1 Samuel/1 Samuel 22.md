David [[H1732]] therefore departed [[H1980]] thence, [[H8033]] and escaped [[H4422]] to [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] Adullam: [[H5725]] and when his brethren [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] his father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] heard [[H8085]] they went down [[H3381]] thither [[H8033]] to [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 2
And every [[H3605]] one [[H376]] in distress, [[H4689]] and every [[H3605]] one [[H376]] that [[H834]] in debt, [[H5378]] and every [[H3605]] one [[H376]] discontented, [[H4751]] gathered themselves [[H6908]] unto [[H413]] him; and he became [[H1961]] a captain [[H8269]] over [[H5921]] them: and there were [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] him about four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men. [[H376]]

### 3
And David [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] thence [[H8033]] to Mizpeh [[H4708]] of Moab: [[H4124]] and he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] Let my father [[H1]] and my mother, [[H517]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] come forth, [[H3318]] with [[H854]] you, till [[H5704]] I know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] God [[H430]] will do [[H6213]] for me. [[H6213]]

### 4
And he brought [[H5148]] them before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab: [[H4124]] and they dwelt [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] him all [[H3605]] the while [[H3117]] that David [[H1732]] was [[H1961]] in the hold. [[H4686]]

### 5
And the prophet [[H5030]] Gad [[H1410]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Abide [[H3427]] not [[H3808]] in the hold; [[H4686]] depart, [[H1980]] and get [[H935]] thee into the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]] Then David [[H1732]] departed, [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] into the forest [[H3293]] of Hareth. [[H2802]]

### 6
When Saul [[H7586]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] was discovered, [[H3045]] and the men [[H582]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, (now Saul [[H7586]] abode [[H3427]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] under [[H8478]] a tree [[H815]] in Ramah, [[H7414]] having his spear [[H2595]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] standing [[H5324]] about [[H5921]] him;) [[H5921]]

### 7
Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto his servants [[H5650]] that stood [[H5324]] about [[H5921]] him, Hear now, [[H8085]] ye Benjamites; [[H1145]] will the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] give [[H5414]] every one [[H3605]] of you fields [[H7704]] and vineyards, [[H3754]] make [[H7760]] you all [[H3605]] captains [[H8269]] of thousands, [[H505]] and captains [[H8269]] of hundreds; [[H3967]]

### 8
That [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] of you have conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] me, and none [[H369]] that sheweth [[H1540]] me [[H241]] that my son [[H1121]] hath made a league [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse, [[H3448]] and none [[H369]] of [[H4480]] you that is sorry [[H2470]] for [[H5921]] me, or sheweth [[H1540]]  unto [[H853]] me [[H241]] that [[H3588]] my son [[H1121]] hath stirred up [[H6965]] my servant [[H5650]] against [[H5921]] me, to lie in wait, [[H693]] as at this [[H2088]] day? [[H3117]]

### 9
Then answered [[H6030]] Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite, [[H130]] which [[H1931]] was set [[H5324]] over [[H5921]] the servants [[H5650]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and said, [[H559]] I saw [[H7200]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] coming [[H935]] to Nob, [[H5011]] to [[H413]] Ahimelech [[H288]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahitub. [[H285]]

### 10
And he inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord [[H3068]] for him, and gave [[H5414]] him victuals, [[H6720]] and gave [[H5414]] him the sword [[H2719]] of Goliath [[H1555]] the Philistine. [[H6430]]

### 11
Then the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] to call [[H7121]] Ahimelech [[H288]] the priest, [[H3548]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahitub, [[H285]] and all [[H3605]] his father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] the priests [[H3548]] that [[H834]] in Nob: [[H5011]] and they came [[H935]] all [[H3605]] of them to [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 12
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] thou son [[H1121]] of Ahitub. [[H285]] And he answered, [[H559]] Here [[H2005]] I my lord. [[H113]]

### 13
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Why [[H4100]] have ye conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] me, thou [[H859]] and the son [[H1121]] of Jesse, [[H3448]] in that thou hast given [[H5414]] him bread, [[H3899]] and a sword, [[H2719]] and hast inquired [[H7592]] of God [[H430]] for him, that he should rise [[H6965]] against [[H413]] me, to lie in wait, [[H693]] as at this [[H2088]] day? [[H3117]]

### 14
Then Ahimelech [[H288]] answered [[H6030]] the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] And who [[H4310]] faithful [[H539]] among all [[H3605]] thy servants [[H5650]] as David, [[H1732]] which is the king's [[H4428]] son in law, [[H2860]] and goeth [[H5493]] at [[H413]] thy bidding, [[H4928]] and is honourable [[H3513]] in thine house? [[H1004]]

### 15
Did I then [[H3117]] begin [[H2490]] to inquire [[H7592]] of God [[H430]] for him? be it far [[H2486]] from me: let not [[H408]] the king [[H4428]] impute [[H7760]] thing [[H1697]] unto his servant, [[H5650]] to all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of my father: [[H1]] for [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] knew [[H3045]] nothing [[H1697]] of all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] less [[H6996]] or [[H176]] more. [[H1419]]

### 16
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die, [[H4191]] Ahimelech, [[H288]] thou, [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] thy father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 17
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto the footmen [[H7323]] that stood [[H5324]] about [[H5921]] him, Turn, [[H5437]] and slay [[H4191]] the priests [[H3548]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] their hand [[H3027]] also [[H1571]] with [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] and because [[H3588]] they knew [[H3045]] when [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] fled, [[H1272]] and did not [[H3808]] shew [[H1540]] it to me. [[H241]] But the servants [[H5650]] of the king [[H4428]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] put forth [[H7971]] their hand [[H3027]] to fall [[H6293]] upon the priests [[H3548]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to Doeg, [[H1673]] Turn [[H5437]] thou, [[H859]] and fall [[H6293]] upon the priests. [[H3548]] And Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite [[H130]] turned, [[H5437]] and he [[H1931]] fell [[H6293]] upon the priests, [[H3548]] and slew [[H4191]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] fourscore [[H8084]] and five [[H2568]] persons [[H376]] that did wear [[H5375]] a linen [[H906]] ephod. [[H646]]

### 19
And Nob, [[H5011]] the city [[H5892]] of the priests, [[H3548]] smote [[H5221]] he with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] both men [[H376]] and women, [[H802]] children [[H5768]] and sucklings, [[H3243]] and oxen, [[H7794]] and asses, [[H2543]] and sheep, [[H7716]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 20
And one [[H259]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Ahimelech [[H288]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahitub, [[H285]] named [[H8034]] Abiathar, [[H54]] escaped, [[H4422]] and fled [[H1272]] after [[H310]] David. [[H1732]]

### 21
And Abiathar [[H54]] shewed [[H5046]] David [[H1732]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] had slain [[H2026]] the Lord's [[H3068]] priests. [[H3548]]

### 22
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto Abiathar, [[H54]] I knew [[H3045]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] when [[H3588]] Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite [[H130]] there, [[H8033]] that [[H3588]] he would surely [[H5046]] tell [[H5046]] Saul: [[H7586]] I [[H595]] have occasioned [[H5437]] of all [[H3605]] the persons [[H5315]] of thy father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 23
Abide [[H3427]] thou with [[H854]] me, fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] he that [[H834]] seeketh [[H1245]] my life [[H5315]] seeketh [[H1245]] thy life: [[H5315]] but [[H3588]] with me thou [[H859]] in safeguard. [[H4931]]
