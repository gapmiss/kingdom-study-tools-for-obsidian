### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Samuel [[H8050]] was old, [[H2204]] that he made [[H7760]] his sons [[H1121]] judges [[H8199]] over Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
Now the name [[H8034]] of his firstborn [[H1121]] was [[H1961]] Joel; [[H3100]] and the name [[H8034]] of his second, [[H4932]] Abiah: [[H29]] judges [[H8199]] in Beer-sheba. [[H884]]

### 3
And his sons [[H1121]] walked [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] in his ways, [[H1870]] but turned aside [[H5186]] after [[H310]] lucre, [[H1215]] and took [[H3947]] bribes, [[H7810]] and perverted [[H5186]] judgment. [[H4941]]

### 4
Then all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] gathered themselves together, [[H6908]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Samuel [[H8050]] unto Ramah, [[H7414]]

### 5
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] thou [[H859]] art old, [[H2204]] and thy sons [[H1121]] walk [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] in thy ways: [[H1870]] now [[H6258]] make [[H7760]] us a king [[H4428]] to judge [[H8199]] us like all [[H3605]] the nations. [[H1471]]

### 6
But the thing [[H1697]] displeased [[H3415]] Samuel, [[H8050]] when [[H834]] they said, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]] us a king [[H4428]] to judge [[H8199]] us. And Samuel [[H8050]] prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Hearken [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the people [[H5971]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee: for [[H3588]] they have not [[H3808]] rejected [[H3988]] thee, but [[H3588]] they have rejected [[H3988]] me, that I should not reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 8
According to all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] which [[H834]] they have done [[H6213]] since the day [[H3117]] that I brought them up [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] even unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] wherewith they have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and served [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] so [[H3651]] do [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] unto thee. [[H1571]]

### 9
Now [[H6258]] therefore hearken [[H8085]] unto their voice: [[H6963]] howbeit [[H389]] yet [[H3588]] protest [[H5749]] solemnly [[H5749]] unto them, and shew [[H5046]] them the manner [[H4941]] of the king [[H4428]] that [[H834]] shall reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 10
And Samuel [[H8050]] told [[H559]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] that asked [[H7592]] of [[H853]] him a king. [[H4428]]

### 11
And he said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] will be [[H1961]] the manner [[H4941]] of the king [[H4428]] that [[H834]] shall reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] you: He will take [[H3947]] your sons, [[H1121]] and appoint [[H7760]] for himself, for his chariots, [[H4818]] and his horsemen; [[H6571]] and shall run [[H7323]] before [[H6440]] his chariots. [[H4818]]

### 12
And he will appoint [[H7760]] him captains [[H8269]] over thousands, [[H505]] and captains [[H8269]] over fifties; [[H2572]] and to ear [[H2790]] his ground, [[H2758]] and to reap [[H7114]] his harvest, [[H7105]] and to make [[H6213]] his instruments [[H3627]] of war, [[H4421]] and instruments [[H3627]] of his chariots. [[H7393]]

### 13
And he will take [[H3947]] your daughters [[H1323]] confectionaries, [[H7548]] and cooks, [[H2879]] and bakers. [[H644]]

### 14
And he will take [[H3947]] your fields, [[H7704]] and your vineyards, [[H3754]] and your oliveyards, [[H2132]] the best [[H2896]] and give [[H5414]] to his servants. [[H5650]]

### 15
And he will take the tenth [[H6237]] of your seed, [[H2233]] and of your vineyards, [[H3754]] and give [[H5414]] to his officers, [[H5631]] and to his servants. [[H5650]]

### 16
And he will take [[H3947]] your menservants, [[H5650]] and your maidservants, [[H8198]] and your goodliest [[H2896]] young men, [[H970]] and your asses, [[H2543]] and put [[H6213]] to his work. [[H4399]]

### 17
He will take the tenth [[H6237]] of your sheep: [[H6629]] and ye [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] his servants. [[H5650]]

### 18
And ye shall cry out [[H2199]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] because [[H6440]] of your king [[H4428]] which [[H834]] ye shall have chosen [[H977]] you; and the Lord [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] hear [[H6030]] you in that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

### 19
Nevertheless the people [[H5971]] refused [[H3985]] to obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of Samuel; [[H8050]] and they said, [[H559]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] we will have [[H1961]] a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] us; [[H5921]]

### 20
That we [[H587]] also [[H1571]] may be [[H1961]] like all [[H3605]] the nations; [[H1471]] and that our king [[H4428]] may judge [[H8199]] us, and go out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] us, and fight [[H3898]] our battles. [[H4421]]

### 21
And Samuel [[H8050]] heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the people, [[H5971]] and he rehearsed [[H1696]] them in the ears [[H241]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Hearken [[H8085]] unto their voice, [[H6963]] and make [[H4427]] them a king. [[H4428]] And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Go [[H1980]] ye every man [[H376]] unto his city. [[H5892]]
