### 1
Now the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered together [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] their armies [[H4264]] to Aphek: [[H663]] and the Israelites [[H3478]] pitched [[H2583]] by a fountain [[H5869]] which [[H834]] in Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 2
And the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] passed on [[H5674]] by hundreds, [[H3967]] and by thousands: [[H505]] but David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] passed on [[H5674]] in the rereward [[H314]] with [[H5973]] Achish. [[H397]]

### 3
Then said [[H559]] the princes [[H8269]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] What [[H4100]] these [[H428]] Hebrews [[H5680]] And Achish [[H397]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the princes [[H8269]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] David, [[H1732]] the servant [[H5650]] of Saul [[H7586]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] hath been [[H1961]] with [[H854]] me these [[H2088]] days, [[H3117]] or [[H176]] these [[H2088]] years, [[H8141]] and I have found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] fault [[H3972]] in him since [[H3117]] he fell [[H5307]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day? [[H3117]]

### 4
And the princes [[H8269]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] were wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] him; and the princes [[H8269]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] said [[H559]] unto him, Make this fellow [[H376]] return, [[H7725]] that he may go again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] thou hast appointed [[H6485]] him, and let him not [[H3808]] go down [[H3381]] with [[H5973]] us to battle, [[H4421]] lest [[H3808]] in the battle [[H4421]] he be [[H1961]] an adversary [[H7854]] to us: for wherewith [[H4100]] should he reconcile [[H7521]] himself [[H2088]] unto [[H413]] his master? [[H113]] not [[H3808]] with the heads [[H7218]] of these [[H1992]] men? [[H582]]

### 5
not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] David, [[H1732]] of whom [[H834]] they sang [[H6030]] one to another in dances, [[H4246]] saying, [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] slew [[H5221]] his thousands, [[H505]] and David [[H1732]] his ten thousands? [[H7233]]

### 6
Then Achish [[H397]] called [[H7121]] David, [[H1732]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Surely, the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] thou [[H859]] hast been upright, [[H3477]] and thy going out [[H3318]] and thy coming in [[H935]] with [[H854]] me in the host [[H4264]] good [[H2896]] in my sight: [[H5869]] for [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] evil [[H7451]] in thee since the day [[H3117]] of thy coming [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day: [[H3117]] nevertheless the lords [[H5633]] favour [[H2896]] thee [[H859]] not. [[H5869]]

### 7
Wherefore now [[H6258]] return, [[H7725]] and go [[H1980]] in peace, [[H7965]] that thou displease [[H7451]] not [[H3808]] the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Achish, [[H397]] But [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] have I done? [[H6213]] and what [[H4100]] hast thou found [[H4672]] in thy servant [[H5650]] so long as [[H3117]] I have been [[H1961]] with thee [[H6440]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] I may not [[H3808]] go [[H935]] fight [[H3898]] against the enemies [[H341]] of my lord [[H113]] the king? [[H4428]]

### 9
And Achish [[H397]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] good [[H2896]] in my sight, [[H5869]] as an angel [[H4397]] of God: [[H430]] notwithstanding [[H389]] the princes [[H8269]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] have said, [[H559]] He shall not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] us to the battle. [[H4421]]

### 10
Wherefore now [[H6258]] rise up early [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] with thy master's [[H113]] servants [[H5650]] that [[H834]] are come [[H935]] with [[H854]] thee: and as soon as ye be up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and have light, [[H215]] depart. [[H1980]]

### 11
So David [[H1732]] and his men [[H582]] rose up early [[H7925]] to depart [[H1980]] in the morning, [[H1242]] to return [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] And the Philistines [[H6430]] went up [[H5927]] to Jezreel. [[H3157]]
