[[1 Samuel 30|←]] • [[2 Samuel 1|→]]

### 1
Now the Philistines [[H6430]] fought [[H3898]] against Israel: [[H3478]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] fled [[H5127]] from before [[H6440]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and fell down [[H5307]] slain [[H2491]] in mount [[H2022]] Gilboa. [[H1533]]

### 2
And the Philistines [[H6430]] followed hard upon [[H1692]] Saul [[H7586]] and upon his sons; [[H1121]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] slew [[H5221]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] and Abinadab, [[H41]] and Malchi-shua, [[H4444]] Saul's [[H7586]] sons. [[H1121]]

### 3
And the battle [[H4421]] went sore [[H3513]] against [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] and the archers [[H3384]] hit [[H4672]] him; and he was sore [[H3966]] wounded [[H2342]] of the archers. [[H3384]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] unto his armourbearer, [[H5375]] Draw [[H8025]] thy sword, [[H2719]] and thrust me through [[H1856]] therewith; lest [[H6435]] these [[H428]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] come [[H935]] and thrust me through, [[H1856]] and abuse [[H5953]] me. But his armourbearer [[H5375]] would [[H14]] not; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] he was sore [[H3966]] afraid. [[H3372]] Therefore Saul [[H7586]] took [[H3947]] a sword, [[H2719]] and fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 5
And when his armourbearer [[H5375]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] was dead, [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] fell [[H5307]] likewise [[H1571]] upon [[H5921]] his sword, [[H2719]] and died [[H4191]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 6
So Saul [[H7586]] died, [[H4191]] and his three [[H7969]] sons, [[H1121]] and his armourbearer, [[H5375]] and [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] his men, [[H376]] that same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] together. [[H3162]]

### 7
And when the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the valley, [[H6010]] and that [[H834]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] fled, [[H5127]] and that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] and his sons [[H1121]] were dead, [[H4191]] they forsook [[H5800]] the cities, [[H5892]] and fled; [[H5127]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in them. [[H2004]]

### 8
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] when the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] to strip [[H6584]] the slain, [[H2491]] that they found [[H4672]] Saul [[H7586]] and his three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] fallen [[H5307]] in mount [[H2022]] Gilboa. [[H1533]]

### 9
And they cut off [[H3772]] his head, [[H7218]] and stripped off [[H6584]] his armour, [[H3627]] and sent [[H7971]] into the land [[H776]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] round about, [[H5439]] to publish [[H1319]] the house [[H1004]] of their idols, [[H6091]] and among [[H853]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 10
And they put [[H7760]] his armour [[H3627]] in the house [[H1004]] of Ashtaroth: [[H6252]] and they fastened [[H8628]] his body [[H1472]] to the wall [[H2346]] of Beth-shan. [[H1052]]

### 11
And when the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] heard [[H8085]] of that which [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had done [[H6213]] to Saul; [[H7586]]

### 12
All [[H3605]] the valiant [[H2428]] men [[H376]] arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] night, [[H3915]] and took [[H3947]] the body [[H1472]] of Saul [[H7586]] and the bodies [[H1472]] of his sons [[H1121]] from the wall [[H2346]] of Beth-shan, [[H1052]] and came [[H935]] to Jabesh, [[H3003]] and burnt [[H8313]] them there. [[H8033]]

### 13
And they took [[H3947]] their bones, [[H6106]] and buried [[H6912]] under [[H8478]] a tree [[H815]] at Jabesh, [[H3003]] and fasted [[H6684]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]
