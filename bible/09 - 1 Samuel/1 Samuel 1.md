### 1
Now there was [[H1961]] a certain [[H259]] man [[H376]] of [[H4480]] Ramathaim-zophim, [[H7436]] of mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and his name [[H8034]] Elkanah, [[H511]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeroham, [[H3395]] the son [[H1121]] of Elihu, [[H453]] the son [[H1121]] of Tohu, [[H8459]] the son [[H1121]] of Zuph, [[H6689]] an Ephrathite: [[H673]]

### 2
And he had two [[H8147]] wives; [[H802]] the name [[H8034]] of the one [[H259]] Hannah, [[H2584]] and the name [[H8034]] of the other [[H8145]] Peninnah: [[H6444]] and Peninnah [[H6444]] had [[H1961]] children, [[H3206]] but Hannah [[H2584]] had no [[H369]] children. [[H3206]]

### 3
And this [[H1931]] man [[H376]] went up [[H5927]] out of his city [[H5892]] yearly [[H3117]] to worship [[H7812]] and to sacrifice [[H2076]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] in Shiloh. [[H7887]] And the two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] of Eli, [[H5941]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas, [[H6372]] the priests [[H3548]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] there. [[H8033]]

### 4
And when the time [[H3117]] was [[H1961]] that Elkanah [[H511]] offered, [[H2076]] he gave [[H5414]] to Peninnah [[H6444]] his wife, [[H802]] and to all [[H3605]] her sons [[H1121]] and her daughters, [[H1323]] portions: [[H4490]]

### 5
But unto Hannah [[H2584]] he gave [[H5414]] a [[H259]] worthy [[H639]] portion; [[H4490]] for [[H3588]] he loved [[H157]] Hannah: [[H2584]] but the Lord [[H3068]] had shut up [[H5462]] her womb. [[H7358]]

### 6
And her adversary [[H6869]] also [[H1571]] provoked [[H3707]] her sore, [[H3708]] for to [[H5668]] make her fret, [[H7481]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had shut [[H5462]] up [[H1157]] her womb. [[H7358]]

### 7
And he did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] year [[H8141]] by year, [[H8141]] when [[H1767]] she went up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] so [[H3651]] she provoked [[H3707]] her; therefore she wept, [[H1058]] and did not [[H3808]] eat. [[H398]]

### 8
Then said [[H559]] Elkanah [[H511]] her husband [[H376]] to her, Hannah, [[H2584]] why [[H4100]] weepest [[H1058]] thou? and why [[H4100]] eatest [[H398]] thou not? [[H3808]] and why [[H4100]] is thy heart [[H3824]] grieved? [[H3415]] not [[H3808]] I [[H595]] better [[H2896]] to thee than ten [[H6235]] sons? [[H1121]]

### 9
So Hannah [[H2584]] rose up [[H6965]] after [[H310]] they had eaten [[H398]] in Shiloh, [[H7887]] and after [[H310]] they had drunk. [[H8354]] Now Eli [[H5941]] the priest [[H3548]] sat [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] a seat [[H3678]] by [[H5921]] a post [[H4201]] of the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
And she [[H1931]] in bitterness [[H4751]] of soul, [[H5315]] and prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and wept [[H1058]] sore. [[H1058]]

### 11
And she vowed [[H5087]] a vow, [[H5088]] and said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] if [[H518]] thou wilt indeed [[H7200]] look [[H7200]] on the affliction [[H6040]] of thine handmaid, [[H519]] and remember [[H2142]] me, and not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] thine handmaid, [[H519]] but wilt give [[H5414]] unto thine handmaid [[H519]] a man [[H376]] child, [[H2233]] then I will give [[H5414]] him unto the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] and there shall no [[H3808]] razor [[H4177]] come [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]]

### 12
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as [[H3588]] she continued [[H7235]] praying [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that Eli [[H5941]] marked [[H8104]] her mouth. [[H6310]]

### 13
Now Hannah, [[H2584]] she [[H1931]] spake [[H1696]] in [[H5921]] her heart; [[H3820]] only [[H7535]] her lips [[H8193]] moved, [[H5128]] but her voice [[H6963]] was not [[H3808]] heard: [[H8085]] therefore Eli [[H5941]] thought [[H2803]] she had been drunken. [[H7910]]

### 14
And Eli [[H5941]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, How [[H5704]] long [[H4970]] wilt thou be drunken? [[H7937]] put away [[H5493]] thy wine [[H3196]] from [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 15
And Hannah [[H2584]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] No, [[H3808]] my lord, [[H113]] I a woman [[H802]] of a sorrowful [[H7186]] spirit: [[H7307]] I [[H595]] have drunk [[H8354]] neither [[H3808]] wine [[H3196]] nor strong drink, [[H7941]] but have poured out [[H8210]] my soul [[H5315]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
Count [[H5414]] not [[H408]] thine handmaid [[H519]] for [[H6440]] a daughter [[H1323]] of Belial: [[H1100]] for [[H3588]] out of the abundance [[H7230]] of my complaint [[H7879]] and grief [[H3708]] have I spoken [[H1696]] hitherto. [[H5704]]

### 17
Then Eli [[H5941]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] in peace: [[H7965]] and the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] grant [[H5414]] thy petition [[H7596]] that [[H834]] thou hast asked [[H7592]] of [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 18
And she said, [[H559]] Let thine handmaid [[H8198]] find [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight. [[H5869]] So the woman [[H802]] went [[H1980]] her way, [[H1870]] and did eat, [[H398]] and her countenance [[H6440]] was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]]

### 19
And they rose up in the morning [[H1242]] early, [[H7925]] and worshipped [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and returned, [[H7725]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] their house [[H1004]] to Ramah: [[H7414]] and Elkanah [[H511]] knew [[H3045]] Hannah [[H2584]] his wife; [[H802]] and the Lord [[H3068]] remembered [[H2142]] her. [[H2142]]

### 20
Wherefore it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the time [[H3117]] was come [[H8622]] about after Hannah [[H2584]] had conceived, [[H2029]] that she bare [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Because [[H3588]] I have asked [[H7592]] him of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
And the man [[H376]] Elkanah, [[H511]] and all [[H3605]] his house, [[H1004]] went up [[H5927]] to offer [[H2076]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] the yearly [[H3117]] sacrifice, [[H2077]] and his vow. [[H5088]]

### 22
But Hannah [[H2584]] went not up; [[H5927]] for [[H3588]] she said [[H559]] unto her husband, [[H376]] until [[H5704]] the child [[H5288]] be weaned, [[H1580]] and I will bring [[H935]] him, that he may appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and there [[H8033]] abide [[H3427]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 23
And Elkanah [[H511]] her husband [[H376]] said [[H559]] unto her, Do [[H6213]] what seemeth [[H5869]] thee good; [[H2896]] tarry [[H3427]] until [[H5704]] thou have weaned [[H1580]] him; only [[H389]] the Lord [[H3068]] establish [[H6965]] his word. [[H1697]] So the woman [[H802]] abode, [[H3427]] and gave her son [[H1121]] suck [[H3243]] until [[H5704]] she weaned [[H1580]] him. [[H1580]]

### 24
And when [[H834]] she had weaned [[H1580]] him, she took him up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] her, with three [[H7969]] bullocks, [[H6499]] and one [[H259]] ephah [[H374]] of flour, [[H7058]] and a bottle [[H5035]] of wine, [[H3196]] and brought [[H935]] him unto the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in Shiloh: [[H7887]] and the child [[H5288]] young. [[H5288]]

### 25
And they slew [[H7819]] a bullock, [[H6499]] and brought [[H935]] the child [[H5288]] to [[H413]] Eli. [[H5941]]

### 26
And she said, [[H559]] Oh [[H994]] my lord, [[H113]] thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] my lord, [[H113]] I [[H589]] the woman [[H802]] that stood [[H5324]] by [[H5973]] thee here, [[H2088]] praying [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
For [[H413]] this [[H2088]] child [[H5288]] I prayed; [[H6419]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]]  me [[H853]] my petition [[H7596]] which [[H834]] I asked [[H7592]] of him: [[H5973]]

### 28
Therefore also [[H1571]] I [[H595]] have lent [[H7592]] him to the Lord; [[H3068]] as long [[H3605]] as [[H834]] he liveth [[H3117]] he [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] lent [[H7592]] to the Lord. [[H3068]] And he worshipped [[H7812]] the Lord [[H3068]] there. [[H8033]]
