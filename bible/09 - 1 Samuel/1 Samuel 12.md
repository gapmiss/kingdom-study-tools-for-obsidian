### 1
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have hearkened [[H8085]] unto your voice [[H6963]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] ye said [[H559]] unto me, and have made [[H4427]] a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 2
And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] walketh [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] you: and I [[H589]] am old [[H2204]] and grayheaded; [[H7867]] and, behold, [[H2009]] my sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] you: and I [[H589]] have walked [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] you from my childhood [[H5271]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 3
Behold, [[H2005]] here I witness [[H6030]] against me before [[H5048]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and before [[H5048]] his anointed: [[H4899]] whose [[H4310]] ox [[H7794]] have I taken? [[H3947]] or whose [[H4310]] ass [[H2543]] have I taken? [[H3947]] or whom [[H4310]] have I defrauded? [[H6231]] whom [[H4310]] have I oppressed? [[H7533]] or of whose hand [[H3027]] have I received [[H3947]] bribe [[H3724]] to blind [[H5956]] mine eyes [[H5869]] therewith? and I will restore [[H7725]] it you. [[H7725]]

### 4
And they said, [[H559]] Thou hast not [[H3808]] defrauded [[H6231]] us, nor [[H3808]] oppressed [[H7533]] us, neither [[H3808]] hast thou taken [[H3947]] ought [[H3972]] of any man's [[H376]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 5
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, The Lord [[H3068]] witness [[H5707]] against you, and his anointed [[H4899]] witness [[H5707]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] ye have not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] ought [[H3972]] in my hand. [[H3027]] And they answered, [[H559]] witness. [[H5707]]

### 6
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] advanced [[H6213]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] and that [[H834]] brought up [[H5927]] your fathers [[H1]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 7
Now [[H6258]] therefore stand still, [[H3320]] that I may reason [[H8199]] with [[H854]] you before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]]  of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the righteous acts [[H6666]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] to [[H854]] you and to [[H854]] your fathers. [[H1]]

### 8
When [[H834]] Jacob [[H3290]] was come [[H935]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] and your fathers [[H1]] cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] then the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] which brought forth [[H3318]] your fathers [[H1]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and made them dwell [[H3427]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 9
And when they forgat [[H7911]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] he sold [[H4376]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Sisera, [[H5516]] captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] of Hazor, [[H2674]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and they fought [[H3898]] against them. [[H3898]]

### 10
And they cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] We have sinned, [[H2398]] because [[H3588]] we have forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and have served [[H5647]] Baalim [[H1168]] and Ashtaroth: [[H6252]] but now [[H6258]] deliver [[H5337]] us out of the hand [[H3027]] of our enemies, [[H341]] and we will serve [[H5647]] thee. [[H5647]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] and Bedan, [[H917]] and Jephthah, [[H3316]] and Samuel, [[H8050]] and delivered [[H5337]] you out of the hand [[H3027]] of your enemies [[H341]] on every side, [[H5439]] and ye dwelled [[H3427]] safe. [[H983]]

### 12
And when ye saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Nahash [[H5176]] the king [[H4428]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] came [[H935]] against [[H5921]] you, ye said [[H559]] unto me, Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] a king [[H4428]] shall reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] us: when the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] your king. [[H4428]]

### 13
Now [[H6258]] therefore behold [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] whom [[H834]] ye have chosen, [[H977]] whom [[H834]] ye have desired! [[H7592]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath set [[H5414]] a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 14
If [[H518]] ye will fear [[H3372]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] him, and obey [[H8085]] his voice, [[H6963]] and not [[H3808]] rebel against [[H4784]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] then shall both [[H1571]] ye [[H859]] and also [[H1571]] the king [[H4428]] that [[H834]] reigneth [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] you continue [[H1961]] following [[H310]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]]

### 15
But if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] but rebel against [[H4784]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] then shall the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] against you, as against your fathers. [[H1]]

### 16
Now [[H6258]] therefore [[H1571]] stand [[H3320]] and see [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] thing, [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] before your eyes. [[H5869]]

### 17
not [[H3808]] wheat [[H2406]] harvest [[H7105]] to day? [[H3117]] I will call [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he shall send [[H5414]] thunder [[H6963]] and rain; [[H4306]] that ye may perceive [[H3045]] and see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] your wickedness [[H7451]] great, [[H7227]] which [[H834]] ye have done [[H6213]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] in asking [[H7592]] you a king. [[H4428]]

### 18
So Samuel [[H8050]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H5414]] thunder [[H6963]] and rain [[H4306]] that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] greatly [[H3966]] feared [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] and Samuel. [[H8050]]

### 19
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] thy servants [[H5650]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] that we die [[H4191]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] we have added [[H3254]] unto [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] our sins [[H2403]] evil, [[H7451]] to ask [[H7592]] us a king. [[H4428]]

### 20
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] ye [[H859]] have done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] wickedness: [[H7451]] yet [[H389]] turn not aside [[H5493]] from following [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] but serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] your heart; [[H3824]]

### 21
And turn ye not aside: [[H5493]] for [[H3588]] after [[H310]] vain [[H8414]] which [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] profit [[H3276]] nor [[H3808]] deliver; [[H5337]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] vain. [[H8414]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5203]] his people [[H5971]] for his great [[H1419]] name's [[H8034]] sake: [[H5668]] because [[H3588]] it hath pleased [[H2974]] the Lord [[H3068]] to make [[H6213]] you his people. [[H5971]]

### 23
Moreover [[H1571]] as for me, [[H595]] God forbid [[H2486]] that I should sin [[H2398]] against the Lord [[H3068]] in ceasing [[H2308]] to pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] you: but I will teach [[H3384]] you the good [[H2896]] and the right [[H3477]] way: [[H1870]]

### 24
Only [[H389]] fear [[H3372]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] him in truth [[H571]] with all [[H3605]] your heart: [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] consider [[H7200]] how [[H834]] great he hath done [[H1431]] for [[H5973]] you. [[H5973]]

### 25
But if [[H518]] ye shall still [[H7489]] do wickedly, [[H7489]] ye shall be consumed, [[H5595]] both [[H1571]] ye [[H859]] and [[H1571]] your king. [[H4428]]
