### 1
And the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] in the country [[H7704]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] seven [[H7651]] months. [[H2320]]

### 2
And the Philistines [[H6430]] called [[H7121]] for the priests [[H3548]] and the diviners, [[H7080]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] to the ark [[H727]] of the Lord? [[H3068]] tell [[H3045]] us wherewith [[H4100]] we shall send [[H7971]] it to his place. [[H4725]]

### 3
And they said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] ye send away [[H7971]] the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] send [[H7971]] it not [[H408]] empty; [[H7387]] but [[H3588]] in any wise [[H7725]] return [[H7725]] him a trespass offering: [[H817]] then [[H227]] ye shall be healed, [[H7495]] and it shall be known [[H3045]] to you why [[H4100]] his hand [[H3027]] is not [[H3808]] removed [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] you. [[H4480]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] they, What [[H4100]] the trespass offering [[H817]] which [[H834]] we shall return [[H7725]] to him? They answered, [[H559]] Five [[H2568]] golden [[H2091]] emerods, [[H6076]] and five [[H2568]] golden [[H2091]] mice, [[H5909]] the number [[H4557]] of the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] for [[H3588]] one [[H259]] plague [[H4046]] on you all, [[H3605]] and on your lords. [[H5633]]

### 5
Wherefore ye shall make [[H6213]] images [[H6754]] of your emerods, [[H6076]] and images [[H6754]] of your mice [[H5909]] that mar [[H7843]] the land; [[H776]] and ye shall give [[H5414]] glory [[H3519]] unto the God [[H430]] of Israel: [[H3478]] peradventure [[H194]] he will lighten [[H7043]] his hand [[H3027]] from off [[H5921]] you, and from off [[H5921]] your gods, [[H430]] and from off [[H5921]] your land. [[H776]]

### 6
Wherefore [[H4100]] then do ye harden [[H3513]] your hearts, [[H3824]] as [[H834]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] and Pharaoh [[H6547]] hardened [[H3513]] their hearts? [[H3820]] when [[H834]] he had wrought wonderfully [[H5953]] among them, did they not [[H3808]] let the people go, [[H7971]] and they departed? [[H1980]]

### 7
Now [[H6258]] therefore make [[H6213]] a [[H259]] new [[H2319]] cart, [[H5699]] and take [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] milch [[H5763]] kine, [[H6510]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] there hath come [[H5927]] no [[H3808]] yoke, [[H5923]] and tie [[H631]] the kine [[H6510]] to the cart, [[H5699]] and bring [[H7725]] their calves [[H1121]] home [[H1004]] from [[H310]] them: [[H310]]

### 8
And take [[H3947]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and lay [[H5414]] it upon [[H413]] the cart; [[H5699]] and put [[H7760]] the jewels [[H3627]] of gold, [[H2091]] which [[H834]] ye return [[H7725]] him a trespass offering, [[H817]] in a coffer [[H712]] by the side [[H6654]] thereof; and send it away, [[H7971]] that it may go. [[H1980]]

### 9
And see, [[H7200]] if [[H518]] it goeth up [[H5927]] by the way [[H1870]] of his own coast [[H1366]] to Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] he [[H1931]] hath done [[H6213]]  us [[H853]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] evil: [[H7451]] but if [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] then we shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] his hand [[H3027]] smote [[H5060]] us; it [[H1931]] a chance [[H4745]] happened us. [[H1961]] to [[H1961]]

### 10
And the men [[H376]] did so; [[H6213]] and took [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] milch [[H5763]] kine, [[H6510]] and tied [[H631]] them to the cart, [[H5699]] and shut up [[H3607]] their calves [[H1121]] at home: [[H1004]]

### 11
And they laid [[H7760]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H413]] the cart, [[H5699]] and the coffer [[H712]] with [[H853]] the mice [[H5909]] of gold [[H2091]] and the images [[H6754]] of their emerods. [[H2914]]

### 12
And the kine [[H6510]] took the straight [[H3474]] way [[H1870]] to [[H5921]] the way [[H1870]] of Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] went along [[H1980]] the [[H259]] highway, [[H4546]] lowing [[H1600]] as they went, [[H1980]] and turned not aside [[H5493]] the right hand [[H3225]] or the left; [[H8040]] and the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] them unto [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of Beth-shemesh. [[H1053]]

### 13
And Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] reaping [[H7114]] their wheat [[H2406]] harvest [[H7105]] in the valley: [[H6010]] and they lifted up [[H5375]] their eyes, [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] the ark, [[H727]] and rejoiced [[H8055]] to see [[H7200]]

### 14
And the cart [[H5699]] came [[H935]] into [[H413]] the field [[H7704]] of Joshua, [[H3091]] a Beth-shemite, [[H1030]] and stood [[H5975]] there, [[H8033]] where [[H8033]] a great [[H1419]] stone: [[H68]] and they clave [[H1234]] the wood [[H6086]] of the cart, [[H5699]] and offered [[H5927]] the kine [[H6510]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
And the Levites [[H3881]] took down [[H3381]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the coffer [[H712]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] it, wherein [[H834]] the jewels [[H3627]] of gold [[H2091]] and put [[H7760]] on [[H413]] the great [[H1419]] stone: [[H68]] and the men [[H376]] of Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] the same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
And when the five [[H2568]] lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] had seen [[H7200]] they returned [[H7725]] to Ekron [[H6138]] the same [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

### 17
And these [[H428]] the golden [[H2091]] emerods [[H2914]] which [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] returned [[H7725]] a trespass offering [[H817]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] for Ashdod [[H795]] one, [[H259]] for Gaza [[H5804]] one, [[H259]] for Askelon [[H831]] one, [[H259]] for Gath [[H1661]] one, [[H259]] for Ekron [[H6138]] one; [[H259]]

### 18
And the golden [[H2091]] mice, [[H5909]] the number [[H4557]] of all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] to the five [[H2568]] lords, [[H5633]] of fenced [[H4013]] cities, [[H5892]] and of [[H5704]] country [[H6521]] villages, [[H3724]] even unto [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] Abel, [[H59]] whereon [[H834]] they set down [[H3240]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] in the field [[H7704]] of Joshua, [[H3091]] the Beth-shemite. [[H1030]]

### 19
And he smote [[H5221]] the men [[H376]] of Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] because [[H3588]] they had looked [[H7200]] into the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] even he smote [[H5221]] of the people [[H5971]] fifty [[H2572]] thousand [[H505]] and threescore and ten [[H7657]] men: [[H582]] and the people [[H5971]] lamented, [[H56]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had smitten [[H5221]] of the people [[H5971]] with a great [[H1419]] slaughter. [[H4347]]

### 20
And the men [[H376]] of Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] is able [[H3201]] to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] holy [[H6918]] Lord [[H3068]] God? [[H430]] and to [[H413]] whom [[H4310]] shall he go up [[H5927]] from us? [[H5921]]

### 21
And they sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Kirjath-jearim, [[H7157]] saying, [[H559]] The Philistines [[H6430]] have brought again [[H7725]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] come ye down, [[H3381]] fetch it up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] you. [[H413]]
