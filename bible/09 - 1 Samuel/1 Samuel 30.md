### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] were come [[H935]] to Ziklag [[H6860]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] that the Amalekites [[H6003]] had invaded [[H6584]] the south, [[H5045]] and Ziklag, [[H6860]] and smitten [[H5221]] Ziklag, [[H6860]] and burned [[H8313]] it with fire; [[H784]]

### 2
And had taken the women [[H802]] captives, [[H7617]] that [[H834]] therein: they slew [[H4191]] not [[H3808]] any, [[H376]] either [[H5704]] great [[H1419]] or small, [[H6996]] but carried away, [[H5090]] and went [[H1980]] on their way. [[H1870]]

### 3
So David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the city, [[H5892]] and, behold, [[H2009]] burned [[H8313]] with fire; [[H784]] and their wives, [[H802]] and their sons, [[H1121]] and their daughters, [[H1323]] were taken captives. [[H7617]]

### 4
Then David [[H1732]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him lifted up [[H5375]] their voice [[H6963]] and wept, [[H1058]] until [[H5704]] they had no more [[H369]] power [[H3581]] to weep. [[H1058]]

### 5
And David's [[H1732]] two [[H8147]] wives [[H802]] were taken captives, [[H7617]] Ahinoam [[H293]] the Jezreelitess, [[H3159]] and Abigail [[H26]] the wife [[H802]] of Nabal [[H5037]] the Carmelite. [[H3761]]

### 6
And David [[H1732]] was greatly [[H3966]] distressed; [[H3334]] for [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] spake [[H559]] of stoning [[H5619]] him, because [[H3588]] the soul [[H5315]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] was grieved, [[H4843]] every man [[H376]] for [[H5921]] his sons [[H1121]] and for [[H5921]] his daughters: [[H1323]] but David [[H1732]] encouraged himself [[H2388]] in the Lord [[H3068]] his God. [[H430]]

### 7
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abiathar [[H54]] the priest, [[H3548]] Ahimelech's [[H288]] son, [[H1121]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] bring me hither [[H5066]] the ephod. [[H646]] And Abiathar [[H54]] brought [[H5066]]  thither [[H853]] the ephod [[H646]] to [[H413]] David. [[H1732]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] at the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Shall I pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] this [[H2088]] troop? [[H1416]] shall I overtake [[H5381]] them? And he answered [[H559]] him, Pursue: [[H7291]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt surely [[H5381]] overtake [[H5381]] and without fail [[H5337]] recover [[H5337]]

### 9
So David [[H1732]] went, [[H1980]] he [[H1931]] and the six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the brook [[H5158]] Besor, [[H1308]] where those that were left behind [[H3498]] stayed. [[H5975]]

### 10
But David [[H1732]] pursued, [[H7291]] he [[H1931]] and four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men: [[H376]] for two hundred [[H3967]] abode behind, [[H5975]] which [[H834]] were so faint [[H6296]] that they could not go over [[H5674]] the brook [[H5158]] Besor. [[H1308]]

### 11
And they found [[H4672]] an Egyptian [[H376]] in the field, [[H7704]] and brought [[H3947]] him to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and gave [[H5414]] him bread, [[H3899]] and he did eat; [[H398]] and they made him drink [[H8248]] water; [[H4325]]

### 12
And they gave [[H5414]] him a piece [[H6400]] of a cake [[H1690]] of figs, and two [[H8147]] clusters of raisins: [[H6778]] and when he had eaten, [[H398]] his spirit [[H7307]] came again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] him: for [[H3588]] he had eaten [[H398]] no [[H3808]] bread, [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drunk [[H8354]] water, [[H4325]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] and three [[H7969]] nights. [[H3915]]

### 13
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto him, To whom [[H4310]] thou? [[H859]] and whence [[H335]] thou? [[H859]] And he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] a young man [[H5288]] of Egypt, [[H4713]] servant [[H5650]] to an Amalekite; [[H376]] and my master [[H113]] left [[H5800]] me, because [[H3588]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] agone I fell sick. [[H2470]]

### 14
We [[H587]] made an invasion [[H6584]] the south [[H5045]] of the Cherethites, [[H3774]] and upon [[H5921]] which [[H834]] to Judah, [[H3063]] and upon [[H5921]] the south [[H5045]] of Caleb; [[H3612]] and we burned [[H8313]] Ziklag [[H6860]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 15
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] him, Canst thou bring me down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] company? [[H1416]] And he said, [[H559]] Swear [[H7650]] unto me by God, [[H430]] that thou wilt neither [[H518]] kill [[H4191]] me, nor [[H518]] deliver [[H5462]] me into the hands [[H3027]] of my master, [[H113]] and I will bring thee down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] company. [[H1416]]

### 16
And when he had brought him down, [[H3381]] behold, [[H2009]] spread abroad [[H5203]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H6440]] the earth, [[H776]] eating [[H398]] and drinking, [[H8354]] and dancing, [[H2287]] because of all [[H3605]] the great [[H1419]] spoil [[H7998]] that [[H834]] they had taken [[H3947]] out of the land [[H776]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and out of the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 17
And David [[H1732]] smote [[H5221]] them from the twilight [[H5399]] even unto [[H5704]] the evening [[H6153]] of the next day: [[H4283]] and there escaped [[H4422]] not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] of them, save [[H3588]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] young [[H5288]] men, [[H376]] which [[H834]] rode [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] camels, [[H1581]] and fled. [[H5127]]

### 18
And David [[H1732]] recovered [[H5337]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Amalekites [[H6002]] had carried away: [[H3947]] and David [[H1732]] rescued [[H5337]] his two [[H8147]] wives. [[H802]]

### 19
And there was nothing [[H3808]] lacking [[H5737]] to them, neither [[H4480]] small [[H6996]] nor [[H5704]] great, [[H1419]] neither [[H5704]] sons [[H1121]] nor daughters, [[H1323]] neither spoil, [[H7998]] nor [[H5704]] any [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they had taken [[H3947]] to them: David [[H1732]] recovered [[H7725]] all. [[H3605]]

### 20
And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the flocks [[H6629]] and the herds, [[H1241]] they drave [[H5090]] before [[H6440]] those [[H1931]] cattle, [[H4735]] and said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] David's [[H1732]] spoil. [[H7998]]

### 21
And David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the two hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]] which [[H834]] were so faint [[H6296]] that they could not follow [[H1980]] David, [[H1732]] whom they had made also to abide [[H3427]] at the brook [[H5158]] Besor: [[H1308]] and they went forth [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] David, [[H1732]] and to meet [[H7125]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him: and when David [[H1732]] came near [[H5066]]  to [[H853]] the people, [[H5971]] he saluted [[H7592]] them. [[H7965]]

### 22
Then answered [[H6030]] all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7451]] men [[H376]] and of Belial, [[H1100]] of those [[H582]] that [[H834]] went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] and said, [[H559]] Because [[H3282]] they went [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] with [[H5973]] us, we will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] them of the spoil [[H7998]] that [[H834]] we have recovered, [[H5337]] save [[H3588]] to every man [[H376]] his wife [[H802]] and his children, [[H1121]] that they may lead away, [[H5090]] and depart. [[H1980]]

### 23
Then said [[H559]] David, [[H1732]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] do so, [[H6213]] my brethren, [[H251]] with [[H854]] that which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]] us, who hath preserved [[H8104]] us, and delivered [[H5414]] the company [[H1416]] that came [[H935]] against [[H5921]] us into our hand. [[H3027]]

### 24
For who [[H4310]] will hearken [[H8085]] unto you in this [[H2088]] matter? [[H1697]] but [[H3588]] as his part [[H2506]] that goeth down [[H3381]] to the battle, [[H4421]] so his part [[H2506]] that tarrieth [[H3427]] by [[H5921]] the stuff: [[H3627]] they shall part [[H2505]] alike. [[H3162]]

### 25
And it was [[H1961]] from that day [[H3117]] forward, [[H4605]] that he made [[H7760]] it a statute [[H2706]] and an ordinance [[H4941]] for Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 26
And when David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Ziklag, [[H6860]] he sent [[H7971]] of the spoil [[H7998]] unto the elders [[H2205]] of Judah, [[H3063]] to his friends, [[H7453]] saying, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] a present [[H1293]] for you of the spoil [[H7998]] of the enemies [[H341]] of the Lord; [[H3068]]

### 27
To which [[H834]] in Beth-el, [[H1008]] and to which [[H834]] in south [[H5045]] Ramoth, [[H7418]] and to which [[H834]] in Jattir, [[H3492]]

### 28
And to which [[H834]] in Aroer, [[H6177]] and to which [[H834]] in Siphmoth, [[H8224]] and to which [[H834]] in Eshtemoa, [[H851]]

### 29
And to which [[H834]] in Rachal, [[H7403]] and to which [[H834]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the Jerahmeelites, [[H3397]] and to which [[H834]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the Kenites, [[H7017]]

### 30
And to which [[H834]] in Hormah, [[H2767]] and to which [[H834]] in Chor-ashan, [[H3565]] and to which [[H834]] in Athach, [[H6269]]

### 31
And to which [[H834]] in Hebron, [[H2275]] and to all [[H3605]] the places [[H4725]] where [[H834]] David [[H1732]] himself [[H1931]] and his men [[H376]] were wont to haunt. [[H1980]]
