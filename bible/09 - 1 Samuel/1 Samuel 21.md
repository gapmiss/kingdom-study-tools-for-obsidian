### 1
Then came [[H935]] David [[H1732]] to Nob [[H5011]] to [[H413]] Ahimelech [[H288]] the priest: [[H3548]] and Ahimelech [[H288]] was afraid [[H2729]] at the meeting [[H7125]] of David, [[H1732]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Why [[H4069]] thou [[H859]] alone, [[H905]] and no [[H369]] man [[H376]] with [[H854]] thee? [[H854]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto Ahimelech [[H288]] the priest, [[H3548]] The king [[H4428]] hath commanded [[H6680]] me a business, [[H1697]] and hath said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] know [[H3045]] any thing [[H3972]]  of [[H853]] the business [[H1697]] whereabout [[H834]] I [[H595]] send [[H7971]] thee, and what [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] thee: and I have appointed [[H3045]] servants [[H5288]] to [[H413]] such [[H6423]] and such [[H492]] a place. [[H4725]]

### 3
Now [[H6258]] therefore what [[H4100]] is [[H3426]] under [[H8478]] thine hand? [[H3027]] give [[H5414]] five [[H2568]] bread [[H3899]] in mine hand, [[H3027]] or [[H176]] what there is present. [[H4672]]

### 4
And the priest [[H3548]] answered [[H6030]] David, [[H1732]] and said, [[H559]] no [[H369]] common [[H2455]] bread [[H3899]] under [[H413]] mine hand, [[H3027]] but [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] hallowed [[H6944]] bread; [[H3899]] if [[H518]] the young men [[H5288]] have kept themselves [[H8104]] at least [[H389]] from women. [[H802]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] answered [[H6030]] the priest, [[H3548]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Of [[H3588]] a truth [[H518]] women [[H802]] kept [[H6113]] from us about these three [[H8032]] days, [[H8543]] since I came out, [[H3318]] and the vessels [[H3627]] of the young men [[H5288]] are holy, [[H6944]] and in a manner [[H1870]] common, [[H2455]] yea, [[H637]] though [[H3588]] it were sanctified [[H6942]] this day [[H3117]] in the vessel. [[H3627]]

### 6
So the priest [[H3548]] gave [[H5414]] him hallowed [[H6944]] for [[H3588]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] bread [[H3899]] there [[H8033]] but [[H3588]] the shewbread, [[H3899]] that was taken [[H5493]] from before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to put [[H7760]] hot [[H2527]] bread [[H3899]] in the day [[H3117]] when it was taken away. [[H3947]]

### 7
Now a certain man [[H376]] of the servants [[H5650]] of Saul [[H7586]] there [[H8033]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] detained [[H6113]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and his name [[H8034]] Doeg, [[H1673]] an Edomite, [[H130]] the chiefest [[H47]] of the herdmen [[H7462]] that [[H834]] to Saul. [[H7586]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto Ahimelech, [[H288]] And is there [[H3426]] not [[H371]] here [[H6311]] under [[H8478]] thine hand [[H3027]] spear [[H2595]] or [[H176]] sword? [[H2719]] for [[H3588]] I have neither [[H1571]] brought [[H3947]] my sword [[H2719]] nor [[H1571]] my weapons [[H3627]] with me, [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] the king's [[H4428]] business [[H1697]] required [[H1961]] haste. [[H5169]]

### 9
And the priest [[H3548]] said, [[H559]] The sword [[H2719]] of Goliath [[H1555]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] whom [[H834]] thou slewest [[H5221]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Elah, [[H425]] behold, [[H2009]] it [[H1931]] wrapped [[H3874]] in a cloth [[H8071]] behind [[H310]] the ephod: [[H646]] if [[H518]] thou wilt take [[H3947]] that, take [[H3947]] for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] other [[H312]] save [[H2108]] that here. [[H2088]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] none [[H369]] like that; give [[H5414]] it me. [[H5414]]

### 10
And David [[H1732]] arose, [[H6965]] and fled [[H1272]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] for fear [[H6440]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Achish [[H397]] the king [[H4428]] of Gath. [[H1661]]

### 11
And the servants [[H5650]] of Achish [[H397]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] David [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] of the land? [[H776]] did they not [[H3808]] sing [[H6030]] one to another of him [[H2088]] in dances, [[H4246]] saying, [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] hath slain [[H5221]] his thousands, [[H505]] and David [[H1732]] his ten thousands? [[H7233]]

### 12
And David [[H1732]] laid up [[H7760]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in his heart, [[H3824]] and was sore [[H3966]] afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] Achish [[H397]] the king [[H4428]] of Gath. [[H1661]]

### 13
And he changed [[H8138]] his behaviour [[H2940]] before [[H5869]] them, and feigned himself mad [[H1984]] in their hands, [[H3027]] and scrabbled [[H8427]] on [[H5921]] the doors [[H1817]] of the gate, [[H8179]] and let his spittle [[H7388]] fall down [[H3381]] upon [[H413]] his beard. [[H2206]]

### 14
Then said [[H559]] Achish [[H397]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] Lo, [[H2009]] ye see [[H7200]] the man [[H376]] is mad: [[H7696]] wherefore [[H4100]] have ye brought [[H935]] him to [[H413]] me? [[H413]]

### 15
Have I [[H589]] need [[H2638]] of mad men, [[H7696]] that [[H3588]] ye have brought [[H935]] this [[H2088]] to play the mad man [[H7696]] in my presence? [[H5921]] shall this [[H2088]] come [[H935]] into [[H413]] my house? [[H1004]]
