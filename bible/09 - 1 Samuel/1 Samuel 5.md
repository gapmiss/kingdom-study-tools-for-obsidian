### 1
And the Philistines [[H6430]] took [[H3947]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] and brought [[H935]] it from Eben-ezer [[H72]] unto Ashdod. [[H795]]

### 2
When the Philistines [[H6430]] took [[H3947]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] they brought [[H935]] it into the house [[H1004]] of Dagon, [[H1712]] and set [[H3322]] it by [[H681]] Dagon. [[H1712]]

### 3
And when they of Ashdod [[H796]] arose early [[H7925]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] behold, [[H2009]] Dagon [[H1712]] fallen [[H5307]] upon his face [[H6440]] to the earth [[H776]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And they took [[H3947]] Dagon, [[H1712]] and set [[H7725]] him in his place [[H4725]] again. [[H4725]]

### 4
And when they arose early [[H7925]] on the morrow [[H4283]] morning, [[H1242]] behold, [[H2009]] Dagon [[H1712]] fallen [[H5307]] upon his face [[H6440]] to the ground [[H776]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and the head [[H7218]] of Dagon [[H1712]] and both [[H8147]] the palms [[H3709]] of his hands [[H3027]] cut off [[H3772]] upon [[H413]] the threshold; [[H4670]] only [[H7535]] Dagon [[H1712]] was left [[H7604]] to [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 5
Therefore [[H5921]] neither [[H3808]] the priests [[H3548]] of Dagon, [[H1712]] nor any [[H3605]] that come [[H935]] into Dagon's [[H1712]] house, [[H1004]] tread [[H1869]] on [[H5921]] the threshold [[H4670]] of Dagon [[H1712]] in Ashdod [[H795]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 6
But the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was heavy [[H3513]] upon [[H413]] them of Ashdod, [[H796]] and he destroyed [[H8074]] them, and smote [[H5221]] them with emerods, [[H6076]] Ashdod [[H795]] and the coasts [[H1366]] thereof. [[H1366]]

### 7
And when the men [[H582]] of Ashdod [[H795]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] so, [[H3651]] they said, [[H559]] The ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall not [[H3808]] abide [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] us: for [[H3588]] his hand [[H3027]] is sore [[H7185]] upon [[H5921]] us, and upon [[H5921]] Dagon [[H1712]] our god. [[H430]]

### 8
They sent [[H7971]] therefore and gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] unto [[H413]] them, and said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] with the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel? [[H3478]] And they answered, [[H559]] Let the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] be carried about [[H5437]] unto Gath. [[H1661]] And they carried [[H5437]] the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] about [[H3478]]

### 9
And it was [[H1961]] that, after [[H310]] they had carried it about, [[H5437]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] against the city [[H5892]] with a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] destruction: [[H4103]] and he smote [[H5221]] the men [[H376]] of the city, [[H5892]] both small [[H6996]] and great, [[H1419]] and they had emerods [[H6076]] in their secret parts. [[H8368]]

### 10
Therefore they sent [[H7971]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] to Ekron. [[H6138]] And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to Ekron, [[H6138]] that the Ekronites [[H6139]] cried out, [[H2199]] saying, [[H559]] They have brought about [[H5437]] the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] to [[H413]] us, to slay [[H4191]] us and our people. [[H5971]]

### 11
So they sent [[H7971]] and gathered together [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and said, [[H559]] Send away [[H7971]] the ark [[H727]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and let it go again [[H7725]] to his own place, [[H4725]] that it slay [[H4191]] us not, [[H3808]] and our people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] there was [[H1961]] a deadly [[H4194]] destruction [[H4103]] throughout all [[H3605]] the city; [[H5892]] the hand [[H3027]] of God [[H430]] was very [[H3966]] heavy [[H3513]] there. [[H8033]]

### 12
And the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] died [[H4191]] not [[H3808]] were smitten [[H5221]] with the emerods: [[H6076]] and the cry [[H7775]] of the city [[H5892]] went up [[H5927]] to heaven. [[H8064]]
