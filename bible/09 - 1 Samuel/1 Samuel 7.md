And the men [[H376]] of Kirjath-jearim [[H7157]] came, [[H935]] and fetched up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and brought [[H935]] it into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Abinadab [[H41]] in the hill, [[H1389]] and sanctified [[H6942]] Eleazar [[H499]] his son [[H1121]] to keep [[H8104]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] while [[H3117]] the ark [[H727]] abode [[H3427]] in Kirjath-jearim, [[H7157]] that the time [[H3117]] was long; [[H7235]] for it was [[H1961]] twenty [[H6242]] years: [[H8141]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] lamented [[H5091]] after [[H310]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
And Samuel [[H8050]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] ye [[H859]] do return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] your hearts, [[H3824]] put away [[H5493]] the strange [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] and Ashtaroth [[H6252]] from among [[H8432]] you, and prepare [[H3559]] your hearts [[H3824]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] him only: [[H905]] and he will deliver [[H5337]] you out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 4
Then the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did put away [[H5493]] Baalim [[H1168]] and Ashtaroth, [[H6252]] and served [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] only. [[H905]]

### 5
And Samuel [[H8050]] said, [[H559]] Gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] to Mizpeh, [[H4709]] and I will pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] you unto [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And they gathered together [[H6908]] to Mizpeh, [[H4709]] and drew [[H7579]] water, [[H4325]] and poured out [[H8210]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and fasted [[H6684]] on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and said [[H559]] there, [[H8033]] We have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord. [[H3068]] And Samuel [[H8050]] judged [[H8199]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in Mizpeh. [[H4709]]

### 7
And when the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were gathered together [[H6908]] to Mizpeh, [[H4709]] the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] went up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] Israel. [[H3478]] And when the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] they were afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 8
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Cease [[H2790]] not [[H408]] to cry [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] for [[H4480]] us, that he will save [[H3467]] us out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 9
And Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] a [[H259]] sucking [[H2461]] lamb, [[H2924]] and offered [[H5927]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] wholly [[H3632]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] and Samuel [[H8050]] cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] for [[H1157]] Israel; [[H3478]] and the Lord [[H3068]] heard [[H6030]] him. [[H6030]]

### 10
And as Samuel [[H8050]] was [[H1961]] offering up [[H5927]] the burnt offering, [[H5930]] the Philistines [[H6430]] drew near [[H5066]] to battle [[H4421]] against Israel: [[H3478]] but the Lord [[H3068]] thundered [[H7481]] with a great [[H1419]] thunder [[H6963]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] upon [[H5921]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and discomfited [[H2000]] them; and they were smitten [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
And the men [[H582]] of Israel [[H3478]] went out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] Mizpeh, [[H4709]] and pursued [[H7291]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and smote [[H5221]] them, until [[H5704]] under Beth-car. [[H1033]]

### 12
Then Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] a [[H259]] stone, [[H68]] and set [[H7760]] between [[H996]] Mizpeh [[H4709]] and Shen, [[H8129]] and called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of it Eben-ezer, [[H72]] saying, [[H559]] Hitherto [[H5704]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] helped [[H5826]] us. [[H5826]]

### 13
So the Philistines [[H6430]] were subdued, [[H3665]] and they came [[H935]] no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] into the coast [[H1366]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] against the Philistines [[H6430]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Samuel. [[H8050]]

### 14
And the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had taken [[H3947]] from [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] were restored [[H7725]] to Israel, [[H3478]] from Ekron [[H6138]] even unto [[H5704]] Gath; [[H1661]] and the coasts [[H1366]] thereof did Israel [[H3478]] deliver [[H5337]] out of the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] And there was [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] between [[H996]] Israel [[H3478]] and the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 15
And Samuel [[H8050]] judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life. [[H2416]]

### 16
And he went [[H1980]] from [[H1767]] year [[H8141]] to year [[H8141]] in circuit [[H5437]] to Beth-el, [[H1008]] and Gilgal, [[H1537]] and Mizpeh, [[H4709]] and judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] in [[H853]] all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] places. [[H4725]]

### 17
And his return [[H8666]] to Ramah; [[H7414]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] his house; [[H1004]] and there [[H8033]] he judged [[H8199]] Israel; [[H3478]] and there [[H8033]] he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]
