### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] that the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered together [[H6908]] their armies [[H4264]] for warfare, [[H6635]] to fight [[H3898]] with Israel. [[H3478]] And Achish [[H397]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Know [[H3045]] thou assuredly, [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou shalt go out [[H3318]] with [[H854]] me to battle, [[H4264]] thou [[H859]] and thy men. [[H376]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Achish, [[H397]] Surely [[H3651]] thou [[H859]] shalt know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] thy servant [[H5650]] can do. [[H6213]] And Achish [[H397]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Therefore [[H3651]] will I make [[H7760]] thee keeper [[H8104]] of mine head [[H7218]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 3
Now Samuel [[H8050]] was dead, [[H4191]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] had lamented [[H5594]] him, and buried [[H6912]] him in Ramah, [[H7414]] even in his own city. [[H5892]] And Saul [[H7586]] had put away [[H5493]] those that had familiar spirits, [[H178]] and the wizards, [[H3049]] out of the land. [[H776]]

### 4
And the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered themselves together, [[H6908]] and came [[H935]] and pitched [[H2583]] in Shunem: [[H7766]] and Saul [[H7586]] gathered together, [[H6908]] all Israel [[H3478]] and they pitched [[H2583]] in Gilboa. [[H1533]]

### 5
And when Saul [[H7586]] saw [[H7200]] the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] he was afraid, [[H3372]] and his heart [[H3820]] greatly [[H3966]] trembled. [[H2729]]

### 6
And when Saul [[H7586]] inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the Lord [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] him not, [[H3808]] neither [[H1571]] by dreams, [[H2472]] nor [[H1571]] by Urim, [[H224]] nor [[H1571]] by prophets. [[H5030]]

### 7
Then said [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] unto his servants, [[H5650]] Seek [[H1245]] me a woman [[H802]] that hath [[H1172]] a familiar spirit, [[H178]] that I may go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] her, and inquire [[H1875]] of her. And his servants [[H5650]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] a woman [[H802]] that hath [[H1172]] a familiar spirit [[H178]] at Endor. [[H5874]]

### 8
And Saul [[H7586]] disguised himself, [[H2664]] and put on [[H3847]] other [[H312]] raiment, [[H899]] and he [[H1931]] went, [[H1980]] and two [[H8147]] men [[H582]] with [[H5973]] him, and they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] by night: [[H3915]] and he said, [[H559]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] divine [[H7080]] unto me by the familiar spirit, [[H178]] and bring up, [[H5927]]  me [[H853]] whom [[H834]] I shall name [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 9
And the woman [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] what [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] hath done, [[H6213]] how [[H834]] he hath cut off [[H3772]] those that have familiar spirits, [[H178]] and the wizards, [[H3049]] out of [[H4480]] the land: [[H776]] wherefore [[H4100]] then layest thou [[H859]] a snare [[H5367]] for my life, [[H5315]] to cause me to die? [[H4191]]

### 10
And Saul [[H7586]] sware [[H7650]] to her by the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] there shall no [[H518]] punishment [[H5771]] happen [[H7136]] to thee for this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] the woman, [[H802]] Whom [[H4310]] shall I bring up [[H5927]] unto thee? And he said, [[H559]] Bring me up [[H5927]] Samuel. [[H8050]]

### 12
And when the woman [[H802]] saw [[H7200]] Samuel, [[H8050]] she cried [[H2199]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice: [[H6963]] and the woman [[H802]] spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] hast thou deceived [[H7411]] me? for thou [[H859]] Saul. [[H7586]]

### 13
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto her, Be not [[H408]] afraid: [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] sawest [[H7200]] thou? And the woman [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] I saw [[H7200]] gods [[H430]] ascending [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 14
And he said [[H559]] unto her, What [[H4100]] form [[H8389]] he of? And she said, [[H559]] An old [[H2205]] man [[H376]] cometh up; [[H5927]] and he [[H1931]] covered [[H5844]] with a mantle. [[H4598]] And Saul [[H7586]] perceived [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it Samuel, [[H8050]] and he [[H1931]] stooped [[H6915]] with face [[H639]] to the ground, [[H776]] and bowed himself. [[H7812]]

### 15
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Why [[H4100]] hast thou disquieted [[H7264]] me, to bring me up? [[H5927]] And Saul [[H7586]] answered, [[H559]] I am sore [[H3966]] distressed; [[H6887]] for the Philistines [[H6430]] make war [[H3898]] against me, and God [[H430]] is departed [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] me, and answereth [[H6030]] me no [[H3808]] more, [[H5750]] neither [[H1571]] by [[H3027]] prophets, [[H5030]] nor [[H1571]] by dreams: [[H2472]] therefore I have called [[H7121]] thee, that thou mayest make known [[H3045]] unto me what [[H4100]] I shall do. [[H6213]]

### 16
Then said [[H559]] Samuel, [[H8050]] Wherefore [[H4100]] then dost thou ask [[H7592]] of me, seeing the Lord [[H3068]] is departed [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] thee, and is become [[H1961]] thine enemy? [[H6145]]

### 17
And the Lord [[H3068]] hath done [[H6213]] to him, as [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by me: for the Lord [[H3068]] hath rent [[H7167]] the kingdom [[H4467]] out of thine hand, [[H3027]] and given [[H5414]] it to thy neighbour, [[H7453]] to David: [[H1732]]

### 18
Because [[H834]] thou obeyedst [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] nor [[H3808]] executedst [[H6213]] his fierce [[H2740]] wrath [[H639]] upon Amalek, [[H6002]] therefore [[H5921]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] unto thee this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 19
Moreover [[H1571]] the Lord [[H3068]] will also deliver [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] thee into the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] and to morrow [[H4279]] thou [[H859]] and thy sons [[H1121]] with [[H5973]] me: the Lord [[H3068]] also [[H1571]] shall deliver [[H5414]] the host [[H4264]] of Israel [[H3478]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 20
Then Saul [[H7586]] fell [[H5307]] straightway [[H4116]] all [[H4393]] along [[H6967]] on the earth, [[H776]] and was sore [[H3966]] afraid, [[H3372]] because of the words [[H1697]] of Samuel: [[H8050]] and [[H1571]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] strength [[H3581]] in him; for [[H3588]] he had eaten [[H398]] no [[H3808]] bread [[H3899]] all [[H3605]] the day, [[H3117]] nor all [[H3605]] the night. [[H3915]]

### 21
And the woman [[H802]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] and saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he was sore [[H3966]] troubled, [[H926]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] thine handmaid [[H8198]] hath obeyed [[H8085]] thy voice, [[H6963]] and I have put [[H7760]] my life [[H5315]] in my hand, [[H3709]] and have hearkened [[H8085]]  unto [[H853]] thy words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thou spakest [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 22
Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] hearken [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of thine handmaid, [[H8198]] and let me set [[H7760]] a morsel [[H6595]] of bread [[H3899]] before [[H6440]] thee; and eat, [[H398]] that thou mayest have [[H1961]] strength, [[H3581]] when [[H3588]] thou goest [[H1980]] on thy way. [[H1870]]

### 23
But he refused, [[H3985]] and said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] eat. [[H398]] But his servants, [[H5650]] together with [[H1571]] the woman, [[H802]] compelled [[H6555]] him; and he hearkened [[H8085]] unto their voice. [[H6963]] So he arose [[H6965]] from the earth, [[H776]] and sat [[H3427]] upon [[H413]] the bed. [[H4296]]

### 24
And the woman [[H802]] had a fat [[H4770]] calf [[H5695]] in the house; [[H1004]] and she hasted, [[H4116]] and killed [[H2076]] it, and took [[H3947]] flour, [[H7058]] and kneaded [[H3888]] and did bake [[H644]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] thereof: [[H4682]]

### 25
And she brought [[H5066]] before [[H6440]] Saul, [[H7586]] and before [[H6440]] his servants; [[H5650]] and they did eat. [[H398]] Then they rose up, [[H6965]] and went away [[H1980]] that [[H1931]] night. [[H3915]]
