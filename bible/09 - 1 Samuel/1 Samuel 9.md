### 1
Now there was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] whose name [[H8034]] Kish, [[H7027]] the son [[H1121]] of Abiel, [[H22]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeror, [[H6872]] the son [[H1121]] of Bechorath, [[H1064]] the son [[H1121]] of Aphiah, [[H647]] a Benjamite, [[H3227]] a mighty [[H1368]] man [[H376]] of power. [[H2428]]

### 2
And he had [[H1961]] a son, [[H1121]] whose name [[H8034]] Saul, [[H7586]] a choice young man, [[H970]] and a goodly: [[H2896]] and not [[H369]] among the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] a goodlier [[H2896]] person [[H376]] than [[H4480]] he: from his shoulders [[H7926]] and upward [[H4605]] higher [[H1364]] than any [[H3605]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 3
And the asses [[H860]] of Kish [[H7027]] Saul's [[H7586]] father [[H1]] were lost. [[H6]] And Kish [[H7027]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] his son, [[H1121]] Take [[H3947]] now [[H4994]] one [[H259]] of the servants [[H5288]] with [[H854]] thee, and arise, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] seek [[H1245]] the asses. [[H860]]

### 4
And he passed through [[H5674]] mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and passed through [[H5674]] the land [[H776]] of Shalisha, [[H8031]] but they found [[H4672]] not: [[H3808]] then they passed through [[H5674]] the land [[H776]] of Shalim, [[H8171]] and not: [[H369]] and he passed through [[H5674]] the land [[H776]] of the Benjamites, [[H3227]] but they found [[H4672]] not. [[H3808]]

### 5
when they [[H1992]] were come [[H935]] to the land [[H776]] of Zuph, [[H6689]] Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to his servant [[H5288]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him, Come, [[H1980]] and let us return; [[H7725]] lest [[H6435]] my father [[H1]] leave [[H2308]] for [[H4480]] the asses, [[H860]] and take thought [[H1672]] for us. [[H1672]]

### 6
And he said [[H559]] unto him, Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] a man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and an honourable [[H3513]] man; [[H376]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he saith [[H1696]] cometh [[H935]] surely to pass: [[H935]] now [[H6258]] let us go [[H1980]] thither; [[H8033]] peradventure [[H194]] he can shew [[H5046]]  us [[H853]] our way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] we should go. [[H1980]]

### 7
Then said [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] to his servant, [[H5288]] But, behold, [[H2009]] we go, [[H1980]] what [[H4100]] shall we bring [[H935]] the man? [[H376]] for [[H3588]] the bread [[H3899]] is spent [[H235]] in our vessels, [[H3627]] and not [[H369]] a present [[H8670]] to bring [[H935]] to the man [[H376]] of God: [[H430]] what [[H4100]] have we? [[H4100]]

### 8
And the servant [[H5288]] answered [[H6030]] Saul [[H7586]] again, [[H3254]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have here [[H4672]] at hand [[H3027]] the fourth part [[H7253]] of a shekel [[H8255]] of silver: [[H3701]] will I give [[H5414]] to the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] to tell [[H5046]]  us [[H853]] our way. [[H1870]]

### 9
(Beforetime [[H6440]] in Israel, [[H3478]] when a man [[H376]] went [[H1980]] to inquire [[H1875]] of God, [[H430]] thus [[H3541]] he spake, [[H559]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us go [[H1980]] to [[H5704]] the seer: [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] now [[H3117]] a Prophet [[H5030]] was beforetime [[H6440]] called [[H7121]] a Seer.) [[H7200]]

### 10
Then said [[H1697]] Saul [[H7586]] to his servant, [[H5288]] Well [[H2896]] said; [[H559]] come, [[H1980]] let us go. [[H1980]] So they went [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] where [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]]

### 11
as they [[H1992]] went up [[H5927]] the hill [[H4608]] to the city, [[H5892]] they [[H1992]] found [[H4672]] young maidens [[H5291]] going out [[H3318]] to draw [[H7579]] water, [[H4325]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Is [[H3426]] the seer [[H7200]] here? [[H2088]]

### 12
And they answered [[H6030]] them, and said, [[H559]] He is; [[H3426]] behold, [[H2009]] before [[H6440]] you: make haste [[H4116]] now, [[H6258]] for [[H3588]] he came [[H935]] to day [[H3117]] to the city; [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] of the people [[H5971]] to day [[H3117]] in the high place: [[H1116]]

### 13
As soon as ye be come [[H935]] into the city, [[H5892]] ye shall straightway [[H3651]] find [[H4672]] him, before [[H2962]] he go up [[H5927]] to the high place [[H1116]] to eat: [[H398]] for [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] will not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] until [[H5704]] he come, [[H935]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] doth bless [[H1288]] the sacrifice; [[H2077]] afterwards [[H310]] they eat [[H398]] that be bidden. [[H7121]] Now [[H6258]] therefore get you up; [[H5927]] for [[H3588]] about this time [[H3117]] ye shall find [[H4672]] him. [[H4672]]

### 14
And they went up [[H5927]] into the city: [[H5892]] when they [[H1992]] were come [[H935]] into [[H8432]] the city, [[H5892]] behold, [[H2009]] Samuel [[H8050]] came out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] them, for to go up [[H5927]] to the high place. [[H1116]]

### 15
Now the Lord [[H3068]] had told [[H1540]] Samuel [[H8050]] in [[H853]] his ear [[H241]] a [[H259]] day [[H3117]] before [[H6440]] Saul [[H7586]] came, [[H935]] saying, [[H559]]

### 16
To morrow [[H4279]] about this time [[H6256]] I will send [[H7971]] thee a man [[H376]] out of the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and thou shalt anoint [[H4886]] him captain [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] that he may save [[H3467]] my people [[H5971]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] for [[H3588]] I have looked upon [[H7200]] my people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] their cry [[H6818]] is come [[H935]] unto me. [[H413]]

### 17
And when Samuel [[H8050]] saw [[H7200]] Saul, [[H7586]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H6030]] unto him, Behold [[H2009]] the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] I spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] thee of! this same [[H2088]] shall reign [[H6113]] over my people. [[H5971]]

### 18
Then Saul [[H7586]] drew near [[H5066]]  to [[H853]] Samuel [[H8050]] in [[H8432]] the gate, [[H8179]] and said, [[H559]] Tell [[H5046]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] where [[H335]] the seer's [[H7200]] house [[H1004]]

### 19
And Samuel [[H8050]] answered [[H6030]] Saul, [[H7586]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] the seer: [[H7200]] go up [[H5927]] before [[H6440]] me unto the high place; [[H1116]] for ye shall eat [[H398]] with [[H5973]] me to day, [[H3117]] and to morrow [[H1242]] I will let thee go, [[H7971]] and will tell [[H5046]] thee all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in thine heart. [[H3824]]

### 20
And as for thine asses [[H860]] that were lost [[H6]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] ago, [[H3117]] set [[H7760]] not [[H408]] thy mind [[H3820]] on them; for [[H3588]] they are found. [[H4672]] And on whom [[H4310]] all [[H3605]] the desire [[H2532]] of Israel? [[H3478]] not [[H3808]] on thee, and on all [[H3605]] thy father's [[H1]] house? [[H1004]]

### 21
And Saul [[H7586]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] I [[H595]] a Benjamite, [[H1145]] of the smallest [[H6996]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel? [[H3478]] and my family [[H4940]] the least [[H6810]] of all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin? [[H1144]] wherefore [[H4100]] then speakest [[H1696]] thou so [[H1697]] to [[H413]] me? [[H413]]

### 22
And Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] Saul [[H7586]] and his servant, [[H5288]] and brought [[H935]] them into the parlour, [[H3957]] and made them sit [[H5414]] in the chiefest [[H7218]] place [[H4725]] among them that were bidden, [[H7121]] which [[H1992]] about thirty [[H7970]] persons. [[H376]]

### 23
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] unto the cook, [[H2876]] Bring [[H5414]] the portion [[H4490]] which [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] thee, of which [[H834]] I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, Set [[H7760]] it by [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 24
And the cook [[H2876]] took up [[H7311]] the shoulder, [[H7785]] and which upon [[H5921]] it, and set [[H7760]] before [[H6440]] Saul. [[H7586]] And said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] that which is left! [[H7604]] set [[H7760]] before [[H6440]] thee, eat: [[H398]] for [[H3588]] unto this time [[H4150]] hath it been kept [[H8104]] for thee since I said, [[H559]] I have invited [[H7121]] the people. [[H5971]] So Saul [[H7586]] did eat [[H398]] with [[H5973]] Samuel [[H8050]] that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

### 25
And when they were come down [[H3381]] from the high place [[H1116]] into the city, [[H5892]] communed [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] upon [[H5921]] the top of the house. [[H1406]]

### 26
And they arose early: [[H7925]] and it came to pass [[H1961]] about the spring [[H5927]] of the day, [[H7837]] that Samuel [[H8050]] called [[H7121]] Saul [[H7586]] to the top of the house, [[H1406]] saying, [[H559]] Up, [[H6965]] that I may send thee away. [[H7971]] And Saul [[H7586]] arose, [[H6965]] and they went out [[H3318]] both [[H8147]] of them, he [[H1931]] and Samuel, [[H8050]] abroad. [[H2351]]

### 27
as they [[H1992]] were going down [[H3381]] to the end [[H7097]] of the city, [[H5892]] Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Bid [[H559]] the servant [[H5288]] pass on [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] us, (and he passed on,) [[H5674]] but stand [[H5975]] thou [[H859]] still a while, [[H3117]] that I may shew [[H8085]]  thee [[H853]] the word [[H1697]] of God.
