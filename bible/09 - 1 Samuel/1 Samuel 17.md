### 1
Now the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered together [[H622]] their armies [[H4264]] to battle, [[H4421]] and were gathered together [[H622]] at Shochoh, [[H7755]] which [[H834]] to Judah, [[H3063]] and pitched [[H2583]] between [[H996]] Shochoh [[H7755]] and Azekah, [[H5825]] in Ephes-dammim. [[H658]]

### 2
And Saul [[H7586]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] were gathered together, [[H622]] and pitched [[H2583]] by the valley [[H6010]] of Elah, [[H425]] and set the battle [[H4421]] in array [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 3
And the Philistines [[H6430]] stood [[H5975]] on [[H413]] a mountain [[H2022]] on the one side, [[H2088]] and Israel [[H3478]] stood [[H5975]] on [[H413]] a mountain [[H2022]] on the other side: [[H2088]] and a valley [[H1516]] between [[H996]] them. [[H996]]

### 4
And there went out [[H3318]] a champion [[H376]] out of the camp [[H4264]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] named [[H8034]] Goliath, [[H1555]] of Gath, [[H1661]] whose height [[H1363]] six [[H8337]] cubits [[H520]] and a span. [[H2239]]

### 5
And an helmet [[H3553]] of brass [[H5178]] upon [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and he [[H1931]] armed [[H3847]] with a coat [[H8302]] of mail; [[H7193]] and the weight [[H4948]] of the coat [[H8302]] five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] shekels [[H8255]] of brass. [[H5178]]

### 6
And greaves [[H4697]] of brass [[H5178]] upon [[H5921]] his legs, [[H7272]] and a target [[H3591]] of brass [[H5178]] between [[H996]] his shoulders. [[H3802]]

### 7
And the staff [[H2671]] of his spear [[H2595]] like a weaver's [[H707]] beam; [[H4500]] and his spear's [[H2595]] head [[H3852]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] of iron: [[H1270]] and one bearing [[H5375]] a shield [[H6793]] went [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 8
And he stood [[H5975]] and cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the armies [[H4634]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Why [[H4100]] are ye come out [[H3318]] to set battle [[H4421]] in array? [[H6186]] not [[H3808]] I [[H595]] a Philistine, [[H6430]] and ye [[H859]] servants [[H5650]] to Saul? [[H7586]] choose [[H1262]] you a man [[H376]] for you, and let him come down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 9
If [[H518]] he be able [[H3201]] to fight [[H3898]] with [[H854]] me, and to kill [[H5221]] me, then will we be [[H1961]] your servants: [[H5650]] but if [[H518]] I [[H589]] prevail [[H3201]] against him, and kill [[H5221]] him, then shall ye be [[H1961]] our servants, [[H5650]] and serve [[H5647]] us. [[H5647]]

### 10
And the Philistine [[H6430]] said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] defy [[H2778]] the armies [[H4634]] of Israel [[H3478]] this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]] give [[H5414]] me a man, [[H376]] that we may fight [[H3898]] together. [[H3162]]

### 11
When Saul [[H7586]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] those [[H428]] words [[H1697]] of the Philistine, [[H6430]] they were dismayed, [[H2865]] and greatly [[H3966]] afraid. [[H3372]]

### 12
Now David [[H1732]] the son [[H1121]] of that [[H2088]] Ephrathite [[H376]] of Bethlehem-judah, [[H1035]] whose name [[H8034]] Jesse; [[H3448]] and he had eight [[H8083]] sons: [[H1121]] and the man [[H376]] went [[H935]] among men [[H376]] an old man [[H2204]] in the days [[H3117]] of Saul. [[H7586]]

### 13
And the three [[H7969]] eldest [[H1419]] sons [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] went [[H1980]] followed [[H310]] Saul [[H7586]] to the battle: [[H4421]] and the names [[H8034]] of his three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] that [[H834]] went [[H1980]] to the battle [[H4421]] Eliab [[H446]] the firstborn, [[H1060]] and next [[H4932]] unto him Abinadab, [[H41]] and the third [[H7992]] Shammah. [[H8048]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] the youngest: [[H6996]] and the three [[H7969]] eldest [[H1419]] followed [[H1980]] Saul. [[H7586]]

### 15
But David [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] and returned [[H7725]] from [[H5921]] Saul [[H7586]] to feed [[H7462]] his father's [[H1]] sheep [[H6629]] at Bethlehem. [[H1035]]

### 16
And the Philistine [[H6430]] drew near [[H5066]] morning [[H7925]] and evening, [[H6150]] and presented himself [[H3320]] forty [[H705]] days. [[H3117]]

### 17
And Jesse [[H3448]] said [[H559]] unto David [[H1732]] his son, [[H1121]] Take [[H3947]] now [[H4994]] for thy brethren [[H251]] an ephah [[H374]] of this [[H2088]] parched [[H7039]] and these [[H2088]] ten [[H6235]] loaves, [[H3899]] and run [[H7323]] to the camp [[H4264]] to thy brethren; [[H251]]

### 18
And carry [[H935]] these [[H428]] ten [[H6235]] cheeses [[H2461]] unto the captain [[H8269]] of thousand, [[H505]] and look how [[H6485]] thy brethren [[H251]] fare, [[H7965]] and take [[H3947]] their pledge. [[H6161]]

### 19
Now Saul, [[H7586]] and they, [[H1992]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of Israel, [[H3478]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Elah, [[H425]] fighting [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 20
And David [[H1732]] rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and left [[H5203]] the sheep [[H6629]] with [[H5921]] a keeper, [[H8104]] and took, [[H5375]] and went, [[H1980]] as [[H834]] Jesse [[H3448]] had commanded [[H6680]] him; and he came [[H935]] to the trench, [[H4570]] as the host [[H2428]] was going forth [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the fight, [[H4634]] and shouted [[H7321]] for the battle. [[H4421]]

### 21
For Israel [[H3478]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] had put the battle in array, [[H6186]] army [[H4634]] against [[H7125]] army. [[H4634]]

### 22
And David [[H1732]] left [[H5203]] his carriage [[H3627]] in [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of the keeper [[H8104]] of the carriage, [[H3627]] and ran [[H7323]] into the army, [[H4634]] and came [[H935]] and saluted [[H7592]] his brethren. [[H251]]

### 23
And as he [[H1931]] talked [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] them, behold, [[H2009]] there came up [[H5927]] the champion, [[H376]] the Philistine [[H6430]] of Gath, [[H1661]] Goliath [[H1555]] by name, [[H8034]] out of the armies [[H4630]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and spake [[H1696]] according to the same [[H428]] words: [[H1697]] and David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]]

### 24
And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] when they saw [[H7200]] the man, [[H376]] fled [[H5127]] from him, [[H6440]] and were sore [[H3966]] afraid. [[H3372]]

### 25
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] Have ye seen [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] that is come up? [[H5927]] surely [[H3588]] to defy [[H2778]] Israel [[H3478]] is he come up: [[H5927]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] killeth [[H5221]] him, the king [[H4428]] will enrich [[H6238]] him with great [[H1419]] riches, [[H6239]] and will give [[H5414]] him his daughter, [[H1323]] and make [[H6213]] his father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] free [[H2670]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 26
And David [[H1732]] spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] the men [[H582]] that stood [[H5975]] by [[H5973]] him, saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall be done [[H6213]] to the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] killeth [[H5221]] this [[H1975]] Philistine, [[H6430]] and taketh away [[H5493]] the reproach [[H2781]] from [[H5921]] Israel? [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] this [[H2088]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] Philistine, [[H6430]] that [[H3588]] he should defy [[H2778]] the armies [[H4634]] of the living [[H2416]] God? [[H430]]

### 27
And the people [[H5971]] answered [[H559]] him after this [[H2088]] manner, [[H1697]] saying, [[H559]] So [[H3541]] shall it be done [[H6213]] to the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] killeth [[H5221]] him. [[H5221]]

### 28
And Eliab [[H446]] his eldest [[H1419]] brother [[H251]] heard [[H8085]] when he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the men; [[H376]] and Eliab's [[H446]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] against David, [[H1732]] and he said, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] camest thou down [[H3381]] hither? and with [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] hast thou left [[H5203]] those [[H2007]] few [[H4592]] sheep [[H6629]] in the wilderness? [[H4057]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] thy pride, [[H2087]] and the naughtiness [[H7455]] of thine heart; [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] thou art come down [[H3381]] that [[H4616]] thou mightest see [[H7200]] the battle. [[H4421]]

### 29
And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have I now [[H6258]] done? [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] a cause? [[H1697]]

### 30
And he turned [[H5437]] from him [[H681]] toward [[H4136]] another, [[H312]] and spake [[H559]] after the same [[H2088]] manner: [[H1697]] and the people [[H5971]] answered [[H1697]] him again [[H7725]] after the former [[H7223]] manner. [[H1697]]

### 31
And when the words [[H1697]] were heard [[H8085]] which [[H834]] David [[H1732]] spake, [[H1696]] they rehearsed [[H5046]] before [[H6440]] Saul: [[H7586]] and he sent [[H3947]] for him. [[H3947]]

### 32
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Let no [[H408]] man's [[H120]] heart [[H3820]] fail [[H5307]] because [[H5921]] of him; thy servant [[H5650]] will go [[H1980]] and fight [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] this [[H2088]] Philistine. [[H6430]]

### 33
And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Thou art not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to go [[H1980]] against [[H413]] this [[H2088]] Philistine [[H6430]] to fight [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] him: for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a youth, [[H5288]] and he [[H1931]] a man [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] from his youth. [[H5271]]

### 34
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] Thy servant [[H5650]] kept [[H7462]] his father's [[H1]] sheep, [[H6629]] and there came [[H935]] a lion, [[H738]] and a bear, [[H1677]] and took [[H5375]] a lamb [[H7716]] out of the flock: [[H5739]]

### 35
And I went out [[H3318]] after [[H310]] him, and smote [[H5221]] him, and delivered [[H5337]] out of his mouth: [[H6310]] and when he arose [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] me, I caught [[H2388]] by his beard, [[H2206]] and smote [[H5221]] him, and slew [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 36
Thy servant [[H5650]] slew [[H5221]] both [[H1571]] the lion [[H738]] and [[H1571]] the bear: [[H1677]] and this [[H2088]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] Philistine [[H6430]] shall be [[H1961]] as one [[H259]] of them, seeing [[H3588]] he hath defied [[H2778]] the armies [[H4634]] of the living [[H2416]] God. [[H430]]

### 37
David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] moreover, The Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] delivered [[H5337]] me out of the paw [[H3027]] of the lion, [[H738]] and out of the paw [[H3027]] of the bear, [[H1677]] he [[H1931]] will deliver [[H5337]] me out of the hand [[H3027]] of this [[H2088]] Philistine. [[H6430]] And Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Go, [[H1980]] and the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 38
And Saul [[H7586]] armed [[H3847]] David [[H1732]] with his armour, [[H4055]] and he put [[H5414]] an helmet [[H6959]] of brass [[H5178]] upon [[H5921]] his head; [[H7218]] also he armed [[H3847]] him with a coat of mail. [[H8302]]

### 39
And David [[H1732]] girded [[H2296]] his sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] his armour, [[H4055]] and he assayed [[H2974]] to go; [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] he had not [[H3808]] proved [[H5254]] And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] I cannot [[H3201]] go [[H1980]] with these; [[H428]] for [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] proved [[H5254]] And David [[H1732]] put [[H5493]] them off him. [[H5921]]

### 40
And he took [[H3947]] his staff [[H4731]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and chose [[H977]] him five [[H2568]] smooth [[H2512]] stones [[H68]] out of [[H4480]] the brook, [[H5158]] and put [[H7760]] them in a shepherd's [[H7462]] bag [[H3627]] which [[H834]] he had, even in a scrip; [[H3219]] and his sling [[H7050]] in his hand: [[H3027]] and he drew near [[H5066]] to [[H413]] the Philistine. [[H6430]]

### 41
And the Philistine [[H6430]] came [[H1980]] on [[H1980]] and drew near [[H7131]] unto [[H413]] David; [[H1732]] and the man [[H376]] that bare [[H5375]] the shield [[H6793]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 42
And when the Philistine [[H6430]] looked about, [[H5027]] and saw [[H7200]] David, [[H1732]] he disdained [[H959]] him: for [[H3588]] he was [[H1961]] a youth, [[H5288]] and ruddy, [[H132]] and of [[H5973]] a fair [[H3303]] countenance. [[H4758]]

### 43
And the Philistine [[H6430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] I [[H595]] a dog, [[H3611]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] comest [[H935]] to [[H413]] me with staves? [[H4731]] And the Philistine [[H6430]] cursed [[H7043]] David [[H1732]] by his gods. [[H430]]

### 44
And the Philistine [[H6430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Come [[H1980]] to [[H413]] me, and I will give [[H5414]] thy flesh [[H1320]] unto the fowls [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and to the beasts [[H929]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 45
Then said [[H559]] David [[H1732]] to [[H413]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] Thou [[H859]] comest [[H935]] to [[H413]] me with a sword, [[H2719]] and with a spear, [[H2595]] and with a shield: [[H3591]] but I [[H595]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] thee in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of the armies [[H4634]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] thou hast defied. [[H2778]]

### 46
This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] will the Lord [[H3068]] deliver [[H5462]] thee into mine hand; [[H3027]] and I will smite [[H5221]] thee, and take [[H5493]] thine head [[H7218]] from [[H5921]] thee; and I will give [[H5414]] the carcases [[H6297]] of the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] unto the fowls [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and to the wild beasts [[H2416]] of the earth; [[H776]] that all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a God [[H430]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 47
And all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] assembly [[H6951]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] saveth [[H3467]] not [[H3808]] with sword [[H2719]] and spear: [[H2595]] for [[H3588]] the battle [[H4421]] the Lord's, [[H3068]] and he will give [[H5414]] you into our hands. [[H3027]]

### 48
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Philistine [[H6430]] arose, [[H6965]] and came [[H1980]] and drew nigh [[H7126]] to meet [[H7125]] David, [[H1732]] that David [[H1732]] hasted, [[H4116]] and ran [[H7323]] toward the army [[H4634]] to meet [[H7125]] the Philistine. [[H6430]]

### 49
And David [[H1732]] put [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] in [[H413]] his bag, [[H3627]] and took [[H3947]] thence [[H8033]] a stone, [[H68]] and slang [[H7049]] and smote [[H5221]] the Philistine [[H6430]] in [[H413]] his forehead, [[H4696]] that the stone [[H68]] sunk [[H2883]] into his forehead; [[H4696]] and he fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] his face [[H6440]] to the earth. [[H776]]

### 50
So David [[H1732]] prevailed [[H2388]] over [[H4480]] the Philistine [[H6430]] with a sling [[H7050]] and with a stone, [[H68]] and smote [[H5221]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] and slew [[H4191]] him; but no [[H369]] sword [[H2719]] in the hand [[H3027]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 51
Therefore David [[H1732]] ran, [[H7323]] and stood [[H5975]] upon [[H413]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] and took [[H3947]] his sword, [[H2719]] and drew [[H8025]] it out of the sheath [[H8593]] thereof, and slew [[H4191]] him, and cut off [[H3772]] his head [[H7218]] therewith. And when the Philistines [[H6430]] saw [[H7200]] their champion [[H1368]] was dead, [[H4191]] they fled. [[H5127]]

### 52
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] and of Judah [[H3063]] arose, [[H6965]] and shouted, [[H7321]] and pursued [[H7291]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] until [[H5704]] thou come [[H935]] to the valley, [[H1516]] and to [[H5704]] the gates [[H8179]] of Ekron. [[H6138]] And the wounded [[H2491]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] fell down [[H5307]] by the way [[H1870]] to Shaaraim, [[H8189]] even unto [[H5704]] Gath, [[H1661]] and unto [[H5704]] Ekron. [[H6138]]

### 53
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] returned [[H7725]] from chasing [[H1814]] after [[H310]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and they spoiled [[H8155]] their tents. [[H4264]]

### 54
And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the head [[H7218]] of the Philistine, [[H6430]] and brought [[H935]] it to Jerusalem; [[H3389]] but he put [[H7760]] his armour [[H3627]] in his tent. [[H168]]

### 55
And when Saul [[H7586]] saw [[H7200]] David [[H1732]] go forth [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abner, [[H74]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host, [[H6635]] Abner, [[H74]] whose [[H4310]] son [[H1121]] this [[H2088]] youth? [[H5288]] And Abner [[H74]] said, [[H559]] thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] O king, [[H4428]] I cannot [[H518]] tell. [[H3045]]

### 56
