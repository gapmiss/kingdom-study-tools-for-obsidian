### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of Samuel [[H8050]] came [[H1961]] to all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] Now Israel [[H3478]] went out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] the Philistines [[H6430]] to battle, [[H4421]] and pitched [[H2583]] beside [[H5921]] Eben-ezer: [[H72]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] pitched [[H2583]] in Aphek. [[H663]]

### 2
And the Philistines [[H6430]] put themselves in array [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] Israel: [[H3478]] and when they joined [[H5203]] battle, [[H4421]] Israel [[H3478]] was smitten [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] the Philistines: [[H6430]] and they slew [[H5221]] of the army [[H4634]] in the field [[H7704]] about four [[H702]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 3
And when the people [[H5971]] were come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] smitten [[H5062]] us to day [[H3117]] before [[H6440]] the Philistines? [[H6430]] Let us fetch [[H3947]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] out of Shiloh [[H7887]] unto [[H413]] us, that, when it cometh [[H935]] among [[H7130]] us, it may save [[H3467]] us out of the hand [[H3709]] of our enemies. [[H341]]

### 4
So the people [[H5971]] sent [[H7971]] to Shiloh, [[H7887]] that they might bring [[H5375]] from thence [[H8033]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] which dwelleth [[H3427]] the cherubims: [[H3742]] and the two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] of Eli, [[H5941]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas, [[H6372]] there [[H8033]] with [[H5973]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of God. [[H430]]

### 5
And when the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H935]] into [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] shouted [[H7321]] with a great [[H1419]] shout, [[H8643]] so that the earth [[H776]] rang again. [[H1949]]

### 6
And when the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] of the shout, [[H8643]] they said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] the noise [[H6963]] of this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] shout [[H8643]] in the camp [[H4264]] of the Hebrews? [[H5680]] And they understood [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the camp. [[H4264]]

### 7
And the Philistines [[H6430]] were afraid, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] is come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the camp. [[H4264]] And they said, [[H559]] Woe [[H188]] unto us! for [[H3588]] there hath not [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] such a thing [[H2063]] heretofore. [[H865]]

### 8
Woe [[H188]] unto us! who [[H4310]] shall deliver [[H5337]] us out of the hand [[H3027]] of these [[H428]] mighty [[H117]] Gods? [[H430]] these [[H428]] the Gods [[H430]] that smote [[H5221]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] with all [[H3605]] the plagues [[H4347]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 9
Be strong, [[H2388]] and quit [[H1961]] yourselves like men, [[H376]] O ye Philistines, [[H6430]] that ye be not servants [[H5647]] unto the Hebrews, [[H5680]] as [[H834]] they have been [[H5647]] to you: quit [[H1961]] yourselves like men, [[H376]] and fight. [[H3898]]

### 10
And the Philistines [[H6430]] fought, [[H3898]] and Israel [[H3478]] was smitten, [[H5062]] and they fled [[H5127]] every man [[H376]] into his tent: [[H168]] and there was [[H1961]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] slaughter; [[H4347]] for there fell [[H5307]] of Israel [[H3478]] thirty [[H7970]] thousand [[H505]] footmen. [[H7273]]

### 11
And the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] was taken; [[H3947]] and the two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] of Eli, [[H5941]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas, [[H6372]] were slain. [[H4191]]

### 12
And there ran [[H7323]] a man [[H376]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] out of the army, [[H4634]] and came [[H935]] to Shiloh [[H7887]] the same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] with his clothes [[H4055]] rent, [[H7167]] and with earth [[H127]] upon [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]]

### 13
And when he came, [[H935]] lo, [[H2009]] Eli [[H5941]] sat [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] a seat [[H3678]] by the wayside [[H1870]] watching: [[H6822]] for [[H3588]] his heart [[H3820]] trembled [[H2730]] for [[H5921]] the ark [[H727]] of God. [[H430]] And when the man [[H376]] came [[H935]] into the city, [[H5892]] and told [[H5046]] all [[H3605]] the city [[H5892]] cried out. [[H2199]]

### 14
And when Eli [[H5941]] heard [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] of the crying, [[H6818]] he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] the noise [[H6963]] of this [[H2088]] tumult? [[H1995]] And the man [[H376]] came [[H935]] in hastily, [[H4116]] and told [[H5046]] Eli. [[H5941]]

### 15
Now Eli [[H5941]] was ninety [[H8673]] and eight [[H8083]] years [[H8141]] old; [[H1121]] and his eyes [[H5869]] were dim, [[H6965]] that he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] see. [[H7200]]

### 16
And the man [[H376]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Eli, [[H5941]] I [[H595]] he that came [[H935]] out of [[H4480]] the army, [[H4634]] and I [[H589]] fled [[H5127]] to day [[H3117]] out of [[H4480]] the army. [[H4634]] And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] is [[H1961]] there done, [[H1697]] my son? [[H1121]]

### 17
And the messenger [[H1319]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Israel [[H3478]] is fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and there hath been [[H1961]] also [[H1571]] a great [[H1419]] slaughter [[H4046]] among the people, [[H5971]] and thy two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] also, [[H1571]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas, [[H6372]] are dead, [[H4191]] and the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] is taken. [[H3947]]

### 18
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he made mention [[H2142]]  of [[H853]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] that he fell [[H5307]] from off [[H5921]] the seat [[H3678]] backward [[H322]] by [[H1157]] the side [[H3027]] of the gate, [[H8179]] and his neck [[H4665]] brake, [[H7665]] and he died: [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] he was an old [[H2204]] man, [[H376]] and heavy. [[H3515]] And he [[H1931]] had judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

### 19
And his daughter in law, [[H3618]] Phinehas' [[H6372]] wife, [[H802]] was with child, [[H2030]] to be delivered: [[H3205]] and when she heard [[H8085]] the tidings [[H8052]] that [[H413]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] was taken, [[H3947]] and that her father in law [[H2524]] and her husband [[H376]] were dead, [[H4191]] she bowed herself [[H3766]] and travailed; [[H3205]] for [[H3588]] her pains [[H6735]] came [[H2015]] upon [[H5921]] her. [[H5921]]

### 20
And about the time [[H6256]] of her death [[H4191]] the women that stood [[H5324]] by her said [[H1696]] unto [[H5921]] her, Fear [[H3372]] not; [[H408]] for [[H3588]] thou hast born [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] But she answered [[H6030]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] did she regard [[H7896]]

### 21
And she named [[H7121]] the child [[H5288]] Ichabod, [[H350]] saying, [[H559]] The glory [[H3519]] is departed [[H1540]] from Israel: [[H3478]] because [[H413]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] was taken, [[H3947]] and because [[H413]] of her father in law [[H2524]] and her husband. [[H376]]

### 22
And she said, [[H559]] The glory [[H3519]] is departed [[H1540]] from Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] is taken. [[H3947]]
