# Lamentations 1

[[Jeremiah 52|←]] • [[Lamentations 2|→]]

---

### 1
How [[H349]] doth the city [[H5892]] sit [[H3427]] solitary, [[H910]] full [[H7227]] of people! [[H5971]] is she become [[H1961]] as a widow! [[H490]] she great [[H7227]] among the nations, [[H1471]] princess [[H8282]] among the provinces, [[H4082]] is she become [[H1961]] tributary! [[H4522]]

### 2
She weepeth [[H1058]] sore [[H1058]] in the night, [[H3915]] and her tears [[H1832]] on [[H5921]] her cheeks: [[H3895]] among all [[H3605]] her lovers [[H157]] she hath none [[H369]] to comfort [[H5162]] all [[H3605]] her friends [[H7453]] have dealt treacherously [[H898]] with her, they are become [[H1961]] her enemies. [[H341]]

### 3
Judah [[H3063]] is gone into captivity [[H1540]] because of affliction, [[H6040]] and because of great [[H7230]] servitude: [[H5656]] she [[H1931]] dwelleth [[H3427]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] she findeth [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] rest: [[H4494]] all [[H3605]] her persecutors [[H7291]] overtook [[H5381]] her between [[H996]] the straits. [[H4712]]

### 4
The ways [[H1870]] of Zion [[H6726]] do mourn, [[H57]] because none [[H1097]] come [[H935]] to the solemn feasts: [[H4150]] all [[H3605]] her gates [[H8179]] are desolate: [[H8074]] her priests [[H3548]] sigh, [[H584]] her virgins [[H1330]] are afflicted, [[H3013]] and she [[H1931]] in bitterness. [[H4843]]

### 5
Her adversaries [[H6862]] are [[H1961]] the chief, [[H7218]] her enemies [[H341]] prosper; [[H7951]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath afflicted [[H3013]] her for [[H5921]] the multitude [[H7230]] of her transgressions: [[H6588]] her children [[H5768]] are gone [[H1980]] into captivity [[H7628]] before [[H6440]] the enemy. [[H6862]]

### 6
And from [[H4480]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] all [[H3605]] her beauty [[H1926]] is departed: [[H3318]] her princes [[H8269]] are become [[H1961]] like harts [[H354]] find [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] pasture, [[H4829]] and they are gone [[H1980]] without [[H3808]] strength [[H3581]] before [[H6440]] the pursuer. [[H7291]]

### 7
Jerusalem [[H3389]] remembered [[H2142]] in the days [[H3117]] of her affliction [[H6040]] and of her miseries [[H4788]] all [[H3605]] her pleasant things [[H4262]] that [[H834]] she had [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] of old, [[H6924]] when her people [[H5971]] fell [[H5307]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy, [[H6862]] and none [[H369]] did help [[H5826]] her: the adversaries [[H6862]] saw [[H7200]] her, did mock [[H7832]] at [[H5921]] her sabbaths. [[H4868]]

### 8
Jerusalem [[H3389]] hath grievously [[H2399]] sinned; [[H2398]] therefore [[H5921]] she is [[H1961]] removed: [[H5206]] all [[H3605]] that honoured [[H3513]] her despise [[H2107]] her, because [[H3588]] they have seen [[H7200]] her nakedness: [[H6172]] yea, [[H1571]] she [[H1931]] sigheth, [[H584]] and turneth [[H7725]] backward. [[H268]]

### 9
Her filthiness [[H2932]] in her skirts; [[H7757]] she remembereth [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] her last end; [[H319]] therefore she came down [[H3381]] wonderfully: [[H6382]] she had no [[H369]] comforter. [[H5162]] O Lord, [[H3068]] behold [[H7200]] my affliction: [[H6040]] for [[H3588]] the enemy [[H341]] hath magnified [[H1431]]

### 10
The adversary [[H6862]] hath spread out [[H6566]] his hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] her pleasant things: [[H4261]] for [[H3588]] she hath seen [[H7200]] the heathen [[H1471]] entered [[H935]] into her sanctuary, [[H4720]] whom [[H834]] thou didst command [[H6680]] they should not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into thy congregation. [[H6951]]

### 11
All [[H3605]] her people [[H5971]] sigh, [[H584]] they seek [[H1245]] bread; [[H3899]] they have given [[H5414]] their pleasant things [[H4262]] for meat [[H400]] to relieve [[H7725]] the soul: [[H5315]] see, [[H7200]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and consider; [[H5027]] for [[H3588]] I am become [[H1961]] vile. [[H2151]]

### 12
nothing [[H3808]] to [[H413]] you, all [[H3605]] ye that pass [[H5674]] by? [[H1870]] behold, [[H5027]] and see [[H7200]] if [[H518]] there be [[H3426]] any sorrow [[H4341]] like unto my sorrow, [[H4341]] which [[H834]] is done [[H5953]] unto me, wherewith [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath afflicted [[H3013]] in the day [[H3117]] of his fierce [[H2740]] anger. [[H639]]

### 13
From above [[H4791]] hath he sent [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] into my bones, [[H6106]] and it prevaileth against [[H7287]] them: he hath spread [[H6566]] a net [[H7568]] for my feet, [[H7272]] he hath turned [[H7725]] me back: [[H268]] he hath made [[H5414]] me desolate [[H8074]] faint [[H1739]] all [[H3605]] the day. [[H3117]]

### 14
The yoke [[H5923]] of my transgressions [[H6588]] is bound [[H8244]] by his hand: [[H3027]] they are wreathed, [[H8276]] come up [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] my neck: [[H6677]] he hath made my strength [[H3581]] to fall, [[H3782]] the Lord [[H136]] hath delivered [[H5414]] me into hands, [[H3027]] I am not able [[H3201]] to rise up. [[H6965]]

### 15
The Lord [[H136]] hath trodden under foot [[H5541]] all [[H3605]] my mighty [[H47]] in the midst [[H7130]] of me: he hath called [[H7121]] an assembly [[H4150]] against [[H5921]] me to crush [[H7665]] my young men: [[H970]] the Lord [[H136]] hath trodden [[H1869]] the virgin, [[H1330]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in a winepress. [[H1660]]

### 16
For [[H5921]] these [[H428]] I [[H589]] weep; [[H1058]] mine eye, [[H5869]] mine eye [[H5869]] runneth down [[H3381]] with water, [[H4325]] because [[H3588]] the comforter [[H5162]] that should relieve [[H7725]] my soul [[H5315]] is far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me: my children [[H1121]] are [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8074]] because [[H3588]] the enemy [[H341]] prevailed. [[H1396]]

### 17
Zion [[H6726]] spreadeth forth [[H6566]] her hands, [[H3027]] none [[H369]] to comfort [[H5162]] her: the Lord [[H3068]] hath commanded [[H6680]] concerning Jacob, [[H3290]] his adversaries [[H6862]] round about [[H5439]] him: Jerusalem [[H3389]] is [[H1961]] as a menstruous woman [[H5079]] among [[H996]] them. [[H996]]

### 18
The Lord [[H3068]] is righteous; [[H6662]] for [[H3588]] I have rebelled [[H4784]] against his commandment: [[H6310]] hear, [[H8085]] I pray you, [[H4994]] all [[H3605]] people, [[H5971]] and behold [[H7200]] my sorrow: [[H4341]] my virgins [[H1330]] and my young men [[H970]] are gone [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]]

### 19
I called [[H7121]] for my lovers, [[H157]] they [[H1992]] deceived [[H7411]] me: my priests [[H3548]] and mine elders [[H2205]] gave up the ghost [[H1478]] in the city, [[H5892]] while [[H3588]] they sought [[H1245]] their meat [[H400]] to relieve [[H7725]] their souls. [[H5315]]

### 20
Behold, [[H7200]] O Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I in distress: [[H6862]] my bowels [[H4578]] are troubled; [[H2560]] mine heart [[H3820]] is turned [[H2015]] within [[H7130]] me; for [[H3588]] I have grievously [[H4784]] rebelled: [[H4784]] abroad [[H2351]] the sword [[H2719]] bereaveth, [[H7921]] at home [[H1004]] as death. [[H4194]]

### 21
They have heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] sigh: [[H584]] none [[H369]] to comfort [[H5162]] me: all [[H3605]] mine enemies [[H341]] have heard [[H8085]] of my trouble; [[H7451]] they are glad [[H7797]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast done [[H6213]] thou wilt bring [[H935]] the day [[H3117]] thou hast called, [[H7121]] and they shall be [[H1961]] like [[H3644]] unto me. [[H3644]]

### 22
Let all [[H3605]] their wickedness [[H7451]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] thee; and do [[H5953]] unto them, as [[H834]] thou hast done [[H5953]] unto me for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] my transgressions: [[H6588]] for [[H3588]] my sighs [[H585]] many, [[H7227]] and my heart [[H3820]] faint. [[H1742]]
