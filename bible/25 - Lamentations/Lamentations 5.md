### 1
Remember, [[H2142]] O Lord, [[H3068]] what [[H4100]] is come [[H1961]] upon us: consider, [[H5027]] and behold [[H7200]] our reproach. [[H2781]]

### 2
Our inheritance [[H5159]] is turned [[H2015]] to strangers, [[H2114]] our houses [[H1004]] to aliens. [[H5237]]

### 3
We are [[H1961]] orphans [[H3490]] and fatherless, [[H369]] our mothers [[H517]] as widows. [[H490]]

### 4
We have drunken [[H8354]] our water [[H4325]] for money; [[H3701]] our wood [[H6086]] is sold [[H935]] unto us. [[H4242]]

### 5
Our necks [[H6677]] under [[H5921]] persecution: [[H7291]] we labour, [[H3021]] have no rest. [[H5117]]

### 6
We have given [[H5414]] the hand [[H3027]] the Egyptians, [[H4714]] the Assyrians, [[H804]] to be satisfied [[H7646]] with bread. [[H3899]]

### 7
Our fathers [[H1]] have sinned, [[H2398]] not; [[H369]] and we [[H587]] have borne [[H5445]] their iniquities. [[H5771]]

### 8
Servants [[H5650]] have ruled over [[H4910]] us: none [[H369]] that doth deliver [[H6561]] out of their hand. [[H3027]]

### 9
We gat [[H935]] our bread [[H3899]] with our lives [[H5315]] because [[H6440]] of the sword [[H2719]] of the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 10
Our skin [[H5785]] was black [[H3648]] like an oven [[H8574]] because [[H6440]] of the terrible [[H2152]] famine. [[H7458]]

### 11
They ravished [[H6031]] the women [[H802]] in Zion, [[H6726]] the maids [[H1330]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 12
Princes [[H8269]] are hanged up [[H8518]] by their hand: [[H3027]] the faces [[H6440]] of elders [[H2205]] were not [[H3808]] honoured. [[H1921]]

### 13
They took [[H5375]] the young men [[H970]] to grind, [[H2911]] and the children [[H5288]] fell [[H3782]] under the wood. [[H6086]]

### 14
The elders [[H2205]] have ceased [[H7673]] from the gate, [[H8179]] the young men [[H970]] from their musick. [[H5058]]

### 15
The joy [[H4885]] of our heart [[H3820]] is ceased; [[H7673]] our dance [[H4234]] is turned [[H2015]] into mourning. [[H60]]

### 16
The crown [[H5850]] is fallen [[H5307]] our head: [[H7218]] woe [[H188]] unto us, that [[H3588]] we have sinned! [[H2398]]

### 17
For [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] our heart [[H3820]] is [[H1961]] faint; [[H1739]] for [[H5921]] these [[H428]] our eyes [[H5869]] are dim. [[H2821]]

### 18
Because of [[H5921]] the mountain [[H2022]] of Zion, [[H6726]] which is desolate, [[H8074]] the foxes [[H7776]] walk [[H1980]] upon it. [[H1980]]

### 19
Thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] remainest [[H3427]] for ever; [[H5769]] thy throne [[H3678]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]

### 20
Wherefore [[H4100]] dost thou forget [[H7911]] us for ever, [[H5331]] forsake [[H5800]] us so long [[H753]] time? [[H3117]]

### 21
Turn [[H7725]] thou us unto [[H413]] thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] and we shall be turned; [[H7725]] renew [[H2318]] our days [[H3117]] as of old. [[H6924]]

### 22
But [[H3588]] thou hast utterly us; [[H3988]] rejected [[H3973]] thou art very [[H3966]] wroth [[H7107]] against us. [[H5921]]
