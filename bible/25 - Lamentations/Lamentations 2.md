### 1
How [[H349]] hath the Lord [[H136]] covered [[H5743]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] with a cloud in his anger, [[H639]] cast down [[H7993]] from heaven [[H8064]] unto the earth [[H776]] the beauty [[H8597]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and remembered [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] his footstool [[H1916]] in the day [[H3117]] of his anger! [[H639]]

### 2
The Lord [[H136]] hath swallowed up [[H1104]] all [[H3605]] the habitations [[H4999]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and hath not [[H3808]] pitied: [[H2550]] he hath thrown down [[H2040]] in his wrath [[H5678]] the strong holds [[H4013]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Judah; [[H3063]] he hath brought down [[H5060]] to the ground: [[H776]] he hath polluted [[H2490]] the kingdom [[H4467]] and the princes [[H8269]] thereof. [[H8269]]

### 3
He hath cut off [[H1438]] in fierce [[H2750]] anger [[H639]] all [[H3605]] the horn [[H7161]] of Israel: [[H3478]] he hath drawn [[H7725]] back [[H268]] his right hand [[H3225]] from before [[H6440]] the enemy, [[H341]] and he burned [[H1197]] against Jacob [[H3290]] like a flaming [[H3852]] fire, [[H784]] devoureth [[H398]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 4
He hath bent [[H1869]] his bow [[H7198]] like an enemy: [[H341]] he stood [[H5324]] with his right hand [[H3225]] as an adversary, [[H6862]] and slew [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] pleasant [[H4261]] to the eye [[H5869]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion: [[H6726]] he poured out [[H8210]] his fury [[H2534]] like fire. [[H784]]

### 5
The Lord [[H136]] was [[H1961]] as an enemy: [[H341]] he hath swallowed up [[H1104]] Israel, [[H3478]] he hath swallowed up [[H1104]] all [[H3605]] her palaces: [[H759]] he hath destroyed [[H7843]] his strong holds, [[H4013]] and hath increased [[H7235]] in the daughter [[H1323]] of Judah [[H3063]] mourning [[H8386]] and lamentation. [[H592]]

### 6
And he hath violently taken away [[H2554]] his tabernacle, [[H7900]] as a garden: [[H1588]] he hath destroyed [[H7843]] his places of the assembly: [[H4150]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath caused the solemn feasts [[H4150]] and sabbaths [[H7676]] to be forgotten [[H7911]] in Zion, [[H6726]] and hath despised [[H5006]] in the indignation [[H2195]] of his anger [[H639]] the king [[H4428]] and the priest. [[H3548]]

### 7
The Lord [[H136]] hath cast off [[H2186]] his altar, [[H4196]] he hath abhorred [[H5010]] his sanctuary, [[H4720]] he hath given up [[H5462]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy [[H341]] the walls [[H2346]] of her palaces; [[H759]] they have made [[H5414]] a noise [[H6963]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] as in the day [[H3117]] of a solemn feast. [[H4150]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] hath purposed [[H2803]] to destroy [[H7843]] the wall [[H2346]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion: [[H6726]] he hath stretched out [[H5186]] a line, [[H6957]] he hath not [[H3808]] withdrawn [[H7725]] his hand [[H3027]] from destroying: [[H1104]] therefore he made the rampart [[H2426]] and the wall [[H2346]] to lament; [[H56]] they languished [[H535]] together. [[H3162]]

### 9
Her gates [[H8179]] are sunk [[H2883]] into the ground; [[H776]] he hath destroyed [[H6]] and broken [[H7665]] her bars: [[H1280]] her king [[H4428]] and her princes [[H8269]] among the Gentiles: [[H1471]] the law [[H8451]] no [[H369]] her prophets [[H5030]] also [[H1571]] find [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] vision [[H2377]] from the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
The elders [[H2205]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] sit [[H3427]] upon the ground, [[H776]] keep silence: [[H1826]] they have cast up [[H5927]] dust [[H6083]] upon [[H5921]] their heads; [[H7218]] they have girded [[H2296]] themselves with sackcloth: [[H8242]] the virgins [[H1330]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] hang down [[H3381]] their heads [[H7218]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 11
Mine eyes [[H5869]] do fail [[H3615]] with tears, [[H1832]] my bowels [[H4578]] are troubled, [[H2560]] my liver [[H3516]] is poured [[H8210]] upon the earth, [[H776]] for [[H5921]] the destruction [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people; [[H5971]] because the children [[H5768]] and the sucklings [[H3243]] swoon [[H5848]] in the streets [[H7339]] of the city. [[H7151]]

### 12
They say [[H559]] to their mothers, [[H517]] Where [[H346]] corn [[H1715]] and wine? [[H3196]] when they swooned [[H5848]] as the wounded [[H2491]] in the streets [[H7339]] of the city, [[H5892]] when their soul [[H5315]] was poured out [[H8210]] into [[H413]] their mothers' [[H517]] bosom. [[H2436]]

### 13
What thing [[H4100]] shall I take to witness [[H5749]] for thee? what thing [[H4100]] shall I liken [[H1819]] to thee, O daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem? [[H3389]] what [[H4100]] shall I equal [[H7737]] to thee, that I may comfort [[H5162]] thee, O virgin [[H1330]] daughter [[H1323]] of Zion? [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] thy breach [[H7667]] great [[H1419]] like the sea: [[H3220]] who [[H4310]] can heal [[H7495]] thee? [[H7495]]

### 14
Thy prophets [[H5030]] have seen [[H2372]] vain [[H7723]] and foolish things [[H8602]] for thee: and they have not [[H3808]] discovered [[H1540]] thine iniquity, [[H5771]] to turn away [[H7725]] thy captivity; [[H7622]] but have seen [[H2372]] for thee false [[H7723]] burdens [[H4864]] and causes of banishment. [[H4065]]

### 15
All [[H3605]] that pass by [[H5674]] clap [[H5606]] hands [[H3709]] at [[H5921]] thee; [[H1870]] they hiss [[H8319]] and wag [[H5128]] their head [[H7218]] at [[H5921]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] this [[H2063]] the city [[H5892]] that call [[H559]] The perfection [[H3632]] of beauty, [[H3308]] The joy [[H4885]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth? [[H776]]

### 16
All [[H3605]] thine enemies [[H341]] have opened [[H6475]] their mouth [[H6310]] against [[H5921]] thee: they hiss [[H8319]] and gnash [[H2786]] the teeth: [[H8127]] they say, [[H559]] We have swallowed up: [[H1104]] certainly [[H389]] this [[H2088]] the day [[H3117]] that we looked for; [[H6960]] we have found, [[H4672]] we have seen [[H7200]]

### 17
The Lord [[H3068]] hath done [[H6213]] which [[H834]] he had devised; [[H2161]] he hath fulfilled [[H1214]] his word [[H565]] that [[H834]] he had commanded [[H6680]] in the days [[H3117]] of old: [[H6924]] he hath thrown down, [[H2040]] and hath not [[H3808]] pitied: [[H2550]] and he hath caused enemy [[H341]] to rejoice [[H8055]] over [[H5921]] thee, he hath set up [[H7311]] the horn [[H7161]] of thine adversaries. [[H6862]]

### 18
Their heart [[H3820]] cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H136]] O wall [[H2346]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] let tears [[H1832]] run down [[H3381]] like a river [[H5158]] day [[H3119]] and night: [[H3915]] give [[H5414]] thyself no [[H408]] rest; [[H6314]] let not [[H408]] the apple [[H1323]] of thine eye [[H5869]] cease. [[H1826]]

### 19
Arise, [[H6965]] cry out [[H7442]] in the night: [[H3915]] in the beginning [[H7218]] of the watches [[H821]] pour out [[H8210]] thine heart [[H3820]] like water [[H4325]] before [[H5227]] the face [[H6440]] of the Lord: [[H136]] lift up [[H5375]] thy hands [[H3709]] toward [[H413]] him for [[H5921]] the life [[H5315]] of thy young children, [[H5768]] that faint [[H5848]] for hunger [[H7458]] in the top [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] street. [[H2351]]

### 20
Behold, [[H7200]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and consider [[H5027]] to whom [[H4310]] thou hast done [[H5953]] this. [[H3541]] Shall the women [[H802]] eat [[H398]] their fruit, [[H6529]] children [[H5768]] of a span long? [[H2949]] shall the priest [[H3548]] and the prophet [[H5030]] be slain [[H2026]] in the sanctuary [[H4720]] of the Lord? [[H136]]

### 21
The young [[H5288]] and the old [[H2205]] lie [[H7901]] on the ground [[H776]] in the streets: [[H2351]] my virgins [[H1330]] and my young men [[H970]] are fallen [[H5307]] by the sword; [[H2719]] thou hast slain [[H2026]] in the day [[H3117]] of thine anger; [[H639]] thou hast killed, [[H2873]] not [[H3808]] pitied. [[H2550]]

### 22
Thou hast called [[H7121]] as in a solemn [[H4150]] day [[H3117]] my terrors [[H4032]] round about, [[H5439]] so that in the day [[H3117]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] none [[H3808]] escaped [[H6412]] nor remained: [[H8300]] those that [[H834]] I have swaddled [[H2946]] and brought up [[H7235]] hath mine enemy [[H341]] consumed. [[H3615]]
