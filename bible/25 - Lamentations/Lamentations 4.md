### 1
How [[H349]] is the gold [[H2091]] become dim! [[H6004]] is the most [[H2896]] fine gold [[H3800]] changed! [[H8132]] the stones [[H68]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] are poured out [[H8210]] in the top [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] street. [[H2351]]

### 2
The precious [[H3368]] sons [[H1121]] of Zion, [[H6726]] comparable [[H5537]] to fine gold, [[H6337]] how [[H349]] are they esteemed [[H2803]] as earthen [[H2789]] pitchers, [[H5035]] the work [[H4639]] of the hands [[H3027]] of the potter! [[H3335]]

### 3
Even [[H1571]] the sea monsters [[H8577]] draw out [[H2502]] the breast, [[H7699]] they give suck [[H3243]] to their young ones: [[H1482]] the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] cruel, [[H393]] like the ostriches [[H3283]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 4
The tongue [[H3956]] of the sucking child [[H3243]] cleaveth [[H1692]] to [[H413]] the roof of his mouth [[H2441]] for thirst: [[H6772]] the young children [[H5768]] ask [[H7592]] bread, [[H3899]] no man [[H369]] breaketh [[H6566]] unto them. [[H6566]]

### 5
They that did feed [[H398]] delicately [[H4574]] are desolate [[H8074]] in the streets: [[H2351]] they that were brought up [[H539]] in [[H5921]] scarlet [[H8438]] embrace [[H2263]] dunghills. [[H830]]

### 6
For the punishment of the iniquity [[H5771]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] is greater [[H1431]] than the punishment [[H2403]] of the sin of Sodom, [[H5467]] that was overthrown [[H2015]] as in [[H3644]] a moment, [[H7281]] and no [[H3808]] hands [[H3027]] stayed [[H2342]] on her. [[H2342]]

### 7
Her Nazarites [[H5139]] were purer [[H2141]] than snow, [[H7950]] they were whiter [[H6705]] than milk, [[H2461]] they were more ruddy [[H119]] in body [[H6106]] than rubies, [[H6443]] their polishing [[H1508]] of sapphire: [[H5601]]

### 8
Their visage [[H8389]] is blacker [[H2821]] than a coal; [[H7815]] they are not [[H3808]] known [[H5234]] in the streets: [[H2351]] their skin [[H5785]] cleaveth [[H6821]] to [[H5921]] their bones; [[H6106]] it is withered, [[H3001]] it is become [[H1961]] like a stick. [[H6086]]

### 9
slain [[H2491]] with the sword [[H2719]] are [[H1961]] better [[H2896]] than slain [[H2491]] with hunger: [[H7458]] for these [[H1992]] pine away, [[H2100]] stricken through [[H1856]] for the fruits [[H8570]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 10
The hands [[H3027]] of the pitiful [[H7362]] women [[H802]] have sodden [[H1310]] their own children: [[H3206]] they were [[H1961]] their meat [[H1262]] in the destruction [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people. [[H5971]]

### 11
The Lord [[H3068]] hath accomplished [[H3615]] his fury; [[H2534]] he hath poured out [[H8210]] his fierce [[H2740]] anger, [[H639]] and hath kindled [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in Zion, [[H6726]] and it hath devoured [[H398]] the foundations [[H3247]] thereof. [[H3247]]

### 12
The kings [[H4428]] of the earth, [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world, [[H8398]] would not [[H3808]] have believed [[H539]] that [[H3588]] the adversary [[H6862]] and the enemy [[H341]] should have entered [[H935]] into the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 13
For the sins [[H2403]] of her prophets, [[H5030]] the iniquities [[H5771]] of her priests, [[H3548]] that have shed [[H8210]] the blood [[H1818]] of the just [[H6662]] in the midst [[H7130]] of her, [[H7130]]

### 14
They have wandered [[H5128]] blind [[H5787]] in the streets, [[H2351]] they have polluted [[H1351]] themselves with blood, [[H1818]] so that men could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] touch [[H5060]] their garments. [[H3830]]

### 15
They cried [[H7121]] unto them, Depart [[H5493]] ye; unclean; [[H2931]] depart, [[H5493]] depart, [[H5493]] touch [[H5060]] not: [[H408]] when [[H3588]] they fled away [[H5132]] and [[H1571]] wandered, [[H5128]] they said [[H559]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] They shall no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] sojourn [[H1481]]

### 16
The anger [[H6440]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath divided [[H2505]] them; he will no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] regard [[H5027]] them: they respected [[H5375]] not [[H3808]] the persons [[H6440]] of the priests, [[H3548]] they favoured [[H2603]] not [[H3808]] the elders. [[H2205]]

### 17
As for us, our eyes [[H5869]] as yet [[H5750]] failed [[H3615]] for [[H413]] our vain [[H1892]] help: [[H5833]] in our watching [[H6836]] we have watched [[H6822]] for [[H413]] a nation [[H1471]] could not [[H3808]] save [[H3467]]

### 18
They hunt [[H6679]] our steps, [[H6806]] that we cannot go [[H1980]] in our streets: [[H7339]] our end [[H7093]] is near, [[H7126]] our days [[H3117]] are fulfilled; [[H4390]] for [[H3588]] our end [[H7093]] is come. [[H935]]

### 19
Our persecutors [[H7291]] are [[H1961]] swifter [[H7031]] than the eagles [[H5404]] of the heaven: [[H8064]] they pursued [[H1814]] us upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] they laid wait [[H693]] for us in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 20
The breath [[H7307]] of our nostrils, [[H639]] the anointed [[H4899]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] was taken [[H3920]] in their pits, [[H7825]] of whom [[H834]] we said, [[H559]] Under his shadow [[H6738]] we shall live [[H2421]] among the heathen. [[H1471]]

### 21
Rejoice [[H7797]] and be glad, [[H8055]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Edom, [[H123]] that dwellest [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Uz; [[H5780]] the cup [[H3563]] also [[H1571]] shall pass through [[H5674]] unto [[H5921]] thee: thou shalt be drunken, [[H7937]] and shalt make thyself naked. [[H6168]]

### 22
The punishment of thine iniquity [[H5771]] is accomplished, [[H8552]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion; [[H6726]] he will no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] carry thee away into captivity: [[H1540]] he will visit [[H6485]] thine iniquity, [[H5771]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Edom; [[H123]] he will discover [[H1540]] thy sins.
