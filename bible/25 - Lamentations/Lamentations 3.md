### 1
I [[H589]] the man [[H1397]] hath seen [[H7200]] affliction [[H6040]] by the rod [[H7626]] of his wrath. [[H5678]]

### 2
He hath led [[H5090]] me, and brought [[H1980]] darkness, [[H2822]] but not [[H3808]] light. [[H216]]

### 3
Surely [[H389]] against me is he turned; [[H7725]] he turneth [[H2015]] his hand [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] the day. [[H3117]]

### 4
My flesh [[H1320]] and my skin [[H5785]] hath he made old; [[H1086]] he hath broken [[H7665]] my bones. [[H6106]]

### 5
He hath builded against [[H1129]] me, and compassed [[H5362]] with gall [[H7219]] and travail. [[H8513]]

### 6
He hath set [[H3427]] me in dark places, [[H4285]] as dead [[H4191]] of old. [[H5769]]

### 7
He hath hedged [[H1443]] me about, [[H1157]] that I cannot [[H3808]] get out: [[H3318]] he hath made my chain [[H5178]] heavy. [[H3513]]

### 8
Also [[H1571]] when [[H3588]] I cry [[H2199]] and shout, [[H7768]] he shutteth out [[H5640]] my prayer. [[H8605]]

### 9
He hath inclosed [[H1443]] my ways [[H1870]] with hewn stone, [[H1496]] he hath made my paths [[H5410]] crooked. [[H5753]]

### 10
He [[H1931]] unto me a bear [[H1677]] lying in wait, [[H693]] a lion [[H738]] in secret places. [[H4565]]

### 11
He hath turned aside [[H5493]] my ways, [[H1870]] and pulled me in pieces: [[H6582]] he hath made [[H7760]] me desolate. [[H8074]]

### 12
He hath bent [[H1869]] his bow, [[H7198]] and set [[H5324]] me as a mark [[H4307]] for the arrow. [[H2671]]

### 13
He hath caused the arrows [[H1121]] of his quiver [[H827]] to enter [[H935]] into my reins. [[H3629]]

### 14
I was [[H1961]] a derision [[H7814]] to all [[H3605]] my people; [[H5971]] their song [[H5058]] all [[H3605]] the day. [[H3117]]

### 15
He hath filled [[H7646]] me with bitterness, [[H4844]] he hath made me drunken [[H7301]] with wormwood. [[H3939]]

### 16
He hath also broken [[H1638]] my teeth [[H8127]] with gravel stones, [[H2687]] he hath covered [[H3728]] me with ashes. [[H665]]

### 17
And thou hast removed off [[H2186]] my soul [[H5315]] far from peace: [[H7965]] I forgat [[H5382]] prosperity. [[H2896]]

### 18
And I said, [[H559]] My strength [[H5331]] and my hope [[H8431]] is perished [[H6]] from the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 19
Remembering [[H2142]] mine affliction [[H6040]] and my misery, [[H4788]] the wormwood [[H3939]] and the gall. [[H7219]]

### 20
My soul [[H5315]] hath still [[H2142]] in remembrance, [[H2142]] and is humbled [[H7743]] in [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 21
This [[H2063]] I recall [[H7725]] to [[H413]] my mind, [[H3820]] therefore [[H5921]] have I hope. [[H3176]]

### 22
the Lord's [[H3068]] mercies [[H2617]] that [[H3588]] we are not [[H3808]] consumed, [[H8552]] because [[H3588]] his compassions [[H7356]] fail [[H3615]] not. [[H3615]]

### 23
new [[H2319]] every morning: [[H1242]] great [[H7227]] thy faithfulness. [[H530]]

### 24
The Lord [[H3068]] my portion, [[H2506]] saith [[H559]] my soul; [[H5315]] therefore [[H5921]] will I hope [[H3176]] in him. [[H3176]]

### 25
The Lord [[H3068]] good [[H2896]] unto them that wait for [[H6960]] him, to the soul [[H5315]] seeketh [[H1875]] him. [[H1875]]

### 26
good [[H2896]] that should both hope [[H2342]] and quietly wait [[H1748]] for the salvation [[H8668]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
good [[H2896]] for a man [[H1397]] that [[H3588]] he bear [[H5375]] the yoke [[H5923]] in his youth. [[H5271]]

### 28
He sitteth [[H3427]] alone [[H910]] and keepeth silence, [[H1826]] because [[H3588]] he hath borne [[H5190]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 29
He putteth [[H5414]] his mouth [[H6310]] in the dust; [[H6083]] if so be [[H194]] there may be [[H3426]] hope. [[H8615]]

### 30
He giveth [[H5414]] cheek [[H3895]] to him that smiteth [[H5221]] him: he is filled full [[H7646]] with reproach. [[H2781]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] will not [[H3808]] cast off [[H2186]] for ever: [[H5769]]

### 32
But [[H3588]] though [[H518]] he cause grief, [[H3013]] yet will he have compassion [[H7355]] according to the multitude [[H7230]] of his mercies. [[H2617]]

### 33
For [[H3588]] he doth not [[H3808]] afflict [[H6031]] willingly [[H3820]] nor grieve [[H3013]] the children [[H1121]] of men. [[H376]]

### 34
To crush [[H1792]] under [[H8478]] his feet [[H7272]] all [[H3605]] the prisoners [[H615]] of the earth, [[H776]]

### 35
To turn aside [[H5186]] the right [[H4941]] of a man [[H1397]] before [[H5048]] the face [[H6440]] of the most High, [[H5945]]

### 36
To subvert [[H5791]] a man [[H120]] in his cause, [[H7379]] the Lord [[H136]] approveth [[H7200]] not. [[H7200]]

### 37
Who [[H4310]] he [[H2088]] saith, [[H559]] and it cometh to pass, [[H1961]] the Lord [[H136]] commandeth [[H6680]] not? [[H6680]]

### 38
Out of the mouth [[H6310]] of the most High [[H5945]] proceedeth [[H3318]] not [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] and good? [[H2896]]

### 39
Wherefore [[H4100]] doth a living [[H2416]] man [[H120]] complain, [[H596]] a man [[H1397]] for [[H5921]] the punishment of his sins? [[H2399]]

### 40
Let us search [[H2664]] and try [[H2713]] our ways, [[H1870]] and turn again [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 41
Let us lift up [[H5375]] our heart [[H3824]] with [[H413]] hands [[H3709]] unto [[H413]] God [[H410]] in the heavens. [[H8064]]

### 42
We [[H5168]] have transgressed [[H6586]] and have rebelled: [[H4784]] thou [[H859]] hast not [[H3808]] pardoned. [[H5545]]

### 43
Thou hast covered [[H5526]] with anger, [[H639]] and persecuted [[H7291]] us: thou hast slain, [[H2026]] thou hast not [[H3808]] pitied. [[H2550]]

### 44
Thou hast covered [[H5526]] thyself with a cloud, [[H6051]] that prayer [[H8605]] should not pass through. [[H5674]]

### 45
Thou hast made [[H7760]] us the offscouring [[H5501]] and refuse [[H3973]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 46
All [[H3605]] our enemies [[H341]] have opened [[H6475]] their mouths [[H6310]] against [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 47
Fear [[H6343]] and a snare [[H6354]] is come [[H1961]] upon us, desolation [[H7612]] and destruction. [[H7667]]

### 48
Mine eye [[H5869]] runneth down [[H3381]] with rivers [[H6388]] of water [[H4325]] for [[H5921]] the destruction [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people. [[H5971]]

### 49
Mine eye [[H5869]] trickleth down, [[H5064]] and ceaseth [[H1820]] not, [[H3808]] without any [[H369]] intermission, [[H2014]]

### 50
Till [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] look down, [[H8259]] and behold [[H7200]] from heaven. [[H8064]]

### 51
Mine eye [[H5869]] affecteth [[H5953]] mine heart [[H5315]] because of all [[H3605]] the daughters [[H1323]] of my city. [[H5892]]

### 52
Mine enemies [[H341]] chased [[H6679]] me sore, [[H6679]] like a bird, [[H6833]] without cause. [[H2600]]

### 53
They have cut off [[H6789]] my life [[H2416]] in the dungeon, [[H953]] and cast [[H3034]] a stone [[H68]] upon me. [[H68]]

### 54
Waters [[H4325]] flowed over [[H6687]] mine head; [[H7218]] I said, [[H559]] I am cut off. [[H1504]]

### 55
I called upon [[H7121]] thy name, [[H8034]] O Lord, [[H3068]] out of the low [[H8482]] dungeon. [[H953]]

### 56
Thou hast heard [[H8085]] my voice: [[H6963]] hide [[H5956]] not [[H408]] thine ear [[H241]] at my breathing, [[H7309]] at my cry. [[H7775]]

### 57
Thou drewest near [[H7126]] in the day [[H3117]] I called upon [[H7121]] thee: thou saidst, [[H559]] Fear [[H3372]] not. [[H3372]]

### 58
O Lord, [[H136]] thou hast pleaded [[H7378]] the causes [[H7379]] of my soul; [[H5315]] thou hast redeemed [[H1350]] my life. [[H2416]]

### 59
O Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast seen [[H7200]] my wrong: [[H5792]] judge [[H8199]] thou my cause. [[H4941]]

### 60
Thou hast seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] their vengeance [[H5360]] all [[H3605]] their imaginations [[H4284]] against me. [[H4284]]

### 61
Thou hast heard [[H8085]] their reproach, [[H2781]] O Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] their imaginations [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] me; [[H5921]]

### 62
The lips [[H8193]] of those that rose up against [[H6965]] me, and their device [[H1902]] against [[H5921]] me all [[H3605]] the day. [[H3117]]

### 63
Behold [[H5027]] their sitting down, [[H3427]] and their rising up; [[H7012]] I [[H589]] their musick. [[H4485]]

### 64
Render [[H7725]] unto them a recompence, [[H1576]] O Lord, [[H3068]] according to the work [[H4639]] of their hands. [[H3027]]

### 65
Give [[H5414]] them sorrow [[H4044]] of heart, [[H3820]] thy curse [[H8381]] unto them. [[H8381]]

### 66
Persecute [[H7291]] and destroy [[H8045]] them in anger [[H639]] from under [[H8478]] the heavens [[H8064]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
