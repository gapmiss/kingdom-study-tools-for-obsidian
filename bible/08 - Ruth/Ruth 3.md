### 1
Then Naomi [[H5281]] her mother in law [[H2545]] said [[H559]] unto her, My daughter, [[H1323]] shall I not [[H3808]] seek [[H1245]] rest [[H4494]] for thee, that [[H834]] it may be well [[H3190]] with thee? [[H3190]]

### 2
And now [[H6258]] not [[H3808]] Boaz [[H1162]] of our kindred, [[H4130]] with [[H854]] whose [[H834]] maidens [[H5291]] thou wast? [[H1961]] Behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] winnoweth [[H2219]] barley [[H8184]] to night [[H3915]]  in [[H853]] the threshingfloor. [[H1637]]

### 3
Wash [[H7364]] thyself therefore, and anoint [[H5480]] thee, and put [[H7760]] thy raiment [[H8071]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and get thee down [[H3381]] to the floor: [[H1637]] make not thyself known [[H3045]] unto the man, [[H376]] until [[H5704]] he shall have done [[H3615]] eating [[H398]] and drinking. [[H8354]]

### 4
And it shall be, [[H1961]] when he lieth down, [[H7901]] that thou shalt mark [[H3045]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he shall lie, [[H7901]] and thou shalt go in, [[H935]] and uncover [[H1540]] his feet, [[H4772]] and lay thee down; [[H7901]] and he [[H1931]] will tell [[H5046]]  thee [[H853]] what [[H834]] thou shalt do. [[H6213]]

### 5
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou sayest unto me [[H559]] I will do. [[H6213]]

### 6
And she went down [[H3381]] unto the floor, [[H1637]] and did [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] her mother in law [[H2545]] bade [[H6680]] her. [[H6680]]

### 7
And when Boaz [[H1162]] had eaten [[H398]] and drunk, [[H8354]] and his heart [[H3820]] was merry, [[H3190]] he went [[H935]] to lie down [[H7901]] at the end [[H7097]] of the heap of corn: [[H6194]] and she came [[H935]] softly, [[H3909]] and uncovered [[H1540]] his feet, [[H4772]] and laid her down. [[H7901]]

### 8
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at midnight, [[H2677]] that the man [[H376]] was afraid, [[H2729]] and turned himself: [[H3943]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a woman [[H802]] lay [[H7901]] at his feet. [[H4772]]

### 9
And he said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] thou? [[H859]] And she answered, [[H559]] I [[H595]] Ruth [[H7327]] thine handmaid: [[H519]] spread [[H6566]] therefore thy skirt [[H3671]] over [[H5921]] thine handmaid; [[H519]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a near kinsman. [[H1350]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] thou [[H859]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] my daughter: [[H1323]] thou hast shewed more [[H3190]] kindness [[H2617]] in the latter end [[H314]] than [[H4480]] at the beginning, [[H7223]] inasmuch as thou followedst [[H1980]] not [[H1115]] young men, [[H970]] whether [[H518]] poor [[H1800]] or [[H518]] rich. [[H6223]]

### 11
And now, [[H6258]] my daughter, [[H1323]] fear [[H3372]] not; [[H408]] I will do [[H6213]] to thee all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou requirest: [[H559]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the city [[H8179]] of my people [[H5971]] doth know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou a virtuous [[H2428]] woman. [[H802]]

### 12
And now [[H6258]] it is true [[H551]] that [[H3588]] I [[H595]] near kinsman: [[H1350]] howbeit [[H1571]] there is [[H3426]] a kinsman [[H1350]] nearer [[H7138]] than [[H4480]] I. [[H4480]]

### 13
Tarry [[H3885]] this night, [[H3915]] and it shall be [[H1961]] in the morning, [[H1242]] if [[H518]] he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, [[H1350]] well; [[H2896]] let him do the kinsman's part: [[H1350]] but if [[H518]] he will [[H2654]] not [[H3808]] do the part of a kinsman [[H1350]] to thee, then will I [[H595]] do the part of a kinsman [[H1350]] to thee, the Lord [[H3068]] liveth: [[H2416]] lie down [[H7901]] until [[H5704]] the morning. [[H1242]]

### 14
And she lay [[H7901]] at his feet [[H4772]] until [[H5704]] the morning: [[H1242]] and she rose up [[H6965]] before [[H2958]] one [[H376]] could know [[H5234]] another. [[H7453]] And he said, [[H559]] Let it not [[H408]] be known [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] a woman [[H802]] came [[H935]] into the floor. [[H1637]]

### 15
Also he said, [[H559]] Bring [[H3051]] the vail [[H4304]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and hold [[H270]] it. And when she held [[H270]] it, he measured [[H4058]] six [[H8337]] of barley, [[H8184]] and laid [[H7896]] on [[H5921]] her: and she went into [[H935]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 16
And when she came [[H935]] to [[H413]] her mother in law, [[H2545]] she said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] thou, [[H859]] my daughter? [[H1323]] And she told [[H5046]]  her [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the man [[H376]] had done [[H6213]] to her. [[H6213]]

### 17
And she said, [[H559]] These [[H428]] six [[H8337]] of barley [[H8184]] gave [[H5414]] he me; for [[H3588]] he said [[H559]] to me, Go [[H935]] not [[H408]] empty [[H7387]] unto [[H413]] thy mother in law. [[H2545]]

### 18
Then said [[H559]] she, Sit still, [[H3427]] my daughter, [[H1323]] until [[H5704]] thou know [[H3045]] how [[H349]] the matter [[H1697]] will fall: [[H5307]] for [[H3588]] the man [[H376]] will not [[H3808]] be in rest, [[H8252]] until [[H518]] he have finished [[H3615]] the thing [[H1697]] this day.
