### 1
And Naomi [[H5281]] had a kinsman [[H4129]] of her husband's, [[H376]] a mighty [[H1368]] man [[H376]] of wealth, [[H2428]] of the family [[H4940]] of Elimelech; [[H458]] and his name [[H8034]] Boaz. [[H1162]]

### 2
And Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess [[H4125]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Naomi, [[H5281]] Let me now [[H4994]] go [[H1980]] to the field, [[H7704]] and glean [[H3950]] ears of corn [[H7641]] after [[H310]] in whose sight [[H5869]] I shall find [[H4672]] grace. [[H2580]] And she said [[H559]] unto her, Go, [[H1980]] my daughter. [[H1323]]

### 3
And she went, [[H1980]] and came, [[H935]] and gleaned [[H3950]] in the field [[H7704]] after [[H310]] the reapers: [[H7114]] and her hap [[H4745]] was to light [[H7136]] on a part [[H2513]] of the field [[H7704]] unto Boaz, [[H1162]] who [[H834]] of the kindred [[H4940]] of Elimelech. [[H458]]

### 4
And, behold, [[H2009]] Boaz [[H1162]] came [[H935]] from Bethlehem, [[H1035]] and said [[H559]] unto the reapers, [[H7114]] The Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] you. And they answered [[H559]] him, The Lord [[H3068]] bless [[H1288]] thee. [[H1288]]

### 5
Then said [[H559]] Boaz [[H1162]] unto his servant [[H5288]] that was set [[H5324]] over [[H5921]] the reapers, [[H7114]] Whose [[H4310]] damsel [[H5291]] this? [[H2063]]

### 6
And the servant [[H5288]] that was set [[H5324]] over [[H5921]] the reapers [[H7114]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] It [[H1931]] the Moabitish [[H4125]] damsel [[H5291]] that came back [[H7725]] with [[H5973]] Naomi [[H5281]] out of the country [[H7704]] of Moab: [[H4124]]

### 7
And she said, [[H559]] I pray [[H4994]] you, let me glean [[H3950]] and gather [[H622]] after [[H310]] the reapers [[H7114]] among the sheaves: [[H6016]] so she came, [[H935]] and hath continued [[H5975]] even [[H227]] from the morning [[H1242]] until [[H5704]] now, [[H6258]] that [[H2088]] she tarried [[H3427]] a little [[H4592]] in the house. [[H1004]]

### 8
Then said [[H559]] Boaz [[H1162]] unto [[H413]] Ruth, [[H7327]] Hearest [[H8085]] thou not, [[H3808]] my daughter? [[H1323]] Go [[H1980]] not [[H408]] to glean [[H3950]] in another [[H312]] field, [[H7704]] neither [[H1571]] go [[H5674]] from hence, [[H2088]] but [[H3541]] abide [[H1692]] here fast by [[H5973]] my maidens: [[H5291]]

### 9
thine eyes [[H5869]] on the field [[H7704]] that [[H834]] they do reap, [[H7114]] and go [[H1980]] thou after [[H310]] them: have I not [[H3808]] charged [[H6680]] the young men [[H5288]] that they shall not [[H1115]] touch [[H5060]] thee? and when thou art athirst, [[H6770]] go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] the vessels, [[H3627]] and drink [[H8354]] of which [[H834]] the young men [[H5288]] have drawn. [[H7579]]

### 10
Then she fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] her face, [[H6440]] and bowed herself [[H7812]] to the ground, [[H776]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Why [[H4069]] have I found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thine eyes, [[H5869]] that thou shouldest take knowledge [[H5234]] of me, seeing I [[H595]] a stranger? [[H5237]]

### 11
And Boaz [[H1162]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto her, It hath fully [[H5046]] been shewed [[H5046]] me, all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast done [[H6213]] unto thy mother in law [[H2545]] since [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of thine husband: [[H376]] and thou hast left [[H5800]] thy father [[H1]] and thy mother, [[H517]] and the land [[H776]] of thy nativity, [[H4138]] and art come [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] a people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] thou knewest [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] heretofore. [[H8543]]

### 12
The Lord [[H3068]] recompense [[H7999]] thy work, [[H6467]] and a full [[H8003]] reward [[H4909]] be given [[H1961]] thee of [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] under [[H8478]] whose [[H834]] wings [[H3671]] thou art come [[H935]] to trust. [[H2620]]

### 13
Then she said, [[H559]] Let me find [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] my lord; [[H113]] for [[H3588]] that thou hast comforted [[H5162]] me, and for that [[H3588]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] friendly [[H3820]] unto thine handmaid, [[H8198]] though I [[H595]] be [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] like unto one [[H259]] of thine handmaidens. [[H8198]]

### 14
And Boaz [[H1162]] said [[H559]] unto her, At mealtime [[H6256]] come [[H5066]] thou hither, [[H1988]] and eat [[H398]] of [[H4480]] the bread, [[H3899]] and dip [[H2881]] thy morsel [[H6595]] in the vinegar. [[H2558]] And she sat [[H3427]] beside [[H6654]] the reapers: [[H7114]] and he reached [[H6642]] her parched [[H7039]] and she did eat, [[H398]] and was sufficed, [[H7646]] and left. [[H3498]]

### 15
And when she was risen up [[H6965]] to glean, [[H3950]] Boaz [[H1162]] commanded [[H6680]] his young men, [[H5288]] saying, [[H559]] Let her glean [[H3950]] even [[H1571]] among [[H996]] the sheaves, [[H6016]] and reproach [[H3637]] her not: [[H3808]]

### 16
And let fall [[H7997]] also [[H1571]] of [[H4480]] the handfuls [[H6653]] of purpose [[H7997]] for her, and leave [[H5800]] that she may glean [[H3950]] and rebuke [[H1605]] her not. [[H3808]]

### 17
So she gleaned [[H3950]] in the field [[H7704]] until [[H5704]] even, [[H6153]] and beat out [[H2251]] that [[H834]] she had gleaned: [[H3950]] and it was [[H1961]] about an ephah [[H374]] of barley. [[H8184]]

### 18
And she took up, [[H5375]] and went [[H935]] into the city: [[H5892]] and her mother in law [[H2545]] saw [[H7200]] what [[H834]] she had gleaned: [[H3950]] and she brought forth, [[H3318]] and gave [[H5414]]  to her [[H853]] that [[H834]] she had reserved [[H3498]] after she was sufficed. [[H7648]]

### 19
And her mother in law [[H2545]] said [[H559]] unto her, Where [[H375]] hast thou gleaned [[H3950]] to day? [[H3117]] and where [[H575]] wroughtest [[H6213]] thou? blessed [[H1288]] be [[H1961]] he that did take knowledge [[H5234]] of thee. And she shewed [[H5046]] her mother in law [[H2545]] with [[H5973]] whom [[H834]] she had wrought, [[H6213]] and said, [[H559]] The man's [[H376]] name [[H8034]] with [[H5973]] whom [[H834]] I wrought [[H6213]] to day [[H3117]] Boaz. [[H1162]]

### 20
And Naomi [[H5281]] said [[H559]] unto her daughter in law, [[H3618]] Blessed [[H1288]] he [[H1931]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] left off [[H5800]] his kindness [[H2617]] to [[H854]] the living [[H2416]] and to [[H854]] the dead. [[H4191]] And Naomi [[H5281]] said [[H559]] unto her, The man [[H376]] near of kin [[H7138]] unto us, one [[H1931]] of our next kinsmen. [[H1350]]

### 21
And Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess [[H4125]] said, [[H559]] He said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me also, [[H1571]] Thou shalt keep fast [[H1692]] by [[H5973]] my [[H834]] young men, [[H5288]] until [[H5704]] they have ended [[H3615]] all [[H3605]] my [[H834]] harvest. [[H7105]]

### 22
And Naomi [[H5281]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Ruth [[H7327]] her daughter in law, [[H3618]] good, [[H2896]] my daughter, [[H1323]] that [[H3588]] thou go out [[H3318]] with [[H5973]] his maidens, [[H5291]] that they meet [[H6293]] thee not [[H3808]] in any other [[H312]] field. [[H7704]]

### 23
So she kept fast [[H1692]] by the maidens [[H5291]] of Boaz [[H1162]] to glean [[H3950]] unto [[H5704]] the end [[H3615]] of barley [[H8184]] harvest [[H7105]] and of wheat [[H2406]] harvest; [[H7105]] and dwelt [[H3427]] with [[H854]] her mother in law. [[H2545]]
