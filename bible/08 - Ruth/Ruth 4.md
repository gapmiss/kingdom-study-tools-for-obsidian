### 1
Then went up [[H5927]] Boaz [[H1162]] to the gate, [[H8179]] and sat him down [[H3427]] there: [[H8033]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the kinsman [[H1350]] of whom Boaz [[H1162]] spake [[H1696]] came by; [[H5674]] unto whom [[H834]] he said, [[H559]] Ho, such [[H6423]] a one! [[H492]] turn aside, [[H5493]] sit down [[H3427]] here. [[H6311]] And he turned aside, [[H5493]] and sat down. [[H3427]]

### 2
And he took [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H582]] of the elders [[H2205]] of the city, [[H5892]] and said, [[H559]] Sit ye down [[H3427]] here. [[H6311]] And they sat down. [[H3427]]

### 3
And he said [[H559]] unto the kinsman, [[H1350]] Naomi, [[H5281]] that is come again [[H7725]] out of the country [[H7704]] of Moab, [[H4124]] selleth [[H4376]] a parcel [[H2513]] of land, [[H7704]] which [[H834]] our brother [[H251]] Elimelech's: [[H458]]

### 4
And I [[H589]] thought [[H559]] to advertise [[H1540]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Buy [[H7069]] before [[H5048]] the inhabitants, [[H3427]] and before [[H5048]] the elders [[H2205]] of my people. [[H5971]] If [[H518]] thou wilt redeem [[H1350]] redeem [[H1350]] but if [[H518]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] redeem [[H1350]] tell [[H5046]] me, that I may know: [[H3045]] for [[H3588]] none [[H369]] to redeem [[H1350]] beside [[H2108]] thee; and I [[H595]] after [[H310]] thee. And he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] will redeem [[H1350]]

### 5
Then said [[H559]] Boaz, [[H1162]] What day [[H3117]] thou buyest [[H7069]] the field [[H7704]] of the hand [[H3027]] of Naomi, [[H5281]] thou must buy [[H7069]] also of [[H854]] Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess, [[H4125]] the wife [[H802]] of the dead, [[H4191]] to raise up [[H6965]] the name [[H8034]] of the dead [[H4191]] upon [[H5921]] his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 6
And the kinsman [[H1350]] said, [[H559]] I cannot [[H3201]] redeem [[H1350]] for myself, lest [[H6435]] I mar [[H7843]] mine own inheritance: [[H5159]] redeem [[H1350]] thou [[H859]] my right [[H1353]] to thyself; for [[H3588]] I cannot [[H3201]] redeem [[H1350]]

### 7
Now this [[H2063]] in former time [[H6440]] in Israel [[H3478]] concerning [[H5921]] redeeming [[H1353]] and concerning [[H5921]] changing, [[H8545]] for to confirm [[H6965]] all [[H3605]] things; [[H1697]] a man [[H376]] plucked off [[H8025]] his shoe, [[H5275]] and gave [[H5414]] to his neighbour: [[H7453]] and this [[H2063]] a testimony [[H8584]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
Therefore the kinsman [[H1350]] said [[H559]] unto Boaz, [[H1162]] Buy [[H7069]] for thee. So he drew off [[H8025]] his shoe. [[H5275]]

### 9
And Boaz [[H1162]] said [[H559]] unto the elders, [[H2205]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] Ye [[H859]] witnesses [[H5707]] this day, [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] I have bought [[H7069]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Elimelech's, [[H458]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Chilion's [[H3630]] and Mahlon's, [[H4248]] of the hand [[H3027]] of Naomi. [[H5281]]

### 10
Moreover [[H1571]] Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess, [[H4125]] the wife [[H802]] of Mahlon, [[H4248]] have I purchased [[H7069]] to be my wife, [[H802]] to raise up [[H6965]] the name [[H8034]] of the dead [[H4191]] upon [[H5921]] his inheritance, [[H5159]] that the name [[H8034]] of the dead [[H4191]] be not [[H3808]] cut off [[H3772]] from among [[H5973]] his brethren, [[H251]] and from the gate [[H8179]] of his place: [[H4725]] ye [[H859]] witnesses [[H5707]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 11
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] in the gate, [[H8179]] and the elders, [[H2205]] said, [[H559]] witnesses. [[H5707]] The Lord [[H3068]] make [[H5414]] the woman [[H802]] that is come [[H935]] into [[H413]] thine house [[H1004]] like Rachel [[H7354]] and like Leah, [[H3812]] which [[H834]] two [[H8147]] did build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and do [[H6213]] thou worthily [[H2428]] in Ephratah, [[H672]] and be famous [[H7121]] in Bethlehem: [[H1035]]

### 12
And let thy house [[H1004]] be [[H1961]] like the house [[H1004]] of Pharez, [[H6557]] whom [[H834]] Tamar [[H8559]] bare [[H3205]] unto Judah, [[H3063]] of [[H4480]] the seed [[H2233]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall give [[H5414]] thee of [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] young woman. [[H5291]]

### 13
So Boaz [[H1162]] took [[H3947]] Ruth, [[H7327]] and she was [[H1961]] his wife: [[H802]] and when he went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her, the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] her conception, [[H2032]] and she bare [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 14
And the women [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Naomi, [[H5281]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] left [[H7673]] thee this day [[H3117]] without a kinsman, [[H1350]] that his name [[H8034]] may be famous [[H7121]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
And he shall be [[H1961]] unto thee a restorer [[H7725]] of life, [[H5315]] and a nourisher [[H3557]]  of [[H853]] thine old age: [[H7872]] for [[H3588]] thy daughter in law, [[H3618]] which [[H834]] loveth [[H157]] thee, which [[H834]] is better [[H2896]] to thee than seven [[H7651]] sons, [[H1121]] hath born [[H3205]] him. [[H3205]]

### 16
And Naomi [[H5281]] took [[H3947]] the child, [[H3206]] and laid [[H7896]] it in her bosom, [[H2436]] and became [[H1961]] nurse [[H539]] unto it. [[H539]]

### 17
And the women her neighbours [[H7934]] gave [[H7121]] it a name, [[H8034]] saying, [[H559]] There is a son [[H1121]] born [[H3205]] to Naomi; [[H5281]] and they called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Obed: [[H5744]] he [[H1931]] the father [[H1]] of Jesse, [[H3448]] the father [[H1]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 18
Now these [[H428]] the generations [[H8435]] of Pharez: [[H6557]] Pharez [[H6557]] begat [[H3205]] Hezron, [[H2696]]

### 19
And Hezron [[H2696]] begat [[H3205]] Ram, [[H7410]] and Ram [[H7410]] begat [[H3205]] Amminadab, [[H5992]]

### 20
And Amminadab [[H5992]] begat [[H3205]] Nahshon, [[H5177]] and Nahshon [[H5177]] begat [[H3205]] Salmon, [[H8009]]

### 21
And Salmon [[H8012]] begat [[H3205]] Boaz, [[H1162]] and Boaz [[H1162]] begat [[H3205]] Obed, [[H5744]]

### 22
And Obed [[H5744]] begat [[H3205]] Jesse, [[H3448]] and Jesse [[H3448]] begat [[H3205]] David. [[H1732]]
