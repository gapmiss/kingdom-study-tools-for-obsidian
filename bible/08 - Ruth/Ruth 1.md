### 1
Now it came to pass [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] when the judges [[H8199]] ruled, [[H8199]] that there was [[H1961]] a famine [[H7458]] in the land. [[H776]] And a certain man [[H376]] of Bethlehem-judah [[H1035]] went [[H1980]] to sojourn [[H1481]] in the country [[H7704]] of Moab, [[H4124]] he, [[H1931]] and his wife, [[H802]] and his two [[H8147]] sons. [[H1121]]

### 2
And the name [[H8034]] of the man [[H376]] Elimelech, [[H458]] and the name [[H8034]] of his wife [[H802]] Naomi, [[H5281]] and the name [[H8034]] of his two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] Mahlon [[H4248]] and Chilion, [[H3630]] Ephrathites [[H673]] of Bethlehem-judah. [[H1035]] And they came [[H935]] into the country [[H7704]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and continued [[H1961]] there. [[H8033]]

### 3
And Elimelech [[H458]] Naomi's [[H5281]] husband [[H376]] died; [[H4191]] and she [[H1931]] was left, [[H7604]] and her two [[H8147]] sons. [[H1121]]

### 4
And they took [[H5375]] them wives [[H802]] of the women of Moab; [[H4125]] the name [[H8034]] of the one [[H259]] Orpah, [[H6204]] and the name [[H8034]] of the other [[H8145]] Ruth: [[H7327]] and they dwelled [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] about ten [[H6235]] years. [[H8141]]

### 5
And Mahlon [[H4248]] and Chilion [[H3630]] died [[H4191]] also [[H1571]] both [[H8147]] of them; and the woman [[H802]] was left [[H7604]] of her two [[H8147]] sons [[H3206]] and her husband. [[H376]]

### 6
Then she [[H1931]] arose [[H6965]] with her daughters in law, [[H3618]] that she might return [[H7725]] from the country [[H7704]] of Moab: [[H4124]] for [[H3588]] she had heard [[H8085]] in the country [[H7704]] of Moab [[H4124]] how that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had visited [[H6485]] his people [[H5971]] in giving [[H5414]] them bread. [[H3899]]

### 7
Wherefore she went forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] she was, [[H1961]] and her two [[H8147]] daughters in law [[H3618]] with her; [[H5973]] and they went [[H1980]] on the way [[H1870]] to return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 8
And Naomi [[H5281]] said [[H559]] unto her two [[H8147]] daughters in law, [[H3618]] Go, [[H1980]] return [[H7725]] each [[H802]] to her mother's [[H517]] house: [[H1004]] the Lord [[H3068]] deal [[H6213]] kindly [[H2617]] with [[H5973]] you, as [[H834]] ye have dealt [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] the dead, [[H4191]] and with [[H5973]] me. [[H5973]]

### 9
The Lord [[H3068]] grant [[H5414]] you that ye may find [[H4672]] rest, [[H4496]] each [[H802]] in the house [[H1004]] of her husband. [[H376]] Then she kissed [[H5401]] them; and they lifted up [[H5375]] their voice, [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 10
And they said [[H559]] unto her, Surely [[H3588]] we will return [[H7725]] with [[H854]] thee unto thy people. [[H5971]]

### 11
And Naomi [[H5281]] said, [[H559]] Turn again, [[H7725]] my daughters: [[H1323]] why [[H4100]] will ye go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] me? there yet [[H5750]] sons [[H1121]] in my womb, [[H4578]] that they may be [[H1961]] your husbands? [[H376]]

### 12
Turn again, [[H7725]] my daughters, [[H1323]] go [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] I am too old [[H2204]] to have [[H1961]] an husband. [[H376]] If [[H3588]] I should say, [[H559]] I have [[H3426]] hope, [[H8615]] I should have [[H1961]] an husband [[H376]] also [[H1571]] to night, [[H3915]] and should also [[H1571]] bear [[H3205]] sons; [[H1121]]

### 13
Would ye tarry [[H7663]] for them [[H3860]] till [[H5704]] they were grown? [[H1431]] would ye stay [[H5702]] for them [[H3860]] from having [[H1961]] husbands? [[H376]] nay, [[H408]] my daughters; [[H1323]] for [[H3588]] it grieveth [[H4843]] me much [[H3966]] for [[H4480]] your sakes that [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is gone out [[H3318]] against me. [[H3318]]

### 14
And they lifted up [[H5375]] their voice, [[H6963]] and wept again: [[H1058]] and Orpah [[H6204]] kissed [[H5401]] her mother in law; [[H2545]] but Ruth [[H7327]] clave [[H1692]] unto her. [[H1692]]

### 15
And she said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] thy sister in law [[H2994]] is gone back [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] her people, [[H5971]] and unto [[H413]] her gods: [[H430]] return [[H7725]] thou after [[H310]] thy sister in law. [[H2994]]

### 16
And Ruth [[H7327]] said, [[H559]] Intreat [[H6293]] me not [[H408]] to leave [[H5800]] thee, to return [[H7725]] from following after [[H310]] thee: for [[H3588]] whither [[H413]] thou goest, [[H1980]] I will go; [[H1980]] and where [[H834]] thou lodgest, [[H3885]] I will lodge: [[H3885]] thy people [[H5971]] my people, [[H5971]] and thy God [[H430]] my God: [[H430]]

### 17
Where [[H834]] thou diest, [[H4191]] will I die, [[H4191]] and there [[H8033]] will I be buried: [[H6912]] the Lord [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] so [[H3541]] to me, and more [[H3254]] also, [[H3541]] but [[H3588]] death [[H4194]] part [[H6504]] thee [[H996]] and me. [[H996]]

### 18
When she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] was stedfastly minded [[H553]] to go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] her, then she left [[H2308]] speaking [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] her. [[H413]]

### 19
So they two [[H8147]] went [[H1980]] until [[H5704]] they came [[H935]] to Bethlehem. [[H1035]] And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they were come [[H935]] to Bethlehem, [[H1035]] that all [[H3605]] the city [[H5892]] was moved [[H1949]] about [[H5921]] them, and they said, [[H559]] this [[H2063]] Naomi? [[H5281]]

### 20
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Call [[H7121]] me not [[H408]] Naomi, [[H5281]] call [[H7121]] me Mara: [[H4755]] for [[H3588]] the Almighty [[H7706]] hath dealt very [[H3966]] bitterly [[H4843]] with me. [[H4843]]

### 21
I [[H589]] went out [[H1980]] full, [[H4392]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath brought me home again [[H7725]] empty: [[H7387]] why [[H4100]] call [[H7121]] ye me Naomi, [[H5281]] seeing the Lord [[H3068]] hath testified [[H6030]] against me, and the Almighty [[H7706]] hath afflicted [[H7489]] me? [[H7489]]

### 22
So Naomi [[H5281]] returned, [[H7725]] and Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess, [[H4125]] her daughter in law, [[H3618]] with her, [[H5973]] which returned [[H7725]] out of the country [[H7704]] of Moab: [[H4124]] and they [[H1992]] came [[H935]] to Bethlehem [[H1035]] in the beginning [[H8462]] of barley [[H8184]] harvest.
