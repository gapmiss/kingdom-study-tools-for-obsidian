### 1
This [[G3778]] second [[G1208]] epistle, [[G1992]] beloved, [[G27]] now [[G2235]] I [[G1125]] write [[G1125]] unto you; [[G5213]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] I stir up [[G1326]] your [[G5216]] pure [[G1506]] minds [[G1271]] by way of [[G1722]] remembrance: [[G5280]]

### 2
ye may be mindful [[G3415]] That [[G1785]] of the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] which were spoken before [[G4280]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1785]] commandment [[G1785]] of us [[G2257]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Saviour: [[G4990]]

### 3
Knowing [[G1097]] this [[G5124]] first, [[G4412]] that [[G3754]] there shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] days [[G2250]] scoffers, [[G1703]] walking [[G4198]] after [[G2596]] their [[G846]] own [[G2398]] lusts, [[G1939]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Where [[G4226]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of [[G3952]] his [[G846]] coming? [[G3952]] for [[G1063]] since [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fathers [[G3962]] fell asleep, [[G2837]] all things [[G3956]] continue [[G1265]] as [[G3779]] from [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] of the creation. [[G2937]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] they [[G846]] willingly [[G2309]] are ignorant of, [[G2990]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] by [[G3056]] word [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] were [[G2258]] of old, [[G1597]] and [[G2532]] the earth [[G1093]] standing [[G4921]] out of [[G1537]] the water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1223]] the water: [[G5204]]

### 6
Whereby [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] that then was, [[G5119]] being with [[G5204]] overflowed [[G2626]] water, [[G5204]] perished: [[G622]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] which are now, [[G3568]] the [[G3588]] by [[G846]] same [[G846]] word [[G3056]] are [[G1526]] kept in store, [[G2343]] reserved [[G5083]] unto fire [[G4442]] against [[G1519]] the day [[G2250]] of judgment [[G2920]] and [[G2532]] perdition [[G684]] ungodly [[G765]] of [[G444]] men. [[G444]]

### 8
But, [[G1161]] beloved, [[G27]] not [[G3361]] be of [[G2990]] ignorant [[G2990]] this [[G5124]] one thing, [[G1520]] that [[G3754]] one [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] with [[G3844]] the Lord [[G2962]] as [[G5613]] a thousand [[G5507]] years, [[G2094]] and [[G2532]] a thousand [[G5507]] years [[G2094]] as [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] day. [[G2250]]

### 9
The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1019]] slack [[G1019]]  concerning his [[G3588]] promise, [[G1860]] as [[G5613]] some men [[G5100]] count [[G2233]] slackness; [[G1022]] but [[G235]] is longsuffering [[G3114]] to [[G1519]] us-ward, [[G2248]] not [[G3361]] willing that [[G1014]] any [[G5100]] should perish, [[G622]] but that [[G235]] all [[G3956]] should come [[G5562]] to [[G1519]] repentance. [[G3341]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of the Lord [[G2962]] will come [[G2240]] as [[G5613]] a thief [[G2812]] in [[G1722]] the night; [[G3571]] in [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] shall pass away [[G3928]] with a great noise, [[G4500]] and [[G1161]] the elements [[G4747]] shall melt [[G3089]] with fervent heat, [[G2741]] the earth [[G1093]] also [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] that are therein [[G1722]] shall be burned up. [[G2618]]

### 11
then [[G3767]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5130]] shall be dissolved, [[G3089]] what manner [[G4217]] ought [[G1163]] ye [[G5209]] to be [[G5225]] in [[G1722]] holy [[G40]] conversation [[G391]] and [[G2532]] godliness, [[G2150]]

### 12
Looking for [[G4328]] and [[G2532]] hasting unto [[G4692]] the [[G3588]] coming of [[G3952]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] wherein [[G1223]] the heavens [[G3772]] being on fire [[G4448]] shall be dissolved, [[G3089]] and [[G2532]] the elements [[G4747]] shall melt [[G5080]] with fervent heat? [[G2741]]

### 13
Nevertheless [[G1161]] according to [[G2596]] we, for [[G4328]] his [[G846]] promise, [[G1862]] look [[G4328]] new [[G2537]] heavens [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] a new [[G2537]] earth, [[G1093]] wherein [[G1722]] dwelleth [[G2730]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 14
Wherefore, [[G1352]] beloved, [[G27]] seeing that ye look for [[G4328]] such things, [[G5023]] be diligent that [[G4704]] ye may be found [[G2147]] of him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] peace, [[G1515]] without spot, [[G784]] and [[G2532]] blameless. [[G298]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] account [[G2233]] the [[G3588]] longsuffering [[G3115]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] salvation; [[G4991]] even as [[G2531]] our [[G2257]] beloved [[G27]] brother [[G80]] Paul [[G3972]] also [[G2532]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] given [[G1325]] unto him [[G846]] hath written [[G1125]] unto you; [[G5213]]

### 16
As [[G5613]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] epistles, [[G1992]] speaking [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] them [[G846]] of [[G4012]] these things; [[G5130]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] are [[G2076]] some things [[G5100]] hard to be understood, [[G1425]] which [[G3739]] they that are unlearned [[G261]] and [[G2532]] unstable [[G793]] wrest, [[G4761]] as [[G5613]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] scriptures, [[G1124]] unto [[G4314]] their [[G846]] own [[G2398]] destruction. [[G684]]

### 17
Ye [[G5210]] therefore, [[G3767]] beloved, [[G27]] seeing ye know before, [[G4267]] beware [[G5442]] lest [[G3361]] with [[G3588]] being led away [[G4879]] ye also, from [[G1601]] the [[G3588]] error [[G4106]] the [[G3588]] of [[G113]] wicked, [[G113]] fall [[G1601]] your own [[G2398]] stedfastness. [[G4740]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] grow [[G837]] in [[G1722]] grace, [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] the knowledge [[G1108]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Saviour [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] To him [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] both [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
