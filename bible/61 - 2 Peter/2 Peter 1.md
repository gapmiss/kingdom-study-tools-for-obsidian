### 1
Simon [[G4826]] Peter, [[G4074]] a servant [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] an apostle [[G652]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] them [[G3588]] to [[G2975]] that have with [[G2254]] obtained [[G2975]] like precious [[G2472]] faith [[G4102]] us [[G2254]] through [[G1722]] the righteousness [[G1343]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Saviour [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 2
Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] be multiplied [[G4129]] unto you [[G5213]] through [[G1722]] the knowledge [[G1922]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G2257]] Lord, [[G2962]]

### 3
According as [[G5613]] his [[G846]] divine [[G2304]] power [[G1411]] hath given [[G1433]] unto us [[G2254]] all things [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] unto [[G4314]] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] godliness, [[G2150]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] knowledge of him that hath [[G1922]] called [[G2564]] us [[G2248]] to [[G1223]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] virtue: [[G703]]

### 4
Whereby [[G1223]]  are [[G3739]] given [[G1433]] unto us [[G2254]] exceeding great [[G3176]] and [[G2532]] precious [[G5093]] promises: [[G1862]] that [[G2443]] by [[G1223]] these [[G5130]] ye might be [[G1096]] partakers [[G2844]] divine [[G2304]] of the [[G5449]] nature, [[G5449]] having escaped [[G668]] the [[G3588]] corruption [[G5356]] that is in [[G1722]] the world [[G2889]] through [[G1722]] lust. [[G1939]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] beside [[G1161]] this, [[G5124]] giving [[G3923]] all [[G3956]] diligence, [[G4710]] add [[G2023]] to [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] virtue; [[G703]] and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] virtue [[G703]] knowledge; [[G1108]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] knowledge [[G1108]] temperance; [[G1466]] and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] temperance [[G1466]] patience; [[G5281]] and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] patience [[G5281]] godliness; [[G2150]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] to [[G1722]] godliness [[G2150]]  brotherly [[G3588]] kindness; [[G5360]] and [[G1161]] to [[G1722]]  brotherly [[G3588]] kindness [[G5360]] charity. [[G26]]

### 8
For if [[G1063]] these things [[G5023]] be [[G5225]] in you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] abound, [[G4121]] they make [[G2525]] neither [[G3756]] barren [[G692]] nor [[G3761]] unfruitful [[G175]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1922]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 9
But [[G1063]] he that [[G3739]] lacketh [[G3918]] these things [[G5023]] is [[G2076]] blind, [[G5185]] and cannot see afar off, [[G3467]] and hath [[G2983]] forgotten [[G3024]]  that [[G3588]] he was purged [[G2512]] from [[G266]] his [[G846]] old [[G3819]] sins. [[G266]]

### 10
Wherefore [[G1352]] the rather, [[G3123]] brethren, [[G80]] give diligence [[G4704]] to make [[G4160]] your [[G5216]] calling [[G2821]] and [[G2532]] election [[G1589]] sure: [[G949]] for [[G1063]] if ye do [[G4160]] these things, [[G5023]] never [[G3756]] ye shall [[G4417]] fall: [[G4417]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] so [[G3779]]  an [[G3588]] entrance [[G1529]] shall be ministered [[G2023]] unto [[G5213]] you [[G5213]] abundantly [[G4146]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] everlasting [[G166]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2257]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Saviour [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 12
Wherefore [[G1352]] not [[G3756]] I will be [[G272]] negligent [[G272]] to put in remembrance [[G5279]] you [[G5209]] always [[G104]] of [[G4012]] these things, [[G5130]] though [[G2539]] ye know [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] be established [[G4741]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] present [[G3918]] truth. [[G225]]

### 13
Yea, [[G1161]] I think it [[G2233]] meet, [[G1342]] as [[G1909]] long as [[G3745]] I am [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] tabernacle, [[G4638]] to stir up [[G1326]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] by putting [[G5280]] remembrance; [[G5280]]

### 14
Knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] shortly [[G5031]]  I must put [[G3588]] off [[G595]] my [[G3450]] tabernacle, [[G4638]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] hath shewed [[G1213]] me. [[G3427]]

### 15
Moreover [[G1161]] I will endeavour that [[G4704]] ye [[G5209]] after [[G3326]] may be able [[G4160]] my [[G1699]] decease [[G1841]] to have [[G2192]] these [[G3588]] things [[G5130]] always [[G1539]] in remembrance. [[G3420]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] we have [[G1811]] followed [[G1811]] cunningly devised [[G4679]] fables, [[G3454]] when we made known [[G1107]] unto you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] coming [[G3952]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] but [[G235]] were [[G1096]] eyewitnesses [[G2030]] of [[G3168]] his [[G1565]] majesty. [[G3168]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] he received [[G2983]] from [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] the Father [[G3962]] honour [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory, [[G1391]] when there came [[G5342]] such [[G5107]] a voice [[G5456]] to him [[G846]] from [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] excellent [[G3169]] glory, [[G1391]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] Son, [[G5207]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am well pleased. [[G2106]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] voice [[G5456]] which came [[G5342]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] we [[G2249]] heard, [[G191]] when we were [[G5607]] with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] mount. [[G3735]]

### 19
We have [[G2192]] also [[G2532]] more sure [[G949]] a [[G3056]] word [[G3056]] of prophecy; [[G4397]] whereunto [[G3739]] ye do [[G4160]] well [[G2573]] that ye take heed, [[G4337]] as unto [[G5613]] a light [[G3088]] that shineth [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] dark [[G850]] a [[G5117]] place, [[G5117]] until [[G2193]] the day [[G2250]] dawn, [[G1306]] and [[G2532]] the day star [[G5459]] arise [[G393]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] hearts: [[G2588]]

### 20
Knowing [[G1097]] this [[G5124]] first, [[G4412]] that [[G3754]] no [[G3756]] prophecy [[G4394]] of the scripture [[G1124]] is [[G1096]] any [[G3956]] of [[G1955]] private [[G2398]] interpretation. [[G1955]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] the prophecy [[G4394]] came [[G5342]] not [[G3756]] in old time [[G4218]] by the will [[G2307]] of man: [[G444]] but [[G235]] holy [[G40]] men [[G444]] of [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] spake [[G2980]] moved [[G5342]] by the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]
