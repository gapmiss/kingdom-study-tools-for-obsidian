### 1
But [[G1161]] there were [[G1096]] false prophets [[G5578]] also [[G2532]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] there shall be [[G2071]] false teachers [[G5572]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] who [[G3748]] privily shall bring in [[G3919]] damnable [[G684]] heresies, [[G139]] even [[G2532]] denying [[G720]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G1203]] that bought [[G59]] them, [[G846]] and bring upon [[G1863]] themselves [[G1438]] swift [[G5031]] destruction. [[G684]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] shall follow [[G1811]] their [[G846]]  pernicious [[G3588]] ways; [[G684]] by reason of [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of [[G225]] truth [[G225]] shall be evil spoken of. [[G987]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] through [[G1722]] covetousness [[G4124]] with feigned [[G4112]] shall they merchandise of [[G1710]] words [[G3056]] make [[G1710]] you: [[G5209]] whose [[G3739]] judgment [[G2917]] of a long time [[G1597]] now [[G691]] lingereth [[G691]] not, [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] damnation [[G684]] slumbereth [[G3573]] not. [[G3756]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] spared [[G5339]] not [[G3756]] the angels [[G32]] that sinned, [[G264]] but [[G235]] cast down to hell, [[G5020]] and delivered [[G3860]] into chains [[G4577]] of darkness, [[G2217]] to be reserved [[G5083]] unto [[G1519]] judgment; [[G2920]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] spared [[G5339]] not [[G3756]] old [[G744]] the [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] saved [[G5442]] Noah [[G3575]] the eighth [[G3590]] a preacher [[G2783]] of righteousness, [[G1343]] bringing in [[G1863]] the flood [[G2627]] upon the world [[G2889]] of the ungodly; [[G765]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] the cities [[G4172]] turning into [[G5077]] of Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] Gomorrha [[G1116]] ashes [[G5077]] condemned [[G2632]] with an overthrow, [[G2692]] making [[G5087]] an ensample [[G5262]] unto those that after should [[G3195]] live ungodly; [[G764]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] delivered [[G4506]] just [[G1342]] Lot, [[G3091]] vexed [[G2669]] with [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] filthy [[G766]] conversation [[G391]]  of [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wicked: [[G113]]

### 8
(For [[G1063]] that righteous man [[G1342]] dwelling [[G1460]] among [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] in seeing [[G990]] and [[G2532]] hearing, [[G189]] vexed [[G928]] righteous [[G1342]] soul [[G5590]] from to [[G1537]] day [[G2250]] day [[G2250]] unlawful [[G459]] with [[G2041]] deeds;) [[G2041]]

### 9
The Lord [[G2962]] knoweth how [[G1492]] to deliver [[G4506]] the godly [[G2152]] out of [[G1537]] temptations, [[G3986]] and [[G1161]] to to be [[G2849]] reserve [[G5083]] the unjust [[G94]] unto [[G1519]] the day [[G2250]] of judgment [[G2920]] punished: [[G2849]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] chiefly [[G3122]] them that walk [[G4198]] after [[G3694]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] in [[G1722]] the lust [[G1939]] of uncleanness, [[G3394]] and [[G2532]] despise [[G2706]] government. [[G2963]] Presumptuous [[G5113]] selfwilled, [[G829]] not [[G3756]] they are [[G5141]] afraid [[G5141]] to speak evil of [[G987]] dignities. [[G1391]]

### 11
Whereas [[G3699]] angels, [[G32]] which are [[G5607]] greater [[G3173]] in power [[G2479]] and [[G2532]] might, [[G1411]] bring [[G5342]] not [[G3756]] railing [[G989]] accusation [[G2920]] against [[G2596]] them [[G846]] before [[G3844]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] these, [[G3778]] as [[G5613]] natural [[G5446]] brute [[G249]] beasts, [[G2226]] made [[G1080]] to [[G1519]] be taken [[G259]] and [[G2532]] destroyed, [[G5356]] speak evil [[G987]] of [[G1722]] the things that [[G3739]] they understand not; [[G50]] and shall utterly perish [[G2704]] in [[G1722]] their own [[G846]] corruption; [[G5356]]

### 13
And shall receive [[G2865]] the reward [[G3408]] of unrighteousness, [[G93]] they that count it [[G2233]] pleasure [[G2237]] to riot [[G5172]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day time. [[G2250]] Spots [[G4696]] and [[G2532]] blemishes, [[G3470]] sporting themselves [[G1792]] with [[G1722]] their own [[G846]] deceivings while they with [[G539]] feast [[G4910]] you; [[G5213]]

### 14
Having [[G2192]] eyes [[G3788]] full [[G3324]] of adultery, [[G3428]] and [[G2532]] that cannot cease [[G180]] from sin; [[G266]] beguiling [[G1185]] unstable [[G793]] souls: [[G5590]] an heart [[G2588]] they have [[G2192]] exercised [[G1128]] with covetous practices; [[G4124]] cursed [[G2671]] children: [[G5043]]

### 15
Which have forsaken [[G2641]] the [[G3588]] right [[G2117]] way, [[G3598]] and are gone astray, [[G4105]] following [[G1811]] the [[G3588]] way of [[G3598]] Balaam [[G903]] of Bosor, [[G1007]] who [[G3739]] loved [[G25]] the wages [[G3408]] of unrighteousness; [[G93]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] was [[G2192]] rebuked [[G1649]] his [[G2398]] for [[G3892]] iniquity: [[G3892]] the [[G5268]] dumb [[G880]] ass [[G5268]] speaking [[G5350]] with [[G1722]] man's [[G444]] voice [[G5456]] forbad [[G2967]] the [[G3588]] madness [[G3913]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophet. [[G4396]]

### 17
These [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] wells [[G4077]] without water, [[G504]] clouds [[G3507]] that are carried [[G1643]] with [[G5259]] a tempest; [[G2978]] to whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] mist [[G2217]] of [[G4655]] darkness [[G4655]] is reserved [[G5083]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] when they speak [[G5350]] great swelling [[G5246]] of vanity, [[G3153]] they allure [[G1185]] through [[G1722]] the lusts [[G1939]] of the flesh, [[G4561]] wantonness, [[G766]] those that were clean [[G3689]] escaped [[G668]] from them who [[G4106]] live [[G390]] in [[G1722]] error. [[G4106]]

### 19
While they promise [[G1861]] them [[G846]] liberty, [[G1657]] they themselves [[G846]] are [[G5225]] the servants [[G1401]] of [[G5356]] corruption: [[G5356]] for [[G1063]] of whom [[G3739]] a man [[G5100]] is overcome, [[G2274]] of the same [[G5129]] is he brought in bondage. [[G1402]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] after they have escaped [[G668]] the [[G3588]] pollutions [[G3393]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world [[G2889]] through [[G1722]] the knowledge [[G1922]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Saviour [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] again [[G3825]] they are [[G1707]] entangled [[G1707]] therein, [[G5125]] and overcome, [[G2274]] the [[G3588]] latter end [[G2078]] is [[G1096]] worse [[G5501]] with them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] than [[G4413]] beginning. [[G4413]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] it had been [[G2258]] better [[G2909]] for them [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to have known [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of [[G1343]] righteousness, [[G1343]] than, [[G2228]] after they have known [[G1921]] to turn [[G1994]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] commandment [[G1785]] delivered [[G3860]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] it is happened [[G4819]] unto them [[G846]]  according [[G3588]] to [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] true [[G227]] proverb, [[G3942]] The dog [[G2965]] turned again; [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] his own [[G2398]] vomit [[G1829]] and [[G2532]] the sow [[G5300]] that was washed [[G3068]] to [[G1519]] her wallowing [[G2946]] in the mire.
