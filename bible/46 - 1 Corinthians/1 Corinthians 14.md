### 1
Follow after [[G1377]] charity, [[G26]] and [[G1161]] desire [[G2206]] spiritual [[G4152]] but [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] that [[G2443]] ye may prophesy. [[G4395]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] he that [[G3588]] speaketh [[G2980]] in an tongue [[G1100]] speaketh [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] unto men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] unto [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] no [[G3762]] man understandeth [[G191]] howbeit [[G1161]] in the spirit [[G4151]] he speaketh [[G2980]] mysteries. [[G3466]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] prophesieth [[G4395]] speaketh [[G2980]] unto men [[G444]] edification, [[G3619]] and [[G2532]] exhortation, [[G3874]] and [[G2532]] comfort. [[G3889]]

### 4
He that [[G3588]] speaketh [[G2980]] in an tongue [[G1100]] edifieth [[G3618]] himself; [[G1438]] but [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] prophesieth [[G4395]] edifieth [[G3618]] the church. [[G1577]]

### 5
I would [[G2309]] that ye [[G5209]] all [[G3956]] spake [[G2980]] with tongues, [[G1100]] but [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] that [[G2443]] ye prophesied: [[G4395]] for [[G1063]] greater [[G3187]] he that [[G3588]] prophesieth [[G4395]] than [[G2228]] he that [[G3588]] speaketh [[G2980]] with tongues, [[G1100]] except [[G1622]] he interpret, [[G1329]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] may receive [[G2983]] edifying. [[G3619]]

### 6
Now, [[G3570]] brethren, [[G80]] if [[G1437]] I come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] speaking [[G2980]] with tongues, [[G1100]] what [[G5101]] shall I profit [[G5623]] you, [[G5209]] except [[G1437]] I shall speak [[G2980]] to you [[G5213]] either [[G2228]] by [[G1722]] revelation, [[G602]] or [[G2228]] by [[G1722]] knowledge, [[G1108]] or [[G2228]] by [[G1722]] prophesying, [[G4394]] or [[G2228]] by [[G1722]] doctrine? [[G1322]]

### 7
And even [[G3676]] things [[G3588]] without life [[G895]] giving [[G1325]] sound, [[G5456]] whether [[G1535]] pipe [[G836]] or [[G1535]] harp, [[G2788]] except [[G1437]] they give [[G1325]] a [[G3361]] distinction [[G1293]] the [[G3588]] in [[G5353]] sounds, [[G5353]] how [[G4459]] shall it be known [[G1097]] what [[G3588]] is piped [[G832]] or [[G2228]] harped? [[G2789]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] the trumpet [[G4536]] give [[G1325]] an uncertain [[G82]] sound, [[G5456]] who [[G5101]] shall prepare himself [[G3903]] to [[G1519]] the battle? [[G4171]]

### 9
So [[G3779]] likewise [[G2532]] ye, [[G5210]] except [[G1437]] ye utter [[G1325]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] tongue [[G1100]] words [[G3056]] easy understood, [[G2154]] to be [[G2071]] how [[G4459]] shall it be known [[G1097]] what [[G3588]] is spoken? [[G2980]] for [[G1063]] ye shall speak [[G2980]] into [[G1519]] the air. [[G109]]

### 10
There are, [[G2076]] it may [[G1487]] be, [[G5177]] so many [[G5118]] kinds [[G1085]] of voices [[G5456]] in [[G1722]] the world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] none [[G3762]] of them [[G846]] without signification. [[G880]]

### 11
Therefore [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] I know [[G1492]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] meaning [[G1411]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5456]] voice, [[G5456]] I shall be [[G2071]] him [[G3588]] unto that [[G2980]] speaketh [[G2980]] a barbarian, [[G915]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that speaketh [[G2980]] a barbarian [[G915]] unto [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]

### 12
Even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] ye, [[G5210]] forasmuch as [[G1893]] ye are [[G2075]] zealous [[G2207]] of spiritual [[G4151]] seek [[G2212]] that [[G2443]] ye may excel [[G4052]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] edifying [[G3619]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] church. [[G1577]]

### 13
Wherefore [[G1355]] let him [[G3588]] that speaketh [[G2980]] in an tongue [[G1100]] pray [[G4336]] that [[G2443]] he may interpret. [[G1329]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] I pray [[G4336]] in an tongue, [[G1100]] my [[G3450]] spirit [[G4151]] prayeth, [[G4336]] but [[G1161]] my [[G3450]] understanding [[G3563]] is [[G2076]] unfruitful. [[G175]]

### 15
What [[G5101]] is it [[G2076]] then? [[G3767]] I will pray [[G4336]] the [[G3588]] with [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G1161]] I will pray [[G4336]] the [[G3588]] with [[G3563]] understanding [[G3563]] also: [[G2532]] I will sing [[G5567]] the [[G3588]] with [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G1161]] I will sing [[G5567]] with the [[G3588]] understanding [[G3563]] also. [[G2532]]

### 16
Else [[G1893]] when [[G1437]] thou shalt bless [[G2127]] the [[G3588]] with [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] how [[G4459]] he that [[G3588]] shall [[G378]] occupieth [[G378]] the [[G3588]] room [[G5117]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2399]] unlearned [[G2399]] say [[G2046]] Amen [[G281]] at [[G1909]] thy [[G4674]] giving of thanks, [[G2169]] seeing [[G1894]] he understandeth [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] thou sayest? [[G3004]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] thou [[G4771]] verily [[G3303]] givest thanks [[G2168]] well, [[G2573]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] not [[G3756]] is [[G3618]] edified. [[G3618]]

### 18
I thank [[G2168]] my [[G3450]] God, [[G2316]] I speak [[G2980]] with tongues [[G1100]] more than [[G3123]] ye [[G5216]] all: [[G3956]]

### 19
Yet [[G235]] in [[G1722]] the church [[G1577]] I had rather [[G2309]] speak [[G2980]] five [[G4002]] words [[G3056]] with [[G1223]] my [[G3450]] understanding, [[G3563]] that [[G2443]] I might teach [[G2727]] others [[G243]] also, [[G2532]] than [[G2228]] ten thousand [[G3463]] words [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] an tongue. [[G1100]]

### 20
Brethren, [[G80]] be [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] children [[G3813]]  in [[G3588]] understanding: [[G5424]] howbeit [[G235]]  in [[G3588]] malice [[G2549]] be ye children, [[G3515]] but [[G1161]] in understanding [[G5424]] be [[G1096]] men. [[G5046]]

### 21
In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] it is written, [[G1125]] With [[G1722]] other tongues [[G2084]] and [[G2532]] other [[G2087]] lips [[G5491]] will I speak [[G2980]] unto this [[G5129]] people; [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] yet for all that [[G3779]] not [[G3761]] will they [[G1522]] hear [[G1522]] me, [[G3450]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 22
Wherefore [[G5620]] tongues [[G1100]] are [[G1526]] for [[G1519]] a sign, [[G4592]] not [[G3756]] them [[G3588]] to that [[G4100]] believe, [[G4100]] but [[G235]] them [[G3588]] to that believe [[G571]] not: [[G571]] but [[G1161]] prophesying [[G4394]] not [[G3756]] for them [[G3588]] that believe not, [[G571]] but [[G235]] for them [[G3588]] which believe. [[G4100]]

### 23
If [[G1437]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] church be come [[G1577]] together [[G4905]] into [[G1909]] one place, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] speak [[G2980]] with tongues, [[G1100]] and [[G1161]] there come in [[G1525]] unlearned, [[G2399]] or [[G2228]] unbelievers, [[G571]] not [[G3756]] will they [[G2046]] say [[G2046]] that [[G3754]] ye are mad? [[G3105]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] all [[G3956]] prophesy, [[G4395]] and [[G1161]] there come in [[G1525]] one [[G5100]] that believeth not, [[G571]] or [[G2228]] unlearned, [[G2399]] he is convinced [[G1651]] of [[G5259]] all, [[G3956]] he is judged [[G350]] of [[G5259]] all: [[G3956]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] thus [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] are [[G1096]] secrets [[G2927]] of his [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] made [[G1096]] manifest; [[G5318]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] falling down [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] face [[G4383]] he will worship [[G4352]] God, [[G2316]] and report [[G518]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] of a truth. [[G3689]]

### 26
How [[G5101]] is it [[G2076]] then, [[G3767]] brethren? [[G80]] when [[G3752]] ye come together, [[G4905]] every one [[G1538]] of you [[G5216]] hath [[G2192]] a psalm, [[G5568]] hath [[G2192]] a doctrine, [[G1322]] hath [[G2192]] a tongue, [[G1100]] hath [[G2192]] a revelation, [[G602]] hath [[G2192]] an interpretation. [[G2058]] all things [[G3956]] Let be [[G1096]] done [[G1096]] unto [[G4314]] edifying. [[G3619]]

### 27
If [[G1535]] any man [[G5100]] speak [[G2980]] in [[G2596]] an tongue, [[G1100]] by [[G303]] two, [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] at [[G4118]] most [[G4118]] three, [[G5140]] and [[G2532]] by course; [[G3313]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] let [[G1329]] interpret. [[G1329]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] there be [[G5600]] no [[G3361]] interpreter, [[G1328]] let him keep silence [[G4601]] in [[G1722]] the church; [[G1577]] and [[G1161]] let him speak [[G2980]] to himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] to [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 29
Let [[G1161]] the prophets [[G4396]] speak [[G2980]] two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three, [[G5140]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] let [[G1252]] other [[G243]] judge. [[G1252]]

### 30
If [[G1437]] be revealed [[G601]] to another [[G243]] that sitteth by, [[G2521]] the [[G3588]] let hold his [[G4601]] first [[G4413]] peace. [[G4601]]

### 31
For [[G1063]] ye may [[G1410]] all [[G3956]] prophesy [[G4395]] one one, [[G1520]] by [[G2596]] that [[G2443]] all [[G3956]] may learn, [[G3129]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] may be comforted. [[G3870]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] the spirits [[G4151]] of the prophets [[G4396]] are subject [[G5293]] to the prophets. [[G4396]]

### 33
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of confusion, [[G181]] but [[G235]] of peace, [[G1515]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] churches of [[G1577]] the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]]

### 34
Let your [[G5216]] women [[G1135]] keep silence [[G4601]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] churches: [[G1577]] for [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] it is [[G2010]] permitted [[G2010]] unto them [[G846]] to speak; [[G2980]] but [[G235]] to be under obedience, [[G5293]] as [[G2531]] also [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] law. [[G3551]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] they will [[G2309]] learn [[G3129]] any thing, [[G5100]] let them ask [[G1905]] their [[G2398]] husbands [[G435]] at [[G1722]] home: [[G3624]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] a shame [[G149]] for women [[G1135]] to speak [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] the church. [[G1577]]

### 36
What? [[G2228]] came [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of out [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] from [[G575]] you? [[G5216]] or [[G2228]] came it [[G2658]] unto [[G1519]] you [[G5209]] only? [[G3441]]

### 37
If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] think himself [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] a prophet, [[G4396]] or [[G2228]] spiritual, [[G4152]] let him acknowledge [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] the things that [[G3739]] I write [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] are [[G1526]] the commandments [[G1785]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] be ignorant, [[G50]] let him be ignorant. [[G50]]

### 39
Wherefore, [[G5620]] brethren, [[G80]] covet [[G2206]] to prophesy, [[G4395]] and [[G2532]] forbid [[G2967]] not [[G3361]] to speak [[G2980]] with tongues. [[G1100]]

### 40
Let all things [[G3956]] be done [[G1096]] decently [[G2156]] and [[G2532]] in [[G2596]] order. [[G5010]]
