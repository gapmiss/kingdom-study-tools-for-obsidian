Now [[G1161]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] collection [[G3048]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] as [[G5618]] I have given order [[G1299]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1577]] churches [[G1577]] of [[G1053]] Galatia, [[G1053]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] do [[G4160]] ye. [[G5210]]

### 2
Upon [[G2596]] the first [[G3391]] of the week [[G4521]] let every one [[G1538]] of you [[G5216]] lay [[G5087]] by [[G3844]] him [[G1438]] in store, [[G2343]] as [[G3739]] hath prospered him, [[G2137]] that [[G2443]] there be [[G1096]] no [[G3361]] gatherings [[G3048]] when [[G3752]] I come. [[G2064]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] I come, [[G3854]] whomsoever [[G3739]] ye shall approve [[G1381]] by [[G1223]] letters, [[G1992]] them [[G5128]] will I send [[G3992]] to bring [[G667]] your [[G5216]] liberality [[G5485]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] it be [[G5600]] meet [[G514]] that I go [[G4198]] also, [[G2504]] they shall go [[G4198]] with [[G4862]] me. [[G1698]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] it may be that [[G5177]] I will abide, [[G3887]] yea, [[G2228]] and [[G2532]] winter [[G3914]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] may bring on my journey [[G4311]] me [[G3165]] whithersoever [[G3757]] I go. [[G4198]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] I will [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] see [[G1492]] you [[G5209]] now [[G737]] by [[G1722]] the way; [[G3938]] but [[G1161]] I trust [[G1679]] to tarry [[G1961]] a while [[G5550]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] permit. [[G2010]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] I will tarry [[G1961]] at [[G1722]] Ephesus [[G2181]] until [[G2193]] Pentecost. [[G4005]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] a great [[G3173]] door [[G2374]] and [[G2532]] effectual [[G1756]] is opened unto [[G455]] me, [[G3427]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] adversaries. [[G480]]

### 10
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] Timotheus [[G5095]] come, [[G2064]] see [[G991]] that [[G2443]] he may be [[G1096]] with [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] without fear: [[G870]] for [[G1063]] he worketh [[G2038]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] also [[G2532]]

### 11
no [[G3361]] Let [[G1848]] man [[G5100]] therefore [[G3767]] despise [[G1848]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] conduct forth [[G4311]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] peace, [[G1515]] that [[G2443]] he may come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me: [[G3165]] for [[G1063]] I look for [[G1551]] him [[G846]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 12
As [[G1161]] touching [[G4012]] brother [[G80]] Apollos, [[G625]] greatly [[G4183]] I [[G3870]] desired [[G3870]] him [[G846]] to [[G2443]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] brethren: [[G80]] but [[G2532]] his will [[G2307]] was [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] at all [[G3843]] to [[G2443]] come [[G2064]] at this time; [[G3568]] but [[G1161]] he will come [[G2064]] when [[G3752]] he shall have convenient time. [[G2119]]

### 13
Watch ye, [[G1127]] stand fast [[G4739]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] quit you like men, [[G407]] be strong. [[G2901]]
