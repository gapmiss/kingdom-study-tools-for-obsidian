### 1
Now [[G1161]] as touching [[G4012]] things offered unto idols, [[G1494]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] we [[G2192]] have [[G2192]] knowledge. [[G1108]] Knowledge [[G1108]] puffeth up, [[G5448]] but [[G1161]] charity [[G26]] edifieth. [[G3618]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] think [[G1380]] that he knoweth [[G1492]] any thing, [[G5100]] he knoweth [[G1097]] nothing [[G3762]] yet [[G3764]] as [[G2531]] he ought [[G1163]] to know. [[G1097]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] love [[G25]] God, [[G2316]] the same [[G3778]] is known [[G1097]] of [[G5259]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
As concerning [[G4012]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] eating [[G1035]] those [[G3588]] of things that are offered in sacrifice unto [[G1494]] idols, [[G1494]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] an idol [[G1497]] nothing [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] the world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] none [[G3762]] other [[G2087]] God [[G2316]] but [[G1487]] one. [[G1520]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] though [[G1512]] there be [[G1526]] that are called [[G3004]] gods, [[G2316]] whether [[G1535]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] or [[G1535]] in [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] (as [[G5618]] there be [[G1526]] gods [[G2316]] many, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] lords [[G2962]] many,) [[G4183]]

### 6
But [[G235]] to us [[G2254]] one [[G1520]] God, [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] of [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] in [[G1519]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] by [[G1223]] him. [[G846]]

### 7
Howbeit [[G235]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] every man [[G3956]]  that [[G3588]] knowledge: [[G1108]] for [[G1161]] some [[G5100]]  with [[G3588]] conscience [[G4893]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1497]] idol [[G1497]] unto [[G2193]] this hour [[G737]] eat [[G2068]] as [[G5613]] a thing offered unto an idol; [[G1494]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] conscience [[G4893]] being [[G5607]] weak [[G772]] is defiled. [[G3435]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] meat [[G1033]] commendeth [[G3936]] us [[G2248]] not [[G3756]] to [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] neither, [[G3777]] if [[G1437]] we eat, [[G5315]] are we the better; [[G4052]] neither, [[G3777]] if [[G1437]] we eat [[G5315]] not, [[G3361]] are we the worse. [[G5302]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] take heed [[G991]] lest by any means [[G3381]] this [[G3778]] liberty [[G1849]] of yours [[G5216]] become [[G1096]] a stumblingblock [[G4348]] them [[G3588]] to that are [[G770]] weak. [[G770]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] see [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] which hast [[G2192]] knowledge [[G1108]] sit at meat [[G2621]] in [[G1722]] the idol's temple, [[G1493]] not [[G3780]] shall be [[G3618]] the [[G3588]] conscience [[G4893]] of him [[G846]] which is [[G5607]] weak [[G772]] emboldened [[G3618]] to eat [[G2068]] those things which are offered to idols; [[G1494]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] through [[G1909]] thy [[G4674]] knowledge [[G1108]] shall [[G622]] the [[G3588]] weak [[G770]] brother [[G80]] perish, [[G622]] for [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] Christ [[G5547]] died? [[G599]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] when ye sin [[G264]] so [[G3779]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] wound [[G5180]] their [[G846]] weak [[G770]] conscience, [[G4893]] ye sin [[G264]] against [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 13
Wherefore, [[G1355]] if [[G1487]] meat [[G1033]] make to [[G4624]] my [[G3450]] brother [[G80]] offend, [[G4624]] I will eat [[G5315]] no [[G3361]] flesh [[G2907]] while [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world standeth, [[G165]] lest [[G3361]] my [[G3450]] I make [[G4624]] brother [[G80]] to [[G2443]] offend.
