### 1
And I, [[G2504]] brethren, [[G80]] when I came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] came [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] with [[G2596]] excellency [[G5247]] of speech [[G3056]] or [[G2228]] of wisdom, [[G4678]] declaring [[G2605]] unto you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3142]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] I determined [[G2919]] not [[G3756]] to know [[G1492]] any thing [[G5100]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] save [[G1487]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] him [[G5126]] crucified. [[G4717]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] was [[G1096]] with [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] weakness, [[G769]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] fear, [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] much [[G4183]] trembling. [[G5156]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] speech [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] preaching [[G2782]] not [[G3756]] with [[G1722]] enticing [[G3981]] words [[G3056]] of man's [[G442]] wisdom, [[G4678]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] demonstration [[G585]] of the Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] of power: [[G1411]]

### 5
That [[G2443]] your [[G5216]] faith should [[G4102]] not [[G3361]] stand [[G5600]] in [[G1722]] the wisdom [[G4678]] of men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] the power [[G1411]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 6
Howbeit [[G1161]] we speak [[G2980]] wisdom [[G4678]] among [[G1722]] them [[G3588]] that are perfect: [[G5046]] yet [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] the wisdom [[G4678]] of this [[G5127]] world, [[G165]] nor [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] of [[G758]] princes [[G758]] of this [[G5127]] world, [[G165]] that [[G3588]] come to nought: [[G2673]]

### 7
But [[G235]] we speak [[G2980]] the wisdom [[G4678]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] a mystery, [[G3466]] the [[G3588]] hidden [[G613]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] ordained [[G4309]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] world [[G165]] unto [[G1519]] our [[G2257]] glory: [[G1391]]

### 8
Which [[G3739]] none [[G3762]] the [[G3588]] of [[G758]] princes [[G758]] of this [[G5127]] world [[G165]] knew: [[G1097]] for [[G1063]] had [[G1487]] they [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] they would [[G4717]] have [[G302]] crucified [[G4717]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] of [[G1391]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 9
But [[G235]] as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] Eye [[G3788]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G1492]] seen, [[G1492]] nor [[G2532]] ear [[G3775]] heard, [[G191]] neither [[G2532]] have entered [[G305]] into [[G1909]] the heart [[G2588]] of man, [[G444]] the things which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath prepared [[G2090]] for them [[G3588]] that love [[G25]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] hath revealed [[G601]] unto us [[G2254]] by [[G1223]] his [[G846]] Spirit: [[G4151]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] searcheth [[G2045]] all things, [[G3956]] yea, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] deep things [[G899]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] man [[G444]] knoweth [[G1492]] the things [[G3588]] of a man, [[G444]] save [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] him? [[G846]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] the things [[G3588]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] knoweth [[G1492]] no man, [[G3762]] but [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] have received, [[G2983]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] which is [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] God; [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] we might know [[G1492]] the things that [[G3588]] are freely given [[G5483]] to us [[G2254]] of [[G5259]] God. [[G2316]]

### 13
Which things [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] we speak, [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] the words [[G3056]] which man's [[G442]] wisdom [[G4678]] teacheth, [[G1318]] but [[G235]] which [[G1722]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] teacheth; [[G1318]] comparing [[G4793]] spiritual things [[G4152]] with spiritual. [[G4152]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] the natural [[G5591]] man [[G444]] receiveth [[G1209]] not [[G3756]] the things [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] they are [[G2076]] foolishness [[G3472]] unto him: [[G846]] neither [[G2532]] can [[G1410]] he know [[G1097]] because [[G3754]] they are spiritually [[G4153]] discerned. [[G350]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] is spiritual [[G4152]] judgeth [[G350]] all things, [[G3956]] yet [[G1161]] he himself [[G846]] is judged [[G350]] of [[G5259]] no man. [[G3762]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] hath known [[G1097]] the mind [[G3563]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] that [[G3739]] he may instruct [[G4822]] him? [[G846]] But [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] have [[G2192]] the mind [[G3563]] of Christ. [[G5547]]
