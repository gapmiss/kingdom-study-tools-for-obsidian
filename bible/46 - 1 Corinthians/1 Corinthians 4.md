### 1
Let [[G3049]] a man [[G444]] so [[G3779]] account [[G3049]] of us, [[G2248]] as [[G5613]] of the ministers [[G5257]] of Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] stewards [[G3623]] of the mysteries [[G3466]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 2
Moreover [[G3063]]  it is [[G3739]] required [[G2212]] in [[G1722]] stewards, [[G3623]] that [[G2443]] a man [[G5100]] be found [[G2147]] faithful. [[G4103]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] with me [[G1698]] it is [[G2076]] a very small thing [[G1646]] that [[G2443]] I should be judged [[G350]] of [[G5259]] you, [[G5216]] or [[G2228]] of [[G5259]] man's [[G442]] judgment: [[G2250]] yea, [[G235]] I judge [[G350]] not [[G3761]] mine own self. [[G1683]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] I know [[G4894]] nothing [[G3762]] by myself; [[G1683]] yet [[G235]] not [[G3756]] am I [[G1344]] hereby [[G1722]] justified: [[G1344]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that judgeth [[G350]] me [[G3165]] is [[G2076]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 5
Therefore [[G5620]] judge [[G2919]] nothing [[G3361]] before [[G4253]] the time, [[G2540]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] come, [[G2064]] who [[G3739]] both [[G2532]] will bring to light [[G5461]] hidden things [[G2927]] of [[G4655]] the [[G3588]] darkness, [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] will make manifest [[G5319]] the [[G3588]] counsels [[G1012]]  of [[G3588]] hearts: [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall [[G1096]] every man [[G1538]] have [[G1096]] praise [[G1868]] of [[G575]] God. [[G2316]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] these things, [[G5023]] brethren, [[G80]] I have in a figure transferred [[G3345]] to [[G1519]] myself [[G1683]] and [[G2532]] Apollos [[G625]] for [[G1223]] your sakes; [[G5209]] that [[G2443]] ye might learn [[G3129]] in [[G1722]] us [[G2254]] not [[G3361]] to think [[G5426]] above [[G5228]] that which [[G3739]] is written, [[G1125]] that [[G2443]] no [[G3361]] one [[G1520]] of you be puffed up [[G5448]] for [[G5228]] one [[G1520]] against [[G2596]] another. [[G2087]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] thee [[G4571]] maketh to [[G1252]] differ [[G1252]] and [[G1161]] what [[G5101]] hast thou [[G2192]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] thou didst [[G2983]] receive? [[G2983]] now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] thou didst receive [[G2983]] why [[G5101]] dost thou glory, [[G2744]] as if [[G5613]] not [[G3361]] thou hadst [[G2983]] received [[G2983]]

### 8
Now [[G2235]] ye are [[G2075]] full, [[G2880]] now [[G2235]] ye are rich, [[G4147]] ye have reigned as kings [[G936]] without [[G5565]] us: [[G2257]] and [[G2532]] I would to God [[G3785]] ye did reign, [[G936]] that [[G2443]] we [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] with [[G5213]] might reign [[G4821]] you. [[G5213]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] I think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] hath set forth [[G584]] us [[G2248]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] last, [[G2078]] as it were [[G5613]] appointed to death: [[G1935]] for [[G3754]] we are made [[G1096]] a spectacle [[G2302]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] to angels, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] to men. [[G444]]

### 10
We [[G2249]] fools [[G3474]] for [[G1223]] Christ's sake, [[G5547]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] wise [[G5429]] in [[G1722]] Christ; [[G5547]] we [[G2249]] weak, [[G772]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] strong; [[G2478]] ye [[G5210]] honourable, [[G1741]] but [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] despised. [[G820]]

### 11
Even unto [[G891]] this present [[G737]] hour [[G5610]] both [[G2532]] we [[G3983]] hunger, [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] thirst, [[G1372]] and [[G2532]] are naked, [[G1130]] and [[G2532]] are buffeted, [[G2852]] and [[G2532]] have no certain dwellingplace; [[G790]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] labour, [[G2872]] working [[G2038]] with our own [[G2398]] hands: [[G5495]] being reviled, [[G3058]] we bless; [[G2127]] being persecuted, [[G1377]] we suffer it: [[G430]]

### 13
Being defamed, [[G987]] we intreat: [[G3870]] we are made [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] the filth [[G4027]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] the offscouring [[G4067]] of all things [[G3956]] unto [[G2193]] this day. [[G737]]

### 14
I write [[G1125]] not [[G3756]] these things [[G5023]] to shame [[G1788]] you, [[G5209]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] sons [[G5043]] I warn [[G3560]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] though [[G1437]] ye have [[G2192]] ten thousand [[G3463]] instructors [[G3807]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] yet [[G235]] not [[G3756]] many [[G4183]] fathers: [[G3962]] for [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] I [[G1473]] have begotten [[G1080]] you [[G5209]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]]

### 16
Wherefore [[G3767]] I beseech [[G3870]] you, [[G5209]] be ye [[G1096]] followers [[G3402]] of me. [[G3450]]

### 17
For [[G1223]] this cause [[G5124]] have I sent [[G3992]] unto you [[G5213]] Timotheus, [[G5095]] who [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] son, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G3739]] you [[G5209]] shall bring into [[G363]] remembrance [[G363]] of my [[G3450]] ways [[G3598]] which [[G3588]] be [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] as [[G2531]] I teach [[G1321]] every where [[G3837]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] church. [[G1577]]

### 18
Now [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] are puffed up, [[G5448]] as though [[G5613]] I [[G3450]] not [[G3361]] would [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] I will come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] shortly, [[G5030]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] will, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] will know, [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] speech [[G3056]] of them which [[G3588]] are puffed up, [[G5448]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] power. [[G1411]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] word, [[G3056]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] power. [[G1411]]

### 21
What [[G5101]] will ye? [[G2309]] shall I come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] a rod, [[G4464]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] and [[G5037]] the spirit [[G4151]] of meekness? [[G4236]]
