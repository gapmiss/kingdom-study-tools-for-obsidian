### 1
Be ye [[G1096]] followers [[G3402]] of me, [[G3450]] even as [[G2531]] I also [[G2504]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

### 2
Now [[G1161]] I praise [[G1867]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] ye remember [[G3415]] me [[G3450]] in all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] ordinances, [[G3862]] as [[G2531]] I delivered [[G3860]] to you. [[G5213]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] I would have [[G2309]] you [[G5209]] know, [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of every [[G3956]] man [[G435]] is [[G2076]] Christ; [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] the head [[G2776]] of the woman [[G1135]] the [[G3588]] man; [[G435]] and [[G1161]] the head [[G2776]] of Christ [[G5547]] God. [[G2316]]

### 4
Every [[G3956]] man [[G435]] praying [[G4336]] or [[G2228]] prophesying, [[G4395]] having [[G2192]] head [[G2776]] covered, [[G2596]] dishonoureth [[G2617]] his [[G846]] head. [[G2776]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] every [[G3956]] woman [[G1135]] that prayeth [[G4336]] or [[G2228]] prophesieth [[G4395]] with [[G2776]] head [[G2776]] uncovered [[G177]] dishonoureth [[G2617]] her [[G1438]] head: [[G2776]] for [[G1063]] that is [[G2076]] even [[G2532]] all one [[G1520]]  as if [[G846]] she [[G3588]] were shaven. [[G3587]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] not [[G3756]] be [[G2619]] covered, [[G2619]] also [[G2532]] let her be [[G2751]] shorn: [[G2751]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] it be a shame [[G149]] for a woman [[G1135]] to be shorn [[G2751]] or [[G2228]] shaven, [[G3587]] let her be covered. [[G2619]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] a man [[G435]] indeed [[G3303]] ought [[G3784]] not [[G3756]] to cover [[G2619]] head, [[G2776]] forasmuch as he is [[G5225]] the image [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] of God: [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] the woman [[G1135]] is [[G2076]] the glory [[G1391]] of the man. [[G435]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] the man [[G435]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the woman; [[G1135]] but [[G235]] the woman [[G1135]] of [[G1537]] the man. [[G435]]

### 9
Neither [[G2532]] was [[G2936]] the man [[G435]] created [[G2936]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] woman; [[G1135]] but [[G235]] the woman [[G1135]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G435]]

### 10
For [[G1223]] this cause [[G5124]] ought [[G3784]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] to have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] on [[G1909]] head [[G2776]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] angels. [[G32]]

### 11
Nevertheless [[G4133]] neither [[G3777]] is the man [[G435]] without [[G5565]] the woman, [[G1135]] neither [[G3777]] the woman [[G1135]] without [[G5565]] the man, [[G435]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G435]] even so [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] man [[G435]] also [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] woman; [[G1135]] but [[G1161]] all things [[G3956]] of [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]]

### 13
Judge [[G2919]] in [[G1722]] yourselves: [[G5213]] is it [[G2076]] comely [[G4241]] that a woman [[G1135]] pray [[G4336]] unto [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] uncovered? [[G177]]

### 14
Doth [[G2228]] not [[G3761]] even [[G3303]] nature [[G5449]] itself [[G846]] teach [[G1321]] you, [[G5209]] that, [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G435]] have long hair, [[G2863]] it unto [[G846]] is [[G2076]] a shame [[G819]] him? [[G846]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] a woman [[G1135]] have long hair, [[G2863]] it is [[G2076]] a glory [[G1391]] to her: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] hair [[G2864]] is given [[G1325]] her [[G846]] for [[G473]] a covering. [[G4018]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] seem [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] contentious, [[G5380]] we [[G2249]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] such [[G5108]] custom, [[G4914]] neither [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] in this [[G5124]] that I declare [[G3853]] I praise [[G1867]] not, [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] ye come together [[G4905]] not [[G3756]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] better, [[G2909]] but [[G235]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] worse. [[G2276]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] first of all, [[G4412]] when [[G3303]] ye [[G5216]] come together [[G4905]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] I hear [[G191]] that there be [[G5225]] divisions [[G4978]] among [[G1722]] you; [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] partly [[G3313]] I it. [[G5100]] believe [[G4100]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] must [[G1163]] there [[G1511]] be [[G1511]] also [[G2532]] heresies [[G139]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] they which [[G3588]] are approved [[G1384]] may be made [[G1096]] manifest [[G5318]] among [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 20
When come [[G4905]] ye [[G5216]] together [[G4905]] therefore [[G3767]] into [[G1909]] one place, [[G846]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] to eat [[G5315]] the Lord's [[G2960]] supper. [[G1173]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] eating [[G5315]] every one [[G1538]] taketh before [[G4301]] his own [[G2398]] supper: [[G1173]] and [[G2532]] one [[G3739]] is hungry, [[G3983]] and [[G1161]] another [[G3739]] is drunken. [[G3184]]

### 22
What? [[G1063]] have ye [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] houses [[G3614]] to [[G1519]] eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] to drink in? [[G4095]] or [[G2228]] despise ye [[G2706]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] shame [[G2617]] them [[G3588]] that have [[G2192]] not? [[G3361]] What [[G5101]] shall I say [[G2036]] to you? [[G5213]] shall I praise [[G1867]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] this? [[G5129]] I praise [[G1867]] not. [[G3756]]

### 23
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] have received [[G3880]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] that which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] I delivered [[G3860]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] he was betrayed [[G3860]] took [[G2983]] bread: [[G740]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] when he had given thanks, [[G2168]] he brake [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Take, [[G2983]] eat: [[G5315]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] body, [[G4983]] which is broken [[G2806]] for [[G5228]] you: [[G5216]] this [[G5124]] do [[G4160]] in [[G1519]] remembrance [[G364]] of me. [[G1699]]

### 25
After the same manner [[G5615]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cup, [[G4221]] when [[G3326]] he [[G3588]] had supped, [[G1172]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G5124]] cup [[G4221]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] testament [[G1242]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1699]] blood: [[G129]] this [[G5124]] do ye, [[G4160]] as oft as [[G3740]] ye drink [[G4095]] in [[G1519]] remembrance [[G364]] of me. [[G1699]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] as often as [[G3740]] ye eat [[G2068]] this [[G5126]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] this [[G5124]] cup, [[G4221]] ye do shew [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] Lord's [[G2962]] death [[G2288]] till [[G891]] he come. [[G2064]]

### 27
Wherefore [[G5620]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall eat [[G2068]] this [[G5126]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2228]] drink [[G4095]] cup [[G4221]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] unworthily, [[G371]] shall be [[G2071]] guilty of [[G1777]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] blood [[G129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] let [[G1381]] a man [[G444]] examine [[G1381]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] let him eat [[G2068]] of [[G1537]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] cup. [[G4221]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] he [[G3588]] that eateth [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinketh [[G4095]] unworthily, [[G371]] eateth [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinketh [[G4095]] damnation [[G2917]] to himself, [[G1438]] not [[G3361]] discerning [[G1252]] the [[G3588]]  Lord's [[G2962]] body. [[G4983]]

### 30
For [[G1223]] this cause [[G5124]] many [[G4183]] weak [[G772]] and [[G2532]] sickly [[G732]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] many [[G2425]] sleep. [[G2837]]

### 31
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] we would judge [[G1252]] ourselves, [[G1438]] not [[G3756]] we should be [[G2919]] judged. [[G2919]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] when we are judged, [[G2919]] we are chastened [[G3811]] of [[G5259]] the Lord, [[G2962]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] we should be [[G2632]] condemned [[G2632]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 33
Wherefore, [[G5620]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] when ye come together [[G4905]] to [[G1519]] eat, [[G5315]] tarry one [[G1551]] for another. [[G240]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] hunger, [[G3983]] let him eat [[G2068]] at [[G1722]] home; [[G3624]] that [[G2443]] ye come together [[G4905]] not [[G3361]] unto [[G1519]] condemnation. [[G2917]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] will I set in order [[G1299]] when [[G5613]] I come. [[G2064]]
