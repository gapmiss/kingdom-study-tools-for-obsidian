### 1
Now [[G1161]] concerning the things [[G4012]] whereof [[G3739]] ye wrote [[G1125]] unto me: [[G3427]] good [[G2570]] for a man [[G444]] not [[G3361]] to touch [[G680]] a woman. [[G1135]]

### 2
Nevertheless, [[G1161]] fornication, [[G4202]] let every man [[G1538]] have [[G2192]] his own [[G1438]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] let every woman [[G1538]] have [[G2192]] her own [[G2398]] husband. [[G435]]

### 3
the [[G3588]] Let [[G591]] husband [[G435]] render [[G591]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1135]] wife [[G1135]] due [[G3784]] benevolence: [[G2133]] and [[G1161]] likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wife [[G1135]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G435]] husband. [[G435]]

### 4
The [[G3588]] wife [[G1135]] hath [[G1850]] not [[G3756]] power [[G1850]] of her own [[G2398]] body, [[G4983]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] husband: [[G435]] and [[G1161]] likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G1850]] power [[G1850]] of his own [[G2398]] body, [[G4983]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 5
Defraud ye [[G650]] not [[G3361]] one the other, [[G240]] except [[G1487]] with [[G1537]] consent [[G4859]] for [[G4314]] a time, [[G2540]] that [[G2443]] ye may give yourselves [[G4980]] to [[G3521]] fasting [[G3521]] and [[G2532]] prayer; [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] come together [[G4905]] again, [[G3825]] that [[G2443]] Satan [[G4567]] tempt [[G3985]] you [[G5209]] not [[G3361]] for [[G1223]] your [[G5216]] incontinency. [[G192]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] I speak [[G3004]] this [[G5124]] by [[G2596]] permission, [[G4774]] not [[G3756]] of [[G2596]] commandment. [[G2003]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] I would [[G2309]] that all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] were [[G1511]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] I myself. [[G1683]] But [[G235]] every man [[G1538]] hath [[G2192]] his proper [[G2398]] gift [[G5486]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] one [[G3739]] after this manner, [[G3779]] and [[G1161]] another [[G3739]] after that. [[G3779]]

### 8
I say [[G3004]] therefore [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] to [[G22]] unmarried [[G22]] and [[G2532]] widows, [[G5503]] It is [[G2076]] good [[G2570]] for them [[G846]] if [[G1437]] they abide [[G3306]] even [[G5613]] as I. [[G2504]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] cannot [[G3756]] they [[G1467]] contain, [[G1467]] let them marry: [[G1060]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] better [[G2909]] to marry [[G1060]] than [[G2228]] to burn. [[G4448]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1060]] married [[G1060]] I command, [[G3853]] not [[G3756]] I, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] Let not [[G3361]] the wife [[G1135]] depart [[G5563]] from [[G575]] husband: [[G435]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] she depart, [[G5563]] let her remain [[G3306]] unmarried, [[G22]] or [[G2228]] be reconciled [[G2644]] to [[G435]] husband: [[G435]] and [[G2532]] let the [[G435]] not [[G3361]] husband [[G435]] put away [[G863]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3062]] rest [[G3062]] speak [[G3004]] I, [[G1473]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Lord: [[G2962]] If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] brother [[G80]] hath [[G2192]] a wife [[G1135]] that believeth not, [[G571]] and [[G2532]] she [[G846]] be pleased [[G4909]] to dwell [[G3611]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] not [[G3361]] let him [[G863]] put [[G863]] her away. [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] the woman [[G1135]] which [[G3748]] hath [[G2192]] an husband [[G435]] that believeth not, [[G571]] and [[G2532]] if he [[G846]] be pleased [[G4909]] to dwell [[G3611]] with [[G3326]] her, [[G846]] not [[G3361]] let her [[G863]] leave [[G863]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] unbelieving [[G571]] husband [[G435]] is sanctified [[G37]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unbelieving [[G571]] wife is [[G1135]] sanctified [[G37]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] husband: [[G435]] else [[G1893]] were [[G2076]] your [[G5216]] children [[G5043]] unclean; [[G169]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] are they [[G2076]] holy. [[G40]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] unbelieving [[G571]] depart, [[G5563]] let him depart. [[G5563]] A [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] or [[G2228]] a [[G3588]] sister [[G79]] is not [[G3756]] under bondage [[G1402]] in [[G1722]] such [[G5108]] but [[G1161]] God hath [[G2316]] called [[G2564]] us [[G2248]] to [[G1722]] peace. [[G1515]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] knowest thou, [[G1492]] O wife, [[G1135]] whether [[G1487]] thou shalt save [[G4982]] husband? [[G435]] or [[G2228]] how [[G5101]] knowest thou, [[G1492]] O man, [[G435]] whether [[G1487]] thou shalt save [[G4982]] wife? [[G1135]]

### 17
But [[G1487]] as [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] hath distributed [[G3307]] to every man, [[G1538]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath called [[G2564]] every one, [[G1538]] so [[G3779]] let him walk. [[G4043]] And [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] ordain I [[G1299]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] churches. [[G1577]]

### 18
any man [[G5100]] Is [[G2564]] called [[G2564]] being circumcised? [[G4059]] not [[G3361]] let him become [[G1986]] uncircumcised. [[G1986]] any [[G5100]] Is [[G2564]] called [[G2564]] in [[G1722]] uncircumcision? [[G203]] not [[G3361]] let him be [[G4059]] circumcised. [[G4059]]

### 19
Circumcision [[G4061]] is [[G2076]] nothing, [[G3762]] and [[G2532]] uncircumcision [[G203]] is [[G2076]] nothing, [[G3762]] but [[G235]] the keeping [[G5084]] of the commandments [[G1785]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 20
Let every man [[G1538]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the same [[G3778]] calling [[G2821]] wherein [[G1722]] he was called. [[G2564]]

### 21
Art thou called [[G2564]] a servant? [[G1401]] care for it: [[G3199]] not [[G3361]] but [[G235]] if [[G1487]] thou mayest [[G1410]] be made [[G1096]] free, [[G1658]] use [[G5530]] rather. [[G3123]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] he that [[G3588]] is called [[G2564]] in [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] a servant, [[G1401]] is [[G2076]] the Lord's [[G2962]] freeman: [[G558]] likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] is called, [[G2564]] free, [[G1658]] is [[G2076]] Christ's [[G5547]] servant. [[G1401]]

### 23
Ye are bought [[G59]] with a price; [[G5092]] be ye [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] the servants [[G1401]] of men. [[G444]]

### 24
Brethren, [[G80]] let every man, [[G1538]] wherein [[G1722]] he is called, [[G2564]] therein [[G1722]] abide [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]]

### 25
Now [[G1161]] concerning [[G4012]] virgins [[G3933]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] commandment [[G2003]] of the Lord: [[G2962]] yet [[G1161]] I give [[G1325]] my judgment, [[G1106]] as [[G5613]] one that hath obtained mercy [[G1653]] of [[G5259]] the Lord [[G2962]] to be [[G1511]] faithful. [[G4103]]

### 26
I suppose [[G3543]] therefore [[G3767]] that this [[G5124]] is [[G5225]] good [[G2570]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] present [[G1764]] distress, [[G318]] that [[G3754]] good [[G2570]] for a man [[G444]] so [[G3779]] to be. [[G1511]]

### 27
Art thou bound [[G1210]] unto a wife? [[G1135]] seek [[G2212]] not [[G3361]] to be loosed. [[G3080]] Art thou loosed [[G3089]] from [[G575]] a wife? [[G1135]] seek [[G2212]] not [[G3361]] a wife. [[G1135]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] thou marry, [[G1060]] not [[G3756]] thou hast [[G264]] sinned; [[G264]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] a [[G3588]] virgin [[G3933]] marry, [[G1060]] not [[G3756]] she hath [[G264]] sinned. [[G264]] Nevertheless [[G1161]] such [[G5108]] shall have [[G2192]] trouble [[G2347]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4561]] flesh: [[G4561]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] spare [[G5339]] you. [[G5216]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] I say, [[G5346]] brethren, [[G80]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] short: [[G4958]] it [[G3588]] remaineth, [[G3063]] that [[G2443]] both [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that have [[G2192]] wives [[G1135]] be none; [[G5600]] as [[G3361]] though [[G5613]] they had [[G2192]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that weep, [[G2799]] as though [[G5613]] they wept [[G2799]] not; [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that rejoice, [[G5463]] as though [[G5613]] they rejoiced [[G5463]] not; [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that buy, [[G59]] as though [[G5613]] they possessed [[G2722]] not; [[G3361]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that use [[G5530]] this [[G5129]] world, [[G2889]] as [[G5613]] not [[G3361]] abusing [[G2710]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] fashion [[G4976]] of this [[G5127]] world passeth [[G2889]] away. [[G3855]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] I would have [[G2309]] you [[G5209]] without carefulness. [[G275]] He [[G3588]] that is [[G1511]] unmarried [[G22]] careth for [[G3309]] the things [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] that belong to [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G4459]] he may please [[G700]] the [[G3588]] Lord: [[G2962]]

### 33
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that is married [[G1060]] careth for [[G3309]] the things [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] that are of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] how [[G4459]] he may please [[G700]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 34
There is difference between [[G3307]] a [[G1135]] wife [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] a [[G3933]] virgin. [[G3933]] The [[G3588]] unmarried woman [[G22]] careth for [[G3309]] the things [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] that [[G2443]] she may be [[G5600]] holy [[G40]] both [[G2532]] in body [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] in spirit: [[G4151]] but [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] that is married [[G1060]] careth for [[G3309]] the things [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] how [[G4459]] she may please [[G700]] husband. [[G435]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] I speak [[G3004]] for [[G4314]] your [[G5216]] own [[G846]] profit; [[G4851]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] I may cast [[G1911]] a snare [[G1029]] upon you, [[G5213]] but [[G235]] for [[G4314]] that which is comely, [[G2158]] and [[G2532]] that ye may attend upon [[G2145]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] without distraction. [[G563]]

### 36
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] think that [[G3543]] he behaveth himself uncomely [[G807]] toward [[G1909]] his [[G846]] virgin, [[G3933]] if [[G1437]] she pass [[G5600]] the flower of age, [[G5230]] and [[G2532]] need [[G3784]] so [[G3779]] require, [[G1096]] let him do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] he will, [[G2309]] he sinneth [[G264]] not: [[G3756]] let them marry. [[G1060]]

### 37
Nevertheless [[G1161]] he that [[G3739]] standeth [[G2476]] stedfast [[G1476]] in [[G1722]] his heart, [[G2588]] having [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] necessity, [[G318]] but [[G1161]] hath [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] over [[G4012]] his own [[G2398]] will, [[G2307]] and [[G2532]] so [[G5124]] hath [[G2919]] decreed [[G2919]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] that [[G2919]] heart [[G2588]] will [[G5083]] keep [[G5083]] his [[G1438]] virgin, [[G3933]] doeth [[G4160]] well. [[G2573]] he [[G3588]]

### 38
So [[G5620]] then [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that giveth in marriage [[G1547]] doeth [[G4160]] well; [[G2573]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] not [[G3361]] that giveth in [[G1547]] marriage [[G1547]] doeth [[G4160]] better. [[G2908]]

### 39
The wife [[G1135]] is bound [[G1210]] by the law [[G3551]] as [[G1909]] long [[G5550]] as [[G3745]] her [[G846]] husband [[G435]] liveth; [[G2198]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] her [[G846]] husband be [[G435]] dead, [[G2837]] she is [[G2076]] at liberty [[G1658]] to be married to [[G1060]] whom [[G3739]] she will; [[G2309]] only [[G3440]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] she is [[G2076]] happier [[G3107]] if [[G1437]] so [[G3779]] she [[G3306]] abide, [[G3306]] after [[G2596]] my [[G1699]] judgment: [[G1106]] and [[G1161]] think [[G1380]] I [[G2504]] also [[G2504]] that I have [[G2192]] the Spirit [[G4151]] of God. [[G2316]]
