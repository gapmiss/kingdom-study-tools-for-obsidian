### 1
Am I [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] an apostle? [[G652]] am I [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] free? [[G1658]] not [[G3780]] have I [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Lord? [[G2962]] are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] ye [[G5210]] my [[G3450]] work [[G2041]] in [[G1722]] the Lord? [[G2962]]

### 2
If [[G1487]] I be [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] an apostle [[G652]] unto others, [[G243]] yet [[G235]] doubtless [[G1065]] I am [[G1510]] to you: [[G5213]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] seal [[G4973]] of mine [[G1699]] apostleship [[G651]] are [[G2075]] ye [[G5210]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 3
Mine [[G1699]] answer [[G627]] them [[G3588]] to that do [[G350]] examine [[G350]] me [[G1691]] is [[G2076]] this, [[G3778]]

### 4
Have we [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] power [[G1849]] to eat [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] to drink? [[G4095]]

### 5
Have we [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] power [[G1849]] to lead about [[G4013]] a sister, [[G79]] a wife, [[G1135]] as well [[G5613]] as [[G2532]] other [[G3062]] apostles, [[G652]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Cephas? [[G2786]]

### 6
Or [[G2228]] I [[G1473]] only [[G3441]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas, [[G921]] have we [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] power [[G1849]] to forbear [[G2038]] working? [[G2038]]

### 7
Who [[G5101]] goeth a warfare [[G4754]] any time [[G4218]] at his own [[G2398]] charges? [[G3800]] who [[G5101]] planteth [[G5452]] a vineyard, [[G290]] and [[G2532]] eateth [[G2068]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] thereof? [[G846]] or [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] feedeth [[G4165]] a flock, [[G4167]] and [[G2532]] eateth [[G2068]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] milk [[G1051]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4167]] flock? [[G4167]]

### 8
Say I [[G2980]] these things [[G5023]] as [[G2596]] a man? [[G444]] or [[G2228]] saith [[G3004]] not [[G3780]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] the same [[G5023]] also? [[G2532]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of Moses, [[G3475]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt the mouth of [[G5392]] muzzle [[G5392]] the ox [[G1016]] that treadeth out the corn. [[G248]] Doth God take [[G2316]] care [[G3199]]  for [[G3588]] oxen? [[G1016]]

### 10
Or [[G2228]] saith he [[G3004]] altogether [[G3843]] for [[G1223]] our sakes? [[G2248]] For [[G1223]] our sakes, [[G2248]] no doubt, [[G1063]] is written: [[G1125]] that [[G3754]] he [[G3588]] that ploweth [[G722]] should [[G3784]] plow [[G722]] in [[G1909]] hope; [[G1680]] and that [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] thresheth [[G248]] in [[G1909]] hope should be [[G1680]] partaker [[G3348]] of his [[G846]] hope. [[G1680]]

### 11
If [[G1487]] we [[G2249]] have sown [[G4687]] unto you [[G5213]] spiritual things, [[G4152]] a great thing [[G3173]] if [[G1487]] we [[G2249]] shall reap [[G2325]] your [[G5216]] carnal things? [[G4559]]

### 12
If [[G1487]] others [[G243]] be partakers [[G3348]] of [[G1849]] power [[G1849]] over you, [[G5216]] not [[G3756]] we [[G2249]] rather? [[G3123]] Nevertheless [[G235]] not [[G3756]] we have [[G5530]] used [[G5530]] this [[G3778]] power; [[G1849]] but [[G235]] suffer [[G4722]] all things, [[G3956]] lest [[G2443]] we should [[G1325]] hinder [[G1464]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 13
not [[G3756]] Do ye [[G1492]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] they [[G3588]] which minister [[G2038]] about holy things [[G2413]] live [[G2068]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple? [[G2411]] and they which wait [[G4332]] at the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] with [[G2379]] are partakers [[G4829]] the [[G3588]] altar? [[G2379]]

### 14
Even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath ordained that [[G1299]] they which [[G3588]] preach [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] should live [[G2198]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] have used [[G5530]] none [[G3762]] of these things: [[G5130]] neither [[G3756]] have I written [[G1125]] these things, [[G5023]] that [[G2443]] it should be done [[G1096]] so [[G3779]] unto [[G1722]] me: [[G1698]] for [[G1063]] better [[G2570]] for me [[G3427]] to [[G3123]] die, [[G599]] than [[G2228]] that [[G2443]] any man [[G5100]] should make void. [[G2758]] my [[G3450]] glorying [[G2745]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] though [[G1437]] I preach the gospel, [[G2097]] I [[G3427]] have [[G2076]] nothing [[G3756]] to glory of: [[G2745]] for [[G1063]] necessity [[G318]] upon [[G3427]] is laid [[G1945]] me; [[G3427]] yea, [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] is [[G2076]] unto me, [[G3427]] if [[G1437]] I preach the gospel! [[G2097]] not [[G3361]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] I do [[G4238]] this thing [[G5124]] willingly, [[G1635]] I have [[G2192]] a reward: [[G3408]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] against my will, [[G210]] a dispensation [[G3622]] is committed unto me. [[G4100]]

### 18
What [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3427]] reward [[G3408]] then? [[G3767]] that, [[G2443]] when I preach the gospel, [[G2097]] I may make [[G5087]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of without [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] charge, [[G77]] that I abuse [[G2710]] not [[G3361]] my [[G3450]] power [[G1849]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] though I be [[G5607]] free [[G1658]] from [[G1537]] all [[G3956]] yet have I made servant [[G1402]] myself [[G1683]] unto all, [[G3956]] that [[G2443]] I might gain [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] more. [[G4119]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] I became [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] a Jew, [[G2453]] that [[G2443]] I might gain [[G2770]] the Jews; [[G2453]] them [[G3588]] to that are [[G5259]] under [[G5259]] the law, [[G3551]] as [[G5613]] under [[G5259]] the law, [[G3551]] that [[G2443]] I might gain [[G2770]] them [[G3588]] that are under [[G5259]] the law; [[G3551]]

### 21
To them that are without law, [[G459]] as [[G5613]] without law, [[G459]] (being [[G5607]] not [[G3361]] without law [[G459]] to God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] under the law [[G1772]] to Christ,) [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] I might gain [[G2770]] them that are without law. [[G459]]

### 22
the [[G3588]] To [[G772]] weak [[G772]] became I [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] weak, [[G772]] that [[G2443]] I might gain [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] weak: [[G772]] I am made [[G1096]] all things [[G3956]] to all [[G3956]] that [[G2443]] by all means [[G3843]] I might [[G4982]] save [[G4982]] some. [[G5100]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] I do [[G4160]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gospel's sake, [[G2098]] that [[G2443]] I might be [[G1096]] partaker [[G4791]] thereof with [[G846]]

### 24
Know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] they which [[G3588]] run [[G5143]] in [[G1722]] a race [[G4712]] run [[G5143]] all, [[G3956]] but [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] receiveth [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] prize? [[G1017]] So [[G3779]] run, [[G5143]] that [[G2443]] ye may obtain. [[G2638]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] every man [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] striveth for the mastery [[G75]] is temperate [[G1467]] in all things. [[G3956]] Now [[G3767]] they [[G1565]] to [[G2443]] obtain [[G2983]] a corruptible [[G5349]] crown; [[G4735]] but [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] an incorruptible. [[G862]]

### 26
I [[G1473]] therefore [[G5106]] so [[G3779]] run, [[G5143]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] uncertainly; [[G84]] so [[G3779]] fight I, [[G4438]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] one that beateth [[G1194]] the air: [[G109]]

### 27
But [[G235]] I keep under [[G5299]] my [[G3450]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] bring into subjection: [[G1396]] lest that by any means, [[G3381]] when I have preached [[G2784]] to others, [[G243]] I myself [[G846]] should be [[G1096]] a castaway. [[G96]]
