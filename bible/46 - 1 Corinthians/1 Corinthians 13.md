### 1
Though [[G1437]] I speak [[G2980]] with the [[G3588]] tongues [[G1100]] of [[G444]] men [[G444]] and [[G2532]] of [[G32]] angels, [[G32]] and [[G1161]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] charity, [[G26]] I am become [[G1096]] sounding [[G2278]] brass, [[G5475]] or [[G2228]] a tinkling [[G214]] cymbal. [[G2950]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] though [[G1437]] I have [[G2192]] prophecy, [[G4394]] and [[G2532]] understand [[G1492]] all [[G3956]] mysteries, [[G3466]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] knowledge; [[G1108]] and [[G2532]] though [[G1437]] I have [[G2192]] all [[G3956]] faith, [[G4102]] so that [[G5620]] I could remove [[G3179]] mountains, [[G3735]] and [[G1161]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] charity, [[G26]] I am [[G1510]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] though [[G1437]] I bestow to feed [[G5595]] all [[G3956]] my [[G3450]] goods [[G5224]] and [[G2532]] though [[G1437]] I give [[G3860]] my [[G3450]] body [[G4983]] to [[G2443]] be burned, [[G2545]] and [[G1161]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] charity, [[G26]] it profiteth me [[G5623]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 4
Charity [[G26]] suffereth long, [[G3114]] is kind; [[G5541]] charity [[G26]] envieth [[G2206]] not; [[G3756]] charity [[G26]] vaunteth itself, [[G4068]] not [[G3756]] not [[G3756]] is up, [[G5448]] puffed [[G5448]]

### 5
Doth not [[G3756]] behave itself unseemly, [[G807]] seeketh [[G2212]] not [[G3756]] her own, [[G1438]] not [[G3756]] is easily [[G3947]] provoked, [[G3947]] thinketh [[G3049]] no [[G3756]] evil; [[G2556]]

### 6
Rejoiceth [[G5463]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1909]] iniquity, [[G93]] but [[G1161]] rejoiceth in [[G4796]] the [[G3588]] truth; [[G225]]

### 7
Beareth [[G4722]] all things, [[G3956]] believeth [[G4100]] all things, [[G3956]] hopeth [[G1679]] all things, [[G3956]] endureth [[G5278]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 8
Charity [[G26]] never [[G3763]] faileth: [[G1601]] but [[G1161]] whether [[G1535]] prophecies, [[G4394]] they shall fail; [[G2673]] whether [[G1535]] tongues, [[G1100]] they shall cease; [[G3973]] whether [[G1535]] knowledge, [[G1108]] it shall vanish away. [[G2673]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] we know [[G1097]] in [[G1537]] part, [[G3313]] and [[G2532]] we prophesy [[G4395]] in [[G1537]] part. [[G3313]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] that which is [[G3588]] perfect [[G5046]] is come, [[G2064]] then [[G5119]] that which is [[G3588]] in [[G1537]] part [[G3313]] shall be done away. [[G2673]]

### 11
When [[G3753]] I was [[G2252]] a child, [[G3516]] I spake [[G2980]] as [[G5613]] a child, [[G3516]] I understood [[G5426]] as [[G5613]] a child, [[G3516]] I thought [[G3049]] as [[G5613]] a child: [[G3516]] but [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] I became [[G1096]] a man, [[G435]] I put away [[G2673]] childish [[G3516]] things. [[G3588]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] now [[G737]] we see [[G991]] through [[G1223]] a glass, [[G2072]] darkly; [[G1722]] but [[G1161]] then [[G5119]] face [[G4383]] to [[G4314]] face: [[G4383]] now [[G737]] I know [[G1097]] in [[G1537]] part; [[G3313]] but [[G1161]] then [[G5119]] shall I know [[G1921]] even as [[G2531]] also [[G2532]] I am known. [[G1921]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] abideth [[G3306]] faith, [[G4102]] hope, [[G1680]] charity, [[G26]] these [[G5023]] three; [[G5140]] but [[G1161]] the greatest [[G3187]] of these [[G5130]] charity. [[G26]]
