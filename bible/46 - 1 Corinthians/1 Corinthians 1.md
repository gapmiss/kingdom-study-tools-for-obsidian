### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] called [[G2822]] an apostle [[G652]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] through [[G1223]] the will [[G2307]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Sosthenes [[G4988]] brother, [[G80]]

### 2
Unto the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] is [[G5607]] at [[G1722]] Corinth, [[G2882]] to them that are sanctified [[G37]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] called [[G2822]] saints, [[G40]] with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] place [[G5117]] call upon [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Lord, [[G2962]] both [[G5037]] theirs [[G846]] and [[G2532]] ours: [[G2257]]

### 3
Grace [[G5485]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] peace, [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 4
I thank [[G2168]] my [[G3450]] God [[G2316]] always [[G3842]] on behalf, [[G4012]] your [[G5216]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] is given [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 5
That [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] every thing [[G3956]] ye are enriched [[G4148]] by [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] utterance, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] knowledge; [[G1108]]

### 6
Even as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3142]] of [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] was confirmed [[G950]] in [[G1722]] you: [[G5213]]

### 7
So that [[G5620]] ye [[G5209]] come behind [[G5302]] in [[G1722]] no [[G3367]] gift; [[G5486]] waiting for [[G553]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G602]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 8
Who shall [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] confirm [[G950]] you [[G5209]] unto [[G2193]] the end, [[G5056]] blameless [[G410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 9
God [[G2316]] faithful, [[G4103]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] ye were called [[G2564]] unto [[G1519]] the fellowship [[G2842]] of his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 10
Now [[G1161]] I beseech [[G3870]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G3004]] all [[G3956]] speak [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] same thing, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] there be [[G5600]] no [[G3361]] divisions [[G4978]] among [[G1722]] you; [[G5213]] but [[G1161]] ye be [[G5600]] perfectly joined together [[G2675]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] mind [[G3563]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] judgment. [[G1106]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] it hath been declared [[G1213]] unto me [[G3427]] of [[G4012]] you, [[G5216]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] by [[G5259]] them [[G3588]] of Chloe, [[G5514]] that [[G3754]] there are [[G1526]] contentions [[G2054]] among [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] I say, [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] every one [[G1538]] of you [[G5216]] saith, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] of Paul; [[G3972]] and [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] of Apollos; [[G625]] and [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] of Cephas; [[G2786]] and [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

### 13
Christ [[G5547]] Is divided? [[G3307]] Paul [[G3972]] was [[G4717]] crucified [[G4717]] for [[G5228]] you? [[G5216]] or [[G2228]] were ye baptized [[G907]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Paul? [[G3972]]

### 14
I thank [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] I baptized [[G907]] none [[G3762]] of you, [[G5216]] but [[G1487]] Crispus [[G2921]] and [[G2532]] Gaius; [[G1050]]

### 15
Lest [[G2443]] any [[G5100]] should say [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] I had baptized [[G907]] in [[G1519]] mine own [[G1699]] name. [[G3686]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] I baptized [[G907]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] household [[G3624]] of Stephanas: [[G4734]] besides, [[G3063]] I know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] whether [[G1487]] I baptized [[G907]] any [[G5100]] other. [[G243]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] Christ [[G5547]] sent [[G649]] me [[G3165]] not [[G3756]] to baptize, [[G907]] but [[G235]] to preach the gospel: [[G2097]] not [[G3756]] with [[G1722]] wisdom [[G4678]] of words, [[G3056]] lest [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of should be made of none [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] effect. [[G2758]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] preaching [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4716]] cross [[G4716]] is [[G2076]] them [[G3588]] to that [[G622]] perish [[G622]] foolishness; [[G3472]] but [[G1161]] unto us [[G2254]] which [[G3588]] are saved [[G4982]] it is [[G2076]] the power [[G1411]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] I will destroy [[G622]] the [[G3588]] wisdom of [[G4678]] the [[G3588]] wise, [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] will bring to nothing [[G114]] the [[G3588]] understanding of [[G4907]] the [[G3588]] prudent. [[G4908]]

### 20
Where [[G4226]] the wise? [[G4680]] where [[G4226]] the scribe? [[G1122]] where [[G4226]] the disputer [[G4804]] of this [[G5127]] world? [[G165]] hath not [[G3780]] God [[G2316]] made foolish [[G3471]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of this [[G5127]] world? [[G2889]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] after that [[G1894]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] by [[G1223]] wisdom [[G4678]] knew [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] God, [[G2316]] it pleased [[G2106]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] foolishness [[G3472]] of [[G2782]] preaching [[G2782]] to save [[G4982]] them [[G3588]] that believe. [[G4100]]

### 22
For [[G1894]] the [[G2532]] Jews [[G2453]] require [[G154]] a sign, [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] the Greeks [[G1672]] after [[G4678]] seek [[G2212]] wisdom: [[G4678]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] preach [[G2784]] Christ [[G5547]] crucified, [[G4717]] unto the Jews [[G2453]] a [[G3303]] stumblingblock, [[G4625]] and [[G1161]] unto the Greeks [[G1672]] foolishness; [[G3472]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] unto them [[G846]] which [[G3588]] are called, [[G2822]] both [[G5037]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks, [[G1672]] Christ [[G5547]] the power [[G1411]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the wisdom [[G4678]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 25
Because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] foolishness [[G3474]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] wiser than [[G4680]] men; [[G444]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] weakness [[G772]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] stronger than [[G2478]] men. [[G444]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] ye see [[G991]] your [[G5216]] calling, [[G2821]] brethren, [[G80]] how that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] many [[G4183]] wise men [[G4680]] after [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] not [[G3756]] many [[G4183]] mighty, [[G1415]] not [[G3756]] many [[G4183]] noble, [[G2104]]

### 27
But [[G235]] God hath [[G2316]] chosen [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] foolish things [[G3474]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world [[G2889]] to [[G2443]] confound [[G2617]] the [[G3588]] wise; [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] God hath [[G2316]] chosen [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] weak things [[G772]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world [[G2889]] to [[G2443]] confound [[G2617]] the things [[G3588]] which are mighty; [[G2478]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] base things [[G36]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] things [[G3588]] which are despised, [[G1848]] hath [[G1586]] God [[G2316]] chosen, [[G1586]] and [[G2532]] things [[G3588]] which are [[G5607]] not, [[G3361]] to [[G2443]] bring to nought [[G2673]] things [[G3588]] that are: [[G5607]]

### 29
That [[G3704]] no [[G3361]] flesh [[G4561]] should glory [[G2744]] in [[G1799]] his [[G846]] presence. [[G1799]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] of [[G1537]] him [[G846]] are [[G2075]] ye [[G5210]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3739]] of [[G575]] God [[G2316]] is made [[G1096]] unto us [[G2254]] wisdom, [[G4678]] and [[G5037]] righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] sanctification, [[G38]] and [[G2532]] redemption: [[G629]]

### 31
That, [[G2443]] according as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] He [[G3588]] that glorieth, [[G2744]] let him glory [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]
