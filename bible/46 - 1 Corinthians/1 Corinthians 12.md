### 1
Now [[G1161]] concerning [[G4012]] spiritual [[G4152]] brethren, [[G80]] I would have [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] you [[G5209]] ignorant. [[G50]]

### 2
Ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] ye were [[G2258]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] carried away [[G520]] unto [[G4314]] these [[G3588]] dumb [[G880]] idols, [[G1497]] even as [[G5613]] ye were led. [[G71]]

### 3
Wherefore [[G1352]] I give to [[G1107]] you [[G5213]] understand, [[G1107]] that [[G3754]] no man [[G3762]] speaking [[G2980]] by [[G1722]] the Spirit [[G4151]] of God [[G2316]] calleth [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] accursed: [[G331]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] say [[G2036]] that Jesus [[G2424]] is the Lord, [[G2962]] but [[G1487]] by [[G1722]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 4
Now [[G1161]] there are [[G1526]] diversities [[G1243]] of gifts, [[G5486]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] there are [[G1526]] differences [[G1243]] of administrations, [[G1248]] but [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] there are [[G1526]] diversities [[G1243]] of operations, [[G1755]] but [[G1161]] it is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] worketh [[G1754]] all [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] all. [[G3956]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] manifestation [[G5321]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] is given [[G1325]] to [[G4314]] every man [[G1538]] to profit withal. [[G4851]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] to one [[G3739]] is given [[G1325]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] the word [[G3056]] of wisdom; [[G4678]] to another [[G243]] the word [[G3056]] of knowledge [[G1108]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Spirit; [[G4151]]

### 9
To [[G1161]] another [[G2087]] faith [[G4102]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Spirit; [[G4151]] to [[G1161]] another [[G243]] the gifts [[G5486]] of healing [[G2386]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Spirit; [[G4151]]

### 10
To [[G1161]] another [[G243]] the working [[G1755]] of miracles; [[G1411]] to [[G1161]] another [[G243]] prophecy; [[G4394]] to [[G1161]] another [[G243]] discerning [[G1253]] of spirits; [[G4151]] to [[G1161]] another [[G2087]] kinds [[G1085]] of tongues; [[G1100]] to [[G1161]] another [[G243]] the interpretation [[G2058]] of tongues: [[G1100]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] these [[G5023]] worketh [[G1754]] that [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] selfsame [[G846]] Spirit, [[G4151]] dividing [[G1244]] to every man [[G1538]] severally [[G2398]] as [[G2531]] he will. [[G1014]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] as [[G2509]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] is [[G2076]] one, [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] hath [[G2192]] many [[G4183]] members, [[G3196]] and [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] members [[G3196]] that [[G3588]] of [[G1520]] one [[G1520]] body, [[G4983]] being [[G5607]] many, [[G4183]] are [[G2076]] one [[G1520]] body: [[G4983]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] by [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] Spirit [[G4151]] we [[G2249]] are [[G907]] all [[G3956]] baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] one [[G1520]] body, [[G4983]] whether [[G1535]] Jews [[G2453]] or [[G1535]] Gentiles, [[G1672]] whether [[G1535]] bond [[G1401]] or [[G1535]] free; [[G1658]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] have been made to [[G4222]] drink [[G4222]] into [[G1519]] one [[G1520]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 14
For [[G1063]]  the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] one [[G1520]] member, [[G3196]] but [[G235]] many. [[G4183]]

### 15
If [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] foot [[G4228]] shall say, [[G2036]] Because [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the hand, [[G5495]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body; [[G4983]] is [[G2076]] it [[G5124]] therefore [[G3844]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body? [[G4983]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] ear [[G3775]] shall say, [[G2036]] Because [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the eye, [[G3788]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body; [[G4983]] is [[G2076]] it [[G5124]] therefore [[G3844]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body? [[G4983]]

### 17
If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] an eye, [[G3788]] where [[G4226]] the [[G3588]] hearing? [[G189]] If [[G1487]] the whole [[G3650]] hearing, [[G189]] where [[G4226]] the [[G3588]] smelling? [[G3750]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] hath [[G5087]] God [[G2316]] set [[G5087]] the [[G3588]] members [[G3196]] every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] as [[G2531]] it hath pleased him. [[G2309]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] they were [[G2258]] all [[G3956]] one [[G1520]] member, [[G3196]] where [[G4226]] the [[G3588]] body? [[G4983]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] many [[G4183]] members, [[G3196]] yet but [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] body. [[G4983]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] the eye [[G3788]] cannot [[G1410]] say [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] of thee: [[G4675]] nor [[G2228]] again [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4228]] feet, [[G4228]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] of you. [[G5216]]

### 22
Nay, [[G235]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] those members [[G3196]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4983]] body, [[G4983]] which [[G3588]] seem [[G1380]] to be [[G5225]] more feeble, [[G772]] are [[G2076]] necessary: [[G316]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] which [[G3739]] we think [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] less honourable, [[G820]] upon these [[G5125]] we bestow [[G4060]] more abundant [[G4053]] honour; [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] uncomely [[G809]] have [[G2192]] more abundant [[G4053]] comeliness. [[G2157]]

### 24
For [[G1161]] our [[G2257]] comely [[G2158]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need: [[G5532]] but [[G235]] God [[G2316]] hath tempered together, [[G4786]] the [[G4983]] body [[G4983]] having given [[G1325]] more abundant [[G4053]] honour [[G5092]] that [[G3588]] to which [[G5302]] lacked: [[G5302]]

### 25
That [[G2443]] there should be [[G5600]] no [[G3361]] schism [[G4978]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] body; [[G4983]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] should have [[G3309]] members [[G3196]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] care [[G3309]] for [[G5228]] one [[G240]] another. [[G240]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] whether [[G1535]] one [[G1520]] member [[G3196]] suffer, [[G3958]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] members with it; [[G3196]] suffer [[G4841]] or [[G1535]] one [[G1520]] member [[G3196]] be honoured, [[G1392]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] members with it. [[G3196]] rejoice [[G4796]]

### 27
Now [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] the body [[G4983]] of Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] members [[G3196]] in [[G1537]] particular. [[G3313]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] hath set [[G5087]] some [[G3739]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] first [[G4412]] apostles, [[G652]] secondarily [[G1208]] prophets, [[G4396]] thirdly [[G5154]] teachers, [[G1320]] after that [[G1899]] miracles, [[G1411]] then [[G1534]] gifts [[G5486]] of healings, [[G2386]] helps, [[G484]] governments, [[G2941]] diversities [[G1085]] of tongues. [[G1100]]

### 29
all [[G3956]] apostles? [[G652]] all [[G3956]] prophets? [[G4396]] all [[G3956]] teachers? [[G1320]] all [[G3956]] workers of miracles? [[G1411]]

### 30
Have [[G2192]] all [[G3956]] the gifts [[G5486]] of healing? [[G2386]] all [[G3956]] do [[G2980]] speak [[G2980]] with tongues? [[G1100]] all [[G3956]] do [[G1329]] interpret? [[G1329]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] covet earnestly [[G2206]] the [[G3588]] best [[G2909]] gifts: [[G5486]] and [[G2532]] yet [[G2089]] shew I [[G1166]] unto you [[G5213]] a more [[G2596]] excellent [[G5236]] way. [[G3598]]
