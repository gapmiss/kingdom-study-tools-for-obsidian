### 1
And [[G2532]] I, [[G1473]] brethren, [[G80]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] speak [[G2980]] unto you [[G5213]] as [[G5613]] unto spiritual, [[G4152]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] unto carnal, [[G4559]] as [[G5613]] unto babes [[G3516]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 2
I have fed [[G4222]] you [[G5209]] with milk, [[G1051]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] with meat: [[G1033]] for [[G1063]] hitherto [[G3768]] ye were not able [[G1410]] neither [[G3777]] yet [[G2089]] now [[G3568]] are ye able. [[G1410]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] ye are [[G2075]] yet [[G2089]] carnal: [[G4559]] for [[G1063]] whereas [[G3699]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] envying, [[G2205]] and [[G2532]] strife, [[G2054]] and [[G2532]] divisions, [[G1370]] are ye [[G2075]] not [[G3780]] carnal, [[G4559]] and [[G2532]] walk [[G4043]] as [[G2596]] men? [[G444]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] while [[G3752]] one [[G5100]] saith, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] of Paul; [[G3972]] and [[G1161]] another, [[G2087]] I [[G1473]] of Apollos; [[G625]] are ye [[G2075]] not [[G3780]] carnal? [[G4559]]

### 5
Who [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] is [[G2076]] Paul, [[G3972]] and [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] Apollos, [[G625]] but [[G235]] ministers [[G1249]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] ye believed, [[G4100]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] gave to [[G1325]] every man? [[G1538]]

### 6
I [[G1473]] have planted, [[G5452]] Apollos [[G625]] watered; [[G4222]] but [[G235]] God [[G2316]] gave the increase. [[G837]]

### 7
So then [[G5620]] neither [[G3777]] is he [[G2076]] that planteth [[G5452]] any thing, [[G5100]] neither [[G3777]] he [[G3588]] that watereth; [[G4222]] but [[G235]] God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] that giveth [[G837]] increase. [[G837]]

### 8
Now [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] planteth [[G5452]] and [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] watereth [[G4222]] are [[G1526]] one: [[G1520]] and [[G1161]] every man [[G1538]] shall receive [[G2983]] his own [[G2398]] reward [[G3408]] according to [[G2596]] his own [[G2398]] labour. [[G2873]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] we are [[G2070]] with [[G2316]] labourers together [[G4904]] God: [[G2316]] ye are [[G2075]] God's [[G2316]] husbandry, [[G1091]] God's [[G2316]] building. [[G3619]]

### 10
According to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] is given [[G1325]] unto me, [[G3427]] as [[G5613]] a wise [[G4680]] masterbuilder, [[G753]] I have laid [[G5087]] the foundation, [[G2310]] and [[G1161]] another [[G243]] buildeth thereon. [[G2026]] But [[G1161]] every man [[G1538]] let take [[G991]] heed [[G991]] how [[G4459]] he buildeth thereupon. [[G2026]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] other [[G243]] foundation [[G2310]] can [[G1410]] no man [[G3762]] lay [[G5087]] than [[G3844]] that is laid, [[G2749]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] build [[G2026]] upon [[G1909]] this [[G5126]] foundation [[G2310]] gold, [[G5557]] silver, [[G696]] precious [[G5093]] stones, [[G3037]] wood, [[G3586]] hay, [[G5528]] stubble; [[G2562]]

### 13
Every man's [[G1538]] work shall be [[G2041]] made [[G1096]] manifest: [[G5318]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] shall declare it, [[G1213]] because [[G3754]] it shall be revealed [[G601]] by [[G1722]] fire; [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] shall try [[G1381]] every man's [[G1538]] work [[G2041]] of what sort [[G3697]] it is. [[G2076]]

### 14
If [[G1487]] any man's [[G5100]] work [[G2041]] abide [[G3306]] which [[G3739]] he hath built thereupon, [[G2026]] he shall receive [[G2983]] a reward. [[G3408]]

### 15
If [[G1487]] any man's [[G5100]] work [[G2041]] shall be burned, [[G2618]] he shall suffer loss: [[G2210]] but [[G1161]] he himself [[G846]] shall be saved; [[G4982]] yet [[G1161]] so [[G3779]] as [[G5613]] by [[G1223]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 16
Know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] the temple [[G3485]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] dwelleth [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] you? [[G5213]]

### 17
If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] defile [[G5351]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] him [[G5126]] shall [[G5351]] God [[G2316]] destroy; [[G5351]] the [[G3588]] for [[G1063]] temple [[G3485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] holy, [[G40]] which [[G3748]] ye [[G5210]] are. [[G2075]]

### 18
no man [[G3367]] Let [[G1818]] deceive [[G1818]] himself. [[G1438]] If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] seemeth [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] wise [[G4680]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] world, [[G165]] let him become [[G1096]] a fool, [[G3474]] that [[G2443]] he may be [[G1096]] wise. [[G4680]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of this [[G5127]] world [[G2889]] is [[G2076]] foolishness [[G3472]] with [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]] For [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] He [[G3588]] taketh [[G1405]] the [[G3588]] wise [[G4680]] in [[G1722]] their own [[G846]] craftiness. [[G3834]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] The Lord [[G2962]] knoweth [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] thoughts of [[G1261]] the [[G3588]] wise, [[G4680]] that [[G3754]] they are [[G1526]] vain. [[G3152]]

### 21
Therefore [[G5620]] no man [[G3367]] let [[G2744]] glory [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] men. [[G444]] For [[G1063]] all things [[G3956]] are [[G2076]] yours; [[G5216]]

### 22
Whether [[G1535]] Paul, [[G3972]] or [[G1535]] Apollos, [[G625]] or [[G1535]] Cephas, [[G2786]] or [[G1535]] the world, [[G2889]] or [[G1535]] life, [[G2222]] or [[G1535]] death, [[G2288]] or [[G1535]] things present, [[G1764]] or [[G1535]] things to come; [[G3195]] all [[G3956]] are [[G2076]] yours; [[G5216]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] are Christ's; [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] Christ [[G5547]] God's. [[G2316]]
