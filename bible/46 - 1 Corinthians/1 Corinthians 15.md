### 1
Moreover, [[G1161]] brethren, [[G80]] I declare [[G1107]] unto you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] which [[G3739]] I preached [[G2097]] unto you, [[G5213]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] ye have received, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] wherein [[G1722]] ye stand; [[G2476]]

### 2
By [[G1223]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] ye are saved, [[G4982]] if [[G1487]] ye keep in memory [[G2722]] what [[G5100]] I [[G3056]] preached [[G2097]] unto you, [[G5213]] unless [[G1622]] ye have believed [[G4100]] in vain. [[G1500]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] I delivered [[G3860]] unto you [[G5213]] first of all [[G4413]] that which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] I [[G3880]] received, [[G3880]] how that [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] our [[G2257]] sins to [[G266]] according [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] scriptures; [[G1124]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] he was buried, [[G2290]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] he rose again [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] scriptures: [[G1124]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] he was seen [[G3700]] of Cephas, [[G2786]] then [[G1534]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve: [[G1427]]

### 6
After that, [[G1899]] he was seen [[G3700]] of above [[G1883]] five hundred [[G4001]] brethren [[G80]] at once; [[G2178]] of [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] greater part [[G4119]] remain [[G3306]] unto [[G2193]] this present, [[G737]] but [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] are [[G2532]] fallen asleep. [[G2837]]

### 7
After that, [[G1899]] he was seen [[G3700]] of James; [[G2385]] then [[G1534]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] last [[G2078]] of all [[G3956]] he was seen [[G3700]] of me also, [[G2504]] as [[G5619]] one [[G3588]] of born out of due [[G1626]] time. [[G1626]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] least [[G1646]] the [[G3588]] of [[G652]] apostles, [[G652]] that [[G3739]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] meet [[G2425]] to be called [[G2564]] an apostle, [[G652]] because [[G1360]] I persecuted [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] by the grace [[G5485]] of God [[G2316]] I am [[G1510]] what [[G3739]] I am: [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] grace [[G5485]] which [[G3588]] upon [[G1519]] me [[G1691]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] in vain; [[G2756]] but [[G235]] I laboured [[G2872]] more abundantly [[G4053]] than they [[G846]] all: [[G3956]] yet [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] I, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which was [[G3588]] with [[G4862]] me. [[G1698]]

### 11
Therefore [[G3767]] whether [[G1535]] I [[G1473]] or [[G1535]] they, [[G1565]] so [[G3779]] we preach, [[G2784]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] ye believed. [[G4100]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] be preached [[G2784]] that [[G3754]] he rose [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] how [[G4459]] say [[G3004]] some [[G5100]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] there is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] resurrection [[G386]] of the dead? [[G3498]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] there be [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] resurrection [[G386]] of the dead, [[G3498]] then not [[G3761]] Christ [[G5547]] is [[G1453]] risen: [[G1453]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] not [[G3756]] be [[G1453]] risen, [[G1453]] then [[G686]] our [[G2257]] preaching [[G2782]] vain, [[G2756]] and [[G1161]] your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] also [[G2532]] vain. [[G2756]]

### 15
Yea, [[G1161]] and [[G2532]] we are found [[G2147]] false witnesses [[G5575]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] because [[G3754]] we have testified [[G3140]] of [[G2596]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] he raised up [[G1453]] Christ: [[G5547]] whom [[G3739]] he raised up, [[G1453]] not [[G3756]] if so be [[G1512]] that [[G686]] the dead [[G3498]] rise [[G1453]] not. [[G3756]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the dead [[G3498]] rise [[G1453]] not, [[G3756]] then not [[G3761]] is [[G1453]] Christ [[G5547]] raised: [[G1453]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] not [[G3756]] be [[G1453]] raised, [[G1453]] your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] vain; [[G3152]] ye are [[G2075]] yet [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] sins. [[G266]]

### 18
Then [[G686]] they [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] which are fallen asleep [[G2837]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] are perished. [[G622]]

### 19
If [[G1487]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] life [[G2222]] only [[G3440]] we have [[G2070]] hope [[G1679]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] we are [[G2070]] of all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] most miserable. [[G1652]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] is Christ [[G5547]] risen [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] become [[G1096]] the firstfruits [[G536]] them [[G3588]] of that [[G2837]] slept. [[G2837]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] since [[G1894]] by [[G1223]] man [[G444]] death, [[G2288]] by [[G1223]] man [[G444]] also [[G2532]] the resurrection [[G386]] of the dead. [[G3498]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] in [[G1722]] Adam [[G76]] all [[G3956]] die, [[G599]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] all [[G3956]] shall be made [[G2227]] alive. [[G2227]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] every man [[G1538]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G2398]] order: [[G5001]] Christ [[G5547]] the firstfruits; [[G536]] afterward [[G1899]] they that [[G3588]] are Christ's [[G5547]] at [[G1722]] his [[G846]] coming. [[G3952]]

### 24
Then [[G1534]] the [[G3588]] end, [[G5056]] when [[G3752]] he shall have delivered up [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] to [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] even [[G2532]] the Father; [[G3962]] when [[G3752]] he shall have put down [[G2673]] all [[G3956]] rule [[G746]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] authority [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] power. [[G1411]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] reign, [[G936]] till [[G891]] he [[G3739]] hath put [[G5087]] all [[G3956]] enemies [[G2190]] under [[G5259]] his [[G846]] feet. [[G4228]]

### 26
The last [[G2078]] enemy [[G2190]] shall be destroyed [[G2673]] death. [[G2288]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] he hath put [[G5293]] all things [[G3956]] under [[G5259]] his [[G846]] feet. [[G4228]] But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] he saith [[G2036]] all things [[G3956]] are put under [[G5293]] manifest [[G1212]] that [[G3754]] he is excepted, [[G1622]] which [[G3588]] did put [[G5293]] all things [[G3956]] under [[G5293]] him. [[G846]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] all things [[G3956]] shall be subdued [[G5293]] unto him, [[G846]] then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] shall be [[G5293]] Son [[G5207]] also [[G2532]] himself [[G846]] subject [[G5293]] him [[G3588]] unto things [[G3956]] that put [[G5293]] all [[G3956]] under [[G5293]] him, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] God may [[G2316]] be [[G5600]] all [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] all. [[G3956]]

### 29
Else [[G1893]] what [[G5101]] shall they do [[G4160]] which [[G3588]] are baptized [[G907]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] if [[G1487]] the dead [[G3498]] rise [[G1453]] not [[G3756]] at all? [[G3654]] why [[G5101]] then [[G2532]] are they [[G907]] baptized [[G907]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] dead? [[G3498]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] why [[G5101]] we [[G2249]] stand in [[G2793]] jeopardy [[G2793]] every [[G3956]] hour? [[G5610]]

### 31
I protest by [[G3513]] your [[G2251]] rejoicing [[G2746]] which [[G3739]] I have [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G2257]] Lord, [[G2962]] I die [[G599]] daily. [[G2596]]

### 32
If [[G1487]] after the manner [[G2596]] of men [[G444]] I have fought with beasts [[G2341]] at [[G1722]] Ephesus, [[G2181]] what [[G5101]] advantageth [[G3786]] it [[G3588]] me, [[G3427]] if [[G1487]] the dead [[G3498]] rise [[G1453]] not? [[G3756]] let us eat [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drink; [[G4095]] for [[G1063]] to morrow [[G839]] we die. [[G599]]

### 33
not [[G3361]] Be [[G4105]] deceived: [[G4105]] evil [[G2556]] communications [[G3657]] corrupt [[G5351]] good [[G5543]] manners. [[G2239]]

### 34
Awake [[G1594]] to righteousness, [[G1346]] and [[G2532]] sin [[G264]] not; [[G3361]] for [[G1063]] some [[G5100]] have [[G2192]] not the knowledge [[G56]] of God: [[G2316]] I speak [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] your [[G5213]] shame. [[G1791]]

### 35
But [[G235]] some [[G5100]] will say, [[G2046]] How [[G4459]] are up? [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] raised [[G1453]] and [[G1161]] with what [[G4169]] body [[G4983]] do they come? [[G2064]]

### 36
fool, [[G878]] that which [[G3739]] thou [[G4771]] sowest [[G4687]] not [[G3756]] is [[G2227]] quickened, [[G2227]] except [[G1437]] it die: [[G599]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] that [[G1487]] which [[G3739]] thou sowest, [[G4687]] thou sowest [[G4687]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] that [[G3588]] shall be, [[G1096]] but [[G235]] bare [[G1131]] grain, [[G2848]] it may chance [[G5177]] of wheat, [[G4621]] or [[G2228]] of some [[G5100]] other [[G3062]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] giveth [[G1325]] it [[G846]] a body [[G4983]] as [[G2531]] it hath pleased him, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] to every [[G1538]] seed [[G3588]]  his [[G4690]] own [[G2398]] body. [[G4983]]

### 39
All [[G3956]] flesh [[G4561]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] flesh: [[G4561]] but [[G235]] one [[G243]] flesh [[G4561]] of men, [[G444]] another [[G243]] flesh [[G4561]] of beasts, [[G2934]] another [[G243]] of fishes, [[G2486]] another [[G243]] of birds. [[G4421]]

### 40
also [[G2532]] celestial [[G2032]] bodies, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] bodies [[G4983]] terrestrial: [[G1919]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2032]] celestial [[G2032]] one, [[G2087]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1919]] terrestrial [[G1919]] another. [[G2087]]

### 41
one [[G243]] glory [[G1391]] of the sun, [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] glory [[G1391]] of the moon, [[G4582]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] glory [[G1391]] of the stars: [[G792]] for [[G1063]] star [[G792]] differeth from [[G1308]] star [[G792]] in [[G1722]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 42
So [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] resurrection of [[G386]] the [[G3588]] dead. [[G3498]] It is sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] corruption; [[G5356]] it is raised [[G1453]] in [[G1722]] incorruption: [[G861]]

### 43
It is sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] dishonour; [[G819]] it is raised [[G1453]] in [[G1722]] glory: [[G1391]] it is sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] weakness; [[G769]] it is raised [[G1453]] in [[G1722]] power: [[G1411]]

### 44
It is sown [[G4687]] a natural [[G5591]] body; [[G4983]] it is raised [[G1453]] a spiritual [[G4152]] body. [[G4983]] There is [[G2076]] a natural [[G5591]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G2076]] a spiritual [[G4152]] body. [[G4983]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] it is written, [[G1125]] The [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] man [[G444]] Adam [[G76]] was made [[G1096]] a living [[G2198]] soul; [[G5590]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] Adam [[G76]] a quickening [[G2227]] spirit. [[G4151]]

### 46
Howbeit that [[G235]] not [[G3756]] first [[G4412]] which [[G3588]] is spiritual, [[G4152]] but [[G235]] that which [[G3588]] is natural; [[G5591]] and afterward [[G1899]] that which [[G3588]] is spiritual. [[G4152]]

### 47
The [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] man [[G444]] of [[G1537]] the earth, [[G1093]] earthy: [[G5517]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] man [[G444]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 48
As [[G3634]] the [[G3588]] earthy, [[G5517]] such [[G5108]] they [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] that are earthy: [[G5517]] and [[G2532]] as [[G3634]] the [[G3588]] heavenly, [[G2032]] such [[G5108]] they [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] that are heavenly. [[G2032]]

### 49
And [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] we have borne [[G5409]] the [[G3588]] image of [[G1504]] the [[G3588]] earthy, [[G5517]] we shall [[G5409]] also [[G2532]] bear [[G5409]] the [[G3588]] image of [[G1504]] the [[G3588]] heavenly. [[G2032]]

### 50
Now [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] I say, [[G5346]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood [[G129]] cannot [[G1410]] inherit [[G2816]] the kingdom [[G932]] of God; [[G2316]] neither [[G3761]] doth [[G2816]] corruption [[G5356]] inherit [[G2816]] incorruption. [[G861]]

### 51
Behold, [[G2400]] I shew [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] a mystery; [[G3466]] We shall [[G2837]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] sleep, [[G2837]] but [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] we shall be [[G236]] changed, [[G236]]

### 52
In [[G1722]] a moment, [[G823]] in [[G1722]] the twinkling [[G4493]] of an eye, [[G3788]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] trump: [[G4536]] for [[G1063]] the trumpet shall sound, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] shall be raised [[G1453]] incorruptible, [[G862]] and [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] shall be changed. [[G236]]

### 53
For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] corruptible [[G5349]] must [[G1163]] put on [[G1746]] incorruption, [[G861]] and [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] mortal [[G2349]] put on [[G1746]] immortality. [[G110]]

### 54
So [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] this [[G5124]] corruptible [[G5349]] shall have put on [[G1746]] incorruption, [[G861]] and [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] mortal [[G2349]] shall have put on [[G1746]] immortality, [[G110]] then [[G5119]] shall be brought to pass [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] that [[G3588]] is written, [[G1125]] Death [[G2288]] is swallowed up [[G2666]] in [[G1519]] victory. [[G3534]]

### 55
O death, [[G2288]] where [[G4226]] thy [[G4675]] sting? [[G2759]] O grave, [[G86]] where [[G4226]] thy [[G4675]] victory? [[G3534]]

### 56
The [[G3588]] sting [[G2759]] of [[G2288]] death [[G2288]] sin; [[G266]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] strength [[G1411]] of [[G266]] sin [[G266]] the [[G3588]] law. [[G3551]]

### 57
But [[G1161]] thanks [[G5485]] to God, [[G2316]] which giveth [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] victory [[G3534]] through [[G1223]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 58
Therefore, [[G5620]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] brethren, [[G80]] be ye [[G1096]] stedfast, [[G1476]] unmoveable, [[G277]] always [[G3842]] abounding [[G4052]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] forasmuch as ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] your [[G5216]] labour [[G2873]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] in vain [[G2756]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]
