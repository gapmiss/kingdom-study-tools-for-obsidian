### 1
Dare [[G5111]] any [[G5100]] of you, [[G5216]] having [[G2192]] a matter [[G4229]] against [[G4314]] another, [[G2087]] go to law [[G2919]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] unjust, [[G94]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3780]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] saints? [[G40]]

### 2
not [[G3756]] Do ye [[G1492]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] shall judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world? [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] world shall be [[G2889]] judged [[G2919]] by [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] are ye [[G2075]] unworthy [[G370]] to judge [[G2922]] the smallest matters? [[G1646]]

### 3
Know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] we shall judge [[G2919]] angels? [[G32]] how much [[G3385]] more [[G1065]] things that pertain to this life? [[G982]]

### 4
If [[G1437]] then [[G3767]] ye have [[G2192]] judgments [[G2922]] of things pertaining to this life, [[G982]] set [[G2523]] them [[G5128]] to judge who are least esteemed [[G1848]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]]

### 5
I speak [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] your [[G5213]] shame. [[G1791]] Is it so, [[G3779]] that there is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] a wise man [[G4680]] among [[G1722]] you? [[G5213]] no, not [[G3761]] one [[G1520]] that [[G3739]] shall be able [[G1410]] to judge [[G1252]] between [[G303]] his [[G846]] brethren? [[G80]]

### 6
But [[G235]] brother [[G80]] goeth to law [[G2919]] with [[G3326]] brother, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] that [[G5124]] before [[G1909]] the unbelievers. [[G571]]

### 7
Now [[G2235]] therefore [[G3767]] there is [[G2076]] utterly [[G3654]] a fault [[G2275]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] because [[G3754]] to law [[G2917]] ye go one [[G2192]] with [[G3326]] another. [[G1438]] Why [[G1302]] not [[G3780]] do ye take [[G91]] rather [[G3123]] wrong? [[G91]] why [[G1302]] not [[G3780]] do ye be [[G650]] rather [[G3123]] defrauded? [[G650]]

### 8
Nay, [[G235]] ye [[G5210]] do wrong, [[G91]] and [[G2532]] defraud, [[G650]] and [[G2532]] that [[G5023]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 9
Know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] the unrighteous [[G94]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2816]] inherit [[G2816]] the kingdom [[G932]] of God? [[G2316]] not [[G3361]] Be [[G4105]] deceived: [[G4105]] neither [[G3777]] fornicators, [[G4205]] nor [[G3777]] idolaters, [[G1496]] nor [[G3777]] adulterers, [[G3432]] nor [[G3777]] effeminate, [[G3120]] nor [[G3777]] abusers of themselves with mankind, [[G733]]

### 10
Nor [[G3777]] thieves, [[G2812]] nor [[G3777]] covetous, [[G4123]] nor [[G3777]] drunkards, [[G3183]] nor [[G3756]] revilers, [[G3060]] nor [[G3756]] extortioners, [[G727]] shall [[G3756]] inherit [[G2816]] the kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] such [[G5023]] were [[G2258]] some of you: [[G5100]] but [[G235]] ye are washed, [[G628]] but [[G235]] ye are sanctified, [[G37]] but [[G235]] ye are justified [[G1344]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of our [[G2257]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
All things [[G3956]] are lawful [[G1832]] unto me, [[G3427]] but [[G235]] all things [[G3956]] not [[G3756]] are [[G4851]] expedient: [[G4851]] all things [[G3956]] are lawful [[G1832]] for me, [[G3427]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] not [[G3756]] will be brought under the [[G1850]] power [[G1850]] of [[G5259]] any. [[G5100]]

### 13
Meats [[G1033]] the [[G3588]] for [[G2836]] belly, [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] belly [[G2836]]  for [[G3588]] meats: [[G1033]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] shall destroy [[G2673]] both [[G2532]] it [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] them. [[G5023]] the [[G3588]] Now [[G1161]] body [[G4983]] not [[G3756]] for [[G4202]] fornication, [[G4202]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] for [[G2962]] Lord; [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] for [[G4983]] body. [[G4983]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] both [[G2532]] hath up [[G1453]] raised [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] will also raise up [[G1825]] us [[G2248]] by [[G1223]] his own [[G846]] power. [[G1411]]

### 15
Know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] your [[G5216]] bodies [[G4983]] are [[G2076]] the members [[G3196]] of Christ? [[G5547]] shall I [[G142]] then [[G3767]] take [[G142]] the [[G3588]] members [[G3196]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] and make [[G4160]] the members [[G3196]] of an harlot? [[G4204]] God [[G3361]] forbid. [[G1096]]

### 16
What? [[G2228]] know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] he which [[G3588]] is joined [[G2853]]  to an [[G3588]] harlot [[G4204]] is [[G2076]] one [[G1520]] body? [[G4983]] for [[G1063]] two, [[G1417]] saith he, [[G5346]] shall be [[G2071]] one [[G1520]] flesh. [[G4561]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] is joined [[G2853]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G2076]] one [[G1520]] spirit. [[G4151]]

### 18
Flee [[G5343]] fornication. [[G4202]] Every [[G3956]] sin [[G265]] that [[G3739]] a man [[G444]] doeth [[G4160]] is [[G2076]] without [[G1622]] the [[G3588]] body; [[G4983]] but [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] committeth fornication [[G4203]] sinneth [[G264]] against [[G1519]] his own [[G2398]] body. [[G4983]]

### 19
What? [[G2228]] know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] your [[G5216]] body [[G4983]] is [[G2076]] the temple [[G3485]] the [[G3588]] of [[G40]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] which [[G3739]] ye have [[G2192]] of [[G575]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] ye are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] your own? [[G1438]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] ye are bought [[G59]] with a price: [[G5092]] therefore [[G1211]] glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] spirit, [[G4151]] which [[G3748]] are [[G2076]] God's. [[G2316]]
