### 1
It is reported [[G191]] commonly [[G3654]] fornication [[G4202]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] such [[G5108]] fornication [[G4202]] as [[G3748]] not so much as [[G3761]] is [[G3687]] named [[G3687]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] that [[G5620]] one [[G5100]] should have [[G2192]] his [[G3588]] father's [[G3962]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] puffed up, [[G5448]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3780]] have [[G3996]] rather [[G3123]] mourned, [[G3996]] that [[G2443]] he that hath done [[G4160]] this [[G5124]] deed might be taken [[G2041]] away [[G1808]] from [[G1537]] among [[G3319]] you. [[G5216]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] verily, [[G3303]] as [[G5613]] absent [[G548]]  in [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] but [[G1161]] present [[G3918]]  in [[G3588]] spirit, [[G4151]] have judged [[G2919]] already, [[G2235]] as though [[G5613]] I were present, [[G3918]] him that [[G3588]] so [[G3779]] hath deed, [[G2716]] done [[G2716]] this [[G5124]]

### 4
In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] when are gathered [[G4863]] ye [[G5216]] together, [[G4863]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1700]] spirit, [[G4151]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

### 5
To deliver [[G3860]] such an one [[G5108]] unto [[G4567]] Satan [[G4567]] for [[G1519]] the destruction [[G3639]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh, [[G4561]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] may be saved [[G4982]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 6
Your [[G5216]] glorying [[G2745]] not [[G3756]] good. [[G2570]] Know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] a little [[G3398]] leaven [[G2219]] leaveneth [[G2220]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] lump? [[G5445]]

### 7
Purge out [[G1571]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] leaven, [[G2219]] that [[G2443]] ye may be [[G5600]] a new [[G3501]] lump, [[G5445]] as [[G2531]] ye are [[G2075]] unleavened. [[G106]] For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] passover [[G3957]] is sacrificed [[G2380]] for [[G5228]] us: [[G2257]]

### 8
Therefore [[G5620]] let us keep the feast, [[G1858]] not [[G3361]] with [[G1722]] old [[G3820]] leaven, [[G2219]] neither [[G3366]] with [[G1722]] the leaven [[G2219]] of malice [[G2549]] and [[G2532]] wickedness; [[G4189]] but [[G235]] with [[G1722]] the unleavened [[G106]] of sincerity [[G1505]] and [[G2532]] truth. [[G225]]

### 9
I wrote [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]]  an [[G3588]] epistle [[G1992]] not [[G3361]] to company [[G4874]] with [[G4205]] fornicators: [[G4205]]

### 10
Yet [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] altogether [[G3843]] with the [[G3588]] fornicators [[G4205]] of this [[G5127]] world, [[G2889]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] with [[G4123]] covetous, [[G4123]] or [[G2228]] extortioners, [[G727]] or [[G2228]] with idolaters; [[G1496]] for [[G1893]] then [[G686]] must ye needs [[G3784]] go out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] I have written [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] not [[G3361]] to keep company, [[G4874]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] that is called [[G3687]] a brother [[G80]]  be [[G2228]] a fornicator, [[G4205]] or [[G2228]] covetous, [[G4123]] or [[G2228]] an idolater, [[G1496]] or [[G2228]] a railer, [[G3060]] or [[G2228]] a drunkard, [[G3183]] or [[G2228]] an extortioner; [[G727]] with such an one [[G5108]] no not [[G3366]] to eat. [[G4906]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]]  have I to do to [[G3427]] judge [[G2919]] them [[G3588]] also that are [[G2532]] without? [[G1854]] not [[G3780]] do [[G2919]] ye [[G5210]] judge [[G2919]]  them that [[G3588]] are [[G2080]] within? [[G2080]]

### 13
But [[G1161]]  them that [[G3588]] are [[G1854]] without [[G1854]] God [[G2316]] judgeth. [[G2919]] Therefore [[G2532]] put away [[G1808]] from [[G1537]] among yourselves [[G5216]] that [[G846]] wicked person. [[G4190]]
