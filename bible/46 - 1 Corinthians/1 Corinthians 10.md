### 1
Moreover, [[G1161]] brethren, [[G80]] I would [[G2309]] not that [[G3756]] ye [[G5209]] should be ignorant, [[G50]] how that [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] were [[G2258]] under [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] cloud, [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] passed [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] were [[G907]] baptized [[G907]] unto [[G1519]] Moses [[G3475]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] did [[G5315]] eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] spiritual [[G4152]] meat; [[G1033]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] did [[G4095]] drink [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] spiritual [[G4152]] drink: [[G4188]] for [[G1063]] they drank [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] that spiritual [[G4152]] Rock [[G4073]] that followed them: [[G190]] and [[G1161]] that Rock [[G4073]] was [[G2258]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 5
But [[G235]] with [[G1722]] many [[G4119]] of them [[G846]] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] was well [[G2106]] pleased: [[G2106]] for [[G1063]] they were overthrown [[G2693]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]]

### 6
Now [[G1161]] these things [[G5023]] were [[G1096]] our [[G2257]] examples, [[G5179]] to the intent [[G1519]] we [[G2248]] should evil [[G1511]] not [[G3361]] lust after [[G1938]] things, [[G2556]] as [[G2531]] they also [[G2548]] lusted. [[G1937]]

### 7
Neither [[G3366]] be ye [[G1096]] idolaters, [[G1496]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] of them; [[G846]] as [[G5613]] it is written, [[G1125]] The [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] sat down [[G2523]] to eat [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drink, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] rose up [[G450]] to play. [[G3815]]

### 8
Neither [[G3366]] let us commit fornication, [[G4203]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] committed, [[G4203]] and [[G2532]] fell [[G4098]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] three [[G5140]] and twenty [[G1501]] thousand. [[G5505]]

### 9
Neither [[G3366]] let us tempt [[G1598]] Christ, [[G5547]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] also [[G2532]] tempted, [[G3985]] and [[G2532]] were destroyed [[G622]] of [[G3789]] serpents. [[G3789]]

### 10
Neither [[G3366]] murmur ye, [[G1111]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] also [[G2532]] murmured, [[G1111]] and [[G2532]] were destroyed [[G622]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] destroyer. [[G3644]]

### 11
Now [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] happened [[G4819]] unto them [[G1565]] for ensamples: [[G5179]] and [[G1161]] they are written [[G1125]] for [[G4314]] our [[G2257]] admonition, [[G3559]] upon [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] ends [[G5056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G165]] world [[G165]] are come. [[G2658]]

### 12
Wherefore [[G5620]] him [[G3588]] let that [[G1380]] thinketh [[G1380]] he standeth [[G2476]] take heed [[G991]] lest [[G3361]] he fall. [[G4098]]

### 13
no [[G3756]] There hath [[G2983]] temptation [[G3986]] taken [[G2983]] you [[G5209]] but [[G1487]] such as is common to man: [[G442]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] faithful, [[G4103]] who [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] will [[G1439]] suffer [[G1439]] you [[G5209]] to be tempted [[G3985]] above [[G5228]] that [[G3739]] ye are able; [[G1410]] but [[G235]] will [[G4160]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] temptation [[G3986]] also [[G2532]] make [[G4160]]  a way [[G3588]] to [[G1545]] escape, [[G1545]] that ye [[G5209]] may be able [[G1410]] to bear [[G5297]]

### 14
Wherefore, [[G1355]] my [[G3450]] dearly beloved, [[G27]] flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] idolatry. [[G1495]]

### 15
I speak [[G3004]] as [[G5613]] to wise men; [[G5429]] judge [[G2919]] ye [[G5210]] what [[G3739]] I say. [[G5346]]

### 16
The [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] of [[G2129]] blessing [[G2129]] which [[G3739]] we bless, [[G2127]] is it [[G2076]] not [[G3780]] the communion [[G2842]] the [[G3588]] of [[G129]] blood [[G129]] of [[G5547]] Christ? [[G5547]] The [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] which [[G3739]] we break, [[G2806]] is it [[G2076]] not [[G3780]] the communion [[G2842]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4983]] body [[G4983]] of [[G5547]] Christ? [[G5547]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] we [[G2070]] many [[G4183]] are [[G2070]] one [[G1520]] bread, [[G740]] one [[G1520]] body: [[G4983]] for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] we are [[G3348]] partakers [[G3348]] of [[G1537]] that one [[G1520]] bread. [[G740]]

### 18
Behold [[G991]] Israel [[G2474]] after [[G2596]] the flesh: [[G4561]] are [[G1526]] not [[G3780]] they [[G3588]] which eat [[G2068]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2378]] sacrifices [[G2378]] partakers [[G2844]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2379]] altar? [[G2379]]

### 19
What [[G5101]] say I [[G5346]] then? [[G3767]] that [[G3754]] the idol [[G1497]] is [[G2076]] any thing, [[G5100]] or [[G2228]] that which is offered in sacrifice to idols [[G1494]] is [[G2076]] any thing? [[G5100]]

### 20
But [[G235]] that [[G3754]] the things [[G3588]] which [[G3739]] the with [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] sacrifice, [[G2380]] they sacrifice [[G2380]] to devils, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] to God: [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] I would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] ye [[G5209]] that should [[G1096]] have [[G1096]] fellowship [[G2844]] devils. [[G1140]]

### 21
Ye [[G3756]] cannot [[G1410]] drink [[G4095]] the cup [[G4221]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] the cup [[G4221]] of devils: [[G1140]] ye be [[G3756]] cannot [[G1410]] partakers [[G3348]] of the Lord's [[G2962]] table, [[G5132]] and [[G2532]] of the table [[G5132]] of devils. [[G1140]]

### 22
Do we provoke Lord to jealousy? [[G3863]] the [[G3588]] are we [[G2070]] stronger [[G2478]] than he? [[G846]]

### 23
All things [[G3956]] are lawful [[G1832]] for me, [[G3427]] but [[G235]] all things [[G3956]] not [[G3756]] are [[G4851]] expedient: [[G4851]] all things [[G3956]] are lawful [[G1832]] for me, [[G3427]] but [[G235]] all things [[G3956]] edify [[G3618]] not. [[G3756]]

### 24
Let no man [[G3367]] seek [[G2212]] his own, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] every man [[G1538]] another's [[G2087]]

### 25
Whatsoever [[G3956]] is sold [[G4453]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] shambles, [[G3111]] eat, [[G2068]] asking question [[G350]] no [[G3367]] for [[G1223]] conscience sake: [[G4893]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] Lord's, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fulness [[G4138]] thereof. [[G846]]

### 27
If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] them [[G3588]] of that believe [[G571]] not [[G571]] bid [[G2564]] you [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] ye be disposed [[G2309]] to go; [[G4198]] whatsoever [[G3956]] is set before [[G3908]] you, [[G5213]] eat, [[G2068]] asking question [[G350]] no [[G3367]] for [[G1223]]  conscience sake. [[G3588]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] say [[G2036]] unto you, [[G5213]] This [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] offered in sacrifice unto idols, [[G1494]] eat [[G2068]] not [[G3361]] for [[G1223]] his sake that [[G1565]] shewed it, [[G3377]] and [[G2532]]  for sake: [[G3588]] conscience [[G4893]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] Lord's, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fulness [[G4138]] thereof: [[G846]]

### 29
Conscience, [[G4893]] I say, [[G3004]] not [[G3780]] thine own, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] of [[G2087]] the [[G3588]] other: [[G2087]] for [[G1063]] why [[G2444]] my [[G3450]] is [[G2919]] liberty [[G1657]] judged [[G2919]] of [[G5259]] another [[G243]] conscience? [[G4893]]

### 30
For [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] by grace [[G5485]] be a partaker, [[G3348]] why [[G5101]] am I evil spoken of [[G987]] for [[G5228]] that for which [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] give thanks? [[G2168]]

### 31
Whether [[G1535]] therefore [[G3767]] ye eat, [[G2068]] or [[G1535]] drink, [[G4095]] or [[G1535]] whatsoever [[G5100]] ye do, [[G4160]] do [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] to [[G1519]] the [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 32
Give [[G1096]] none offence, [[G677]] neither [[G2532]] to the Jews, [[G2453]] nor [[G2532]] to the Gentiles, [[G1672]] nor [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1577]] church [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]]

### 33
Even as [[G2531]] I [[G2504]] please [[G700]] all [[G3956]] in all [[G3956]] not [[G3361]] seeking [[G2212]] mine own [[G1683]] profit, [[G4851]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] of many, [[G4183]] that [[G2443]] they may be saved. [[G4982]]
