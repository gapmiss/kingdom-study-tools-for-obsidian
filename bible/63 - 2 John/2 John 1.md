### 1
The [[G3588]] elder [[G4245]] unto the elect [[G1588]] lady [[G2959]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] children, [[G5043]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] love [[G25]] in [[G1722]] the truth; [[G225]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] I [[G1473]] only, [[G3441]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] they that have known [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] truth; [[G225]]

### 2
For [[G1223]]  the [[G3588]] truth's sake, [[G225]] which [[G3588]] dwelleth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] shall be [[G2071]] with [[G3326]] us [[G2257]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 3
Grace [[G5485]] be [[G2071]] with [[G3326]] you, [[G5216]] mercy, [[G1656]] peace, [[G1515]] from [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] the Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] from [[G3844]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3962]] Father, [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] truth [[G225]] and [[G2532]] love. [[G26]]

### 4
I rejoiced [[G5463]] greatly [[G3029]] that [[G3754]] I found [[G2147]] of [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] children [[G5043]] walking [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] truth, [[G225]] as [[G2531]] we have received [[G2983]] a commandment [[G1785]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I beseech [[G2065]] thee, [[G4571]] lady, [[G2959]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] though I [[G1125]] wrote [[G1125]] a new [[G2537]] commandment [[G1785]] unto thee, [[G4671]] but [[G235]] that that [[G2443]] which [[G3739]] we had [[G2192]] from [[G575]] the beginning, [[G746]] we love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] love, [[G26]] that [[G2443]] we walk [[G4043]] after [[G2596]] his [[G846]] commandments. [[G1785]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] commandment, [[G1785]] That, [[G2443]] as [[G2531]] ye have heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] the beginning, [[G746]] ye should walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] it. [[G846]]

### 7
For [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] deceivers [[G4108]] are entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] who confess [[G3670]] not [[G3361]] that Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] is come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the flesh. [[G4561]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] a [[G3588]] deceiver [[G4108]] and [[G2532]]  an [[G3588]] antichrist. [[G500]]

### 8
Look to [[G991]] yourselves, [[G1438]] that [[G2443]] we lose [[G622]] not [[G3361]] those things which [[G3739]] we have wrought, [[G2038]] but that [[G235]] we receive [[G618]] a [[G3408]] full [[G4134]] reward. [[G3408]]

### 9
Whosoever [[G3956]] transgresseth, [[G3845]] and [[G2532]] abideth [[G3306]] not [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] doctrine [[G1322]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] hath [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] God. [[G2316]] He [[G3588]] that abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] doctrine [[G1322]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] he [[G3778]] hath [[G2192]] both [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son. [[G5207]]

### 10
If [[G1487]] there come [[G2064]] any [[G5100]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] bring [[G5342]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] doctrine, [[G1322]] receive [[G2983]] him [[G846]] not [[G3361]] into [[G1519]] house, [[G3614]] neither [[G3361]] bid [[G3004]] him [[G846]] God speed: [[G5463]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] he that biddeth [[G3004]] him [[G846]] God speed [[G5463]] is partaker [[G2841]] of [[G2041]] his [[G846]] evil [[G4190]] deeds. [[G2041]]

### 12
Having [[G2192]] many [[G4183]] things to [[G1125]] write [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] I would [[G1014]] not [[G3756]] with [[G1223]] paper [[G5489]] and [[G2532]] ink: [[G3188]] but [[G235]] I trust [[G1679]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] speak [[G2980]] face [[G4750]] to [[G4314]] face, [[G4750]] that [[G2443]] our [[G2257]] joy may [[G5479]] be [[G5600]] full. [[G4137]]

### 13
The [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of [[G79]] thy [[G4675]] elect [[G1588]] sister [[G79]] greet [[G782]] thee. [[G4571]] Amen. [[G281]]
