The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Hosea, [[H1954]] the son [[H1121]] of Beeri, [[H882]] in the days [[H3117]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] Jotham, [[H3147]] Ahaz, [[H271]] Hezekiah, [[H3169]] kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the days [[H3117]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash, [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
The beginning [[H8462]] of the word [[H1696]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by Hosea. [[H1954]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hosea, [[H1954]] Go, [[H1980]] take [[H3947]] unto thee a wife [[H802]] of whoredoms [[H2183]] and children [[H3206]] of whoredoms: [[H2183]] for [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] hath committed great [[H2181]] whoredom, [[H2181]] from [[H310]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
So he went [[H1980]] and took [[H3947]] Gomer [[H1586]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Diblaim; [[H1691]] which conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] him a son. [[H1121]]

### 4
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Call [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Jezreel; [[H3157]] for [[H3588]] yet [[H5750]] a little [[H4592]] and I will avenge [[H6485]] the blood [[H1818]] of Jezreel [[H3157]] upon [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Jehu, [[H3058]] and will cause to cease [[H7673]] the kingdom [[H4468]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] that I will break [[H7665]] the bow [[H7198]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 6
And she conceived [[H2029]] again, [[H5750]] and bare [[H3205]] a daughter. [[H1323]] And said [[H559]] unto him, Call [[H7121]] her name [[H8034]] Lo-ruhamah: [[H3819]] for [[H3588]] I will no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] have mercy upon [[H7355]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] but [[H3588]] I will utterly [[H5375]] take them away. [[H5375]]

### 7
But I will have mercy upon [[H7355]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and will save [[H3467]] them by the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and will not [[H3808]] save [[H3467]] them by bow, [[H7198]] nor by sword, [[H2719]] nor by battle, [[H4421]] by horses, [[H5483]] nor by horsemen. [[H6571]]

### 8
Now when she had weaned [[H1580]] Lo-ruhamah, [[H3819]] she conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 9
Then said [[H559]] Call [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Lo-ammi: [[H3818]] for [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] not [[H3808]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] your [[H1961]]

### 10
Yet the number [[H4557]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall be [[H1961]] as the sand [[H2344]] of the sea, [[H3220]] which [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be measured [[H4058]] nor [[H3808]] numbered; [[H5608]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] it was said [[H559]] unto them, Ye [[H859]] not [[H3808]] my people, [[H5971]] it shall be said [[H559]] unto them, the sons [[H1121]] of the living [[H2416]] God. [[H410]]

### 11
Then shall the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] be gathered [[H6908]] together, [[H3162]] and appoint [[H7760]] themselves one [[H259]] head, [[H7218]] and they shall come up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] the day [[H3117]] of Jezreel.
