[[Hosea 7|←]] • [[Hosea 9|→]]

### 1
the trumpet [[H7782]] to [[H413]] thy mouth. [[H2441]] as an eagle [[H5404]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3282]] they have transgressed [[H5674]] my covenant, [[H1285]] and trespassed [[H6586]] against [[H5921]] my law. [[H8451]]

### 2
Israel [[H3478]] shall cry [[H2199]] unto me, My God, [[H430]] we know [[H3045]] thee. [[H3045]]

### 3
Israel [[H3478]] hath cast off [[H2186]] good: [[H2896]] the enemy [[H341]] shall pursue [[H7291]] him. [[H7291]]

### 4
They [[H1992]] have set up kings, [[H4427]] but not [[H3808]] by [[H4480]] me: they have made princes, [[H8323]] and I knew [[H3045]] not: [[H3808]] of their silver [[H3701]] and their gold [[H2091]] have they made [[H6213]] them idols, [[H6091]] that [[H4616]] they may be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 5
Thy calf, [[H5695]] O Samaria, [[H8111]] hath cast [[H2186]] off; mine anger [[H639]] is kindled [[H2734]] against them: how long [[H5704]] ere [[H3808]] they attain [[H3201]] to innocency? [[H5356]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] from Israel [[H3478]] it [[H1931]] also: the workman [[H2796]] made [[H6213]] it; [[H1931]] therefore it not [[H3808]] God: [[H430]] but [[H3588]] the calf [[H5695]] of Samaria [[H8111]] shall be [[H1961]] broken in pieces. [[H7616]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] they have sown [[H2232]] the wind, [[H7307]] and they shall reap [[H7114]] the whirlwind: [[H5492]] it hath no [[H369]] stalk: [[H7054]] the bud [[H6780]] shall yield [[H6213]] no [[H1097]] meal: [[H7058]] if [[H194]] so be it yield, [[H6213]] the strangers [[H2114]] shall swallow it up. [[H1104]]

### 8
Israel [[H3478]] is swallowed up: [[H1104]] now [[H6258]] shall they be [[H1961]] among the Gentiles [[H1471]] as a vessel [[H3627]] wherein no [[H369]] pleasure. [[H2656]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are gone up [[H5927]] to Assyria, [[H804]] a wild ass [[H6501]] alone [[H909]] by himself: Ephraim [[H669]] hath hired [[H8566]] lovers. [[H158]]

### 10
Yea, [[H1571]] though [[H3588]] they have hired [[H8566]] among the nations, [[H1471]] now [[H6258]] will I gather [[H6908]] them, and they shall sorrow [[H2490]] a little [[H4592]] for the burden [[H4853]] of the king [[H4428]] of princes. [[H8269]]

### 11
Because [[H3588]] Ephraim [[H669]] hath made many [[H7235]] altars [[H4196]] to sin, [[H2398]] altars [[H4196]] shall be [[H1961]] unto him to sin. [[H2398]]

### 12
I have written [[H3789]] to him the great things [[H7230]] of my law, [[H8451]] they were counted [[H2803]] as [[H3644]] a strange thing. [[H2114]]

### 13
They sacrifice [[H2076]] flesh [[H1320]] the sacrifices [[H2077]] of mine offerings, [[H1890]] and eat [[H398]] the Lord [[H3068]] accepteth [[H7521]] them not; [[H3808]] now [[H6258]] will he remember [[H2142]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] and visit [[H6485]] their sins: [[H2403]] they [[H1992]] shall return [[H7725]] to Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 14
For Israel [[H3478]] hath forgotten [[H7911]] his Maker, [[H6213]] and buildeth [[H1129]] temples; [[H1964]] and Judah [[H3063]] hath multiplied [[H7235]] fenced [[H1219]] cities: [[H5892]] but I will send [[H7971]] a fire [[H784]] upon his cities, [[H5892]] and it shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] thereof.
