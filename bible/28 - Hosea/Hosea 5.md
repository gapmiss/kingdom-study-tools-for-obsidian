[[Hosea 4|←]] • [[Hosea 6|→]]

---

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] ye this, [[H2063]] O priests; [[H3548]] and hearken, [[H7181]] ye house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and give ye ear, [[H238]] O house [[H1004]] of the king; [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] judgment [[H4941]] toward you, because [[H3588]] ye have been [[H1961]] a snare [[H6341]] on Mizpah, [[H4709]] and a net [[H7568]] spread [[H6566]] upon [[H5921]] Tabor. [[H8396]]

### 2
And the revolters [[H7846]] are profound [[H6009]] to make slaughter, [[H7819]] though I [[H589]] a rebuker [[H4148]] of them all. [[H4148]]

### 3
I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and Israel [[H3478]] is not [[H3808]] hid [[H3582]] from [[H4480]] me: for [[H3588]] now, [[H6258]] O Ephraim, [[H669]] thou committest whoredom, [[H2181]] Israel [[H3478]] is defiled. [[H2930]]

### 4
They will not [[H3808]] frame [[H5414]] their doings [[H4611]] to turn [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] their God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of whoredoms [[H2183]] in the midst [[H7130]] of them, and they have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
And the pride [[H1347]] of Israel [[H3478]] doth testify [[H6030]] to his face: [[H6440]] therefore shall Israel [[H3478]] and Ephraim [[H669]] fall [[H3782]] in their iniquity; [[H5771]] Judah [[H3063]] also [[H1571]] shall fall [[H3782]] with [[H5973]] them. [[H5973]]

### 6
They shall go [[H1980]] with their flocks [[H6629]] and with their herds [[H1241]] to seek [[H1245]] the Lord; [[H3068]] but they shall not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] he hath withdrawn [[H2502]] himself from them. [[H2502]]

### 7
They have dealt treacherously [[H898]] against the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] they have begotten [[H3205]] strange [[H2114]] children: [[H1121]] now [[H6258]] shall a month [[H2320]] devour [[H398]] them with [[H854]] their portions. [[H2506]]

### 8
Blow [[H8628]] ye the cornet [[H7782]] in Gibeah, [[H1390]] the trumpet [[H2689]] in Ramah: [[H7414]] cry aloud [[H7321]] Beth-aven, [[H1007]] after [[H310]] thee, O Benjamin. [[H1144]]

### 9
Ephraim [[H669]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate [[H8047]] in the day [[H3117]] of rebuke: [[H8433]] among the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] have I made known [[H3045]] that which shall surely be. [[H539]]

### 10
The princes [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] were [[H1961]] like them that remove [[H5253]] the bound: [[H1366]] I will pour out [[H8210]] my wrath [[H5678]] upon [[H5921]] them like water. [[H4325]]

### 11
Ephraim [[H669]] oppressed [[H6231]] broken [[H7533]] in judgment, [[H4941]] because [[H3588]] he willingly [[H2974]] walked [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the commandment. [[H6673]]

### 12
Therefore I [[H589]] unto Ephraim [[H669]] as a moth, [[H6211]] and to the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] as rottenness. [[H7538]]

### 13
When Ephraim [[H669]] saw [[H7200]] his sickness, [[H2483]] and Judah [[H3063]] his wound, [[H4205]] then went [[H1980]] Ephraim [[H669]] to [[H413]] the Assyrian, [[H804]] and sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Jareb: [[H3377]] yet could [[H3201]] he [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] heal [[H7495]] you, nor [[H3808]] cure [[H1455]] you of your wound. [[H4205]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] unto Ephraim [[H669]] as a lion, [[H7826]] and as a young lion [[H3715]] to the house [[H1004]] of Judah: [[H3063]] I, [[H589]] I, [[H589]] will tear [[H2963]] and go away; [[H1980]] I will take away, [[H5375]] and none [[H369]] shall rescue [[H5337]]

### 15
I will go [[H1980]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] my place, [[H4725]] till [[H5704]] they acknowledge their offence, [[H816]] and seek [[H1245]] my face: [[H6440]] in their affliction [[H6862]] they will seek me early. [[H7836]]
