[[Hosea 9|←]] • [[Hosea 11|→]]

---

### 1
Israel [[H3478]] an empty [[H1238]] vine, [[H1612]] he bringeth forth [[H7737]] fruit [[H6529]] unto himself: according to the multitude [[H7230]] of his fruit [[H6529]] he hath increased [[H7235]] the altars; [[H4196]] according to the goodness [[H2896]] of his land [[H776]] they have made goodly [[H3190]] images. [[H4676]]

### 2
Their heart [[H3820]] is divided; [[H2505]] now [[H6258]] shall they be found faulty: [[H816]] he [[H1931]] shall break down [[H6202]] their altars, [[H4196]] he shall spoil [[H7703]] their images. [[H4676]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] they shall say, [[H559]] We have no [[H369]] king, [[H4428]] because [[H3588]] we feared [[H3372]] not [[H3808]] the Lord; [[H3068]] what [[H4100]] then should a king [[H4428]] do [[H6213]] to us? [[H6213]]

### 4
They have spoken [[H1696]] words, [[H1697]] swearing [[H422]] falsely [[H7723]] in making [[H3772]] a covenant: [[H1285]] thus judgment [[H4941]] springeth up [[H6524]] as hemlock [[H7219]] in [[H5921]] the furrows [[H8525]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 5
The inhabitants [[H7934]] of Samaria [[H8111]] shall fear [[H1481]] because of the calves [[H5697]] of Beth-aven: [[H1007]] for [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] thereof shall mourn [[H56]] over [[H5921]] it, and the priests [[H3649]] thereof rejoiced [[H1523]] on [[H5921]] it, for [[H5921]] the glory [[H3519]] thereof, because [[H3588]] it is departed [[H1540]] from [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]

### 6
It shall be also [[H1571]] carried [[H2986]] unto Assyria [[H804]] a present [[H4503]] to king [[H4428]] Jareb: [[H3377]] Ephraim [[H669]] shall receive [[H3947]] shame, [[H1317]] and Israel [[H3478]] shall be ashamed [[H954]] of his own counsel. [[H6098]]

### 7
Samaria, [[H8111]] her king [[H4428]] is cut off [[H1820]] as the foam [[H7110]] upon [[H6440]] the water. [[H4325]]

### 8
The high places [[H1116]] also of Aven, [[H206]] the sin [[H2403]] of Israel, [[H3478]] shall be destroyed: [[H8045]] the thorn [[H6975]] and the thistle [[H1863]] shall come up [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] their altars; [[H4196]] and they shall say [[H559]] to the mountains, [[H2022]] Cover [[H3680]] us; and to the hills, [[H1389]] Fall [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 9
O Israel, [[H3478]] thou hast sinned [[H2398]] from the days [[H3117]] of Gibeah: [[H1390]] there [[H8033]] they stood: [[H5975]] the battle [[H4421]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] against [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of iniquity [[H5932]] did not [[H3808]] overtake [[H5381]] them. [[H5381]]

### 10
in my desire [[H185]] that I should chastise [[H3256]] them; and the people [[H5971]] shall be gathered [[H622]] against [[H5921]] them, when they shall bind [[H631]] themselves in their two [[H8147]] furrows. [[H5869]]

### 11
And Ephraim [[H669]] an heifer [[H5697]] taught, [[H3925]] loveth [[H157]] to tread out [[H1758]] but I [[H589]] passed over [[H5674]] upon [[H5921]] her fair [[H2898]] neck: [[H6677]] I will make Ephraim [[H669]] to ride; [[H7392]] Judah [[H3063]] shall plow, [[H2790]] Jacob [[H3290]] shall break his clods. [[H7702]]

### 12
Sow [[H2232]] to yourselves in righteousness, [[H6666]] reap [[H7114]] in [[H6310]] mercy; [[H2617]] break up [[H5214]] your fallow ground: [[H5215]] for time [[H6256]] to seek [[H1875]] the Lord, [[H3068]] till [[H5704]] he come [[H935]] and rain [[H3384]] righteousness [[H6664]] upon you. [[H6664]]

### 13
Ye have plowed [[H2790]] wickedness, [[H7562]] ye have reaped [[H7114]] iniquity; [[H5766]] ye have eaten [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of lies: [[H3585]] because [[H3588]] thou didst trust [[H982]] in thy way, [[H1870]] in the multitude [[H7230]] of thy mighty men. [[H1368]]

### 14
Therefore shall a tumult [[H7588]] arise [[H6965]] among thy people, [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] thy fortresses [[H4013]] shall be spoiled, [[H7703]] as Shalman [[H8020]] spoiled [[H7701]] Beth-arbel [[H1009]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle: [[H4421]] the mother [[H517]] was dashed in pieces [[H7376]] upon [[H5921]] children. [[H1121]]

### 15
So [[H3602]] shall Beth-el [[H1008]] do [[H6213]] unto you because [[H6440]] of your great [[H7451]] wickedness: [[H7451]] in a morning [[H7837]] shall the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] utterly [[H1820]] be cut off. [[H1820]]
