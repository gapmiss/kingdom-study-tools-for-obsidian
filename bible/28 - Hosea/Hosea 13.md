[[Hosea 12|←]] • [[Hosea 14|→]]

### 1
When Ephraim [[H669]] spake [[H1696]] trembling, [[H7578]] he [[H1931]] exalted [[H5375]] himself in Israel; [[H3478]] but when he offended [[H816]] in Baal, [[H1168]] he died. [[H4191]]

### 2
And now [[H6258]] they sin [[H2398]] more and more, [[H3254]] and have made [[H6213]] them molten images [[H4541]] of their silver, [[H3701]] idols [[H6091]] according to their own understanding, [[H8394]] all [[H3605]] of it the work [[H4639]] of the craftsmen: [[H2796]] they [[H1992]] say [[H559]] of them, Let the men [[H120]] that sacrifice [[H2076]] kiss [[H5401]] the calves. [[H5695]]

### 3
Therefore [[H3651]] they shall be [[H1961]] as the morning [[H1242]] cloud, [[H6051]] and as the early [[H7925]] dew [[H2919]] that passeth away, [[H1980]] as the chaff [[H4671]] is driven with the whirlwind [[H5590]] out of the floor, [[H1637]] and as the smoke [[H6227]] out of the chimney. [[H699]]

### 4
Yet I [[H595]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and thou shalt know [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] god [[H430]] but me: [[H2108]] for no [[H369]] saviour [[H3467]] beside me. [[H1115]]

### 5
I [[H589]] did know [[H3045]] thee in the wilderness, [[H4057]] in the land [[H776]] of great drought. [[H8514]]

### 6
According to their pasture, [[H4830]] so were they filled; [[H7646]] they were filled, [[H7646]] and their heart [[H3820]] was exalted; [[H7311]] therefore [[H5921]] have they forgotten [[H7911]] me. [[H7911]]

### 7
Therefore I will be [[H1961]] unto them as [[H3644]] a lion: [[H7826]] as a leopard [[H5246]] by [[H5921]] the way [[H1870]] will I observe [[H7789]]

### 8
I will meet [[H6298]] them as a bear [[H1677]] bereaved [[H7909]] and will rend [[H7167]] the caul [[H5458]] of their heart, [[H3820]] and there [[H8033]] will I devour [[H398]] them like a lion: [[H3833]] the wild [[H7704]] beast [[H2416]] shall tear [[H1234]] them. [[H1234]]

### 9
O Israel, [[H3478]] thou hast destroyed [[H7843]] thyself; but [[H3588]] in me thine help. [[H5828]]

### 10
I will be [[H165]] thy king: [[H4428]] where [[H645]] that may save [[H3467]] thee in all [[H3605]] thy cities? [[H5892]] and thy judges [[H8199]] of whom [[H834]] thou saidst, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]] me a king [[H4428]] and princes? [[H8269]]

### 11
I gave [[H5414]] thee a king [[H4428]] in mine anger, [[H639]] and took [[H3947]] away in my wrath. [[H5678]]

### 12
The iniquity [[H5771]] of Ephraim [[H669]] bound up; [[H6887]] his sin [[H2403]] hid. [[H6845]]

### 13
The sorrows [[H2256]] of a travailing woman [[H3205]] shall come [[H935]] upon him: he [[H1931]] an unwise [[H2450]] son; [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] he should not [[H3808]] stay [[H5975]] long [[H6256]] in the breaking forth [[H4866]] of children. [[H1121]]

### 14
I will ransom [[H6299]] them from the power [[H3027]] of the grave; [[H7585]] I will redeem [[H1350]] them from death: [[H4194]] O death, [[H4194]] I will be [[H165]] thy plagues; [[H1698]] O grave, [[H7585]] I will be [[H165]] thy destruction: [[H6987]] repentance [[H5164]] shall be hid [[H5641]] from mine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 15
Though [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] be fruitful [[H6500]] among [[H996]] brethren, [[H251]] an east wind [[H6921]] shall come, [[H935]] the wind [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall come up [[H5927]] from the wilderness, [[H4057]] and his spring [[H4726]] shall become dry, [[H954]] and his fountain [[H4599]] shall be dried up: [[H2717]] he [[H1931]] shall spoil [[H8154]] the treasure [[H214]] of all [[H3605]] pleasant [[H2532]] vessels. [[H3627]]

### 16
Samaria [[H8111]] shall become desolate; [[H816]] for [[H3588]] she hath rebelled [[H4784]] against her God: [[H430]] they shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword: [[H2719]] their infants [[H5768]] shall be dashed in pieces, [[H7376]] and their women with child [[H2030]] shall be ripped up. [[H1234]]
