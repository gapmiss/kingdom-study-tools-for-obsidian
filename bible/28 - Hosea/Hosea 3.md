Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, Go [[H1980]] yet, [[H5750]] love [[H157]] a woman [[H802]] beloved [[H157]] of friend, [[H7453]] yet an adulteress, [[H5003]] according to the love [[H160]] of the Lord [[H3068]]  toward [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H1992]] look [[H6437]] to [[H413]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and love [[H157]] flagons [[H809]] of wine. [[H6025]]

So I bought [[H3739]] her to me for fifteen [[H6240]] of silver, [[H3701]] and an homer [[H2563]] of barley, [[H8184]] and an half homer [[H3963]] of barley: [[H8184]]

And I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Thou shalt abide [[H3427]] for me many [[H7227]] days; [[H3117]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] play the harlot, [[H2181]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] for man: [[H376]] so I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] for [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

Afterward [[H310]] shall the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] return, [[H7725]] and seek [[H1245]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and David [[H1732]] their king; [[H4428]] and shall fear [[H6342]] the Lord [[H3068]] and his goodness [[H2898]] in the latter [[H319]] days. [[H3117]]
