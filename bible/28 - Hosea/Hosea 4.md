[[Hosea 3|←]] • [[Hosea 5|→]]

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] ye children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath a controversy [[H7379]] with [[H5973]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] because [[H3588]] no [[H369]] truth, [[H571]] nor [[H369]] mercy, [[H2617]] nor [[H369]] knowledge [[H1847]] of God [[H430]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 2
By swearing, [[H422]] and lying, [[H3584]] and killing, [[H7523]] and stealing, [[H1589]] and committing adultery, [[H5003]] they break out, [[H6555]] and blood [[H1818]] toucheth [[H5060]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 3
Therefore [[H5921]] shall the land [[H776]] mourn, [[H56]] and every one [[H3605]] that dwelleth [[H3427]] therein shall languish, [[H535]] with the beasts [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] and with the fowls [[H5775]] of heaven; [[H8064]] yea, the fishes [[H1709]] of the sea [[H3220]] also [[H1571]] shall be taken away. [[H622]]

### 4
Yet [[H389]] let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] strive, [[H7378]] nor [[H408]] reprove [[H3198]] another: [[H376]] for thy people [[H5971]] as they that strive [[H7378]] with the priest. [[H3548]]

### 5
Therefore shalt thou fall [[H3782]] in the day, [[H3117]] and the prophet [[H5030]] also [[H1571]] shall fall [[H3782]] with [[H5973]] thee in the night, [[H3915]] and I will destroy [[H1820]] thy mother. [[H517]]

### 6
My people [[H5971]] are destroyed [[H1820]] for lack [[H1097]] of knowledge: [[H1847]] because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast rejected [[H3988]] knowledge, [[H1847]] I will also reject [[H3988]] thee, that thou shalt be no priest [[H3547]] to me: seeing thou hast forgotten [[H7911]] the law [[H8451]] of thy God, [[H430]] I [[H589]] will also [[H1571]] forget [[H7911]] thy children. [[H1121]]

### 7
As they were increased, [[H7230]] so [[H3651]] they sinned [[H2398]] against me: will I change [[H4171]] their glory [[H3519]] into shame. [[H7036]]

### 8
They eat up [[H398]] the sin [[H2403]] of my people, [[H5971]] and they set [[H5375]] their heart [[H5315]] on [[H413]] their iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 9
And there shall be, [[H1961]] like people, [[H5971]] like priest: [[H3548]] and I will punish [[H6485]] them for their ways, [[H1870]] and reward [[H7725]] them their doings. [[H4611]]

### 10
For they shall eat, [[H398]] and not [[H3808]] have enough: [[H7646]] they shall commit whoredom, [[H2181]] and shall not [[H3808]] increase: [[H6555]] because [[H3588]] they have left off [[H5800]] to take heed [[H8104]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
Whoredom [[H2184]] and wine [[H3196]] and new wine [[H8492]] take away [[H3947]] the heart. [[H3820]]

### 12
My people [[H5971]] ask counsel [[H7592]] at their stocks, [[H6086]] and their staff [[H4731]] declareth [[H5046]] unto them: for [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of whoredoms [[H2183]] hath caused to err, [[H8582]] and they have gone a whoring [[H2181]] from under [[H8478]] their God. [[H430]]

### 13
They sacrifice [[H2076]] upon [[H5921]] the tops [[H7218]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] and burn incense [[H6999]] upon [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] under [[H8478]] oaks [[H437]] and poplars [[H3839]] and elms, [[H424]] because [[H3588]] the shadow [[H6738]] thereof good: [[H2896]] therefore [[H5921]] your daughters [[H1323]] shall commit whoredom, [[H2181]] and your spouses [[H3618]] shall commit adultery. [[H5003]]

### 14
I will not [[H3808]] punish [[H6485]] your daughters [[H1323]] when [[H3588]] they commit whoredom, [[H2181]] nor your spouses [[H3618]] when [[H3588]] they commit adultery: [[H5003]] for [[H3588]] themselves [[H1992]] are separated [[H6504]] with [[H5973]] whores, [[H2181]] and they sacrifice [[H2076]] with [[H5973]] harlots: [[H6948]] therefore the people [[H5971]] doth not [[H3808]] understand [[H995]] shall fall. [[H3832]]

### 15
Though [[H518]] thou, [[H859]] Israel, [[H3478]] play the harlot, [[H2181]] let not [[H408]] Judah [[H3063]] offend; [[H816]] and come [[H935]] not [[H408]] ye unto Gilgal, [[H1537]] neither [[H408]] go ye up [[H5927]] to Beth-aven, [[H1007]] nor [[H408]] swear, [[H7650]] The Lord [[H3068]] liveth. [[H2416]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] slideth back [[H5637]] as a backsliding [[H5637]] heifer: [[H6510]] now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] will feed [[H7462]] them as a lamb [[H3532]] in a large place. [[H4800]]

### 17
Ephraim [[H669]] joined [[H2266]] to idols: [[H6091]] let him alone. [[H3240]]

### 18
Their drink [[H5435]] is sour: [[H5493]] they have committed whoredom [[H2181]] continually: [[H2181]] her rulers [[H4043]] shame [[H7036]] do love, [[H157]] Give ye. [[H3051]]

### 19
The wind [[H7307]] hath bound her up [[H6887]] in her wings, [[H3671]] and they shall be ashamed [[H954]] because of their sacrifices. [[H2077]]
