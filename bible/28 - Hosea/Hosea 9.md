[[Hosea 8|←]] • [[Hosea 10|→]]

---

### 1
Rejoice [[H8055]] not, [[H408]] O Israel, [[H3478]] for [[H413]] joy, [[H1524]] as people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] thou hast gone a whoring [[H2181]] from [[H5921]] thy God, [[H430]] thou hast loved [[H157]] a reward [[H868]] upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] cornfloor. [[H1715]]

### 2
The floor [[H1637]] and the winepress [[H3342]] shall not [[H3808]] feed [[H7462]] them, and the new wine [[H8492]] shall fail [[H3584]] in her. [[H3584]]

### 3
They shall not [[H3808]] dwell [[H3427]] in the Lord's [[H3068]] land; [[H776]] but Ephraim [[H669]] shall return [[H7725]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] and they shall eat [[H398]] unclean [[H2931]] in Assyria. [[H804]]

### 4
They shall not [[H3808]] offer [[H5258]] wine [[H3196]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] neither [[H3808]] shall they be pleasing [[H6149]] unto him: their sacrifices [[H2077]] unto them as the bread [[H3899]] of mourners; [[H205]] all [[H3605]] that eat [[H398]] thereof shall be polluted: [[H2930]] for [[H3588]] their bread [[H3899]] for their soul [[H5315]] shall not [[H3808]] come into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
What [[H4100]] will ye do [[H6213]] in the solemn [[H4150]] day, [[H3117]] and in the day [[H3117]] of the feast [[H2282]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 6
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] they are gone [[H1980]] because of destruction: [[H7701]] Egypt [[H4714]] shall gather them up, [[H6908]] Memphis [[H4644]] shall bury [[H6912]] them: the pleasant [[H4261]] for their silver, [[H3701]] nettles [[H7057]] shall possess [[H3423]] them: thorns [[H2336]] in their tabernacles. [[H168]]

### 7
The days [[H3117]] of visitation [[H6486]] are come, [[H935]] the days [[H3117]] of recompence [[H7966]] are come; [[H935]] Israel [[H3478]] shall know [[H3045]] the prophet [[H5030]] a fool, [[H191]] the spiritual [[H7307]] man [[H376]] mad, [[H7696]] for [[H5921]] the multitude [[H7230]] of thine iniquity, [[H5771]] and the great [[H7227]] hatred. [[H4895]]

### 8
The watchman [[H6822]] of Ephraim [[H669]] with [[H5973]] my God: [[H430]] the prophet [[H5030]] a snare [[H6341]] of a fowler [[H3352]] in [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] hatred [[H4895]] in the house [[H1004]] of his God. [[H430]]

### 9
They have deeply [[H6009]] corrupted [[H7843]] as in the days [[H3117]] of Gibeah: [[H1390]] he will remember [[H2142]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] he will visit [[H6485]] their sins. [[H2403]]

### 10
I found [[H4672]] Israel [[H3478]] like grapes [[H6025]] in the wilderness; [[H4057]] I saw [[H7200]] your fathers [[H1]] as the firstripe [[H1063]] in the fig tree [[H8384]] at her first time: [[H7225]] they [[H1992]] went [[H935]] to Baal-peor, [[H1187]] and separated themselves [[H5144]] unto shame; [[H1322]] and abominations [[H8251]] were [[H1961]] according as they loved. [[H157]]

### 11
Ephraim, [[H669]] their glory [[H3519]] shall fly away [[H5774]] like a bird, [[H5775]] from the birth, [[H3205]] and from the womb, [[H990]] and from the conception. [[H2032]]

### 12
Though [[H3588]] they bring up [[H1431]] their children, [[H1121]] yet will I bereave [[H7921]] them, not a man [[H120]] yea, [[H3588]] woe [[H188]] also [[H1571]] to them when I depart [[H5493]] from them! [[H5493]]

### 13
Ephraim, [[H669]] as [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]] Tyrus, [[H6865]] planted [[H8362]] in a pleasant place: [[H5116]] but Ephraim [[H669]] shall bring forth [[H3318]] his children [[H1121]] to [[H413]] the murderer. [[H2026]]

### 14
Give [[H5414]] them, O Lord: [[H3068]] what [[H4100]] wilt thou give? [[H5414]] give [[H5414]] them a miscarrying [[H7921]] womb [[H7358]] and dry [[H6784]] breasts. [[H7699]]

### 15
All [[H3605]] their wickedness [[H7451]] in Gilgal: [[H1537]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] I hated [[H8130]] them: for [[H5921]] the wickedness [[H7455]] of their doings [[H4611]] I will drive them out [[H1644]] of mine house, [[H1004]] I will love [[H160]] them no [[H3808]] more: [[H3254]] all [[H3605]] their princes [[H8269]] revolters. [[H5637]]

### 16
Ephraim [[H669]] is smitten, [[H5221]] their root [[H8328]] is dried up, [[H3001]] they shall bear [[H6213]] no [[H1097]] fruit: [[H6529]] yea, [[H1571]] though [[H3588]] they bring forth, [[H3205]] yet will I slay [[H4191]] the beloved [[H4261]] of their womb. [[H990]]

### 17
My God [[H430]] will cast them away, [[H3988]] because [[H3588]] they did not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto him: and they shall be [[H1961]] wanderers [[H5074]] among the nations. [[H1471]]
