# Hosea 7

[[Hosea 6|←]] • [[Hosea 8|→]]

---

### 1
When I would have healed [[H7495]] Israel, [[H3478]] then the iniquity [[H5771]] of Ephraim [[H669]] was discovered, [[H1540]] and the wickedness [[H7451]] of Samaria: [[H8111]] for [[H3588]] they commit [[H6466]] falsehood; [[H8267]] and the thief [[H1590]] cometh in, [[H935]] the troop [[H1416]] of robbers spoileth [[H6584]] without. [[H2351]]

### 2
And they consider [[H559]] not [[H1077]] in their hearts [[H3824]] I remember [[H2142]] all [[H3605]] their wickedness: [[H7451]] now [[H6258]] their own doings [[H4611]] have beset them about; [[H5437]] they are [[H1961]] before [[H5048]] my face. [[H6440]]

### 3
They make the king [[H4428]] glad [[H8055]] with their wickedness, [[H7451]] and the princes [[H8269]] with their lies. [[H3585]]

### 4
They all [[H3605]] adulterers, [[H5003]] as [[H3644]] an oven [[H8574]] heated [[H1197]] by the baker, [[H644]] ceaseth [[H7673]] from raising [[H5782]] after he hath kneaded [[H3888]] the dough, [[H1217]] until [[H5704]] it be leavened. [[H2556]]

### 5
In the day [[H3117]] of our king [[H4428]] the princes [[H8269]] have made sick [[H2470]] with bottles [[H2534]] of wine; [[H3196]] he stretched out [[H4900]] his hand [[H3027]] with [[H854]] scorners. [[H3945]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] they have made ready [[H7126]] their heart [[H3820]] like an oven, [[H8574]] whiles they lie in wait: [[H693]] their baker [[H644]] sleepeth [[H3463]] all [[H3605]] the night; [[H3915]] in the morning [[H1242]] it [[H1931]] burneth [[H1197]] as a flaming [[H3852]] fire. [[H784]]

### 7
They are all hot [[H2552]] as an oven, [[H8574]] and have devoured [[H398]] their judges; [[H8199]] all [[H3605]] their kings [[H4428]] are fallen: [[H5307]] none [[H369]] among them that calleth [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 8
Ephraim, [[H669]] he [[H1931]] hath mixed himself [[H1101]] among the people; [[H5971]] Ephraim [[H669]] is [[H1961]] a cake [[H5692]] not [[H1097]] turned. [[H2015]]

### 9
Strangers [[H2114]] have devoured [[H398]] his strength, [[H3581]] and he [[H1931]] knoweth [[H3045]] not: [[H3808]] yea, [[H1571]] gray hairs [[H7872]] are here and there [[H2236]] upon him, yet he [[H1931]] knoweth [[H3045]] not. [[H3045]]

### 10
And the pride [[H1347]] of Israel [[H3478]] testifieth [[H6030]] to his face: [[H6440]] and they do not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] nor [[H3808]] seek [[H1245]] him for all [[H3605]] this. [[H3605]]

### 11
Ephraim [[H669]] also is [[H1961]] like a silly [[H6601]] dove [[H3123]] without [[H369]] heart: [[H3820]] they call [[H7121]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] they go [[H1980]] to Assyria. [[H804]]

### 12
When [[H834]] they shall go, [[H1980]] I will spread [[H6566]] my net [[H7568]] upon [[H5921]] them; I will bring them down [[H3381]] as the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven; [[H8064]] I will chastise [[H3256]] them, as their congregation [[H5712]] hath heard. [[H8088]]

### 13
Woe [[H188]] unto them! for [[H3588]] they have fled [[H5074]] from [[H4480]] me: destruction [[H7701]] unto them! because [[H3588]] they have transgressed [[H6586]] against me: though I [[H595]] have redeemed [[H6299]] them, yet they [[H1992]] have spoken [[H1696]] lies [[H3577]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 14
And they have not [[H3808]] cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] me with their heart, [[H3820]] when [[H3588]] they howled [[H3213]] upon [[H5921]] their beds: [[H4904]] they assemble themselves [[H1481]] for [[H5921]] corn [[H1715]] and wine, [[H8492]] they rebel [[H5493]] against me. [[H5493]]

### 15
Though I [[H589]] have bound [[H3256]] strengthened [[H2388]] their arms, [[H2220]] yet do they imagine [[H2803]] mischief [[H7451]] against [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 16
They return, [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] to the most High: [[H5920]] they are [[H1961]] like a deceitful [[H7423]] bow: [[H7198]] their princes [[H8269]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] for the rage [[H2195]] of their tongue: [[H3956]] this [[H2097]] their derision [[H3933]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt.
