### 1
O Israel, [[H3478]] return [[H7725]] unto [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] thou hast fallen [[H3782]] by thine iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 2
Take [[H3947]] with [[H5973]] you words, [[H1697]] and turn [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Take away [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] iniquity, [[H5771]] and receive [[H3947]] graciously: [[H2896]] so will we render [[H7999]] the calves [[H6499]] of our lips. [[H8193]]

### 3
Asshur [[H804]] shall not [[H3808]] save [[H3467]] us; we will not [[H3808]] ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] horses: [[H5483]] neither [[H3808]] will we say [[H559]] any more [[H5750]] to the work [[H4639]] of our hands, [[H3027]] our gods: [[H430]] for [[H834]] in thee the fatherless [[H3490]] findeth mercy. [[H7355]]

### 4
I will heal [[H7495]] their backsliding, [[H4878]] I will love [[H157]] them freely: [[H5071]] for [[H3588]] mine anger [[H639]] is turned away [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 5
I will be [[H1961]] as the dew [[H2919]] unto Israel: [[H3478]] he shall grow [[H6524]] as the lily, [[H7799]] and cast forth [[H5221]] his roots [[H8328]] as Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 6
His branches [[H3127]] shall spread, [[H1980]] and his beauty [[H1935]] shall be [[H1961]] as the olive tree, [[H2132]] and his smell [[H7381]] as Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 7
They that dwell [[H3427]] under his shadow [[H6738]] shall return; [[H7725]] they shall revive [[H2421]] the corn, [[H1715]] and grow [[H6524]] as the vine: [[H1612]] the scent [[H2143]] thereof as the wine [[H3196]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 8
Ephraim [[H669]] What [[H4100]] have I to do any more [[H5750]] with idols? [[H6091]] I [[H589]] have heard [[H6030]] and observed [[H7789]] him: I [[H589]] like a green [[H7488]] fir tree. [[H1265]] From [[H4480]] me is thy fruit [[H6529]] found. [[H4672]]

### 9
Who [[H4310]] wise, [[H2450]] and he shall understand [[H995]] these [[H428]] prudent, [[H995]] and he shall know [[H3045]] them? for [[H3588]] the ways [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H3068]] right, [[H3477]] and the just [[H6662]] shall walk [[H1980]] in them: but the transgressors [[H6586]] shall fall [[H3782]] therein.
