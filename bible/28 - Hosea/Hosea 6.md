[[Hosea 5|←]] • [[Hosea 7|→]]

### 1
Come, [[H1980]] and let us return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] hath torn, [[H2963]] and he will heal [[H7495]] us; he hath smitten, [[H5221]] and he will bind us up. [[H2280]]

### 2
After two days [[H3117]] will he revive [[H2421]] us: in the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] he will raise us up, [[H6965]] and we shall live [[H2421]] in his sight. [[H6440]]

### 3
Then shall we know, [[H3045]] we follow on [[H7291]] to know [[H3045]] the Lord: [[H3068]] his going forth [[H4161]] is prepared [[H3559]] as the morning; [[H7837]] and he shall come [[H935]] unto us as the rain, [[H1653]] as the latter [[H4456]] former rain [[H3138]] unto the earth. [[H776]]

### 4
O Ephraim, [[H669]] what [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] unto thee? O Judah, [[H3063]] what [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] unto thee? for your goodness [[H2617]] as a morning [[H1242]] cloud, [[H6051]] and as the early [[H7925]] dew [[H2919]] it goeth away. [[H1980]]

### 5
Therefore [[H5921]] have I hewed [[H2672]] by the prophets; [[H5030]] I have slain [[H2026]] them by the words [[H561]] of my mouth: [[H6310]] and thy judgments [[H4941]] the light [[H216]] goeth forth. [[H3318]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] I desired [[H2654]] mercy, [[H2617]] and not [[H3808]] sacrifice; [[H2077]] and the knowledge [[H1847]] of God [[H430]] more than burnt offerings. [[H5930]]

### 7
But they [[H1992]] like men [[H120]] have transgressed [[H5674]] the covenant: [[H1285]] there [[H8033]] have they dealt treacherously [[H898]] against me. [[H898]]

### 8
Gilead [[H1568]] a city [[H7151]] of them that work [[H6466]] iniquity, [[H205]] polluted [[H6121]] with blood. [[H1818]]

### 9
And as troops [[H1416]] of robbers wait [[H2442]] for a man, [[H376]] the company [[H2267]] of priests [[H3548]] murder [[H7523]] in the way [[H1870]] by consent: [[H7926]] for [[H3588]] they commit [[H6213]] lewdness. [[H2154]]

### 10
I have seen [[H7200]] an horrible thing [[H8186]] in the house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] there [[H8033]] the whoredom [[H2184]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] Israel [[H3478]] is defiled. [[H2930]]

### 11
Also, [[H1571]] O Judah, [[H3063]] he hath set [[H7896]] an harvest [[H7105]] for thee, when I returned [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of my people. [[H5971]]
