# Hosea 11

[[Hosea 10|←]] • [[Hosea 12|→]]

### 1
When [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] a child, [[H5288]] then I loved [[H157]] him, and called [[H7121]] my son [[H1121]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 2
they called [[H7121]] them, so [[H3651]] they went [[H1980]] from [[H6440]] them: they sacrificed [[H2076]] unto Baalim, [[H1168]] and burned incense [[H6999]] to graven images. [[H6456]]

### 3
I [[H595]] taught [[H8637]] Ephraim [[H669]] also to go, taking [[H3947]] them by [[H5921]] their arms; [[H2220]] but they knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] I healed them. [[H7495]]

### 4
I drew [[H4900]] them with cords [[H2256]] of a man, [[H120]] with bands [[H5688]] of love: [[H160]] and I was [[H1961]] to them as they that take off [[H7311]] the yoke [[H5923]] on [[H5921]] their jaws, [[H3895]] and I laid meat [[H398]] unto them. [[H413]]

### 5
He shall not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] but the Assyrian [[H804]] shall be his king, [[H4428]] because [[H3588]] they refused [[H3985]] to return. [[H7725]]

### 6
And the sword [[H2719]] shall abide [[H2342]] on his cities, [[H5892]] and shall consume [[H3615]] his branches, [[H905]] and devour [[H398]] because of their own counsels. [[H4156]]

### 7
And my people [[H5971]] are bent [[H8511]] to backsliding [[H4878]] from me: though they called [[H7121]] them to [[H413]] the most High, [[H5920]] none at all [[H3162]] would exalt [[H7311]]

### 8
How [[H349]] shall I give thee up, [[H5414]] Ephraim? [[H669]] shall I deliver [[H4042]] thee, Israel? [[H3478]] how [[H349]] shall I make [[H5414]] thee as Admah? [[H126]] shall I set [[H7760]] thee as Zeboim? [[H6636]] mine heart [[H3820]] is turned [[H2015]] within [[H5921]] me, my repentings [[H5150]] are kindled [[H3648]] together. [[H3162]]

### 9
I will not [[H3808]] execute [[H6213]] the fierceness [[H2740]] of mine anger, [[H639]] I will not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to destroy [[H7843]] Ephraim: [[H669]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] God, [[H410]] and not [[H3808]] man; [[H582]] the Holy One [[H6918]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee: and I will not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into the city. [[H5892]]

### 10
They shall walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the Lord: [[H3068]] he shall roar [[H7580]] like a lion: [[H738]] when [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] shall roar, [[H7580]] then the children [[H1121]] shall tremble [[H2729]] from the west. [[H3220]]

### 11
They shall tremble [[H2729]] as a bird [[H6833]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and as a dove [[H3123]] out of the land [[H776]] of Assyria: [[H804]] and I will place [[H3427]] them in [[H5921]] their houses, [[H1004]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
Ephraim [[H669]] compasseth [[H5437]] me about with lies, [[H3585]] and the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] with deceit: [[H4820]] but Judah [[H3063]] yet [[H5750]] ruleth [[H7300]] with [[H5973]] God, [[H410]] and is faithful [[H539]] with [[H5973]] the saints. [[H6918]]
