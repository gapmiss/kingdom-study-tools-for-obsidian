### 1
Say [[H559]] ye unto your brethren, [[H251]] Ammi; [[H5971]] and to your sisters, [[H269]] Ruhamah. [[H7355]]

### 2
Plead [[H7378]] with your mother, [[H517]] plead: [[H7378]] for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] my wife, [[H802]] neither [[H3808]] I [[H595]] her husband: [[H376]] let her therefore put away [[H5493]] her whoredoms [[H2183]] out of her sight, [[H6440]] and her adulteries [[H5005]] from between [[H996]] her breasts; [[H7699]]

### 3
Lest [[H6435]] I strip [[H6584]] her naked, [[H6174]] and set [[H3322]] her as in the day [[H3117]] that she was born, [[H3205]] and make [[H7760]] her as a wilderness, [[H4057]] and set [[H7896]] her like a dry [[H6723]] land, [[H776]] and slay [[H4191]] her with thirst. [[H6772]]

### 4
And I will not [[H3808]] have mercy upon [[H7355]] her children; [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] the children [[H1121]] of whoredoms. [[H2183]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] their mother [[H517]] hath played the harlot: [[H2181]] she that conceived [[H2029]] them hath done shamefully: [[H3001]] for [[H3588]] she said, [[H559]] I will go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] my lovers, [[H157]] that give [[H5414]] my bread [[H3899]] and my water, [[H4325]] my wool [[H6785]] and my flax, [[H6593]] mine oil [[H8081]] and my drink. [[H8250]]

### 6
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I will hedge up [[H7753]] thy way [[H1870]] with thorns, [[H5518]] and make [[H1443]] a wall, [[H1448]] that she shall not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] her paths. [[H5410]]

### 7
And she shall follow after [[H7291]] her lovers, [[H157]] but she shall not [[H3808]] overtake [[H5381]] them; and she shall seek [[H1245]] them, but shall not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] then shall she say, [[H559]] I will go [[H1980]] and return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] my first [[H7223]] husband; [[H376]] for [[H3588]] then [[H227]] better [[H2896]] with me than now. [[H6258]]

### 8
For she [[H1931]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H595]] gave [[H5414]] her corn, [[H1715]] and wine, [[H8492]] and oil, [[H3323]] and multiplied [[H7235]] her silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] they prepared [[H6213]] for Baal. [[H1168]]

### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] will I return, [[H7725]] and take away [[H3947]] my corn [[H1715]] in the time [[H6256]] thereof, and my wine [[H8492]] in the season [[H4150]] thereof, and will recover [[H5337]] my wool [[H6785]] and my flax [[H6593]] to cover [[H3680]] her nakedness. [[H6172]]

### 10
And now [[H6258]] will I discover [[H1540]] her lewdness [[H5040]] in the sight [[H5869]] of her lovers, [[H157]] and none [[H376]] shall deliver [[H5337]] her out of mine hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
I will also cause all [[H3605]] her mirth [[H4885]] to cease, [[H7673]] her feast days, [[H2282]] her new moons, [[H2320]] and her sabbaths, [[H7676]] and all [[H3605]] her solemn feasts. [[H4150]]

### 12
And I will destroy [[H8074]] her vines [[H1612]] and her fig trees, [[H8384]] whereof [[H834]] she hath said, [[H559]] These [[H1992]] my rewards [[H866]] that [[H834]] my lovers [[H157]] have given [[H5414]] me: and I will make [[H7760]] them a forest, [[H3293]] and the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] shall eat [[H398]] them. [[H398]]

### 13
And I will visit [[H6485]] upon [[H5921]]  her [[H853]] the days [[H3117]] of Baalim, [[H1168]] wherein [[H834]] she burned incense [[H6999]] to them, and she decked [[H5710]] herself with her earrings [[H5141]] and her jewels, [[H2484]] and she went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] her lovers, [[H157]] and forgat [[H7911]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will allure [[H6601]] her, and bring [[H1980]] her into the wilderness, [[H4057]] and speak [[H1696]] comfortably [[H3820]] unto her. [[H5921]]

### 15
And I will give [[H5414]]  her [[H853]] her vineyards [[H3754]] from thence, [[H8033]] and the valley [[H6010]] of Achor [[H5911]] for a door [[H6607]] of hope: [[H8615]] and she shall sing [[H6030]] there, [[H8033]] as in the days [[H3117]] of her youth, [[H5271]] and as in the day [[H3117]] when she came up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 16
And it shall be [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] thou shalt call [[H7121]] me Ishi; [[H376]] and shalt call [[H7121]] me no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] Baali. [[H1180]]

### 17
For I will take away [[H5493]] the names [[H8034]] of Baalim [[H1168]] out of her mouth, [[H6310]] and they shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be remembered [[H2142]] by their name. [[H8034]]

### 18
And in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] will I make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] for them with [[H5973]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] and with [[H5973]] the fowls [[H5775]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and the creeping things [[H7431]] of the ground: [[H127]] and I will break [[H7665]] the bow [[H7198]] and the sword [[H2719]] and the battle [[H4421]] out of [[H4480]] the earth, [[H776]] and will make them to lie down [[H7901]] safely. [[H983]]

### 19
And I will betroth [[H781]] thee unto me for ever; [[H5769]] yea, I will betroth [[H781]] thee unto me in righteousness, [[H6664]] and in judgment, [[H4941]] and in lovingkindness, [[H2617]] and in mercies. [[H7356]]

### 20
I will even betroth [[H781]] thee unto me in faithfulness: [[H530]] and thou shalt know [[H3045]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] I will hear, [[H6030]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I will hear [[H6030]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and they [[H1992]] shall hear [[H6030]] the earth; [[H776]]

### 22
And the earth [[H776]] shall hear [[H6030]] the corn, [[H1715]] and the wine, [[H8492]] and the oil; [[H3323]] and they [[H1992]] shall hear [[H6030]] Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 23
And I will sow [[H2232]] her unto me in the earth; [[H776]] and I will have mercy upon [[H7355]] her that had not [[H3808]] obtained mercy; [[H7355]] and I will say [[H559]] to not [[H3808]] my people, [[H5971]] Thou [[H859]] my people; [[H5971]] and they [[H1931]] shall say, [[H559]] my God.
