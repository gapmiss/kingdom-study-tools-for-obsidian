# Habakkuk 1

[[Nahum 3|←]] • [[Habakkuk 2|→]]

---

### 1
The burden [[H4853]] which [[H834]] Habakkuk [[H2265]] the prophet [[H5030]] did see. [[H2372]]

### 2
O Lord, [[H3068]] how long [[H5704]] shall I cry, [[H7768]] and thou wilt not [[H3808]] hear! [[H8085]] cry out [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] thee violence, [[H2555]] and thou wilt not [[H3808]] save! [[H3467]]

### 3
Why [[H4100]] dost thou shew [[H7200]] me iniquity, [[H205]] and cause to behold [[H5027]] grievance? [[H5999]] for spoiling [[H7701]] and violence [[H2555]] before [[H5048]] me: and there are [[H1961]] raise up [[H5375]] strife [[H7379]] and contention. [[H4066]]

### 4
Therefore [[H5921]] the law [[H8451]] is slacked, [[H6313]] and judgment [[H4941]] doth never [[H5331]] go forth: [[H3318]] for [[H3588]] the wicked [[H7563]] doth compass about [[H3803]] the righteous; [[H6662]] therefore [[H5921]] wrong [[H6127]] judgment [[H4941]] proceedeth. [[H3318]]

### 5
Behold [[H7200]] ye among the heathen, [[H1471]] and regard, [[H5027]] and wonder [[H8539]] marvellously: [[H8539]] for [[H3588]] will work [[H6466]] a work [[H6467]] in your days, [[H3117]] ye will not [[H3808]] believe, [[H539]] though [[H3588]] it be told [[H5608]]

### 6
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2005]] I raise up [[H6965]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] bitter [[H4751]] and hasty [[H4116]] nation, [[H1471]] which shall march [[H1980]] through the breadth [[H4800]] of the land, [[H776]] to possess [[H3423]] the dwellingplaces [[H4908]] not [[H3808]] theirs. [[H3808]]

### 7
They [[H1931]] terrible [[H366]] and dreadful: [[H3372]] their judgment [[H4941]] and their dignity [[H7613]] shall proceed [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] themselves. [[H4480]]

### 8
Their horses [[H5483]] also are swifter [[H7043]] than the leopards, [[H5246]] and are more fierce [[H2300]] than the evening [[H6153]] wolves: [[H2061]] and their horsemen [[H6571]] shall spread [[H6335]] themselves, and their horsemen [[H6571]] shall come [[H935]] from far; [[H7350]] they shall fly [[H5774]] as the eagle [[H5404]] hasteth [[H2363]] to eat. [[H398]]

### 9
They shall come [[H935]] all [[H3605]] for violence: [[H2555]] their faces [[H6440]] shall sup up [[H4041]] the east wind, [[H6921]] and they shall gather [[H622]] the captivity [[H7628]] as the sand. [[H2344]]

### 10
And they [[H1931]] shall scoff [[H7046]] at the kings, [[H4428]] and the princes [[H7336]] shall be a scorn [[H4890]] unto them: they [[H1931]] shall deride [[H7832]] every [[H3605]] strong hold; [[H4013]] for they shall heap [[H6651]] dust, [[H6083]] and take [[H3920]] it. [[H3920]]

### 11
Then [[H227]] shall mind [[H7307]] change, [[H2498]] and he shall pass over, [[H5674]] and offend, [[H816]] this [[H2098]] his power [[H3581]] unto his god. [[H433]]

### 12
thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] from everlasting, [[H6924]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] mine Holy One? [[H6918]] we shall not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast ordained [[H7760]] them for judgment; [[H4941]] and, O mighty God, [[H6697]] thou hast established [[H3245]] them for correction. [[H3198]]

### 13
of purer [[H2889]] eyes [[H5869]] than to behold [[H7200]] evil, [[H7451]] and canst [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] look [[H5027]] on [[H413]] iniquity: [[H5999]] wherefore [[H4100]] lookest [[H5027]] thou upon them that deal treacherously, [[H898]] holdest thy tongue [[H2790]] when the wicked [[H7563]] devoureth [[H1104]] more righteous [[H6662]] than [[H4480]] he? [[H4480]]

### 14
And makest [[H6213]] men [[H120]] as the fishes [[H1709]] of the sea, [[H3220]] as the creeping things, [[H7431]] no [[H3808]] ruler [[H4910]] over them? [[H4910]]

### 15
They take up [[H5927]] all [[H3605]] of them with the angle, [[H2443]] they catch [[H1641]] them in their net, [[H2764]] and gather [[H622]] them in their drag: [[H4365]] therefore [[H5921]] they rejoice [[H8055]] and are glad. [[H1523]]

### 16
Therefore [[H5921]] they sacrifice [[H2076]] unto their net, [[H2764]] and burn incense [[H6999]] unto their drag; [[H4365]] because [[H3588]] by them [[H1992]] their portion [[H2506]] fat, [[H8082]] and their meat [[H3978]] plenteous. [[H1277]]

### 17
Shall they therefore [[H5921]] empty [[H7324]] their net, [[H2764]] and not [[H3808]] spare [[H2550]] continually [[H8548]] to slay [[H2026]] the nations? [[H1471]]
