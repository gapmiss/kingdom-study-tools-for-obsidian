### 1
A prayer [[H8605]] of Habakkuk [[H2265]] the prophet [[H5030]] upon [[H5921]] Shigionoth. [[H7692]]

### 2
O Lord, [[H3068]] I have heard [[H8085]] thy speech, [[H8088]] was afraid: [[H3372]] O Lord, [[H3068]] revive [[H2421]] thy work [[H6467]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the years, [[H8141]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the years [[H8141]] make known; [[H3045]] in wrath [[H7267]] remember [[H2142]] mercy. [[H7355]]

### 3
God [[H433]] came [[H935]] from Teman, [[H8487]] and the Holy One [[H6918]] from mount [[H2022]] Paran. [[H6290]] Selah. [[H5542]] His glory [[H1935]] covered [[H3680]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] was full [[H4390]] of his praise. [[H8416]]

### 4
And brightness [[H5051]] was [[H1961]] as the light; [[H216]] he had horns [[H7161]] out of his hand: [[H3027]] and there [[H8033]] the hiding [[H2253]] of his power. [[H5797]]

### 5
Before [[H6440]] him went [[H1980]] the pestilence, [[H1698]] and burning coals [[H7565]] went forth [[H3318]] at his feet. [[H7272]]

### 6
He stood, [[H5975]] and measured [[H4058]] the earth: [[H776]] he beheld, [[H7200]] and drove asunder [[H5425]] the nations; [[H1471]] and the everlasting [[H5703]] mountains [[H2042]] were scattered, [[H6327]] the perpetual [[H5769]] hills [[H1389]] did bow: [[H7817]] his ways [[H1979]] everlasting. [[H5769]]

### 7
I saw [[H7200]] the tents [[H168]] of Cushan [[H3572]] in [[H8478]] affliction: [[H205]] the curtains [[H3407]] of the land [[H776]] of Midian [[H4080]] did tremble. [[H7264]]

### 8
Was the Lord [[H3068]] displeased [[H2734]] against the rivers? [[H5104]] thine anger [[H639]] against the rivers? [[H5104]] thy wrath [[H5678]] against the sea, [[H3220]] that [[H3588]] thou didst ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] thine horses [[H5483]] thy chariots [[H4818]] of salvation? [[H3444]]

### 9
Thy bow [[H7198]] was made quite [[H6181]] naked, [[H5783]] to the oaths [[H7621]] of the tribes, [[H4294]] word. [[H562]] Selah. [[H5542]] Thou didst cleave [[H1234]] the earth [[H776]] with rivers. [[H5104]]

### 10
The mountains [[H2022]] saw [[H7200]] thee, they trembled: [[H2342]] the overflowing [[H2230]] of the water [[H4325]] passed by: [[H5674]] the deep [[H8415]] uttered [[H5414]] his voice, [[H6963]] lifted up [[H5375]] his hands [[H3027]] on high. [[H7315]]

### 11
The sun [[H8121]] moon [[H3394]] stood still [[H5975]] in their habitation: [[H2073]] at the light [[H216]] of thine arrows [[H2671]] they went, [[H1980]] at the shining [[H5051]] of thy glittering [[H1300]] spear. [[H2595]]

### 12
Thou didst march through [[H6805]] the land [[H776]] in indignation, [[H2195]] thou didst thresh [[H1758]] the heathen [[H1471]] in anger. [[H639]]

### 13
Thou wentest forth [[H3318]] for the salvation [[H3468]] of thy people, [[H5971]] for salvation [[H3468]] with [[H853]] thine anointed; [[H4899]] thou woundedst [[H4272]] the head [[H7218]] out of the house [[H1004]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] by discovering [[H6168]] the foundation [[H3247]] unto [[H5704]] the neck. [[H6677]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 14
Thou didst strike through [[H5344]] with his staves [[H4294]] the head [[H7218]] of his villages: [[H6518]] they came out as a whirlwind [[H5590]] to scatter [[H6327]] me: their rejoicing [[H5951]] as [[H3644]] to devour [[H398]] the poor [[H6041]] secretly. [[H4565]]

### 15
Thou didst walk [[H1869]] through the sea [[H3220]] with thine horses, [[H5483]] the heap [[H2563]] of great [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 16
When I heard, [[H8085]] my belly [[H990]] trembled; [[H7264]] my lips [[H8193]] quivered [[H6750]] at the voice: [[H6963]] rottenness [[H7538]] entered [[H935]] into my bones, [[H6106]] and I trembled [[H7264]] in [[H8478]] myself, that [[H834]] I might rest [[H5117]] in the day [[H3117]] of trouble: [[H6869]] when he cometh up [[H5927]] unto the people, [[H5971]] he will invade troops. [[H1464]] them with his [[H1464]]

### 17
Although [[H3588]] the fig tree [[H8384]] shall not [[H3808]] blossom, [[H6524]] neither [[H369]] fruit [[H2981]] in the vines; [[H1612]] the labour [[H4639]] of the olive [[H2132]] shall fail, [[H3584]] and the fields [[H7709]] shall yield [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] meat; [[H400]] the flock [[H6629]] shall be cut off [[H1504]] from the fold, [[H4356]] and no [[H369]] herd [[H1241]] in the stalls: [[H7517]]

### 18
Yet I [[H589]] will rejoice [[H5937]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] I will joy [[H1523]] in the God [[H430]] of my salvation. [[H3468]]

### 19
The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H136]] my strength, [[H2428]] and he will make [[H7760]] my feet [[H7272]] like hinds' [[H355]] and he will make me to walk [[H1869]] upon [[H5921]] mine high places. [[H1116]] To the chief singer [[H5329]] on my stringed instruments. [[H5058]]
