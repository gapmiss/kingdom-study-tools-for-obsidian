### 1
I will stand [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] my watch, [[H4931]] and set [[H3320]] me upon [[H5921]] the tower, [[H4692]] and will watch [[H6822]] to see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] he will say [[H1696]] unto me, and what [[H4100]] I shall answer [[H7725]] when [[H5921]] I am reproved. [[H8433]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] me, and said, [[H559]] Write [[H3789]] the vision, [[H2377]] and make plain [[H874]] upon [[H5921]] tables, [[H3871]] that [[H4616]] he may run [[H7323]] that readeth [[H7121]] it. [[H7121]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the vision [[H2377]] yet [[H5750]] for an appointed time, [[H4150]] but at the end [[H7093]] it shall speak, [[H6315]] and not [[H3808]] lie: [[H3576]] though [[H518]] it tarry, [[H4102]] wait [[H2442]] for it; because [[H3588]] it will surely [[H935]] come, [[H935]] it will not [[H3808]] tarry. [[H309]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2009]] his soul [[H5315]] is lifted up [[H6075]] is not upright [[H3474]] in him: but the just [[H6662]] shall live [[H2421]] by his faith. [[H530]]

### 5
Yea [[H637]] also, because [[H3588]] he transgresseth [[H898]] by wine, [[H3196]] a proud [[H3093]] man, [[H1397]] neither [[H3808]] keepeth at home, [[H5115]] who [[H834]] enlargeth [[H7337]] his desire [[H5315]] as hell, [[H7585]] and as death, [[H4194]] and cannot [[H3808]] be satisfied, [[H7646]] but gathereth [[H622]] unto [[H413]] him all [[H3605]] nations, [[H1471]] and heapeth [[H6908]] unto [[H413]] him all [[H3605]] people: [[H5971]]

### 6
Shall not [[H3808]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] take up [[H5375]] a parable [[H4912]] against [[H5921]] him, and a taunting [[H4426]] proverb [[H2420]] against him, and say, [[H559]] Woe [[H1945]] to him that increaseth [[H7235]] not [[H3808]] his! how long? [[H5704]] and to him that ladeth [[H3513]] himself with thick clay! [[H5671]]

### 7
Shall they not [[H3808]] rise up [[H6965]] suddenly [[H6621]] that shall bite [[H5391]] thee, and awake [[H6974]] that shall vex thee, [[H2111]] and thou shalt be [[H1961]] for booties [[H4933]] unto them? [[H4933]]

### 8
Because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast spoiled [[H7997]] many [[H7227]] nations, [[H1471]] all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] shall spoil [[H7997]] thee; because of men's [[H120]] blood, [[H1818]] and the violence [[H2555]] of the land, [[H776]] of the city, [[H7151]] and of all [[H3605]] that dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 9
Woe [[H1945]] to him that coveteth [[H1214]] an evil [[H7451]] covetousness [[H1215]] to his house, [[H1004]] that he may set [[H7760]] his nest [[H7064]] on high, [[H4791]] that he may be delivered [[H5337]] from the power [[H3709]] of evil! [[H7451]]

### 10
Thou hast consulted [[H3289]] shame [[H1322]] to thy house [[H1004]] by cutting off [[H7096]] many [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] and hast sinned [[H2398]] thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the stone [[H68]] shall cry out [[H2199]] of the wall, [[H7023]] and the beam out [[H3714]] of the timber [[H6086]] shall answer [[H6030]] it. [[H6030]]

### 12
Woe [[H1945]] to him that buildeth [[H1129]] a town [[H5892]] with blood, [[H1818]] and stablisheth [[H3559]] a city [[H7151]] by iniquity! [[H5766]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] not [[H3808]] of [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] that the people [[H5971]] shall labour [[H3021]] in the very [[H1767]] fire, [[H784]] and the people [[H3816]] shall weary [[H3286]] themselves for very [[H1767]] vanity? [[H7385]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] the earth [[H776]] shall be filled [[H4390]] with the knowledge [[H3045]] of the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] as the waters [[H4325]] cover [[H3680]] the sea. [[H3220]]

### 15
Woe [[H1945]] unto him that giveth his neighbour [[H7453]] drink, [[H8248]] that puttest [[H5596]] thy bottle [[H2573]] to and makest drunken [[H7937]] also, [[H637]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest look [[H5027]] on [[H5921]] their nakedness! [[H4589]]

### 16
Thou art filled [[H7646]] with shame [[H7036]] for glory: [[H3519]] drink [[H8354]] thou [[H859]] also, [[H1571]] and let thy foreskin be uncovered: [[H6188]] the cup [[H3563]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] right hand [[H3225]] shall be turned [[H5437]] unto [[H5921]] thee, and shameful spewing [[H7022]] on [[H5921]] thy glory. [[H3519]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] the violence [[H2555]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] shall cover [[H3680]] thee, and the spoil [[H7701]] of beasts, [[H929]] made them afraid, [[H2865]] because of men's [[H120]] blood, [[H1818]] and for the violence [[H2555]] of the land, [[H776]] of the city, [[H7151]] and of all [[H3605]] that dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 18
What [[H4100]] profiteth [[H3276]] the graven image [[H6459]] that [[H3588]] the maker [[H3335]] thereof hath graven [[H6458]] it; the molten image, [[H4541]] and a teacher [[H3384]] of lies, [[H8267]] that [[H3588]] the maker [[H3335]] of his work [[H3336]] trusteth [[H982]] therein, [[H5921]] to make [[H6213]] dumb [[H483]] idols? [[H457]]

### 19
Woe [[H1945]] unto him that saith [[H559]] to the wood, [[H6086]] Awake; [[H6974]] to the dumb [[H1748]] stone, [[H68]] Arise, [[H5782]] it [[H1931]] shall teach! [[H3384]] Behold, [[H2009]] it [[H1931]] laid over [[H8610]] with gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] and no [[H369]] breath [[H7307]] at all [[H3605]] in the midst [[H7130]] of it. [[H7130]]

### 20
But the Lord [[H3068]] in his holy [[H6944]] temple: [[H1964]] let all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] keep silence [[H2013]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]
