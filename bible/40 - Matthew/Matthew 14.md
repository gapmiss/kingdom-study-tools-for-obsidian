### 1
At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] tetrarch [[G5076]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] of [[G189]] fame [[G189]] of Jesus, [[G2424]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G3816]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G3816]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist; [[G910]] he [[G846]] is risen [[G1453]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] dead; [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] therefore [[G1223]] mighty works [[G1411]] do shew forth themselves [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] Herod [[G2264]] had laid hold on [[G2902]] John, [[G2491]] and bound [[G1210]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] put [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G5438]] for [[G1223]] Herodias' [[G2266]] sake, [[G2266]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Philip's [[G5376]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] It is lawful [[G1832]] for thee [[G4671]] to have [[G2192]] her. [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when have [[G2309]] he [[G846]] would [[G2309]] put him to death, [[G615]] he feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] because [[G3754]] they counted [[G2192]] him [[G846]] as [[G5613]] a prophet. [[G4396]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] when [[G1161]] Herod's [[G2264]] birthday [[G1077]] was kept, [[G71]] the [[G3588]] daughter [[G2364]] of Herodias [[G2266]] danced [[G3738]] before [[G1722]] them, [[G3319]] and [[G2532]] pleased [[G700]] Herod. [[G2264]]

### 7
Whereupon [[G3606]] he promised [[G3670]] with [[G3326]] an oath [[G3727]] to give [[G1325]] her [[G846]] whatsoever [[G3739]]  she [[G1437]] would ask. [[G154]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] she, [[G3588]] being before instructed [[G4264]] of [[G5259]] her [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] said, [[G5346]] Give [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] here [[G5602]] John [[G2491]] Baptist's [[G910]] head [[G2776]] in [[G1909]] a charger. [[G4094]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] was sorry: [[G3076]] nevertheless [[G1161]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] oath's [[G3727]] sake, [[G3727]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] which sat with him at meat, [[G4873]] he commanded [[G2753]] to be given [[G1325]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] he sent, [[G3992]] and beheaded [[G607]] John [[G2491]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prison. [[G5438]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] head [[G2776]] was brought [[G5342]] in [[G1909]] a charger, [[G4094]] and [[G2532]] given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2877]] damsel: [[G2877]] and [[G2532]] she brought [[G5342]] to [[G3384]] her [[G846]] mother. [[G3384]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came, [[G4334]] and took up [[G142]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] buried [[G2290]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] went [[G2064]] and told [[G518]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 13
When [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] he departed [[G402]] thence [[G1564]] by [[G1722]] ship [[G4143]] into [[G1519]] a desert [[G2048]] place [[G5117]] apart: [[G2596]] and [[G2532]] when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] had heard [[G191]] they followed [[G190]] him [[G846]] on foot [[G3979]] out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cities. [[G4172]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went forth, [[G1831]] and saw [[G1492]] a great [[G4183]] multitude, [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] was moved with compassion [[G4697]] toward [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he healed [[G2323]] their [[G846]] sick. [[G732]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] when it was [[G1096]] evening, [[G3798]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] This is [[G2076]] a desert [[G2048]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5610]] now [[G2235]] is [[G3928]] past; [[G3928]] send [[G630]] the multitude [[G3793]] away, [[G630]] that [[G2443]] go [[G565]] they may and [[G59]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] villages, [[G2968]] buy [[G59]] themselves [[G1438]] victuals. [[G1033]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] need [[G5532]] They [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] depart; [[G565]] give [[G1325]] ye [[G5210]] them [[G846]] to eat. [[G5315]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] We [[G3756]] have [[G2192]] here [[G5602]] but [[G1487]] five [[G4002]] loaves, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] fishes. [[G2486]]

### 18
He [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Bring [[G5342]] them [[G846]] hither [[G5602]] to me. [[G3427]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] he commanded [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] to sit down [[G347]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] grass, [[G5528]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] fishes, [[G2486]] and looking up [[G308]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] he blessed, [[G2127]] and [[G2532]] brake, [[G2806]] and gave [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] loaves [[G740]] to disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3793]] multitude. [[G3793]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] they did [[G5315]] all [[G3956]] eat, [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were filled: [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] they took up [[G142]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2801]] fragments [[G2801]] that remained [[G4052]] twelve [[G1427]] baskets [[G2894]] full. [[G4134]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] they that had eaten [[G2068]] were [[G2258]] about [[G5616]] five thousand [[G4000]] men, [[G435]] beside [[G5565]] women [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children. [[G3813]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] Jesus [[G2424]] constrained [[G315]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to get [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] to go before [[G4254]] him [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side, [[G4008]] while [[G2193]] he sent away. [[G630]] the [[G3588]] multitudes [[G3793]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] when he had sent away, [[G630]] the [[G3588]] multitudes [[G3793]] he went up [[G305]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] apart [[G2596]] to pray: [[G4336]] and when [[G1161]] the evening [[G3798]] was come, [[G1096]] he was [[G2258]] there [[G1563]] alone. [[G3441]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] was [[G2258]] now [[G2235]] in the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea, [[G2281]] tossed [[G928]] with [[G5259]] waves: [[G2949]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] was [[G2258]] contrary. [[G1727]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] in the fourth [[G5067]] watch [[G5438]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3571]] night [[G3571]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G565]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] saw [[G1492]] him [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] they were troubled, [[G5015]] saying, [[G3004]] It is [[G2076]] a spirit; [[G5326]] and [[G2532]] they cried out [[G2896]] for [[G575]] fear. [[G5401]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] straightway [[G2112]] Jesus [[G2424]] spake [[G2980]] unto them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Be of good cheer; [[G2293]] it is [[G1510]] I; [[G1473]] not [[G3361]] be [[G5399]] afraid. [[G5399]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] answered [[G611]] him [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] it be [[G1488]] thou, [[G4771]] bid [[G2753]] me [[G3165]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] thee [[G4571]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] water. [[G5204]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Come. [[G2064]]  And when [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] was come down [[G2597]] out [[G575]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] he walked [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] to go [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] when he saw [[G991]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] boisterous, [[G2478]] he was afraid; [[G5399]] and [[G2532]] beginning [[G756]] to sink, [[G2670]] he cried, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] save [[G4982]] me. [[G3165]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] immediately [[G2112]] Jesus [[G2424]] stretched forth [[G1614]] hand, [[G5495]] and caught [[G1949]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] O thou of little faith, [[G3640]] wherefore [[G1519]] didst thou doubt? [[G1365]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] when they [[G846]] were come [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] ceased. [[G2869]]

### 33
Then [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] that were [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] came [[G2064]] and worshipped [[G4352]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Of a truth [[G230]] thou art [[G1488]] the Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] when they were gone over, [[G1276]] they came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] of Gennesaret. [[G1082]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] of that [[G1565]] place [[G5117]] had knowledge of [[G1921]] him, [[G846]] they sent out [[G649]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3650]] that [[G1565]] country round about, [[G4066]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G4374]] unto him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] that were [[G2192]] diseased; [[G2560]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] only [[G3440]] they might [[G680]] touch [[G680]] the [[G3588]] hem [[G2899]] of his [[G846]] garment: [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] as many as [[G3745]] touched [[G680]] were made perfectly whole. [[G1295]]
