### 1
And [[G2532]] when he had called unto [[G4341]] his [[G846]] twelve [[G1427]] disciples, [[G3101]] he gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] power [[G1849]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] to [[G5620]] cast [[G1544]] them [[G846]] out, [[G1544]] and [[G2532]] to heal [[G2323]] all manner of [[G3956]] sickness [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] all manner of [[G3956]] disease. [[G3119]]

### 2
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] names [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G652]] twelve [[G1427]] apostles [[G652]] are [[G2076]] these; [[G5023]] The first, [[G4413]] Simon, [[G4613]] who is called [[G3004]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] Andrew [[G406]] his [[G846]] brother; [[G80]] James [[G2385]] the son [[G3588]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] his [[G846]] brother; [[G80]]

### 3
Philip, [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] Bartholomew; [[G918]] Thomas, [[G2381]] and [[G2532]] Matthew [[G3156]] the [[G3588]] publican; [[G5057]] James [[G2385]] the son [[G3588]] of Alphaeus, [[G256]] and [[G2532]] Lebbaeus, [[G3002]] whose surname was [[G1941]] Thaddaeus; [[G2280]]

### 4
Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] Canaanite, [[G2581]] and [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] who [[G3860]] also [[G2532]] betrayed [[G3860]] him. [[G846]]

### 5
These [[G5128]] twelve [[G1427]] Jesus [[G2424]] sent forth, [[G649]] and commanded [[G3853]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Go [[G565]] not [[G3361]] into [[G1519]] the way [[G3598]] of the Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] city [[G4172]] of the Samaritans [[G4541]] enter ye [[G1525]] not: [[G3361]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] go [[G4198]] rather [[G3123]] to [[G4314]] the lost [[G622]] sheep [[G4263]] of the house [[G3624]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] as ye go, [[G4198]] preach, [[G2784]] saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is at hand. [[G1448]]

### 8
Heal [[G2323]] the sick, [[G770]] cleanse [[G2511]] the lepers, [[G3015]] raise [[G1453]] the dead, [[G3498]] cast out [[G1544]] devils: [[G1140]] freely [[G1432]] ye have received, [[G2983]] freely [[G1432]] give. [[G1325]]

### 9
Provide [[G2932]] neither [[G3361]] gold, [[G5557]] nor [[G3366]] silver, [[G696]] nor [[G3366]] brass [[G5475]] in [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] purses, [[G2223]]

### 10
Nor [[G3361]] scrip [[G4082]] for [[G1519]] journey, [[G3598]] neither [[G3366]] two [[G1417]] coats, [[G5509]] neither [[G3366]] shoes, [[G5266]] nor yet [[G3366]] staves: [[G4464]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] workman [[G2040]] is [[G2076]] worthy [[G514]] of his [[G846]] meat. [[G5160]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] into [[G1519]] whatsoever [[G302]] city [[G4172]] or [[G2228]] town [[G2968]] ye shall enter, [[G1525]] inquire [[G1833]] who [[G5101]] in [[G1722]] it [[G846]] is [[G2076]] worthy; [[G514]] and there [[G2546]] abide [[G3306]] till [[G2193]] ye [[G302]] go thence. [[G1831]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] when ye come [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] an house, [[G3614]] salute [[G782]] it. [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] be [[G5600]] worthy, [[G514]] let [[G2064]] your [[G5216]] peace [[G1515]] come [[G2064]] upon [[G1909]] it: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] it be [[G5600]] not [[G3361]] worthy, [[G514]] your [[G5216]] let [[G1994]] peace [[G1515]] return [[G1994]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall [[G1209]] not [[G3361]] receive [[G1209]] you, [[G5209]] nor [[G3366]] hear [[G191]] your [[G5216]] words, [[G3056]] when ye depart out of [[G1831]] that [[G1565]] house [[G3614]] or [[G2228]] city, [[G4172]] shake off [[G1621]] the [[G3588]] dust [[G2868]] of [[G5216]] your [[G5216]] feet. [[G4228]]

### 15
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] It shall be [[G2071]] more tolerable [[G414]] for the land [[G1093]] of Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] Gomorrha [[G1116]] in [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] of judgment, [[G2920]] than [[G2228]] for [[G4172]] that [[G1565]] city. [[G4172]]

### 16
Behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] send [[G649]] you [[G5209]] forth [[G649]] as [[G5613]] sheep [[G4263]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of wolves: [[G3074]] be ye [[G1096]] therefore [[G3767]] wise [[G5429]] as [[G5613]] serpents, [[G3789]] and [[G2532]] harmless [[G185]] as [[G5613]] doves. [[G4058]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] men: [[G444]] for [[G1063]] they will deliver [[G3860]] you [[G5209]] up to [[G1519]] the councils, [[G4892]] and [[G2532]] they will scourge [[G3146]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues; [[G4864]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] ye shall be brought [[G71]] before [[G1909]] governors [[G2232]] and [[G2532]] kings [[G935]] for sake, [[G1752]] my [[G1700]] for [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] against them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] they deliver up, [[G3860]] you [[G5209]] no [[G3361]] take [[G3309]] thought [[G3309]] how [[G4459]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] ye shall speak: [[G2980]] for [[G1063]] it shall be given [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]] that same [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]] what [[G5101]] ye shall speak. [[G2980]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] it is [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] ye [[G5210]] that speak, [[G2980]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G3962]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] which speaketh [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] the brother [[G80]] shall deliver up [[G3860]] the brother [[G80]] to [[G1519]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] the father [[G3962]] the child: [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] the children [[G5043]] shall rise up [[G1881]] against [[G1909]] parents, [[G1118]] and [[G2532]] cause to be put to [[G2289]] them [[G846]] death. [[G2289]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] ye shall be [[G2071]] hated [[G3404]] of [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] for [[G1223]] my [[G3450]] name's [[G3686]] sake: [[G1223]] but [[G1161]] that endureth [[G5278]] he [[G3778]] to [[G1519]] the end [[G5056]] be [[G3778]] shall [[G4982]] saved. [[G4982]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] they persecute [[G1377]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] city, [[G4172]] flee [[G5343]] ye [[G5343]] into [[G1519]] another: [[G243]] for [[G1063]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] not [[G3756]] Ye shall have gone [[G5055]] over [[G5055]] the [[G3588]] cities [[G4172]] of [[G2474]] Israel, [[G2474]] till [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] be come. [[G2064]]

### 24
The disciple [[G3101]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] above [[G5228]] master, [[G1320]] nor [[G3761]] the servant [[G1401]] above [[G5228]] his [[G846]] lord. [[G2962]]

### 25
It is enough [[G713]] the [[G3588]] for [[G3101]] disciple [[G3101]] that [[G2443]] he be [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] his [[G846]] master, [[G1320]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] as [[G5613]] his [[G846]] lord. [[G2962]] If [[G1487]] they have called [[G2564]] the [[G3588]] master of the house [[G3617]] Beelzebub, [[G954]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] them of [[G3615]] his [[G846]] household? [[G3615]]

### 26
Fear [[G5399]] them [[G846]] not [[G3361]] therefore: [[G3767]] for [[G1063]] there is [[G2076]] nothing [[G3762]] covered, [[G2572]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G601]] revealed; [[G601]] and [[G2532]] hid, [[G2927]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G1097]] known. [[G1097]]

### 27
What [[G3739]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]] darkness, [[G4653]] speak [[G2036]] ye [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] light: [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] ye hear [[G191]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ear, [[G3775]] preach ye [[G2784]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetops. [[G1430]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] fear [[G5399]] not [[G3361]] them [[G3588]] which kill [[G615]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] but [[G1161]] not [[G3361]] are [[G1410]] able [[G1410]] to kill [[G615]] the [[G3588]] soul: [[G5590]] but [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] fear [[G5399]] him [[G3588]] which is able [[G1410]] to destroy [[G622]] both [[G2532]] soul [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] body [[G4983]] in [[G1722]] hell. [[G1067]]

### 29
not [[G3780]] Are [[G4453]] two [[G1417]] sparrows [[G4765]] sold [[G4453]] for a farthing? [[G787]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G4098]] fall [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] without [[G427]] your [[G5216]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] very [[G2532]] hairs [[G2359]] your [[G5216]] of [[G2776]] head [[G2776]] are [[G1526]] all [[G3956]] numbered. [[G705]]

### 31
Fear ye [[G5399]] not [[G3361]] therefore, [[G3767]] ye [[G5210]] are of more value [[G1308]] many [[G4183]] than [[G4765]] sparrows. [[G4765]]

### 32
Whosoever [[G3956]] therefore [[G3767]] shall [[G3748]] confess [[G3670]] me [[G1698]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] him [[G846]] will confess [[G3670]] I [[G2504]] also [[G2504]] before [[G1715]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 33
But [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3748]] shall deny [[G720]] me [[G3165]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] him [[G846]] will [[G720]] I also [[G2504]] deny [[G720]] before [[G1715]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 34
Think [[G3543]] not [[G3361]] that [[G3754]] I am come [[G2064]] to send [[G906]] peace [[G1515]] on [[G1909]] earth: [[G1093]] I came [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] to send [[G906]] peace, [[G1515]] but [[G235]] a sword. [[G3162]]

### 35
For [[G1063]] I am come [[G2064]] to set at [[G1369]] a man [[G444]] variance [[G1369]] against [[G2596]] his [[G846]] father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the daughter [[G2364]] against [[G2596]] her [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] the daughter in law [[G3565]] against [[G2596]] her [[G846]] mother in law. [[G3994]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] a man's [[G444]] foes [[G2190]] they of [[G3615]] his own [[G846]] household. [[G3615]]

### 37
He that loveth [[G5368]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother [[G3384]] more [[G5228]] than [[G5228]] me [[G1691]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] of me: [[G3450]] and [[G2532]] he that loveth [[G5368]] son [[G5207]] or [[G2228]] daughter [[G2364]] more [[G5228]] than [[G5228]] me [[G1691]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] of me. [[G3450]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] that [[G3739]] he [[G2983]] taketh [[G2983]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] cross, [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] followeth [[G190]] after [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] of me. [[G3450]]

### 39
He that findeth [[G2147]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] shall lose [[G622]] it: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he that loseth [[G622]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for sake [[G1752]] my [[G1700]] shall find [[G2147]] it. [[G846]]

### 40
He that receiveth [[G1209]] you [[G5209]] receiveth [[G1209]] me, [[G1691]] and [[G2532]] he that receiveth [[G1209]] me [[G1691]] receiveth [[G1209]] him that sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 41
He that receiveth [[G1209]] a prophet [[G4396]] in [[G1519]] the name [[G3686]] of a prophet [[G4396]] shall receive [[G2983]] a prophet's [[G4396]] reward; [[G3408]] and [[G2532]] he that receiveth [[G1209]] a righteous man [[G1342]] in [[G1519]] the name [[G3686]] of a righteous man [[G1342]] shall receive [[G2983]] a righteous man's [[G1342]] reward. [[G3408]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall give to drink [[G4222]] unto one of [[G1520]] these [[G5130]] little [[G3398]] ones [[G3398]] a cup [[G4221]] of cold [[G5593]] only [[G3440]] in [[G1519]] the name [[G3686]] of a disciple, [[G3101]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] in no [[G3756]] he shall [[G622]] wise [[G3361]] lose [[G622]] his [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]]
