### 1
Then [[G5119]] spake [[G2980]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3793]] multitude, [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] to [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 2
Saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] sit [[G2523]] in [[G1909]] Moses' [[G3475]] seat: [[G2515]]

### 3
All [[G3956]] therefore [[G3767]] whatsoever [[G3745]] they bid [[G2036]] you [[G5213]] observe, [[G5083]] observe [[G5083]] and [[G2532]] do; [[G4160]] but [[G1161]] do [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] after [[G2596]] ye [[G4160]] their [[G846]] works: [[G2041]] for [[G1063]] they say, [[G3004]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] not. [[G3756]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] they bind [[G1195]] heavy [[G926]] burdens [[G5413]] and [[G2532]] grievous to be borne, [[G1419]] and [[G2532]] lay [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] men's [[G444]] shoulders; [[G5606]] but [[G1161]] they will [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] move [[G2795]] them [[G846]] with one of [[G1147]] their [[G846]] fingers. [[G1147]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] their [[G846]] works [[G2041]] they do [[G4160]] for [[G4314]] to be seen [[G2300]] of men: [[G444]] they [[G1161]] make broad [[G4115]] their [[G846]] phylacteries, [[G5440]] and [[G2532]] enlarge [[G3170]] the [[G3588]] borders [[G2899]] of [[G2440]] their [[G846]] garments, [[G2440]]

### 6
And [[G5037]] love [[G5368]] the [[G3588]] uppermost rooms [[G4411]] at [[G1722]] feasts, [[G1173]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief seats [[G4410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] greetings [[G783]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] markets, [[G58]] and [[G2532]] to be called [[G2564]] of [[G5259]] men, [[G444]] Rabbi, [[G4461]] Rabbi. [[G4461]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] not [[G3361]] be [[G2564]] ye [[G5210]] called [[G2564]] Rabbi: [[G4461]] for [[G1063]] one [[G1520]] is [[G2076]] your [[G5216]] Master, [[G2519]] Christ; [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] call [[G2564]] no [[G3361]] your [[G5216]] father [[G3962]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] for [[G1063]] one [[G1520]] is [[G2076]] your [[G5216]] Father, [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 10
Neither [[G3366]] be ye called [[G2564]] masters: [[G2519]] for [[G1063]] one [[G1520]] is [[G2076]] your [[G5216]] Master, [[G2519]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] he that is greatest [[G3187]] among you [[G5216]] shall be [[G2071]] your [[G5216]] servant. [[G1249]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3748]] shall exalt [[G5312]] himself [[G1438]] shall be abased; [[G5013]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3748]] that [[G3748]] shall humble [[G5013]] himself [[G1438]] shall be exalted. [[G5312]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] for [[G3754]] ye shut up [[G2808]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]]  of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] against [[G1715]] men: [[G444]] for [[G1063]] ye [[G5210]] neither [[G3756]] go in [[G1525]] neither [[G3761]] ye that are [[G1525]] suffer [[G863]] them [[G3588]] entering [[G1525]] to go [[G863]] in. [[G1525]]

### 14
Woe [[G3759]] unto [[G1161]] you, [[G5213]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] for [[G3754]] ye devour [[G2719]] widows' [[G5503]] houses, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] for a pretence [[G4392]] long [[G3117]] make [[G4336]] prayer: [[G4336]] therefore [[G5124]] ye shall receive [[G2983]] the greater [[G4053]] damnation. [[G2917]]

### 15
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] for [[G3754]] ye compass [[G4013]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] land [[G3584]] to make [[G4160]] one [[G1520]] proselyte, [[G4339]] and [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] he is made, [[G1096]] ye make [[G4160]] him [[G846]] twofold more [[G1362]] the child [[G5207]] of hell [[G1067]] than yourselves. [[G5216]]

### 16
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] blind [[G5185]] guides, [[G3595]] which [[G3588]] say, [[G3004]] Whosoever [[G3739]] shall swear [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] it is [[G2076]] nothing; [[G3762]] but [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall swear [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gold [[G5557]] of the [[G3588]] temple, he [[G3485]] is a debtor! [[G3784]]

### 17
fools [[G3474]] and [[G2532]] blind: [[G5185]] for [[G1063]] whether [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] greater, [[G3187]] the [[G3588]] gold, [[G5557]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] that sanctifieth [[G37]] the [[G3588]] gold? [[G5557]]

### 18
And, [[G2532]] Whosoever [[G3739]] shall swear [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] it is [[G2076]] nothing; [[G3762]] but [[G1161]] whosoever [[G302]] sweareth [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1435]] that [[G3588]] is upon [[G1883]] it, [[G846]] he is guilty. [[G3784]]

### 19
fools [[G3474]] and [[G2532]] blind: [[G5185]] for [[G1063]] whether [[G5101]] greater, [[G3187]] the [[G3588]] gift, [[G1435]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] that sanctifieth [[G37]] the [[G3588]] gift? [[G1435]]

### 20
Whoso shall [[G3660]] therefore [[G3767]] swear [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] sweareth [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] all things [[G3956]] thereon. [[G1883]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] whoso shall swear [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] sweareth [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] him that dwelleth [[G2730]] therein. [[G846]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that shall swear [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] sweareth [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] him [[G3588]] that sitteth [[G2521]] thereon. [[G1883]]

### 23
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] for [[G3754]] ye pay tithe [[G586]] of mint [[G2238]] and [[G2532]] anise [[G432]] and [[G2532]] cummin, [[G2951]] and [[G2532]] have omitted [[G863]] the [[G3588]] weightier [[G926]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law, [[G3551]] judgment, [[G2920]] mercy, [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] faith: [[G4102]] these [[G5023]] ought [[G1163]] ye [[G1163]] to have done, [[G4160]] and the [[G2548]] not [[G3361]] to leave undone. [[G863]] other [[G2548]]

### 24
blind [[G5185]] guides, [[G3595]] which strain at [[G1368]] a [[G3588]] gnat, [[G2971]] and [[G1161]] swallow [[G2666]] a camel. [[G2574]]

### 25
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] for [[G3754]] ye make clean [[G2511]] the [[G3588]] outside [[G1855]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4221]] cup [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3953]] platter, [[G3953]] but [[G1161]] within [[G2081]] they are full [[G1073]] of [[G1537]] extortion [[G724]] and [[G2532]] excess. [[G192]]

### 26
blind [[G5185]] Pharisee, [[G5330]] cleanse [[G2511]] first [[G4412]] that [[G3588]] within [[G1787]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] platter, [[G3953]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] outside [[G1622]] of them [[G846]] may be [[G1096]] clean [[G2513]] also. [[G2532]]

### 27
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] for [[G3754]] ye are like unto [[G3945]] whited [[G2867]] sepulchres, [[G5028]] which [[G3748]] indeed [[G3303]] appear [[G5316]] beautiful [[G5611]] outward, [[G1855]] but [[G1161]] within [[G2081]] are [[G1073]] full [[G1073]] of [[G3747]] dead [[G3498]] bones, [[G3747]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] of [[G167]] uncleanness. [[G167]]

### 28
Even so [[G3779]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] outwardly [[G1855]] appear [[G5316]] righteous [[G1342]] unto men, [[G444]] but [[G1161]] within [[G2081]] ye are [[G2075]] full [[G3324]] of hypocrisy [[G5272]] and [[G2532]] iniquity. [[G458]]

### 29
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] because [[G3754]] ye build [[G3618]] the [[G3588]] tombs [[G5028]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] garnish [[G2885]] the [[G3588]] sepulchres [[G3419]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1342]] righteous, [[G1342]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] say, [[G3004]] If [[G1487]] we had been [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of [[G3962]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]] not [[G3756]] we [[G302]] would have [[G1510]] been [[G1510]] partakers [[G2844]] with them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 31
Wherefore [[G5620]] ye be witnesses [[G3140]] unto yourselves, [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] the children [[G5207]] of them which killed [[G5407]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 32
Fill [[G4137]]  ye [[G5210]] up [[G4137]] then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] measure [[G3358]] of [[G3962]] your [[G5216]] fathers. [[G3962]]

### 33
serpents, [[G3789]] generation [[G1081]] of vipers, [[G2191]] how can [[G4459]] ye escape [[G5343]] the [[G3588]] damnation [[G2920]] of [[G3588]] hell? [[G1067]]

### 34
Wherefore, [[G1223]] behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] send [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] wise men, [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] scribes: [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] ye shall kill [[G615]] and [[G2532]] crucify; [[G4717]] and [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] shall ye scourge [[G3146]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] persecute [[G1377]] from [[G575]] city [[G4172]] to [[G1519]] city: [[G4172]]

### 35
That [[G3704]] upon [[G1909]] you [[G5209]] may come [[G2064]] all [[G3956]] the righteous [[G1342]] blood [[G129]] shed [[G1632]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of [[G6]] righteous [[G1342]] Abel [[G6]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Zacharias [[G2197]] son [[G5207]] of Barachias, [[G914]] whom [[G3739]] ye slew [[G5407]] between [[G3342]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] altar. [[G2379]]

### 36
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] All [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] shall come [[G2240]] upon [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 37
O Jerusalem, [[G2419]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] that killest [[G615]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] stonest [[G3036]] them which are sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] thee, [[G846]] how often [[G4212]] would [[G2309]] I have [[G2309]] gathered [[G1996]] thy [[G4675]] children [[G5043]] together, [[G1996]] even [[G3739]] as [[G5158]] a hen [[G3733]] gathereth [[G1996]] her [[G1438]] chickens [[G3556]] under [[G5259]] wings, [[G4420]] and [[G2532]] ye would [[G2309]] not! [[G3756]]

### 38
Behold, [[G2400]] your [[G5216]] house [[G3624]] is left [[G863]] unto you [[G5213]] desolate. [[G2048]]

### 39
For [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] not [[G3756]] Ye shall [[G1492]] see [[G1492]] me [[G3165]] henceforth, [[G575]] till [[G2193]] ye shall say, [[G2036]] Blessed [[G2127]] he [[G3588]] that cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of the Lord. [[G2962]]
