### 1
Judge [[G2919]] not, [[G3361]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] ye be [[G2919]] judged. [[G2919]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] with [[G1722]] what [[G3739]] judgment [[G2917]] ye judge, [[G2919]] ye shall be judged: [[G2919]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] what [[G3739]] measure [[G3358]] ye mete, [[G3354]] it shall be measured again. [[G488]] to you [[G5213]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] why [[G5101]] beholdest thou [[G991]] the [[G3588]] mote [[G2595]] that is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] brother's [[G80]] eye, [[G3788]] but [[G1161]] considerest [[G2657]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] beam [[G1385]] that is in [[G1722]] thine [[G3588]] own [[G4674]] eye? [[G3788]]

### 4
Or [[G2228]] how [[G4459]] wilt thou say [[G2046]] to brother, [[G80]] thy [[G4675]] Let [[G863]] me pull out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] mote [[G2595]] out [[G575]] of [[G3788]] thine [[G4675]] eye; [[G3788]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a beam [[G1385]] in [[G1722]] thine own [[G4675]] eye? [[G3788]]

### 5
Thou hypocrite, [[G5273]] first [[G4412]] cast out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] beam [[G1385]] out [[G1537]] of [[G3788]] thine own [[G4675]] eye; [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shalt thou see clearly [[G1227]] to cast out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] mote [[G2595]] out [[G1537]] of [[G3788]] thy [[G4675]] brother's [[G80]] eye. [[G3788]]

### 6
Give [[G1325]] not [[G3361]] that which is holy [[G40]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2965]] dogs, [[G2965]] neither [[G3366]] cast ye [[G906]] your [[G5216]] pearls [[G3135]] before [[G1715]] swine, [[G5519]] lest [[G3379]] they trample [[G2662]] them [[G846]] under [[G1722]] their [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] turn again and [[G4762]] rend [[G4486]] you. [[G5209]]

### 7
Ask, [[G154]] and [[G2532]] it shall be given [[G1325]] you; [[G5213]] seek, [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] ye shall find; [[G2147]] knock, [[G2925]] and [[G2532]] it shall be opened [[G455]] unto you: [[G5213]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] every [[G3956]] one [[G3956]] that asketh [[G154]] receiveth; [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] he that seeketh [[G2212]] findeth; [[G2147]] and [[G2532]] to him that knocketh [[G2925]] it shall be opened. [[G455]]

### 9
Or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] man [[G444]] is there [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] you, [[G5216]] whom [[G3739]] if [[G1437]] his [[G846]] son [[G5207]] ask [[G154]] bread, [[G740]] will he give [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a [[G3361]] stone? [[G3037]]

### 10
Or [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] he ask [[G154]] a fish, [[G2486]] will he give [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a [[G3361]] serpent? [[G3789]]

### 11
If [[G1487]] ye [[G5210]] then, [[G3767]] being [[G5607]] evil, [[G4190]] know how [[G1492]] to give [[G1325]] good [[G18]] gifts [[G1390]] unto [[G5043]] your [[G5216]] children, [[G5043]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] your [[G5216]] shall [[G1325]] Father [[G3962]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] give [[G1325]] good things [[G18]] to them that [[G3588]] ask [[G154]] him? [[G846]]

### 12
Therefore [[G3767]] all things [[G3956]] whatsoever [[G3745]] ye would [[G2309]] that [[G2443]] should do [[G4160]] men [[G3588]] to you, [[G5213]] do [[G4160]] ye [[G5210]] even [[G3779]] so [[G2532]] to them: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the law [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 13
Enter ye [[G1525]] in at [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] strait [[G4728]] gate: [[G4439]] for [[G3754]] wide [[G4116]] the [[G3588]] gate, [[G4439]] and [[G2532]] broad [[G2149]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] that [[G3588]] leadeth [[G520]] to [[G1519]] destruction, [[G684]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] there be [[G1526]] which [[G3588]] go in [[G1525]] thereat: [[G1223]]

### 14
Because [[G3754]] strait [[G4728]] the [[G3588]] gate, [[G4439]] and [[G2532]] narrow [[G2346]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] which [[G3588]] leadeth [[G520]] unto [[G1519]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] few [[G3641]] there be [[G1526]] that find [[G2147]] it. [[G846]]

### 15
Beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] false prophets, [[G5578]] which [[G3748]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] sheep's [[G4263]] clothing, [[G1742]] but [[G1161]] inwardly [[G2081]] they are [[G1526]] ravening [[G727]] wolves. [[G3074]]

### 16
Ye shall know [[G1921]] them [[G846]] by [[G575]] their [[G846]] fruits. [[G2590]] men [[G3385]] Do [[G4816]] gather [[G4816]] grapes [[G4718]] of [[G575]] thorns, [[G173]] or [[G2228]] figs [[G4810]] of [[G575]] thistles? [[G5146]]

### 17
Even so [[G3779]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] tree [[G1186]] bringeth forth [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit; [[G2590]] but [[G1161]] a corrupt [[G4550]] tree [[G1186]] bringeth forth [[G4160]] evil [[G4190]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 18
A good [[G18]] tree [[G1186]] cannot [[G1410]] bring forth [[G4160]] evil [[G4190]] fruit, [[G2590]] neither [[G3761]] a corrupt [[G4550]] tree [[G1186]] bring forth [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 19
Every [[G3956]] tree [[G1186]] that bringeth forth [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] good [[G2570]] fruit [[G2590]] is hewn down, [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the fire. [[G4442]]

### 20
Wherefore [[G686]] by [[G575]] their [[G846]] fruits [[G2590]] ye shall know [[G1921]] them. [[G846]]

### 21
Not [[G3756]] every [[G3956]] one [[G3956]] that saith [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Lord, [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] shall enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven; [[G3772]] but [[G235]] he that doeth [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 22
Many [[G4183]] will say [[G2046]] to me [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day, [[G2250]] Lord, [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] not [[G3756]] have we [[G4395]] prophesied [[G4395]] in [[G3686]] thy [[G4674]] name? [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] in [[G3686]] thy [[G4674]] name [[G3686]] have cast out [[G1544]] devils? [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] in [[G3686]] thy [[G4674]] name [[G3686]] done [[G4160]] many [[G4183]] wonderful works? [[G1411]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] will I profess [[G3670]] unto them, [[G846]] I [[G1097]] never [[G3763]] knew [[G1097]] you: [[G5209]] depart [[G672]] from [[G575]] me, [[G1700]] ye that work [[G2038]] iniquity. [[G458]]

### 24
Therefore [[G3767]] whosoever [[G3956]] heareth [[G191]] these [[G5128]] sayings [[G3056]] of mine, [[G3450]] and [[G2532]] doeth [[G4160]] them, [[G846]] I will liken [[G3666]] him [[G846]] unto a [[G435]] wise [[G5429]] man, [[G435]] which [[G3748]] built [[G3618]] his [[G846]] house [[G3614]] upon [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] rock: [[G4073]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rain [[G1028]] descended, [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] floods [[G4215]] came, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] blew, [[G4154]] and [[G2532]] beat upon [[G4363]] that [[G1565]] house; [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] it fell [[G4098]] not: [[G3756]] for [[G1063]] it was founded [[G2311]] upon [[G1909]] a rock. [[G4073]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] one [[G3956]] that heareth [[G191]] these [[G5128]] sayings [[G3056]] of mine, [[G3450]] and [[G2532]] doeth [[G4160]] them [[G846]] not, [[G3361]] shall be likened [[G3666]] unto a [[G435]] foolish [[G3474]] man, [[G435]] which [[G3748]] built [[G3618]] his [[G846]] house [[G3614]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sand: [[G285]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rain [[G1028]] descended, [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] floods [[G4215]] came, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] blew, [[G4154]] and [[G2532]] beat upon [[G4350]] that [[G1565]] house; [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] it fell: [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] was [[G2258]] the [[G3588]] fall [[G4431]] of it. [[G846]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] when [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had ended [[G4931]] these [[G5128]] sayings, [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] were astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] doctrine: [[G1322]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] he [[G2258]] taught [[G1321]] them [[G846]] as [[G5613]] having [[G2192]] authority, [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] scribes. [[G1122]]
