### 1
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] six [[G1803]] days [[G2250]] Jesus [[G2424]] taketh [[G3880]] Peter, [[G4074]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] bringeth [[G399]] them [[G846]] up [[G399]] into [[G1519]] an [[G3735]] high [[G5308]] mountain [[G3735]] apart, [[G2596]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] was transfigured [[G3339]] before [[G1715]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] face [[G4383]] did shine [[G2989]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] and [[G1161]] his [[G846]] raiment [[G2440]] was [[G1096]] white [[G3022]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] light. [[G5457]]

### 3
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there appeared [[G3700]] unto them [[G846]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] Elias [[G2243]] talking [[G4814]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
Then [[G1161]] answered [[G611]] Peter, [[G4074]] and said [[G2036]] unto Jesus, [[G2424]] Lord, [[G2962]] it is [[G2076]] good [[G2570]] for us [[G2248]] to be [[G1511]] here: [[G5602]] if [[G1487]] thou wilt, [[G2309]] let us make [[G4160]] here [[G5602]] three [[G5140]] tabernacles; [[G4633]] one [[G1520]] for thee, [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Elias. [[G2243]]

### 5
he [[G846]] While [[G2980]] yet [[G2089]] spake, [[G2980]] behold, [[G2400]] a [[G3507]] bright [[G5460]] cloud [[G3507]] overshadowed [[G1982]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] behold [[G2400]] a voice [[G5456]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] cloud, [[G3507]] which said, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] Son, [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] I am well pleased; [[G2106]] hear ye [[G191]] him. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] when [[G191]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [[G191]] they fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] face, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] were [[G5399]] sore [[G4970]] afraid. [[G5399]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G4334]] and touched [[G680]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Arise, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] be [[G5399]] afraid. [[G5399]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] when they had lifted up [[G1869]] their [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] they saw [[G1492]] no man, [[G3762]] save [[G1487]] Jesus [[G2424]] only. [[G3441]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] as came [[G2597]] they [[G846]] down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] Jesus [[G2424]] charged [[G1781]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Tell [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] to no [[G3367]] vision [[G3705]] man, [[G3367]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] man [[G444]] be risen [[G450]] again [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Why [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] say [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] that [[G3754]] Elias [[G2243]] must [[G1163]] first [[G4412]] come? [[G2064]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Elias [[G2243]] truly [[G3303]] shall [[G2064]] first [[G4412]] come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] restore [[G600]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] Elias [[G2243]] is come [[G2064]] already, [[G2235]] and [[G2532]] they knew [[G1921]] him [[G846]] not, [[G3756]] but [[G235]] have done [[G4160]] unto [[G1722]] him [[G846]] whatsoever [[G3745]] they listed. [[G2309]] Likewise [[G3779]] shall [[G3195]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] suffer [[G3958]] of [[G5259]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] understood [[G4920]] that [[G3754]] he spake [[G2036]] unto them [[G846]] of [[G4012]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist. [[G910]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] when were [[G2064]] they [[G846]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] multitude, there [[G3793]] came [[G4334]] to him [[G846]] a man, [[G444]] kneeling down [[G1120]] to him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 15
Lord, [[G2962]] have mercy [[G1653]] my [[G3450]] on [[G5207]] son: [[G5207]] for [[G3754]] he is lunatick, [[G4583]] and [[G2532]] sore [[G2560]] vexed: [[G3958]] for [[G1063]] ofttimes [[G4178]] he falleth [[G4098]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] oft [[G4178]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] water. [[G5204]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] I brought [[G4374]] him [[G846]] to [[G3101]] thy [[G4675]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] they could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] cure [[G2323]] him. [[G846]]

### 17
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] O [[G5599]] faithless [[G571]] and [[G2532]] perverse [[G1294]] generation, [[G1074]] how [[G2193]] long [[G4219]] shall [[G2193]] I be [[G2071]] with [[G3326]] you? [[G5216]] how [[G2193]] long [[G4219]] shall [[G2193]] I suffer [[G430]] you? [[G5216]] bring [[G5342]] him [[G846]] hither [[G5602]] to me. [[G3427]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] devil; [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] departed [[G1831]] out [[G575]] of [[G575]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] child [[G3816]] was cured [[G2323]] from [[G575]] that very [[G1565]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 19
Then [[G5119]] came [[G4334]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]]  to [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] apart, [[G2398]] and said, [[G2036]] Why [[G1302]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] we [[G2249]] cast [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out? [[G1544]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Because [[G1223]] of [[G570]] your [[G5216]] unbelief: [[G570]] for [[G1063]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] If [[G1437]] ye have [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] as [[G5613]] a grain [[G2848]] of mustard seed, [[G4615]] ye shall say [[G2046]] unto [[G3735]] this [[G5129]] mountain, [[G3735]] Remove [[G3327]] hence [[G1782]] to yonder place; [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] it shall remove; [[G3327]] and [[G2532]] nothing [[G3762]] shall be impossible [[G101]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 21
Howbeit [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] kind [[G1085]] goeth [[G1607]] not [[G3756]] out [[G1607]] but [[G3361]] by [[G1722]] prayer [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] fasting. [[G3521]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] while [[G390]] they [[G846]] abode [[G390]] in [[G1722]] Galilee, [[G1056]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] shall [[G3195]] be betrayed [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] the hands [[G5495]] of men: [[G444]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] they shall kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] he shall be raised again. [[G1453]] And [[G2532]] they were [[G3076]] exceeding [[G4970]] sorry. [[G3076]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] when were [[G2064]] they [[G846]] come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] they that received [[G2983]] tribute [[G1323]] came [[G4334]] to Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] Doth [[G5055]] your [[G5216]] master [[G1320]] pay [[G5055]] tribute? [[G1323]]

### 25
He saith, [[G3004]] Yes. [[G3483]] And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he was come [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] Jesus [[G2424]] prevented [[G4399]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] thinkest [[G1380]] thou, [[G4671]] Simon? [[G4613]] of [[G575]] whom [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] do [[G2983]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] take [[G2983]] custom [[G5056]] or [[G2228]] tribute? [[G2778]] of [[G575]] their own [[G846]] children, [[G5207]] or [[G2228]] of [[G575]] strangers? [[G245]]

### 26
Peter [[G4074]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Of [[G575]] strangers. [[G245]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G5346]] unto him, [[G846]] Then [[G686]] are [[G1526]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] free. [[G1658]]

### 27
Notwithstanding, [[G2443]] lest [[G3361]] we should offend [[G4624]] them, [[G846]] go [[G4198]] thou [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2281]] cast [[G906]] an hook, [[G44]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] the fish [[G2486]] that up; [[G305]] first [[G4412]] cometh [[G305]] and [[G2532]] when thou hast opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] thou shalt find [[G2147]] a piece of money: [[G4715]] that [[G1565]] take, [[G2983]] and give [[G1325]] unto them [[G846]] for [[G473]] me [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] thee.
