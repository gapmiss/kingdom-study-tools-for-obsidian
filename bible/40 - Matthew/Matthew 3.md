### 1
In [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] came [[G3854]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist, [[G910]] preaching [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] of Judaea, [[G2449]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Repent ye: [[G3340]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is at hand. [[G1448]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] he that [[G3588]] was spoken [[G4483]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] by [[G4396]] prophet [[G4396]] Esaias, [[G2268]] saying, [[G3004]] The voice [[G5456]] of one crying [[G994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] Prepare ye [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] make [[G4160]] his [[G846]] paths [[G5147]] straight. [[G2117]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] the same [[G846]] John [[G2491]] had [[G2192]] his [[G846]] raiment [[G1742]] of [[G575]] camel's [[G2574]] hair, [[G2359]] and [[G2532]] a leathern [[G1193]] girdle [[G2223]] about [[G4012]] his [[G846]] loins; [[G3751]] and [[G1161]] his [[G846]] meat [[G5160]] was [[G2258]] locusts [[G200]] and [[G2532]] wild [[G66]] honey. [[G3192]]

### 5
Then [[G5119]] went out [[G1607]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] region round about [[G4066]] Jordan, [[G2446]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] were baptized [[G907]] of [[G5259]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] Jordan, [[G2446]] confessing [[G1843]] their [[G846]] sins. [[G266]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] when he saw [[G1492]] many [[G4183]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] Sadducees [[G4523]] come [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] his [[G846]] baptism, [[G908]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] O generation [[G1081]] of vipers, [[G2191]] who [[G5101]] hath warned [[G5263]] you [[G5213]] to flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] to come? [[G3195]]

### 8
Bring forth [[G4160]] therefore [[G3767]] fruits [[G2590]] meet [[G514]] for repentance: [[G3341]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] think [[G1380]] not [[G3361]] to say [[G3004]] within [[G1722]] yourselves, [[G1438]] We have [[G2192]] Abraham [[G11]] to father: [[G3962]] for [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is able [[G1410]] of [[G1537]] these [[G5130]] stones [[G3037]] to raise up [[G1453]] children [[G5043]] unto Abraham. [[G11]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] now [[G2235]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] axe [[G513]] is laid [[G2749]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1186]] trees: [[G1186]] therefore [[G3767]] every [[G3956]] tree [[G1186]] which bringeth forth [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] good [[G2570]] fruit [[G2590]] is hewn down, [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the fire. [[G4442]]

### 11
I [[G1473]] indeed [[G3303]] baptize [[G907]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] water [[G5204]] unto [[G1519]] repentance: [[G3341]] but [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] cometh [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me [[G3450]] is [[G2076]] mightier than [[G2478]] I, [[G3450]] whose [[G3739]] shoes [[G5266]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] to bear: [[G941]] he [[G846]] shall baptize [[G907]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] fire: [[G4442]]

### 12
Whose [[G3739]] fan [[G4425]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] he will throughly purge [[G1245]] his [[G846]] floor, [[G257]] and [[G2532]] gather [[G4863]] his [[G846]] wheat [[G4621]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] garner; [[G596]] but [[G1161]] he will burn up [[G2618]] the [[G3588]] chaff [[G892]] with unquenchable [[G762]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 13
Then [[G5119]] cometh [[G3854]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] to [[G1909]] Jordan [[G2446]] unto [[G4314]] John, [[G2491]] to be baptized [[G907]] of [[G5259]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] forbad [[G1254]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] to be baptized [[G907]] of [[G5259]] thee, [[G4675]] and [[G2532]] comest [[G2064]] thou [[G4771]] to [[G4314]] me? [[G3165]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Suffer [[G863]] now: [[G737]] for [[G1063]] thus [[G3779]]  it [[G2076]] becometh [[G4241]] us [[G2254]] to fulfil [[G4137]] all [[G3956]] righteousness. [[G1343]] Then [[G5119]] he suffered [[G863]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] Jesus, [[G2424]] when he was baptized, [[G907]] went up [[G305]] straightway [[G2117]] out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] water: [[G5204]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] were opened [[G455]] unto him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God [[G2316]] descending [[G2597]] like [[G5616]] a dove, [[G4058]] and [[G2532]] lighting [[G2064]] upon [[G1909]] him: [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] lo [[G2400]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] Son, [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] I am well pleased. [[G2106]]
