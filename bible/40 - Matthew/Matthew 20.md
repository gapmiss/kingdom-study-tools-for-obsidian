### 1
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]]  of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] like [[G3664]] unto [[G3772]] a man [[G444]] an householder, [[G3617]] which [[G3748]] went out [[G1831]] early [[G260]] in the morning [[G4404]] to hire [[G3409]] labourers [[G2040]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] vineyard. [[G290]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] when he had agreed [[G4856]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] labourers [[G2040]] for [[G1537]] a penny [[G1220]] a [[G3588]] day, [[G2250]] he sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] vineyard. [[G290]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he went out [[G1831]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] hour, [[G5610]] and saw [[G1492]] others [[G243]] standing [[G2476]] idle [[G692]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplace, [[G58]]

### 4
And [[G2548]] said [[G2036]] unto them; [[G2036]] Go [[G5217]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] vineyard, [[G290]] and [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G3739]] is [[G5600]] right [[G1342]] I will give [[G1325]] you. [[G5213]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] went their way. [[G565]]

### 5
Again [[G3825]] he went out [[G1831]] about [[G4012]] sixth [[G1623]] the [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] ninth [[G1766]] hour, [[G5610]] and did [[G4160]] likewise. [[G5615]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] eleventh [[G1734]] hour [[G5610]] he went out, [[G1831]] and found [[G2147]] others [[G243]] standing [[G2476]] idle, [[G692]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] stand ye [[G2476]] here [[G5602]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] idle? [[G692]]

### 7
They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Because [[G3754]] no man [[G3762]] hath hired [[G3409]] us. [[G2248]] He saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Go [[G5217]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] vineyard; [[G290]] and [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G3739]] is [[G5600]] right, [[G1342]] shall ye receive. [[G2983]]

### 8
So [[G1161]] even [[G3798]] when was [[G1096]] come, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] of [[G290]] vineyard [[G290]] saith [[G3004]] unto [[G2012]] his [[G846]] steward, [[G2012]] Call [[G2564]] the [[G3588]] labourers, [[G2040]] and [[G2532]] give [[G591]] them [[G846]] hire, [[G3408]] beginning [[G756]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when they came [[G2064]] that [[G3588]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] eleventh [[G1734]] hour, [[G5610]] they received [[G2983]] every man [[G303]] a penny. [[G1220]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] when [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] came, [[G2064]] they supposed [[G3543]] that [[G3754]] they should have received [[G2983]] more; [[G4119]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] likewise [[G2532]] received [[G2983]] every man [[G303]] a penny. [[G1220]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] when they had received [[G2983]] they murmured [[G1111]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] goodman of the house, [[G3617]]

### 12
Saying, [[G3004]] These [[G3778]] last [[G2078]] have wrought [[G4160]] one [[G1520]] hour, [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] thou hast made [[G4160]] them [[G846]] equal [[G2470]] unto us, [[G2254]] which have borne [[G941]] the [[G3588]] burden [[G922]] and [[G2532]] heat [[G2742]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2250]] day. [[G2250]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] one [[G1520]] of them, [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] Friend, [[G2083]] I do [[G91]] thee [[G4571]] no [[G3756]] wrong: [[G91]] not [[G3780]] didst thou [[G4856]] agree [[G4856]] with me [[G3427]] for a penny? [[G1220]]

### 14
Take [[G142]] thine [[G4674]] and [[G2532]] go thy way: [[G5217]] I will [[G2309]] give [[G1325]] unto [[G2078]] this [[G5129]] last, [[G2078]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] unto thee. [[G4671]]

### 15
Is it [[G1832]] not [[G3756]] lawful [[G1832]] for me [[G3427]] to do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] I will [[G2309]] with [[G1722]] mine own? [[G1699]] Is [[G2076]] thine [[G4675]] eye [[G3788]] evil, [[G4190]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] good? [[G18]]

### 16
So [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] shall be [[G2071]] first, [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] last: [[G2078]] for [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] be [[G1526]] called, [[G2822]] but [[G1161]] few [[G3641]] chosen. [[G1588]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] disciples [[G3101]] apart [[G2596]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]]

### 18
Behold, [[G2400]] we go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem; [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] shall be betrayed [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] unto chief [[G749]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] unto the scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] they shall condemn [[G2632]] him [[G846]] to death, [[G2288]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] shall deliver [[G3860]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1484]] Gentiles [[G1484]] to [[G1519]] mock, [[G1702]] and [[G2532]] to scourge, [[G3146]] and [[G2532]] to crucify [[G4717]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] he shall rise again. [[G450]]

### 20
Then [[G5119]] came [[G4334]] to him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of [[G5207]] Zebedee's [[G2199]] children [[G5207]] with [[G3326]] her [[G846]] sons, [[G5207]] worshipping [[G4352]] and [[G2532]] desiring [[G154]] a certain thing [[G5100]] of [[G3844]] him. [[G846]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] wilt thou? [[G2309]] She saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Grant [[G2036]] that [[G2443]] these [[G3778]] my [[G3450]] two [[G1417]] sons [[G5207]] may sit, [[G2523]] the one [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] right hand, [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] the other [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] the left, [[G2176]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] kingdom. [[G932]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Ye know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] ye ask. [[G154]] Are ye able [[G1410]] to drink [[G4095]] of the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] shall [[G3195]] drink of, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] to be baptized [[G907]] with the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am baptized with? [[G907]] They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] We are able. [[G1410]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye shall drink [[G4095]] indeed [[G3303]] of [[G4221]] my [[G3450]] cup, [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] be baptized [[G907]] the [[G3588]] with [[G908]] baptism [[G908]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am baptized with: [[G907]] but [[G1161]] to sit [[G2523]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] right hand, [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] left, [[G2176]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] mine [[G1699]] to give, [[G1325]] but [[G235]] for whom [[G3739]] it is prepared [[G2090]] of [[G5259]] my [[G3450]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] when [[G191]] the [[G3588]] ten [[G1176]] heard [[G191]] they were moved with indignation [[G23]] against [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] called [[G4341]] them [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] Ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] princes [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] Gentiles [[G1484]] exercise dominion over [[G2634]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they that are great [[G3173]] exercise authority upon [[G2715]] them. [[G846]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] it shall [[G2071]] be [[G2071]] so [[G3779]] among [[G1722]] you: [[G5213]] but [[G235]] whosoever [[G3739]] will be [[G2309]] great [[G3173]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] let him [[G1096]] be [[G2077]] your [[G5216]] minister; [[G1249]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] will [[G2309]] be [[G1511]] chief [[G4413]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] let him be [[G2077]] your [[G5216]] servant: [[G1401]]

### 28
Even as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] came [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] to be ministered unto, [[G1247]] but [[G235]] to minister, [[G1247]] and [[G2532]] to give [[G1325]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] a [[G3588]] ransom [[G3083]] for [[G473]] many. [[G4183]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] as [[G1607]] they [[G846]] departed [[G1607]] from [[G575]] Jericho, [[G2410]] a [[G3793]] great [[G4183]] multitude [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 30
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] blind men [[G5185]] sitting [[G2521]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] way side, [[G3598]] when they heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] passed by, [[G3855]] cried out, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] Have mercy on [[G1653]] us, [[G2248]] O Lord, [[G2962]] Son [[G5207]] of David. [[G1138]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] rebuked [[G2008]] them, [[G846]] because [[G2443]] they should hold their peace: [[G4623]] but [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] cried [[G2896]] the more, [[G3185]] saying, [[G3004]] Have mercy on [[G1653]] us, [[G2248]] O Lord, [[G2962]] Son [[G5207]] of David. [[G1138]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood still, [[G2476]] and called [[G5455]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] will ye [[G2309]] that I shall do [[G4160]] unto you? [[G5213]]

### 33
They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] that [[G2443]] our [[G2257]] eyes [[G3788]] may be opened. [[G455]]

### 34
So [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] had compassion [[G4697]] and touched [[G680]] their [[G846]] eyes: [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] received sight, [[G308]] and [[G2532]] they followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]
