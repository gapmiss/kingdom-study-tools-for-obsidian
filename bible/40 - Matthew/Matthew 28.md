### 1
In the end [[G3796]] of the sabbath, [[G4521]] as it began to dawn [[G2020]] toward [[G1519]] the first [[G1520]] of the week, [[G4521]] came [[G2064]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] Mary [[G3137]] to see [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre. [[G5028]]

### 2
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there was [[G1096]] a [[G4578]] great [[G3173]] earthquake: [[G4578]] for [[G1063]] the angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] descended [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] and came [[G4334]] and rolled back [[G617]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] door, [[G2374]] and [[G2532]] sat [[G2521]] upon [[G1883]] it. [[G846]]

### 3
His [[G846]] countenance [[G2397]] was [[G2258]] like [[G5613]] lightning, [[G796]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] raiment [[G1742]] white [[G3022]] as [[G5616]] snow: [[G5510]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] for [[G575]] fear [[G5401]] of him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] keepers [[G5083]] did shake, [[G4579]] and [[G2532]] became [[G1096]] as [[G5616]] dead [[G3498]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1135]] women, [[G1135]] Fear [[G5399]] not [[G3361]] ye: [[G5210]] for [[G1063]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] ye seek [[G2212]] Jesus, [[G2424]] which was crucified. [[G4717]]

### 6
He is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] here: [[G5602]] for [[G1063]] he is risen, [[G1453]] as [[G2531]] he said. [[G2036]] Come, [[G1205]] see [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] lay. [[G2749]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] quickly, [[G5035]] and tell [[G2036]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] that [[G3754]] he is risen [[G1453]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] dead; [[G3498]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] he goeth before [[G4254]] you [[G5209]] into [[G1519]] Galilee; [[G1056]] there [[G1563]] shall ye see [[G3700]] him: [[G846]] lo, [[G2400]] I have told [[G2036]] you. [[G5213]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] they departed [[G1831]] quickly [[G5035]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre [[G3419]] with [[G3326]] fear [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] joy; [[G5479]] and did run [[G5143]] to bring [[G518]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] word. [[G518]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] as [[G5613]] they went [[G4198]] to tell [[G518]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] behold, [[G2400]] Jesus [[G2424]] met [[G528]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] All hail. [[G5463]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] came [[G4334]] and held [[G2902]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] by [[G4228]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] worshipped [[G4352]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
Then [[G5119]] said [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto them, [[G846]] not [[G3361]] Be [[G5399]] afraid: [[G5399]] go [[G5217]] tell [[G518]] my [[G3450]] brethren [[G80]] that [[G2443]] they go [[G565]] into [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and there [[G2546]] shall they see [[G3700]] me. [[G3165]]

### 11
Now [[G1161]] when were [[G4198]] they [[G846]] going, [[G4198]] behold, [[G2400]] some [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2892]] watch [[G2892]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and shewed [[G518]] the [[G3588]] unto chief [[G749]] priests [[G749]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] things that were done. [[G1096]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] when they were assembled [[G4863]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G5037]] had taken [[G2983]] counsel, [[G4824]] they gave [[G1325]] large [[G2425]] money [[G694]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G4757]] soldiers, [[G4757]]

### 13
Saying, [[G3004]] Say ye, [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G2064]] by night, [[G3571]] and stole [[G2813]] him [[G846]] we [[G2257]] while [[G2837]] slept. [[G2837]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] this [[G5124]] come [[G191]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] governor's [[G2232]] ears, [[G191]] we [[G2249]] will persuade [[G3982]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] secure [[G275]] you. [[G5209]]

### 15
So [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] money, [[G694]] and did [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] they were taught: [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] saying [[G3056]] is commonly reported [[G1310]] among [[G3844]] the Jews [[G2453]] until [[G3360]] this day. [[G4594]]

### 16
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] eleven [[G1733]] disciples [[G3101]] went away [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] where [[G3757]] Jesus [[G2424]] had appointed [[G5021]] them. [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] when they saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] they worshipped [[G4352]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] some [[G3588]] doubted. [[G1365]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G4334]] and spake [[G2980]] unto them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] All [[G3956]] power [[G1849]] is given [[G1325]] unto me [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 19
Go ye [[G4198]] therefore, [[G3767]] and teach [[G3100]] all [[G3956]] nations, [[G1484]] baptizing [[G907]] them [[G846]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3962]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost: [[G4151]]

### 20
Teaching [[G1321]] them [[G846]] to observe [[G5083]] all things [[G3956]] whatsoever [[G3745]] I have commanded [[G1781]] you: [[G5213]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] alway, [[G3956]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] end [[G4930]] the [[G3588]] of [[G165]] world. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
