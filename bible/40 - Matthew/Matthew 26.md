### 1
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] when [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had finished [[G5055]] all [[G3956]] these [[G5128]] sayings, [[G3056]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 2
Ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] after [[G3326]] two [[G1417]] days [[G2250]] is [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] passover, [[G3957]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is betrayed [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] be crucified. [[G4717]]

### 3
Then [[G5119]] assembled together [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people, [[G2992]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] palace [[G833]] the [[G3588]] of high [[G749]] priest, [[G749]] who was called [[G3004]] Caiaphas, [[G2533]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] consulted [[G4823]] that [[G2443]] they might take [[G2902]] Jesus [[G2424]] by subtilty, [[G1388]] and [[G2532]] kill [[G615]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] they said, [[G3004]] Not [[G3361]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] lest [[G2443]] there be [[G1096]] an uproar [[G2351]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 6
Now [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] when [[G1096]] was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Bethany, [[G963]] in [[G1722]] the house [[G3614]] of Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] leper, [[G3015]]

### 7
There came unto [[G4334]] him [[G846]] a woman [[G1135]] having [[G2192]] an alabaster box [[G211]] of [[G3464]] very precious [[G927]] ointment, [[G3464]] and [[G2532]] poured it [[G2708]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] head, [[G2776]] as he sat [[G345]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] saw [[G1492]] they had indignation, [[G23]] saying, [[G3004]] To [[G1519]] what purpose [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] waste? [[G684]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] ointment [[G3464]] might [[G1410]] have been sold [[G4097]] for much, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] given [[G1325]] to the poor. [[G4434]]

### 10
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] understood [[G1097]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] trouble [[G2873]]  ye [[G3930]] the [[G3588]] woman? [[G1135]] for [[G1063]] she hath wrought [[G2038]] a [[G2041]] good [[G2570]] work [[G2041]] upon [[G1519]] me. [[G1691]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] ye have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] always [[G3842]] with [[G3326]] you; [[G1438]] but [[G1161]] me [[G1691]] ye have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] always. [[G3842]]

### 12
For in that [[G1063]] she [[G846]] hath poured [[G906]] this [[G5124]] ointment [[G3464]] on [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] body, [[G4983]] she did [[G4160]] for [[G4314]] my [[G3165]] burial. [[G1779]]

### 13
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Wheresoever [[G3699]] this [[G5124]] gospel [[G2098]] shall be preached [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G2889]] shall be [[G2980]] also [[G2532]] this, [[G3739]] that [[G3739]] this woman [[G846]] hath done, [[G4160]] told [[G2980]] for [[G1519]] a memorial [[G3422]] of her. [[G846]]

### 14
Then [[G5119]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve, [[G1427]] called [[G3004]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] went [[G4198]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]]

### 15
And said [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] will ye [[G2309]] give [[G1325]] me, [[G3427]] and I [[G2504]] will deliver [[G3860]] him [[G846]] unto you? [[G5213]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] covenanted [[G2476]] with him [[G846]] thirty [[G5144]] for pieces of [[G694]] silver. [[G694]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] from [[G575]] that time [[G5119]] he sought [[G2212]] opportunity [[G2120]] to [[G2443]] betray [[G3860]] him. [[G846]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] the [[G3588]] of unleavened [[G106]] bread [[G106]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to Jesus, [[G2424]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Where [[G4226]] wilt [[G2309]] thou that [[G2309]] we prepare [[G2090]] for thee [[G4671]] to eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] passover? [[G3957]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] to [[G4314]] a [[G3588]] such [[G1170]] man, [[G1170]] and [[G2532]] say [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] Master [[G1320]] saith, [[G3004]] My [[G3450]] time [[G2540]] is [[G2076]] at hand; [[G1451]] I will keep [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] passover [[G3957]] at [[G4314]] thy house [[G4571]] with [[G3326]] my [[G3450]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] did [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] Jesus [[G2424]] had appointed [[G4929]] them; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they made ready [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] passover. [[G3957]]

### 20
Now [[G1161]] the even [[G3798]] when was [[G1096]] come, [[G1096]] he sat down [[G345]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] twelve. [[G1427]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] as did [[G2068]] they [[G846]] eat, [[G2068]] he said, [[G2036]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] shall betray [[G3860]] me. [[G3165]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] they were [[G3076]] exceeding [[G4970]] sorrowful, [[G3076]] and began [[G756]] every one [[G1538]] of them [[G846]] to say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] is it [[G1510]] I? [[G1473]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] He [[G3588]] that dippeth [[G1686]] hand [[G5495]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] dish, [[G5165]] the same [[G3778]] shall betray [[G3860]] me. [[G3165]]

### 24
The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] goeth [[G5217]] as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] of [[G4012]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] unto [[G444]] that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is betrayed! [[G3860]] it had been [[G2258]] good [[G2570]] for [[G846]] that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] if [[G1487]] he [[G846]] not [[G3756]] had been [[G1080]] born. [[G1080]]

### 25
Then [[G1161]] Judas, [[G2455]] which [[G3588]] betrayed [[G3860]] him, [[G846]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Master, [[G4461]] is it [[G1510]] I? [[G1473]] He said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou [[G4771]] hast said. [[G2036]]

### 26
And [[G1161]] as were [[G2068]] they [[G846]] eating, [[G2068]] Jesus [[G2424]] took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] blessed [[G2127]] and brake [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3101]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Take, [[G2983]] eat; [[G5315]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] body. [[G4983]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] he took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] cup, [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] gave thanks, [[G2168]] and gave [[G1325]] to them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Drink ye [[G4095]] all [[G3956]] of [[G1537]] it; [[G846]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] testament, [[G1242]] which is shed [[G1632]] for [[G4012]] many [[G4183]] for [[G1519]] the remission [[G859]] of sins. [[G266]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] I will [[G4095]] not [[G3756]] drink [[G4095]] henceforth [[G575]] of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] fruit [[G1081]] the [[G3588]] of [[G288]] vine, [[G288]] until [[G2193]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] when [[G3752]] I drink [[G4095]] it [[G846]] new [[G2537]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] Father's [[G3962]] kingdom. [[G932]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] when they had sung an hymn, [[G5214]] they went out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] of Olives. [[G1636]]

### 31
Then [[G5119]] saith [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto them, [[G846]] All [[G3956]] ye [[G5210]] shall be offended [[G4624]] because of [[G1722]] me [[G1698]] this [[G3778]] night: [[G3571]] for [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] I will smite [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] shepherd, [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4167]] flock [[G4167]] shall be scattered abroad. [[G1287]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] I [[G3165]] am risen again, [[G1453]] I will go before [[G4254]] you [[G5209]] into [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 33
Peter [[G4074]] answered [[G611]] and [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Though [[G1487]] all [[G3956]] shall be offended [[G4624]] because of [[G1722]] thee, [[G4671]] I [[G1473]] will be [[G4624]] never [[G3763]] offended. [[G4624]]

### 34
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G5346]] unto him, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] That [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] night, [[G3571]] before [[G4250]] the cock [[G220]] crow, [[G5455]] thou shalt deny [[G533]] me [[G3165]] thrice. [[G5151]]

### 35
Peter [[G4074]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Though [[G2579]] I [[G3165]] should [[G1163]] die [[G599]] with [[G4862]] thee, [[G4671]] not [[G3756]] yet will I [[G533]] deny [[G533]] thee. [[G4571]] Likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 36
Then [[G5119]] cometh [[G2064]] Jesus [[G2424]] with [[G3326]] them [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] a place [[G5564]] called [[G3004]] Gethsemane, [[G1068]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3101]] disciples, [[G3101]] Sit ye [[G2523]] here, [[G847]] while [[G2193]] I go [[G565]] and pray [[G4336]] yonder. [[G1563]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] he took with him [[G3880]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] sons [[G5207]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] and began [[G756]] to be sorrowful [[G3076]] and [[G2532]] very heavy. [[G85]]

### 38
Then [[G5119]] saith he [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] My [[G3450]] soul [[G5590]] is [[G2076]] exceeding sorrowful, [[G4036]] even unto [[G2193]] death: [[G2288]] tarry ye [[G3306]] here, [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] watch [[G1127]] with [[G3326]] me. [[G1700]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] he went [[G4281]] a little farther, [[G3397]] and fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] face, [[G4383]] and prayed, [[G4336]] saying, [[G3004]] O [[G3962]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] if [[G1487]] it be [[G2076]] possible, [[G1415]] let [[G3928]] this [[G5124]] cup [[G4221]] pass [[G3928]] from [[G575]] me: [[G1700]] nevertheless [[G4133]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] will, [[G2309]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] thou [[G4771]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] he cometh [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] findeth [[G2147]] them [[G846]] asleep, [[G2518]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto Peter, [[G4074]] What, [[G3779]] could ye [[G2480]] not [[G3756]] watch [[G1127]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] one [[G1520]] hour? [[G5610]]

### 41
Watch [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] pray, [[G4336]] that [[G2443]] ye enter [[G1525]] not [[G3361]] into [[G1519]] temptation: [[G3986]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] indeed [[G3303]] willing, [[G4289]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] weak. [[G772]]

### 42
He went away [[G565]] again [[G3825]] the [[G1537]] second time, [[G1208]] and prayed, [[G4336]] saying, [[G3004]] O [[G3962]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] if [[G1487]] this [[G5124]] cup [[G4221]] may [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] pass away [[G3928]] from [[G575]] me, [[G1700]] except [[G1437]] I drink [[G4095]] it, [[G846]] thy [[G4675]] will [[G2307]] be done. [[G1096]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] and found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] asleep [[G2518]] again: [[G3825]] for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were [[G2258]] heavy. [[G916]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] he left [[G863]] them, [[G846]] and went away [[G565]] again, [[G3825]] and prayed [[G4336]] the [[G1537]] third time, [[G5154]] saying [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] words. [[G3056]]

### 45
Then [[G5119]] cometh he [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Sleep on [[G2518]] now, [[G3063]] and [[G2532]] take rest: [[G373]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] is at hand, [[G1448]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is betrayed [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] the hands [[G5495]] of sinners. [[G268]]

### 46
Rise, [[G1453]] let us be going: [[G71]] behold, [[G2400]] he is at hand [[G1448]] that doth betray [[G3860]] me. [[G3165]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] while [[G2980]] yet [[G2089]] spake, [[G2980]] lo, [[G2400]] Judas, [[G2455]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve, [[G1427]] came, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] a [[G3793]] great [[G4183]] multitude [[G3793]] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] staves, [[G3586]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people. [[G2992]]

### 48
Now [[G1161]] he that betrayed [[G3860]] him [[G846]] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] a sign, [[G4592]] saying, [[G3004]] Whomsoever [[G3739]] I shall kiss, [[G5368]] that same [[G846]] is he: [[G2076]] hold [[G2902]] him [[G846]] fast. [[G2902]]

### 49
And [[G2532]] forthwith [[G2112]] he came to [[G4334]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and said, [[G2036]] Hail, [[G5463]] master; [[G4461]] and [[G2532]] kissed [[G2705]] him. [[G846]]

### 50
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Friend, [[G2083]] wherefore [[G1909]] art thou come? [[G3918]] Then [[G5119]] came [[G4334]] they, and laid [[G1911]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2902]] him. [[G846]]

### 51
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] one [[G1520]] of them which were [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] stretched out [[G1614]] hand, [[G5495]] and drew [[G645]] his [[G846]] sword, [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] struck [[G3960]] a [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] of high [[G749]] priest's, [[G749]] and smote off [[G851]] his [[G846]] ear. [[G5621]]

### 52
Then [[G5119]] said [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto him, [[G846]] Put up again [[G654]] thy [[G4675]] sword [[G3162]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] place: [[G5117]] for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] they that take [[G2983]] the sword [[G3162]] shall perish [[G622]] with [[G1722]] the sword. [[G3162]]

### 53
Thinkest [[G1380]] thou [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] I cannot [[G1410]] now [[G737]] pray [[G3870]] to [[G3962]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] he shall presently give [[G3936]] me [[G3427]] more [[G4119]] than [[G2228]] twelve [[G1427]] legions [[G3003]] of angels? [[G32]]

### 54
But how [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] shall be [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] scriptures [[G1124]] fulfilled, [[G4137]] that [[G3754]] thus [[G3779]] it must [[G1163]] be? [[G1096]]

### 55
In [[G1722]] that same [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3793]] multitudes, [[G3793]] Are ye come out [[G1831]] as [[G5613]] against [[G1909]] a thief [[G3027]] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] staves [[G3586]] for to take [[G4815]] me? [[G3165]] I sat [[G2516]] daily [[G2596]] with [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] ye laid on [[G2902]] hold [[G2902]] me. [[G3165]]

### 56
But [[G1161]] all [[G3650]] this [[G5124]] was done, [[G1096]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] scriptures [[G1124]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets [[G4396]] might be fulfilled. [[G4137]] Then [[G5119]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] forsook [[G863]] him, [[G846]] and fled. [[G5343]]

### 57
And [[G1161]] they that had laid hold on [[G2902]] Jesus [[G2424]] led [[G520]] away [[G520]] to [[G4314]] Caiaphas [[G2533]] the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] were assembled. [[G4863]]

### 58
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] followed [[G190]] him [[G846]] afar [[G3113]] off [[G575]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] high priest's [[G749]] palace, [[G833]] and [[G2532]] went [[G1525]] in, [[G2080]] and sat [[G2521]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] servants, [[G5257]] to see [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] end. [[G5056]]

### 59
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]] sought [[G2212]] false witness [[G5577]] against [[G2596]] Jesus, [[G2424]] to [[G3704]] him [[G846]] put to [[G2289]] death; [[G2289]]

### 60
But [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] none: [[G3756]] yea, though [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] false witnesses [[G5575]] came, [[G4334]] found they [[G2147]] none. [[G3756]] At the last [[G5305]] came [[G4334]] two [[G1417]] false witnesses, [[G5575]]

### 61
And said, [[G2036]] This [[G3778]] said, [[G5346]] I am able [[G1410]] to destroy [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] to build [[G3618]] it [[G846]] in [[G1223]] three [[G5140]] days. [[G2250]]

### 62
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] arose, [[G450]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Answerest thou [[G611]] nothing? [[G3762]] what [[G5101]] these [[G3778]] witness against [[G2649]] thee? [[G4675]]

### 63
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] held his peace. [[G4623]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] I adjure [[G1844]] thee [[G4571]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] thou tell [[G2036]] us [[G2254]] whether [[G1487]] thou [[G4771]] be [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 64
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou [[G4771]] hast said: [[G2036]] nevertheless [[G4133]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Hereafter [[G575]] shall ye see [[G3700]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] man [[G444]] sitting [[G2521]] on [[G1537]] the right hand [[G1188]] of [[G3588]] power, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] clouds [[G3507]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 65
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] rent [[G1284]] his [[G846]] clothes, [[G2440]] saying, [[G3004]] He hath spoken blasphemy; [[G987]] what [[G5101]] further [[G2089]] need [[G5532]] have we [[G2192]] of witnesses? [[G3144]] behold, [[G1492]] now [[G3568]] ye have heard [[G191]] his [[G846]] blasphemy. [[G988]]

### 66
What [[G5101]] think [[G1380]] ye? [[G5213]] They [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and [[G1161]] said, [[G2036]] He is [[G2076]] guilty of [[G1777]] death. [[G2288]]

### 67
Then [[G5119]] did they spit [[G1716]] in [[G1519]] his [[G846]] face, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] buffeted [[G2852]] him; [[G846]] and [[G1161]] others [[G3588]] smote [[G4474]] with the palms of their hands, [[G4474]]

### 68
Saying, [[G3004]] Prophesy [[G4395]] unto us, [[G2254]] thou Christ, [[G5547]] Who [[G5101]] is he [[G2076]] that smote [[G3817]] thee? [[G4571]]

### 69
Now [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] sat [[G2521]] without [[G1854]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] palace: [[G833]] and [[G2532]] a [[G1520]] damsel [[G3814]] came [[G4334]] unto [[G4334]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] wast [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] of Galilee. [[G1057]]

### 70
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] denied [[G720]] before [[G1715]] all, [[G3956]] saying, [[G3004]] I know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] thou sayest. [[G3004]]

### 71
And [[G1161]] when was out [[G1831]] he [[G846]] gone [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] porch, [[G4440]] another [[G243]] saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] them [[G3588]] unto that were [[G1563]] there, [[G1563]] This [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] also [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth. [[G3480]]

### 72
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he denied [[G720]] with [[G3326]] an oath, [[G3727]] I do [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G444]]

### 73
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] a while [[G3397]] came [[G4334]] unto [[G4334]] they that stood by, [[G2476]] and said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] Peter, [[G4074]] Surely [[G230]] thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] art [[G1488]] of [[G1537]] them; [[G846]] for [[G1063]] thy [[G4675]] speech [[G2981]] bewrayeth [[G1212]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 74
Then [[G5119]] began [[G756]] he [[G756]] to curse [[G2653]] and [[G2532]] to swear, [[G3660]] I know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G444]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] the cock [[G220]] crew. [[G5455]]

### 75
And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] remembered [[G3415]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] of Jesus, [[G2424]] which said [[G2046]] unto him, [[G846]] Before [[G4250]] the cock [[G220]] crow, [[G5455]] thou shalt deny [[G533]] me [[G3165]] thrice. [[G5151]] And [[G2532]] he went [[G1831]] out, [[G1854]] and wept [[G2799]] bitterly. [[G4090]]
