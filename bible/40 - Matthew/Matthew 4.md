### 2
And [[G2532]] when he had fasted [[G3522]] forty [[G5062]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] forty [[G5062]] nights, [[G3571]] afterward [[G5305]] he was an [[G3983]] hungred. [[G3983]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] It is written, [[G1125]] Man [[G444]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2198]] live [[G2198]] by [[G1909]] bread [[G740]] alone, [[G3441]] but [[G235]] by [[G1909]] every [[G3956]] word [[G4487]] that proceedeth [[G1607]] out of [[G1223]] the mouth [[G4750]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] thou be [[G1488]] the Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] cast [[G906]] thyself [[G4572]] down: [[G2736]] for [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] his [[G846]] He shall give [[G1781]] angels [[G32]] charge [[G1781]] concerning [[G4012]] thee: [[G4675]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] hands [[G5495]] they shall bear up, [[G142]] thee [[G4571]] lest [[G3379]] at any time [[G3379]] thou dash [[G4350]] thy [[G4675]] foot [[G4228]] against [[G4314]] a stone. [[G3037]]

### 7
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G5346]] unto him, [[G846]] It is written [[G1125]] again, [[G3825]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G1598]] tempt [[G1598]] the Lord [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] God. [[G2316]]

### 8
Again, [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] taketh up [[G3880]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] an exceeding [[G3029]] high [[G5308]] mountain, [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] sheweth [[G1166]] him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] kingdoms [[G932]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of them; [[G846]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] All [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] will I give [[G1325]] thee, [[G4671]] if [[G1437]] thou wilt fall down [[G4098]] and worship [[G4352]] me. [[G3427]]

### 10
Then [[G5119]] saith [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto him, [[G846]] Get thee hence, [[G5217]] Satan: [[G4567]] for [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] Thou shalt worship [[G4352]] the Lord [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] him [[G846]] only [[G3441]] shalt thou serve. [[G3000]]

### 11
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] leaveth [[G863]] him, [[G846]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] angels [[G32]] came [[G4334]] and [[G2532]] ministered [[G1247]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] when Jesus [[G2424]] had heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] John [[G2491]] was cast into prison, [[G3860]] he departed [[G402]] into [[G1519]] Galilee; [[G1056]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] leaving [[G2641]] Nazareth, [[G3478]] he came [[G2064]] and dwelt [[G2730]] in [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] which [[G3588]] is upon the sea coast, [[G3864]] in [[G1722]] the borders [[G3725]] of Zabulon [[G2194]] and [[G2532]] Nephthalim: [[G3508]]

### 14
That [[G2443]] it might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which [[G3588]] was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G1223]] Esaias [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 15
The land [[G1093]] of Zabulon, [[G2194]] and [[G2532]] the land [[G1093]] of Nephthalim, [[G3508]] the way [[G3598]] of the sea, [[G2281]] beyond [[G4008]] Jordan, [[G2446]] Galilee [[G1056]] the [[G3588]] of Gentiles; [[G1484]]

### 16
The [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] which [[G3588]] sat [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] darkness [[G4655]] saw [[G1492]] great [[G3173]] light; [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] to them [[G846]] which [[G3588]] sat [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] the region [[G5561]] and [[G2532]] shadow [[G4639]] of death [[G2288]] light [[G5457]] is sprung up. [[G393]]

### 17
From [[G575]] that time [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] began [[G756]] to preach, [[G2784]] and [[G2532]] to say, [[G3004]] Repent: [[G3340]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is at hand. [[G1448]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] Jesus, [[G2424]] walking [[G4043]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] saw [[G1492]] two [[G1417]] brethren, [[G80]] Simon [[G4613]] called [[G3004]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] Andrew [[G406]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] casting [[G906]] a net [[G293]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea: [[G2281]] for [[G1063]] they were [[G2258]] fishers. [[G231]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Follow [[G1205]] me, [[G3450]] and [[G2532]] I will make [[G4160]] you [[G5209]] fishers [[G231]] of men. [[G444]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] straightway [[G2112]] left [[G863]] nets, [[G1350]] and followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] going on [[G4260]] from thence, [[G1564]] he saw [[G1492]] other [[G243]] two [[G1417]] brethren, [[G80]] James [[G2385]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] in [[G1722]] a ship [[G4143]] with [[G3326]] Zebedee [[G2199]] their [[G846]] father, [[G3962]] mending [[G2675]] their [[G846]] nets; [[G1350]] and [[G2532]] he called [[G2564]] them. [[G846]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] immediately [[G2112]] left [[G863]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] father, [[G3962]] and followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went about [[G4013]] all [[G3650]] Galilee, [[G1056]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] preaching [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] healing [[G2323]] all manner of [[G3956]] sickness [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] all manner of [[G3956]] disease [[G3119]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] fame [[G189]] went [[G565]] throughout [[G1519]] all [[G3650]] Syria: [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] they brought [[G4374]] unto him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] sick people [[G2560]] that were taken [[G4912]] with divers [[G4164]] diseases [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] torments, [[G931]] and [[G2532]] those which were possessed with devils, [[G1139]] and [[G2532]] those which were lunatick, [[G4583]] and [[G2532]] those that had the palsy; [[G3885]] and [[G2532]] he healed [[G2323]] them. [[G846]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] there followed [[G190]] him [[G846]] great multitudes [[G4183]] of people [[G3793]] from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] Decapolis, [[G1179]] and [[G2532]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] beyond [[G4008]] Jordan. [[G2446]]
