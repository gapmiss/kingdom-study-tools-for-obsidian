### 1
Then [[G5119]] shall [[G3666]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] be likened [[G3666]] ten [[G1176]] unto [[G3933]] virgins, [[G3933]] which [[G3748]] took [[G2983]] their [[G846]] lamps, [[G2985]] and went [[G1831]] forth [[G1519]] to meet [[G529]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom. [[G3566]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] five [[G4002]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] were [[G2258]] wise, [[G5429]] and [[G2532]] five [[G4002]] foolish. [[G3474]]

### 3
They that [[G3748]] foolish [[G3474]] took [[G2983]] their [[G1438]] lamps, [[G2985]] and took [[G2983]] no [[G3756]] oil [[G1637]] with [[G3326]] them: [[G1438]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] wise [[G5429]] took [[G2983]] oil [[G1637]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] vessels [[G30]] with [[G3326]] their [[G846]] lamps. [[G2985]]

### 5
While [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] tarried, [[G5549]] they [[G3573]] all [[G3956]] slumbered [[G3573]] and [[G2532]] slept. [[G2518]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] at midnight [[G3319]] a cry [[G2906]] there was [[G1096]] made, [[G1096]] Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] cometh; [[G2064]]  go ye [[G1831]] out [[G1519]] to meet [[G529]] him. [[G846]]

### 7
Then [[G5119]] all [[G3956]] those [[G1565]] virgins [[G3933]] arose, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] trimmed [[G2885]] their [[G846]] lamps. [[G2985]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] foolish [[G3474]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G5429]] wise, [[G5429]] Give [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] of [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] oil; [[G1637]] for [[G3754]] our [[G2257]] lamps [[G2985]] are gone out. [[G4570]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] wise [[G5429]] answered, [[G611]] saying, [[G3004]] lest [[G3379]] not [[G3756]] there be [[G714]] enough [[G714]] for us [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] you: [[G5213]] but [[G1161]] go ye [[G4198]] rather [[G3123]] to [[G4314]] them that sell, [[G4453]] and [[G2532]] buy [[G59]] for yourselves. [[G1438]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] while [[G565]] they [[G846]] went [[G565]] to buy, [[G59]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] came; [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] they that were ready [[G2092]] went in [[G1525]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] marriage: [[G1062]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] was shut. [[G2808]]

### 11
Afterward [[G5305]] came [[G2064]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] virgins, [[G3933]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] open [[G455]] to us. [[G2254]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] I know [[G1492]] you [[G5209]] not. [[G3756]]

### 13
Watch [[G1127]] therefore, [[G3767]] for [[G3754]] ye know [[G1492]] neither [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] nor [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] wherein [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] cometh. [[G2064]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] a man [[G444]] travelling into a far country, [[G589]] called [[G2564]] his own [[G2398]] servants, [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] delivered [[G3860]] unto them [[G846]] his [[G846]] goods. [[G5224]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] unto one [[G3739]] he gave [[G1325]] five [[G4002]] talents, [[G5007]] to another [[G3739]] two, [[G1417]] and [[G1161]] to another [[G3739]] one; [[G1520]] to every man [[G1538]] according to [[G2596]] his several [[G2398]] ability; [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] took his journey. [[G589]]

### 16
Then [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that had received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] talents [[G5007]] went [[G4198]] and traded [[G2038]] with [[G1722]] the same, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] made [[G4160]] other [[G243]] five [[G4002]] talents. [[G5007]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] likewise [[G5615]] he that [[G3588]] two, [[G1417]] he [[G846]] also [[G2532]] gained [[G2770]] other [[G243]] two. [[G1417]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] he that had received [[G2983]] one [[G1520]] went [[G565]] and digged [[G3736]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] hid [[G613]] his [[G846]] lord's [[G2962]] money. [[G694]]

### 19
After [[G3326]] a [[G5550]] long [[G4183]] time [[G5550]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] of [[G1401]] those [[G1565]] servants [[G1401]] cometh, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] reckoneth [[G4868]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] so [[G2532]] he that had received [[G2983]] five [[G4002]] talents [[G5007]] came [[G4334]] and brought [[G4374]] other [[G243]] five [[G4002]] talents, [[G5007]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] thou deliveredst [[G3860]] unto me [[G3427]] five [[G4002]] talents: [[G5007]] behold, [[G1492]] I have gained [[G2770]] beside [[G1909]] them [[G846]] five [[G4002]] talents [[G5007]] more. [[G243]]

### 21
His [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] said [[G5346]] unto him, [[G846]] Well done, [[G2095]] good [[G18]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] servant: [[G1401]] thou hast been [[G2258]] faithful [[G4103]] over [[G1909]] a few things, [[G3641]] thee [[G4571]] I will make [[G2525]] ruler [[G2525]] over [[G1909]] many things: [[G4183]] enter thou [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] of [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] lord. [[G2962]]

### 22
also [[G2532]] He that had [[G2983]] received [[G2983]] two [[G1417]] talents [[G5007]] came [[G4334]] and said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] thou deliveredst [[G3860]] unto me [[G3427]] two [[G1417]] talents: [[G5007]] behold, [[G1492]] I have gained [[G2770]] two [[G1417]] other [[G243]] talents [[G5007]] beside [[G1909]] them. [[G846]]

### 23
His [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] said [[G5346]] unto him, [[G846]] Well done, [[G2095]] good [[G18]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] servant; [[G1401]] thou hast been [[G2258]] faithful [[G4103]] over [[G1909]] a few things, [[G3641]] thee [[G4571]] I will make [[G2525]] ruler [[G2525]] over [[G1909]] many things: [[G4183]] enter thou [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] of [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] lord. [[G2962]]

### 24
Then [[G1161]] he which had received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] talent [[G5007]] came [[G4334]] and said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] I knew [[G1097]] thee [[G4571]] that [[G3754]] thou art [[G1488]] hard [[G4642]] an [[G444]] man, [[G444]] reaping [[G2325]] where [[G3699]] not [[G3756]] thou hast [[G4687]] sown, [[G4687]] and [[G2532]] gathering [[G4863]] where [[G3606]] not [[G3756]] thou hast [[G1287]] strawed: [[G1287]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] I was afraid, [[G5399]] and went [[G565]] and hid [[G2928]] thy [[G4675]] talent [[G5007]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] lo, [[G2396]] thou hast [[G2192]] thine. [[G4674]]

### 26
His [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] wicked [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] slothful [[G3636]] servant, [[G1401]] thou knewest [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I reap [[G2325]] where [[G3699]] I sowed [[G4687]] not, [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] gather [[G4863]] where [[G3606]] not [[G3756]] I have [[G1287]] strawed: [[G1287]]

### 27
Thou [[G4571]] oughtest [[G1163]] therefore [[G3767]] to have put [[G906]] my [[G3450]] money [[G694]] the [[G3588]] to [[G5133]] exchangers, [[G5133]] and [[G2532]] at my coming [[G2064]] I [[G1473]] should have received [[G2865]] mine own [[G1699]] with [[G4862]] usury. [[G5110]]

### 28
Take [[G142]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] talent [[G5007]] from [[G575]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] him [[G3588]] unto which [[G2192]] hath [[G2192]] ten [[G1176]] talents. [[G5007]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] unto one that [[G2192]] every [[G3956]] hath [[G2192]] shall be given, [[G1325]] and [[G2532]] he shall have abundance: [[G4052]] but [[G1161]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] that hath [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] shall be taken [[G142]] away [[G575]] even [[G2532]] that which [[G3739]] he hath. [[G2192]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] cast ye [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] unprofitable [[G888]] servant [[G1401]] into [[G1519]] outer [[G1857]] darkness: [[G4655]] there [[G1563]] shall be [[G2071]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of teeth. [[G3599]]

### 31
When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] angels [[G32]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] then [[G5119]] shall he sit [[G2523]] upon [[G1909]] the throne [[G2362]] of [[G1391]] his [[G846]] glory: [[G1391]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] before [[G1715]] him [[G846]] shall be gathered [[G4863]] all [[G3956]] nations: [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] he shall separate [[G873]] them [[G846]] from [[G575]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] as [[G5618]] a [[G3588]] shepherd [[G4166]] divideth [[G873]] sheep [[G4263]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] goats: [[G2056]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] he shall set [[G2476]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] on [[G1537]] his [[G846]] right hand, [[G1188]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] goats [[G2055]] on [[G1537]] the left. [[G2176]]

### 34
Then [[G5119]] shall [[G2046]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] say [[G2046]] unto them [[G3588]] on [[G1537]] his [[G846]] right hand, [[G1188]] Come, ye [[G1205]] blessed [[G2127]] of [[G3962]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] inherit [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] prepared [[G2090]] for you [[G5213]] from [[G575]] the foundation [[G2602]] of the world: [[G2889]]

### 35
For [[G1063]] I was an hungred, [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] ye gave [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] meat: [[G5315]] I was thirsty, [[G1372]] and [[G2532]] ye gave [[G4222]] me [[G3165]] drink: [[G4222]] I was [[G2252]] a stranger, [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] ye took in: [[G4863]] me [[G3165]]

### 36
Naked, [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] ye clothed [[G4016]] me: [[G3165]] I was sick, [[G770]] and [[G2532]] ye visited [[G1980]] me: [[G3165]] I was [[G2252]] in [[G1722]] prison, [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] ye came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me. [[G3165]]

### 37
Then [[G5119]] shall [[G611]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] answer [[G611]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] when [[G4219]] saw we [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] an hungred, [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] fed [[G5142]] or [[G2228]] thirsty, [[G1372]] and [[G2532]] gave drink? [[G4222]]

### 38
When [[G4219]] saw we [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] a stranger, [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] took [[G4863]] in? [[G4863]] or [[G2228]] naked, [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] clothed [[G4016]]

### 39
Or [[G1161]] when [[G4219]] saw we [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] sick, [[G772]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] prison, [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] thee? [[G4571]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] shall answer [[G611]] and say [[G2046]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Inasmuch [[G1909]] as [[G3745]] ye have done [[G4160]] one [[G1520]] unto [[G80]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1646]] least [[G1646]] of these [[G5130]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] ye have done [[G4160]] unto me. [[G1698]]

### 41
Then [[G5119]] shall he say [[G2046]] also [[G2532]] unto them [[G3588]] on [[G1537]] the left hand, [[G2176]] Depart [[G4198]] from [[G575]] me, [[G1700]] ye cursed, [[G2672]] into [[G1519]] everlasting [[G166]] fire, [[G4442]] prepared [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] for [[G1228]] devil [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] angels: [[G32]]

### 42
For [[G1063]] I was an hungred, [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] ye gave [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] no [[G3756]] meat: [[G5315]] I was thirsty, [[G1372]] and [[G2532]] ye gave [[G4222]] me [[G3165]] no [[G3756]] drink: [[G4222]]

### 43
I was [[G2252]] a stranger, [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] ye took in: [[G4863]] me [[G3165]] not [[G3756]] naked, [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] ye clothed [[G4016]] me [[G3165]] not: [[G3756]] sick, [[G772]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] prison, [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] ye visited [[G1980]] me [[G3165]] not. [[G3756]]

### 44
Then [[G5119]] shall [[G611]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] answer [[G611]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] when [[G4219]] saw we [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] an hungred, [[G3983]] or [[G2228]] athirst, [[G1372]] or [[G2228]] a stranger, [[G3581]] or [[G2228]] naked, [[G1131]] or [[G2228]] sick, [[G772]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] prison, [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] did [[G1247]] minister [[G1247]] unto thee? [[G4671]]

### 45
Then [[G5119]] shall he answer [[G611]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Inasmuch [[G1909]] as [[G3745]] ye did [[G4160]] not [[G3756]] to one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1646]] least [[G1646]] of these, [[G5130]] ye did [[G4160]] not [[G3761]] to me. [[G1698]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] shall go away [[G565]] into [[G1519]] everlasting [[G166]] punishment: [[G2851]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] into [[G1519]] life [[G2222]] eternal. [[G166]]
