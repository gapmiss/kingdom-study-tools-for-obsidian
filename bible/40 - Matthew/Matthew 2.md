Now when [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] was born [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] Bethlehem [[G965]] of Judaea [[G2449]] in [[G1722]] the days [[G2250]] of Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] king, [[G935]] behold, [[G2400]] there came [[G3854]] wise men [[G3097]] from [[G575]] the east [[G395]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]]

[[G2453]] for [[G1063]] we have seen [[G1492]] his [[G846]] star [[G792]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] east, [[G395]] and [[G2532]] are come [[G2064]] to worship [[G4352]] him. [[G846]]

When [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] had heard [[G191]] he was troubled, [[G5015]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
And when [[G2532]] he had gathered together, [[G4863]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] he demanded [[G4441]] of [[G3844]] them [[G846]] where [[G4226]] Christ [[G5547]] should be born. [[G1080]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] In [[G1722]] Bethlehem [[G965]] of Judaea: [[G2449]] for [[G1063]] thus [[G3779]] it is written [[G1125]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] thou [[G4771]] Bethlehem, [[G965]] the land [[G1093]] of Juda, [[G2448]] art [[G1488]] not [[G3760]] the least [[G1646]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] princes [[G2232]] of Juda: [[G2448]] for [[G1063]] out of [[G1537]] thee [[G4675]] shall come [[G1831]] a Governor, [[G2233]] that [[G3748]] shall rule [[G4165]] my [[G3450]] people [[G2992]] Israel. [[G2474]]

### 7
Then [[G5119]] Herod, [[G2264]] privily [[G2977]] when he had [[G2564]] called [[G2564]] the [[G3588]] wise men, [[G3097]] inquired diligently [[G198]] of [[G3844]] them [[G846]] what time [[G5550]] the [[G3588]] star [[G792]] appeared. [[G5316]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] he sent [[G3992]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Bethlehem, [[G965]] and said, [[G2036]] Go [[G4198]] and search [[G1833]] diligently [[G199]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] young child; [[G3813]] and [[G1161]] when [[G1875]] ye have found [[G2147]] bring word again, [[G518]] me [[G3427]] that [[G3704]] I [[G2504]] may come [[G2064]] and worship [[G4352]] him [[G846]] also. [[G2504]]

### 9
When [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] had heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] king, [[G935]] they departed; [[G4198]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] star, [[G792]] which [[G3739]] they saw [[G1492]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] east, [[G395]] went before [[G4254]] them, [[G846]] till [[G2193]] it came [[G2064]] and stood [[G2476]] over [[G1883]] where [[G3757]] the [[G3588]] young child [[G3813]] was. [[G2258]]

### 10
When [[G1161]] they saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] star, [[G792]] they rejoiced [[G5463]] with exceeding [[G4970]] great [[G3173]] joy. [[G5479]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] when they were come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] they saw [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] young child [[G3813]] with [[G3326]] Mary [[G3137]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] fell down, [[G4098]] and worshipped [[G4352]] him: [[G846]] and when [[G2532]] they had opened [[G455]] their [[G846]] treasures, [[G2344]] they presented [[G4374]] unto him [[G846]] gifts; [[G1435]] gold, [[G5557]] and [[G2532]] frankincense, [[G3030]] and [[G2532]] myrrh. [[G4666]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] being warned of God [[G5537]] in [[G2596]] a dream [[G3677]] not [[G3361]] that they should [[G344]] return [[G344]] to [[G4314]] Herod, [[G2264]] they departed [[G402]] into [[G1519]] their own [[G846]] country [[G5561]] another [[G243]] way. [[G3598]]

### 13
And when [[G1161]] they [[G846]] were departed, [[G402]] behold, [[G2400]] the angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] appeareth [[G5316]] to Joseph [[G2501]] in [[G2596]] a dream, [[G3677]] saying, [[G3004]] Arise, [[G1453]] and take [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] young child [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] flee [[G5343]] into [[G1519]] Egypt, [[G125]] and [[G2532]] be [[G2468]] thou [[G2468]] there [[G1563]] until [[G2193]] I bring word: [[G2036]] thee [[G4671]] for [[G1063]] Herod [[G2264]] will [[G3195]] seek [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] young child [[G3813]] to destroy [[G622]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
When [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] arose, [[G1453]] he took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] young child [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] by night, [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] departed [[G402]] into [[G1519]] Egypt: [[G125]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] there [[G1563]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] death [[G5054]] of Herod: [[G2264]] that [[G2443]] it might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which [[G3588]] was spoken [[G4483]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]] Out of [[G1537]] Egypt [[G125]] have I called [[G2564]] my [[G3450]] son. [[G5207]]

### 16
Then [[G5119]] Herod, [[G2264]] when he saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he was mocked [[G1702]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] wise men, [[G3097]] was [[G2373]] exceeding [[G3029]] wroth, [[G2373]] and [[G2532]] sent forth, [[G649]] and slew [[G337]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] children [[G3816]] that were [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Bethlehem, [[G965]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G3725]] thereof, [[G846]] from [[G575]] two years old [[G1332]] and [[G2532]] under, [[G2736]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] which [[G3739]] he had diligently inquired [[G198]] of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] wise men. [[G3097]]

### 17
Then [[G5119]] was fulfilled [[G4137]] that which was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G5259]] Jeremy [[G2408]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 18
In [[G1722]] Rama [[G4471]] a voice [[G5456]] was there [[G191]] heard, [[G191]] lamentation, [[G2355]] and [[G2532]] weeping, [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] mourning, [[G3602]] Rachel [[G4478]] weeping [[G2799]] her [[G846]] children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] be comforted, [[G3870]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1526]] not. [[G3756]]

### 19
But when [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] was dead, [[G5053]] behold, [[G2400]] an angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] appeareth [[G5316]] in [[G2596]] a dream [[G3677]] to Joseph [[G2501]] in [[G1722]] Egypt, [[G125]]

### 20
Saying, [[G3004]] Arise, [[G1453]] and take [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] young child [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] the land [[G1093]] of Israel: [[G2474]] for [[G1063]] they are dead [[G2348]] which [[G3588]] sought [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] young child's [[G3813]] life. [[G5590]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] arose, [[G1453]] and took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] young child [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the land [[G1093]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] when he heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Archelaus [[G745]] did reign [[G936]] in [[G1909]] Judaea [[G2449]] in the room of [[G473]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Herod, [[G2264]] he was afraid [[G5399]] to go [[G565]] thither: [[G1563]] notwithstanding, [[G1161]] being warned of God [[G5537]] in [[G2596]] a dream, [[G3677]] he turned aside [[G402]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] parts [[G3313]] of Galilee: [[G1056]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] and dwelt [[G2730]] in [[G1519]] a city [[G4172]] called [[G3004]] Nazareth: [[G3478]] that [[G3704]] it might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which [[G3588]] was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] He shall be called [[G2564]] a [[G3754]] Nazarene.
