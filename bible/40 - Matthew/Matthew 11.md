### 1
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] when [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had made an end of [[G5055]] commanding [[G1299]] his [[G846]] twelve [[G1427]] disciples, [[G3101]] he departed [[G3327]] thence [[G1564]] to teach [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] to preach [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] cities. [[G4172]]

### 2
Now [[G1161]] when [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] had heard [[G191]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prison [[G1201]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of Christ, [[G5547]] he sent [[G3992]] two [[G1417]] of [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 3
And said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] he [[G3588]] that should come, [[G2064]] or [[G2228]] do we look for [[G4328]] another? [[G2087]]

### 4
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Go [[G4198]] and shew again [[G518]] John [[G2491]] those things which [[G3739]] ye do hear [[G191]] and [[G2532]] see: [[G991]]

### 5
The blind [[G5185]] receive their sight, [[G308]] and [[G2532]] the lame [[G5560]] walk, [[G4043]] the lepers [[G3015]] are cleansed, [[G2511]] and [[G2532]] the deaf [[G2974]] hear, [[G191]] the dead [[G3498]] are raised up, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] the poor [[G4434]] have the gospel preached to them. [[G2097]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] blessed [[G3107]] is [[G2076]] whosoever [[G3739]] not [[G3361]] shall be [[G4624]] offended [[G4624]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] they [[G5130]] as [[G1161]] departed, [[G4198]] Jesus [[G2424]] began [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3793]] multitudes [[G3793]] concerning [[G4012]] John, [[G2491]] What [[G5101]] went ye out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] to see? [[G2300]] A reed [[G2563]] shaken [[G4531]] with [[G5259]] the wind? [[G417]]

### 8
But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] went ye out [[G1831]] for to see? [[G1492]] A man [[G444]] clothed [[G294]] in [[G1722]] soft [[G3120]] raiment? [[G2440]] behold, [[G2400]] they that [[G3588]] wear [[G5409]] soft [[G3120]] are [[G1526]] in [[G1722]] kings' [[G935]] houses. [[G3624]]

### 9
But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] went ye out [[G1831]] for to see? [[G1492]] A prophet? [[G4396]] yea, [[G3483]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] more [[G4053]] than [[G4053]] a prophet. [[G4396]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] of [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] it is written, [[G1125]] Behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] send [[G649]] my [[G3450]] messenger [[G32]] before [[G4253]] thy [[G4675]] face, [[G4383]] which [[G3739]] shall prepare [[G2680]] thy [[G4675]] way [[G3598]] before [[G1715]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 11
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Among [[G1722]] them that are born [[G1084]] of women [[G1135]] not [[G3756]] there hath [[G1453]] risen [[G1453]] a greater than [[G3187]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist: [[G910]] notwithstanding [[G1161]] he that is least [[G3398]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] greater than [[G3187]] he. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G910]] until [[G2193]] now [[G737]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] suffereth violence, [[G971]] and [[G2532]] the violent [[G973]] take [[G726]] it [[G846]] by force. [[G726]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] prophesied [[G4395]] until [[G2193]] John. [[G2491]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] ye will [[G2309]] receive [[G1209]] this [[G846]] is [[G2076]] Elias, [[G2243]] which [[G3588]] was for [[G3195]] to come. [[G2064]]

### 15
He that hath [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] whereunto [[G5101]] shall I liken [[G3666]] this [[G3778]] generation? [[G1074]] is [[G2076]] It like unto [[G3664]] children [[G3808]] sitting [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] the markets, [[G58]] and [[G2532]] calling unto [[G4377]] their [[G846]] fellows, [[G2083]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] We have piped [[G832]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G3738]] danced; [[G3738]] we have mourned [[G2354]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G2875]] lamented. [[G2875]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] came [[G2064]] neither [[G3383]] eating [[G2068]] nor [[G3383]] drinking, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] they say, [[G3004]] He hath [[G2192]] a devil. [[G1140]]

### 19
The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] came [[G2064]] eating [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinking, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] they say, [[G3004]] Behold [[G2400]] a man [[G444]] gluttonous, [[G5314]] and [[G2532]] a winebibber, [[G3630]] a friend [[G5384]] of publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners. [[G268]] But [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] is justified [[G1344]] of [[G575]] her [[G846]] children. [[G5043]]

### 20
Then [[G5119]] began [[G756]] he [[G756]] to upbraid [[G3679]] the [[G3588]] cities [[G4172]] wherein [[G3739]] most [[G4118]] of mighty [[G1411]] his [[G846]] works [[G1411]] were done, [[G1096]] because [[G3754]] they repented [[G3340]] not: [[G3756]]

### 21
Woe [[G3759]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Chorazin! [[G5523]] woe [[G3759]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Bethsaida! [[G966]] for [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] mighty works, [[G1411]] which were done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] had been done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4605]] would have [[G302]] they [[G3340]] repented [[G3340]] long ago [[G3819]] in [[G1722]] sackcloth [[G4526]] and [[G2532]] ashes. [[G4700]]

### 22
But [[G4133]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] It shall be [[G2071]] more tolerable [[G414]] for Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon [[G4605]] at [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] of judgment, [[G2920]] than [[G2228]] for you. [[G5213]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] thou, [[G4771]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] which art exalted [[G5312]] unto [[G2193]] heaven, [[G3772]] shalt be brought down [[G2601]] to [[G2193]] hell: [[G86]] for [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] mighty works, [[G1411]] which have been done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] thee, [[G4671]] had been done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Sodom, [[G4670]] it [[G3306]] would have [[G302]] remained [[G3306]] until [[G3360]] this day. [[G4594]]

### 24
But [[G4133]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] it shall be [[G2071]] more tolerable [[G414]] for the land [[G1093]] of Sodom [[G4670]] in [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] of judgment, [[G2920]] than [[G2228]] for thee. [[G4671]]

### 25
At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] I thank [[G1843]] thee, [[G4671]] O Father, [[G3962]] Lord [[G2962]] of heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth, [[G1093]] because [[G3754]] thou hast hid [[G613]] these things [[G5023]] from [[G575]] the wise [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] prudent, [[G4908]] and [[G2532]] hast revealed [[G601]] them [[G846]] unto babes. [[G3516]]

### 26
Even so, [[G3483]] Father: [[G3962]] for [[G3754]] so [[G3779]] it seemed [[G1096]] good [[G2107]] in [[G1715]] thy [[G4675]] sight. [[G4675]]

### 27
All things [[G3956]] are delivered [[G3860]] unto me [[G3427]] of [[G5259]] my [[G3450]] Father: [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] knoweth [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] but [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Father; [[G3962]] neither [[G3761]] knoweth [[G1921]] any man [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] save [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] to whomsoever [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] will [[G1014]] reveal [[G601]]

### 28
Come [[G1205]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] all [[G3956]] that labour [[G2872]] and [[G2532]] are heavy laden, [[G5412]] and I [[G2504]] will give [[G373]] you [[G5209]] rest. [[G373]]

### 29
Take [[G142]] my [[G3450]] yoke [[G2218]] upon [[G1909]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] learn [[G3129]] of [[G575]] me; [[G1700]] for [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] meek [[G4235]] and [[G2532]] lowly [[G5011]] in heart: [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] ye shall find [[G2147]] rest [[G372]] unto [[G5590]] your [[G5216]] souls. [[G5590]]

### 30
For [[G1063]] my [[G3450]] yoke [[G2218]] easy, [[G5543]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] burden [[G5413]] is [[G2076]] light. [[G1645]]
