### 2
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there came [[G2064]] a leper [[G3015]] and worshipped [[G4352]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1437]] thou wilt, [[G2309]] thou canst [[G1410]] me [[G3165]] make [[G2511]] clean. [[G2511]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] put forth [[G1614]] hand, [[G5495]] and touched [[G680]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] I will; [[G2309]] be thou clean. [[G2511]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] his [[G846]] leprosy [[G3014]] was cleansed. [[G2511]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] See [[G3708]] thou tell [[G2036]] no man; [[G3367]] but [[G235]] go thy way, [[G5217]] shew [[G1166]] thyself [[G4572]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2409]] priest, [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] offer [[G4374]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1435]] that [[G3739]] Moses [[G3475]] commanded, [[G4367]] for [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] my [[G3450]] servant [[G3816]] lieth [[G906]] at [[G1722]] home [[G3614]] sick of the palsy, [[G3885]] grievously [[G1171]] tormented. [[G928]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] will come and [[G2064]] heal [[G2323]] him. [[G846]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G5346]] Lord, [[G2962]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] that [[G2443]] thou shouldest come [[G1525]] under [[G5259]] my [[G3450]] roof: [[G4721]] but [[G235]] speak [[G2036]] the word [[G3056]] only, [[G3440]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] servant [[G3816]] shall be healed. [[G2390]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] a [[G444]] am [[G1510]] man [[G444]] under [[G5259]] authority, [[G1849]] having [[G2192]] soldiers [[G4757]] under [[G5259]] me: [[G1683]] and [[G2532]] I say [[G3004]] to this [[G5129]] Go, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] he goeth; [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] to another, [[G243]] Come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] he cometh; [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1401]] my [[G3450]] servant, [[G1401]] Do [[G4160]] this, [[G5124]] and [[G2532]] he doeth [[G4160]]

### 10
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] he marvelled, [[G2296]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] to them that followed, [[G190]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] not no, [[G3761]] I have found [[G2147]] so great [[G5118]] faith, [[G4102]] not [[G3761]] in [[G1722]] Israel. [[G2474]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] shall come [[G2240]] from [[G575]] the east [[G395]] and [[G2532]] west, [[G1424]] and [[G2532]] shall sit down [[G347]] with [[G3326]] Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] Jacob, [[G2384]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven. [[G3772]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom [[G932]] shall be cast out [[G1544]] into [[G1519]] outer [[G1857]] darkness: [[G4655]] there [[G1563]] shall be [[G2071]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of teeth. [[G3599]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1543]] centurion, [[G1543]] Go thy way; [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] thou hast believed, [[G4100]] be it done [[G1096]] unto thee. [[G4671]] And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] servant [[G3816]] was healed [[G2390]] in [[G1722]] the [[G5610]] selfsame [[G1565]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] when was [[G2064]] Jesus [[G2424]] come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] Peter's [[G4074]] house, [[G3614]] he saw [[G1492]] his [[G846]] wife's mother [[G3994]] laid, [[G906]] and [[G2532]] sick of a fever. [[G4445]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he touched [[G680]] her [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fever [[G4446]] left [[G863]] her: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] she arose, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] ministered [[G1247]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 16
When [[G1161]] the even [[G3798]] was come, [[G1096]] they brought [[G4374]] unto him [[G846]] many [[G4183]] that were possessed with devils: [[G1139]] and [[G2532]] he cast out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] with word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] healed [[G2323]] all [[G3956]] that were [[G2192]] sick: [[G2560]]

### 17
That [[G3704]] it might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G1223]] Esaias [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]] Himself [[G846]] took [[G2983]] our [[G2257]] infirmities, [[G769]] and [[G2532]] bare [[G941]] sicknesses. [[G3554]]

### 18
Now [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] great [[G4183]] multitudes [[G3793]] about [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] he gave commandment [[G2753]] to depart [[G565]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side. [[G4008]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] a certain [[G1520]] scribe [[G1122]] came, [[G4334]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] I will follow [[G190]] thee [[G4671]] whithersoever [[G3699]] thou goest. [[G565]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] foxes [[G258]] have [[G2192]] holes, [[G5454]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] air [[G3772]] nests; [[G2682]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] hath [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] where [[G4226]] to lay [[G2827]] head. [[G2776]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] another [[G2087]] of [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] suffer [[G2010]] me [[G3427]] first [[G4412]] to go [[G565]] and [[G2532]] bury [[G2290]] my [[G3450]] father. [[G3962]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Follow [[G190]] me; [[G3427]] and [[G2532]] let [[G863]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] bury [[G2290]] their [[G1438]] dead. [[G3498]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] when was [[G1684]] he [[G846]] entered [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] a ship, [[G4143]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 24
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there arose [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] tempest [[G4578]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] insomuch that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] was covered [[G2572]] with [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] waves: [[G2949]] but [[G1161]] he [[G846]] was asleep. [[G2518]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came to [[G4334]] and awoke [[G1453]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] save [[G4982]] us: [[G2248]] we perish. [[G622]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] are ye [[G2075]] fearful, [[G1169]] O ye of little faith? [[G3640]] Then [[G5119]] he arose, [[G1453]] and rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] there was [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] calm. [[G1055]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] men [[G444]] marvelled, [[G2296]] saying, [[G3004]] What manner of man [[G4217]] is [[G2076]] this, [[G3778]] that [[G3754]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] obey [[G5219]] him! [[G846]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] when was [[G2064]] he [[G846]] come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side [[G4008]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] country [[G5561]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1086]] Gergesenes, [[G1086]] there met [[G5221]] him [[G846]] two [[G1417]] possessed with devils, [[G1139]] coming out [[G1831]]  of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tombs, [[G3419]] exceeding [[G3029]] fierce, [[G5467]] so that [[G5620]] no [[G3361]] man [[G5100]] might [[G2480]] pass [[G3928]] by [[G1223]] that [[G1565]] way. [[G3598]]

### 29
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] they cried out, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] have we [[G2254]] to do [[G2532]] with thee, [[G4671]] Jesus, [[G2424]] thou Son [[G5207]] of God? [[G2316]] art thou come [[G2064]] hither [[G5602]] to torment [[G928]] us [[G2248]] before [[G4253]] the time? [[G2540]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] a good way off [[G3112]] from [[G575]] them [[G846]] an herd [[G34]] of many [[G4183]] swine [[G5519]] feeding. [[G1006]]

### 31
So [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] devils [[G1142]] besought [[G3870]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1487]] thou cast out, [[G1544]]  us [[G2248]] suffer [[G2010]] us [[G2254]] to go away [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] herd [[G34]] of swine. [[G5519]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Go. [[G5217]] And when [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] were come out, [[G1831]] they went [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] herd [[G34]] of swine: [[G5519]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] herd [[G34]] of swine [[G5519]] ran violently [[G3729]] down [[G2596]] a steep place [[G2911]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] perished [[G599]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] waters. [[G5204]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] they that kept them [[G1006]] fled, [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] went their ways [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] told [[G518]] and [[G2532]] every thing, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] what was befallen [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] to possessed of the [[G1139]] devils. [[G1139]]

### 34
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] city [[G4172]] came out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G4877]] Jesus: [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] when they saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] they besought [[G3870]] that [[G3704]] he would depart [[G3327]] out [[G575]] of [[G3725]] their [[G846]] coasts. [[G3725]]
