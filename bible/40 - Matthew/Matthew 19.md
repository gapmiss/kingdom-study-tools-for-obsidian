### 1
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] when [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had finished [[G5055]] these [[G5128]] sayings, [[G3056]] he departed [[G3332]] from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G3725]] of Judaea [[G2449]] beyond [[G4008]] Jordan; [[G2446]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] multitudes [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he healed [[G2323]] them [[G846]] there. [[G1563]]

### 3
The [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] also [[G2532]] came [[G4334]] unto him, [[G846]] tempting [[G3985]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Is it [[G1487]] lawful [[G1832]] for a man [[G444]] to put away [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] for [[G2596]] every [[G3956]] cause? [[G156]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] Have ye [[G314]] read, [[G314]] that [[G3754]] he which made [[G4160]] at [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] made [[G4160]] them [[G846]] male [[G730]] and [[G2532]] female, [[G2338]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] For [[G1752]] this [[G5127]] cause [[G1752]] shall [[G2641]] a man [[G444]] leave [[G2641]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] shall cleave [[G4347]] to [[G1135]] his [[G846]] wife: [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] they shall [[G2071]] twain [[G1417]] be [[G2071]] one [[G1520]] flesh? [[G4561]]

### 6
Wherefore [[G5620]] they are [[G1526]] no more [[G3765]] twain, [[G1417]] but [[G235]] one [[G1520]] flesh. [[G4561]] What [[G3739]] therefore [[G3767]] God [[G2316]] hath joined together, [[G4801]] not [[G3361]] let put [[G5563]] man [[G444]] asunder. [[G5563]]

### 7
They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] Moses [[G3475]] did [[G1781]] then [[G3767]] command [[G1781]] to give [[G1325]] a writing [[G975]] of divorcement, [[G647]] and [[G2532]] to put away? [[G630]] her [[G846]]

### 8
He saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Moses [[G3475]] because [[G4314]] of the hardness [[G3588]] of [[G4641]] your [[G5216]] hearts [[G4641]] suffered [[G2010]] you [[G5213]] to put away [[G630]] your [[G5216]] wives: [[G1135]] but [[G1161]] from [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] it was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] so. [[G3779]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Whosoever [[G3739]] shall put away [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] except [[G1487]] for [[G1909]] fornication, [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] shall marry [[G1060]] another, [[G243]] committeth adultery: [[G3429]] and [[G2532]] whoso marrieth [[G1060]] her [[G3588]] which is put away [[G630]] doth commit adultery. [[G3429]]

### 10
His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] case [[G156]] the [[G3588]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] be [[G2076]] so [[G3779]] with [[G3326]] wife, [[G1135]] not [[G3756]] it is [[G4851]] good [[G4851]] to marry. [[G1060]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] All [[G3956]] cannot [[G3756]] receive [[G5562]] this [[G5126]] saying, [[G3056]] save [[G235]] to whom [[G3739]] it is given. [[G1325]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] there are [[G1526]] eunuchs, [[G2135]] some [[G3748]] which [[G3748]] were [[G1080]] so [[G3779]] born [[G1080]] from [[G1537]] mother's [[G3384]] womb: [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] there are [[G1526]] eunuchs, [[G2135]] some [[G3748]] which [[G3748]] were made eunuchs [[G2134]] of [[G5259]] men: [[G444]] and [[G2532]] there be [[G1526]] eunuchs, [[G2135]] which [[G3748]] have made [[G2134]] themselves [[G1438]] eunuchs [[G2134]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven's [[G3772]] sake. [[G1223]] He that is able [[G1410]] to receive [[G5562]] let him receive [[G5562]]

### 13
Then [[G5119]] were there brought [[G4374]] unto him [[G846]] little children, [[G3813]] that [[G2443]] he should put [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] on them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] pray: [[G4336]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] rebuked [[G2008]] them. [[G846]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Suffer [[G863]] little children, [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] forbid [[G2967]] them [[G846]] not, [[G3361]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me: [[G3165]] for [[G1063]] of such [[G5108]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven. [[G3772]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he laid [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] on them, [[G846]] and departed [[G4198]] thence. [[G1564]]

### 16
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] one [[G1520]] came [[G4334]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Good [[G18]] Master, [[G1320]] what [[G5101]] good thing [[G18]] shall I do, [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] I may have [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life? [[G2222]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] callest thou [[G3004]] me [[G3165]] good? [[G18]] none [[G3762]] good [[G18]] but [[G1487]] one, [[G1520]] God: [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] thou wilt [[G2309]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] life, [[G2222]] keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] commandments. [[G1785]]

### 18
He saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Which? [[G4169]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] no [[G3756]] Thou shalt do [[G5407]] murder, [[G5407]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt commit [[G3431]] adultery, [[G3431]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G2813]] steal, [[G2813]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt bear false [[G5576]] witness, [[G5576]]

### 19
Honour [[G5091]] thy [[G4675]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother: [[G3384]] and, [[G2532]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] thy [[G4675]] neighbour [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] thyself. [[G4572]]

### 20
The [[G3588]] young man [[G3495]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] All [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] have I kept [[G5442]] from [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] youth [[G3503]] up: [[G1537]] what [[G5101]] lack I [[G5302]] yet? [[G2089]]

### 21
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G5346]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] thou wilt [[G2309]] be [[G1511]] perfect, [[G5046]] go [[G5217]] sell [[G4453]] thou [[G4675]] that hast, [[G5224]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] to the poor, [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt have [[G2192]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] come [[G1204]] follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] when [[G191]] the [[G3588]] young [[G3495]] heard [[G191]] man [[G3495]] that [[G3588]] saying, [[G3056]] he went away [[G565]] sorrowful: [[G3076]] for [[G1063]] he [[G2258]] had [[G2192]] great [[G4183]] possessions. [[G2933]]

### 23
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] a rich man [[G4145]] hardly [[G1423]] shall [[G1525]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven. [[G3772]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] again [[G3825]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] It is [[G2076]] easier [[G2123]] a camel [[G2574]] for to [[G1330]] go [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] the eye [[G5169]] of a needle, [[G4476]] than [[G2228]] a rich man [[G4145]] for to [[G1525]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 25
When [[G1161]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [[G191]] they were [[G1605]] exceedingly [[G4970]] amazed, [[G1605]] saying, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] then [[G687]] can [[G1410]] be saved? [[G4982]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] beheld [[G1689]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] With [[G3844]] men [[G444]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] impossible; [[G102]] but [[G1161]] with [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] all things [[G3956]] are [[G2076]] possible. [[G1415]]

### 27
Then [[G5119]] answered [[G611]] Peter [[G4074]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Behold, [[G2400]] we [[G2249]] have forsaken [[G863]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] thee; [[G4671]] what [[G5101]] shall [[G2071]] we [[G2254]] have [[G2071]] therefore? [[G687]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] ye [[G5210]] which have followed [[G190]] me, [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] regeneration [[G3824]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] shall sit [[G2523]] in [[G1909]] the throne [[G2362]] of [[G1391]] his [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] shall sit [[G2523]] upon [[G1909]] twelve [[G1427]] thrones, [[G2362]] judging [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] tribes [[G5443]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] one [[G3739]] that hath forsaken [[G863]] houses, [[G3614]] or [[G2228]] brethren, [[G80]] or [[G2228]] sisters, [[G79]] or [[G2228]] father, [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother, [[G3384]] or [[G2228]] wife, [[G1135]] or [[G2228]] children, [[G5043]] or [[G2228]] lands, [[G68]] for [[G1752]] my [[G3450]] name's [[G3686]] sake, [[G1752]] shall receive [[G2983]] an hundredfold, [[G1542]] and [[G2532]] shall inherit [[G2816]] everlasting [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] first [[G4413]] shall be [[G2071]] last; [[G2078]] and [[G2532]] the last [[G2078]] first. [[G4413]]
