### 1
And [[G2532]] he entered [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] a ship, [[G4143]] and passed over, [[G1276]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] his own [[G2398]] city. [[G4172]]

### 2
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] they brought [[G4374]] to him [[G846]] a man sick of the palsy, [[G3885]] lying [[G906]] on [[G1909]] a bed: [[G2825]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] seeing [[G1492]] their [[G846]] faith [[G4102]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto sick of the [[G3885]] palsy; [[G3885]] Son, [[G5043]] be of good cheer; [[G2293]] thy [[G4675]] sins [[G266]] be forgiven [[G863]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 3
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1122]] scribes [[G1122]] said [[G2036]] within [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] This [[G3778]] blasphemeth. [[G987]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] knowing [[G1492]] their [[G846]] thoughts [[G1761]] said, [[G2036]] Wherefore [[G2444]] think [[G1760]] ye [[G5210]] evil [[G4190]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] hearts? [[G2588]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] whether [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] easier, [[G2123]] to say, [[G2036]] sins [[G266]] be forgiven [[G863]] thee; [[G4671]] or [[G2228]] to say, [[G2036]] Arise, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] walk? [[G4043]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] that [[G2443]] ye may know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] hath [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] to forgive [[G863]] sins, [[G266]] (then [[G5119]] saith he [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to sick of the [[G3885]] palsy,) [[G3885]] Arise, [[G1453]] take up [[G142]] thy [[G4675]] bed, [[G2825]] and [[G2532]] go [[G5217]] unto [[G1519]] thine [[G4675]] house. [[G3624]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] he arose, [[G1453]] and departed [[G565]] to [[G1519]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3624]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] multitudes [[G3793]] saw [[G1492]] they marvelled, [[G2296]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] which had given [[G1325]] such [[G5108]] power [[G1849]] unto men. [[G444]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] as passed [[G3855]] Jesus [[G2424]] forth [[G3855]] from thence, [[G1564]] he saw [[G1492]] a man, [[G444]] named [[G3004]] Matthew, [[G3156]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] receipt of custom: [[G5058]] and [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]] And [[G2532]] he arose, and [[G450]] followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] Jesus [[G846]] as at meat [[G345]] sat [[G345]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] behold, [[G2400]] many [[G4183]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] came [[G2064]] and sat down [[G4873]] with [[G2424]] him [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] when [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] saw [[G1492]] they [[G5330]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Why [[G1302]] eateth [[G2068]] your [[G5216]] Master [[G1320]] with [[G3326]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners? [[G268]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] when [[G191]] heard [[G191]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] They [[G3588]] that be whole [[G2480]] need [[G5532]] not [[G3756]] a physician, [[G2395]] but [[G235]] they [[G3588]] that are sick. [[G2560]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] go [[G4198]] ye and [[G4198]] learn [[G3129]] what [[G5101]] meaneth, [[G2076]] I will have [[G2309]] mercy, [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] sacrifice: [[G2378]] for [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] I am [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] to call [[G2564]] the righteous, [[G1342]] but [[G235]] sinners [[G268]] to [[G1519]] repentance. [[G3341]]

### 14
Then [[G5119]] came [[G4334]] to [[G4334]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] of John, [[G2491]] saying, [[G3004]] Why [[G1302]] we [[G2249]] do [[G3522]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] fast [[G3522]] oft, [[G4183]] but [[G1161]] thy [[G4675]] disciples [[G3101]] fast [[G3522]] not? [[G3756]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Can [[G1410]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3567]] bridechamber [[G3567]] mourn, [[G3996]] as [[G1909]] long as [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] is [[G2076]] with [[G3326]] them? [[G846]] but [[G1161]] the days [[G2250]] will come, [[G2064]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] shall be taken [[G522]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall they fast. [[G3522]]

### 16
No man [[G3762]] putteth [[G1911]] a piece [[G1915]] of new [[G46]] cloth [[G4470]] unto [[G1909]] an [[G2440]] old [[G3820]] garment, [[G2440]] for [[G1063]] that which is put in to fill up [[G4138]] it [[G846]] taketh [[G142]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] garment, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] the rent [[G4978]] is made [[G1096]] worse. [[G5501]]

### 17
Neither [[G3761]] do men put [[G906]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] old [[G3820]] bottles: [[G779]] else [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] bottles [[G779]] break, [[G4486]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] runneth [[G1632]] out, [[G1632]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] bottles [[G779]] perish: [[G622]] but [[G235]] they put [[G906]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] new [[G2537]] bottles, [[G779]] and [[G2532]] both [[G297]] are preserved. [[G4933]]

### 18
he [[G846]] While [[G2980]] spake [[G2980]] these things [[G5023]] unto them, [[G846]] behold, [[G2400]] there [[G1520]] came [[G2064]] a [[G758]] certain [[G1520]] ruler, [[G758]] and worshipped [[G4352]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] My [[G3450]] daughter [[G2364]] even now [[G737]] is dead: [[G5053]] but [[G235]] come [[G2064]] and lay [[G2007]] thy [[G4675]] hand [[G5495]] upon [[G1909]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] she shall [[G2532]] live. [[G2198]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] arose, and [[G1453]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 20
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a woman, [[G1135]] which was diseased with an issue of blood [[G131]] twelve [[G1427]] years, [[G2094]] came [[G4334]] behind [[G3693]] and touched [[G680]] the [[G3588]] hem [[G2899]] of [[G2440]] his [[G846]] garment: [[G2440]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] she said [[G3004]] within [[G1722]] herself, [[G1438]] If [[G1437]] but [[G3440]] I may [[G680]] touch [[G680]] his [[G846]] garment, [[G2440]] I shall be whole. [[G4982]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] turned him about, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] when he saw [[G1492]] her, [[G846]] he said, [[G2036]] Daughter, [[G2364]] be of good comfort; [[G2293]] thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] hath made [[G4982]] thee [[G4571]] whole. [[G4982]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] was made whole [[G4982]] from [[G575]] that [[G1565]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] when [[G2064]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ruler's [[G758]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] minstrels [[G834]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] making a noise, [[G2350]]

### 24
He said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Give place: [[G402]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] maid [[G2877]] not [[G3756]] is [[G599]] dead, [[G599]] but [[G235]] sleepeth. [[G2518]] And [[G2532]] they laughed to scorn. [[G2606]] him [[G846]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] were put forth, [[G1544]] he went in, [[G1525]] and took [[G2902]] her [[G846]] the [[G3588]] by [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] maid [[G2877]] arose. [[G1453]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fame [[G5345]] hereof [[G3778]] went abroad [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3650]] that [[G1565]] land. [[G1093]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] when [[G3855]] Jesus [[G2424]] departed [[G3855]] thence, [[G1564]] two [[G1417]] blind men [[G5185]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] crying, [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] us. [[G2248]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] when he was come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] the [[G3588]] blind men [[G5185]] came [[G4334]] to him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Believe ye [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] I am able [[G1410]] to do [[G4160]] this? [[G5124]] They [[G3004]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Yea, [[G3483]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 29
Then [[G5119]] touched he [[G680]] their [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] saying, [[G3004]] According to [[G2596]] your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] be it [[G1096]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were opened; [[G455]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] straitly charged [[G1690]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] See [[G3708]] no man [[G3367]] know [[G1097]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] they, [[G3588]] when they were departed, [[G1831]] spread abroad fame [[G1310]] his [[G846]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] that [[G1565]] country. [[G1093]]

### 32
As [[G1161]] they [[G846]] went out, [[G1831]] behold, [[G2400]] they brought [[G4374]] to him [[G846]] a dumb [[G2974]] man [[G444]] possessed with a devil. [[G1139]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] when was out, [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1140]] cast [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] dumb [[G2974]] spake: [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] multitudes [[G3793]] marvelled, [[G2296]] saying, [[G3004]] It was [[G5316]] never [[G3763]] so [[G3779]] seen [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] Israel. [[G2474]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said, [[G3004]] He casteth out [[G1544]] devils [[G1140]] through [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1140]] devils. [[G1140]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went about [[G4013]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] cities [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] villages, [[G2968]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] preaching [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] healing [[G2323]] every [[G3956]] sickness [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] disease [[G3119]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 36
But [[G1161]] when he saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] multitudes, [[G3793]] he was moved with compassion [[G4697]] on [[G4012]] them, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they were [[G2258]] fainted, [[G1590]] and [[G2532]] scattered abroad, [[G4496]] as [[G5616]] sheep [[G4263]] having [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] shepherd. [[G4166]]

### 37
Then [[G5119]] saith he [[G3004]] unto [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] The [[G3588]] harvest [[G2326]] truly [[G3303]] plenteous, [[G4183]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] labourers [[G2040]] few; [[G3641]]

### 38
Pray ye [[G1189]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2326]] harvest, [[G2326]] that [[G3704]] he will send forth [[G1544]] labourers [[G2040]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] harvest. [[G2326]]
