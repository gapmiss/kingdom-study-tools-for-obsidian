### 1
When [[G1161]] the morning [[G4405]] was come, [[G1096]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] took [[G2983]] counsel [[G4824]] against [[G2596]] Jesus [[G2424]] to [[G5620]] put to [[G2289]] him [[G846]] death: [[G2289]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] when they had bound [[G1210]] him, [[G846]] they led away, [[G520]] and [[G2532]] delivered [[G3860]] him [[G846]] to Pontius [[G4194]] Pilate [[G4091]] the [[G3588]] governor. [[G2232]]

### 3
Then [[G5119]] Judas, [[G2455]] which had betrayed [[G3860]] him, [[G846]] when he saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he was condemned, [[G2632]] repented himself, [[G3338]] and brought again [[G654]] the [[G3588]] thirty [[G5144]] pieces of silver [[G694]] the [[G3588]] to chief [[G749]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]]

### 4
Saying, [[G3004]] I have sinned [[G264]] in that I have betrayed [[G3860]] the innocent [[G121]] blood. [[G129]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] to [[G4314]] us? [[G2248]] see [[G3700]] thou [[G4771]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] he cast down [[G4496]] the [[G3588]] pieces of silver [[G694]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] and departed, [[G402]] and [[G2532]] went [[G565]] and hanged himself. [[G519]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] silver pieces, [[G694]] and said, [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] It is for to [[G906]] lawful [[G1832]] put [[G906]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] treasury, [[G2878]] because [[G1893]] it is [[G2076]] the price [[G5092]] of blood. [[G129]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] they took [[G2983]] counsel, [[G4824]] and bought [[G59]] with [[G1537]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] potter's [[G2763]] field, [[G68]] to bury [[G5027]] strangers [[G3581]] in. [[G1519]]

### 8
Wherefore [[G1352]] that [[G1565]] field [[G68]] was called, [[G2564]] The field [[G68]] of blood, [[G129]] unto [[G2193]] this day. [[G4594]]

### 9
Then [[G5119]] was fulfilled [[G4137]] that [[G3588]] which was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G1223]] Jeremy [[G2408]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] they took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] thirty [[G5144]] pieces of silver, [[G694]] the [[G3588]] price [[G5092]] him [[G3588]] of that was [[G5091]] valued, [[G5091]] whom [[G3739]] of [[G575]] they the [[G5207]] children [[G5207]] of Israel [[G2474]] did value; [[G5091]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] potter's [[G2763]] field, [[G68]] as [[G2505]] the Lord [[G2962]] appointed [[G4929]] me. [[G3427]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] governor: [[G2232]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews? [[G2453]] And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G5346]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou [[G4771]] sayest. [[G3004]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] when [[G1722]] he [[G846]] was accused [[G2723]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] he answered [[G611]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 13
Then [[G5119]] said [[G3004]] Pilate [[G4091]] unto him, [[G846]] Hearest thou [[G191]] not [[G3756]] how many things [[G4214]] they witness against [[G2649]] thee? [[G4675]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] he answered [[G611]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] never [[G3756]] a [[G1520]] word; [[G4487]] insomuch that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] marvelled [[G2296]] greatly. [[G3029]]

### 15
Now [[G1161]] at [[G2596]] feast [[G1859]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] was wont [[G1486]] to release [[G630]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3793]] people [[G3793]] a [[G1520]] prisoner, [[G1198]] whom [[G3739]] they would. [[G2309]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] they had [[G2192]] then [[G5119]] a notable [[G1978]] prisoner, [[G1198]] called [[G3004]] Barabbas. [[G912]]

### 17
Therefore when [[G3767]] they [[G846]] were gathered together, [[G4863]] Pilate [[G4091]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Whom [[G5101]] will ye [[G2309]] that I release [[G630]] unto you? [[G5213]] Barabbas, [[G912]] or [[G2228]] Jesus [[G2424]] which is called [[G3004]] Christ? [[G5547]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] he knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] for [[G1223]] envy [[G5355]] they had delivered [[G3860]] him. [[G846]]

### 19
When [[G1161]] he [[G846]] was set down [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat, [[G968]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Have [[G3367]] thou [[G4671]] nothing [[G3367]] to do [[G3367]] with [[G2532]] that [[G1565]] just man: [[G1342]] for [[G1063]] I have suffered [[G3958]] many things [[G4183]] this day [[G4594]] in [[G2596]] a dream [[G3677]] because of [[G1223]] him. [[G846]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] persuaded [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] that [[G2443]] they should ask [[G154]] Barabbas, [[G912]] and [[G1161]] destroy [[G622]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 21
The [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] answered [[G611]] and [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Whether [[G5101]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] twain [[G1417]] will ye [[G2309]] that I release [[G630]] unto you? [[G5213]] They [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Barabbas. [[G912]]

### 22
Pilate [[G4091]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] shall I do [[G4160]] then [[G3767]] with Jesus [[G2424]] which is called [[G3004]] Christ? [[G5547]] all [[G3956]] say unto [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] Let him be crucified. [[G4717]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] said, [[G5346]] Why, [[G5101]] what [[G1063]] evil [[G2556]] hath he done? [[G4160]] But [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] cried out [[G2896]] the more, [[G4057]] saying, [[G3004]] Let him be crucified. [[G4717]]

### 24
When [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he could prevail [[G5623]] nothing, [[G3762]] but [[G235]] rather [[G3123]] a tumult [[G2351]] was made, [[G1096]] he took [[G2983]] water, [[G5204]] and washed [[G633]] hands [[G5495]] before [[G561]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] saying, [[G3004]] I am [[G1510]] innocent [[G121]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of this [[G5127]] just person: [[G1342]] see [[G3700]] ye [[G5210]]

### 25
Then [[G2532]] answered [[G611]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and said, [[G2036]] His [[G846]] blood [[G129]] on [[G1909]] us, [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] our [[G2257]] children. [[G5043]]

### 26
Then [[G5119]] released he [[G630]] Barabbas [[G912]] unto them: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] when he had scourged [[G5417]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he delivered [[G3860]] to [[G2443]] be crucified. [[G4717]]

### 27
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2232]] governor [[G2232]] took [[G3880]] Jesus [[G2424]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] common hall, [[G4232]] and gathered [[G4863]] unto [[G1909]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] band [[G4686]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] they stripped [[G1562]] him, [[G846]] and put on [[G4060]] him [[G846]] a scarlet [[G2847]] robe. [[G5511]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] when they had platted [[G4120]] a crown [[G4735]] of [[G1537]] thorns, [[G173]] they put [[G2007]] upon [[G1909]] his [[G846]] head, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] a reed [[G2563]] in [[G1909]] his [[G846]] right hand: [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] they bowed the knee [[G1120]] before [[G1715]] him, [[G846]] and mocked [[G1702]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Hail, [[G5463]] King [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews! [[G2453]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] they spit [[G1716]] upon [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] and took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] reed, [[G2563]] and [[G2532]] smote [[G5180]] him [[G846]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] head. [[G2776]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] after [[G3753]] that they had mocked [[G1702]] him, [[G846]] they took off from [[G1562]] the [[G3588]] robe [[G5511]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] put on [[G1746]] his own [[G846]] raiment [[G2440]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] led away [[G520]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] crucify [[G4717]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] as they came out, [[G1831]] they found [[G2147]] a man [[G444]] of Cyrene, [[G2956]] Simon [[G4613]] by name: [[G3686]] him [[G5126]] they compelled [[G29]] to [[G2443]] bear [[G142]] his [[G846]] cross. [[G4716]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] when they were come [[G2064]] unto [[G1519]] a place [[G5117]] called [[G3004]] Golgotha, [[G1115]] that [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] to say, [[G3004]] a place [[G5117]] of a skull, [[G2898]]

### 34
They gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] vinegar [[G3690]] to drink [[G4095]] mingled [[G3396]] with [[G3326]] gall: [[G5521]] and [[G2532]] when he had tasted [[G1089]] he would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] drink. [[G4095]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] they crucified [[G4717]] him, [[G846]] and parted [[G1266]] his [[G846]] garments, [[G2440]] casting [[G906]] lots: [[G2819]] that [[G2443]] it might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] They parted [[G1266]] my [[G3450]] garments [[G2440]] among them, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] vesture [[G2441]] did they cast [[G906]] lots. [[G2819]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] sitting down [[G2521]] they watched [[G5083]] him [[G846]] there; [[G1563]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] set up [[G2007]] over [[G1883]] his [[G846]] head [[G2776]] his [[G846]] accusation [[G156]] written, [[G1125]] THIS [[G3778]] IS [[G2076]] JESUS [[G2424]] THE [[G3588]] KING [[G935]] THE [[G3588]] OF [[G2453]] JEWS. [[G2453]]

### 38
Then [[G5119]] were there [[G4717]] two [[G1417]] thieves [[G3027]] crucified [[G4717]] with [[G4862]] him, [[G846]] one [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] the right hand, [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] another [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] the left. [[G2176]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] they that passed by [[G3899]] reviled [[G987]] him, [[G846]] wagging [[G2795]] their [[G846]] heads, [[G2776]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Thou that destroyest [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] buildest [[G3618]] in [[G1722]] three [[G5140]] days, [[G2250]] save [[G4982]] thyself. [[G4572]] If [[G1487]] thou be [[G1488]] the Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] come down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cross. [[G4716]]

### 41
Likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] mocking [[G1702]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] said, [[G3004]]

### 42
He saved [[G4982]] others; [[G243]] himself [[G1438]] cannot [[G3756]] he [[G1410]] save. [[G4982]] If [[G1487]] he be [[G2076]] the King [[G935]] of Israel, [[G2474]] let him come [[G2597]] now [[G3568]] down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cross, [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] we will believe [[G4100]] him. [[G846]]

### 43
He trusted [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] God; [[G2316]] let him deliver [[G4506]] him [[G846]] now, [[G3568]] if [[G1487]] he will have [[G2309]] him: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] he said, [[G2036]] I am [[G1510]] the Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 44
The [[G3588]] thieves [[G3027]] also, [[G2532]] which were crucified [[G4957]] with him, [[G846]] cast [[G3679]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] in his [[G846]] teeth. [[G3679]]

### 45
Now [[G1161]] from [[G575]] the sixth [[G1623]] hour [[G5610]] there was [[G1096]] darkness [[G4655]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] unto [[G2193]] the ninth [[G1766]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 46
And [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] ninth [[G1766]] hour [[G5610]] Jesus [[G2424]] cried with [[G310]] a [[G5456]] loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] saying, [[G3004]] Eli, [[G2241]] Eli, [[G2241]] lama [[G2982]] sabachthani? [[G4518]] that [[G5124]] is to say, [[G2076]] My [[G3450]] God, [[G2316]] my [[G3450]] God, [[G2316]] why [[G2444]] hast thou forsaken [[G1459]] me? [[G3165]]

### 47
Some [[G5100]] of them [[G3588]] that stood [[G2476]] there, [[G1563]] when they heard [[G191]] said, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] calleth for [[G5455]] Elias. [[G2243]]

### 48
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] ran, [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2983]] a spunge, [[G4699]] and [[G5037]] filled [[G4130]] with vinegar, [[G3690]] and [[G2532]] put [[G4060]] on a reed, [[G2563]] and gave to [[G4222]] him [[G846]] drink. [[G4222]]

### 49
The [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] said, [[G3004]] Let be, [[G863]] let us see [[G1492]] whether [[G1487]] Elias [[G2243]] will come [[G2064]] to save [[G4982]] him. [[G846]]

### 50
Jesus, [[G2424]] when he had cried with [[G2896]] again [[G3825]] loud [[G3173]] a voice, [[G5456]] up [[G863]] yielded [[G863]] the [[G3588]] ghost. [[G4151]]

### 51
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] veil [[G2665]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3485]] temple [[G3485]] was rent [[G4977]] in [[G1519]] twain [[G1417]] from [[G575]] the top [[G509]] to [[G2193]] the bottom; [[G2736]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] did quake, [[G4579]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rocks [[G4073]] rent; [[G4977]]

### 52
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] graves [[G3419]] were opened; [[G455]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] bodies [[G4983]] the [[G3588]] of [[G40]] saints [[G40]] which slept [[G2837]] arose, [[G1453]]

### 53
And [[G2532]] came out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] graves [[G3419]] after [[G3326]] his [[G846]] resurrection, [[G1454]] and went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] appeared [[G1718]] unto many. [[G4183]]

### 54
Now when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] centurion, [[G1543]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that were with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] watching [[G5083]] Jesus, [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] earthquake, [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] those things that were done, [[G1096]] they feared [[G5399]] greatly, [[G4970]] saying, [[G3004]] Truly [[G230]] this [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] the Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 55
And [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] women [[G1135]] were [[G2258]] there [[G1563]] beholding [[G2334]] afar [[G3113]] off, [[G575]] which [[G3748]] followed [[G190]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] ministering [[G1247]] unto him: [[G846]]

### 56
Among [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] Joses, [[G2499]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of Zebedee's [[G2199]] children. [[G5207]]

### 57
When [[G1161]] the even [[G3798]] was come, [[G1096]] there came [[G2064]] a rich [[G4145]] man [[G444]] of [[G575]] Arimathaea, [[G707]] named [[G5122]] Joseph, [[G2501]] who [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] himself [[G846]] was [[G3100]] Jesus' [[G2424]] disciple: [[G3100]]

### 58
He [[G3778]] went to [[G4334]] Pilate, [[G4091]] and begged [[G154]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] Then [[G5119]] Pilate [[G4091]] commanded [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] to be delivered. [[G591]]

### 59
And when [[G2532]] Joseph [[G2501]] had taken [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] he wrapped in [[G1794]] it [[G846]] a clean [[G2513]] linen cloth, [[G4616]]

### 60
And [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] new [[G2537]] tomb, [[G3419]] which [[G3739]] he had hewn out [[G2998]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] rock: [[G4073]] and [[G2532]] he rolled [[G4351]] a [[G3037]] great [[G3173]] stone [[G3037]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2374]] door [[G2374]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3419]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] and departed. [[G565]]

### 61
And [[G1161]] there [[G1563]] was [[G2258]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] Mary, [[G3137]] sitting [[G2521]] over against [[G561]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre. [[G5028]]

### 62
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] next day, [[G1887]] that [[G3748]] followed [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] day of the [[G3588]] preparation, [[G3904]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] came together [[G4863]] unto [[G4314]] Pilate, [[G4091]]

### 63
Saying, [[G3004]] Sir, [[G2962]] we remember [[G3415]] that [[G3754]] that [[G1565]] deceiver [[G4108]] said, [[G2036]] yet [[G2089]] while he was [[G2198]] alive, [[G2198]] After [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] I will rise again. [[G1453]]

### 64
Command [[G2753]] therefore [[G3767]] that [[G805]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre [[G5028]] be made sure [[G805]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day, [[G2250]] lest [[G3379]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] come [[G2064]] by night, [[G3571]] and steal away, [[G2813]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] say [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2992]] people, [[G2992]] He is risen [[G1453]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] dead: [[G3498]] so [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] error [[G4106]] shall be [[G2071]] worse than [[G5501]] the [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]]

### 65
Pilate [[G4091]] said [[G5346]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye have [[G2192]] a watch: [[G2892]] go your way, [[G5217]] make as sure [[G805]] as [[G5613]] ye can. [[G1492]]

### 66
So [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] went, [[G4198]] and made [[G805]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre [[G5028]] sure, [[G805]] sealing [[G4972]] the [[G3588]] stone, [[G3037]] and setting [[G3326]] a [[G3588]] watch. [[G2892]]
