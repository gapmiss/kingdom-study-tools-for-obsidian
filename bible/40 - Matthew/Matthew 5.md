### 1
And [[G1161]] seeing [[G1492]] the multitudes, [[G3793]] he went up [[G305]] into [[G1519]] a mountain: [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] when was [[G2523]] he [[G846]] set, [[G2523]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came unto [[G4334]] him: [[G846]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] and taught [[G1321]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 3
Blessed [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] in spirit: [[G4151]] for [[G3754]] theirs [[G846]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven. [[G3772]]

### 4
Blessed [[G3107]] they that mourn: [[G3996]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] shall be comforted. [[G3870]]

### 5
Blessed [[G3107]] the meek: [[G4239]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] shall inherit [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 6
Blessed [[G3107]] they which do hunger [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] thirst [[G1372]] after righteousness: [[G1343]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] shall be filled. [[G5526]]

### 7
Blessed [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] merciful: [[G1655]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] shall obtain mercy. [[G1653]]

### 8
Blessed [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] pure [[G2513]] in heart: [[G2588]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] shall see [[G3700]] God. [[G2316]]

### 9
Blessed [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] peacemakers: [[G1518]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] shall be called [[G2564]] the children [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 10
Blessed [[G3107]] they which are persecuted [[G1377]] for [[G1752]] righteousness' [[G1343]] sake: [[G1752]] for [[G3754]] theirs [[G846]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven. [[G3772]]

### 11
Blessed [[G3107]] are ye, [[G2075]] when [[G3752]] shall revile [[G3679]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] persecute [[G1377]] and [[G2532]] shall say [[G2036]] all manner of [[G3956]] evil [[G4190]] against [[G2596]] you [[G5216]] falsely, [[G5574]] for sake. [[G1752]] my [[G1700]]

### 12
Rejoice, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] be exceeding glad: [[G21]] for [[G3754]] great [[G4183]] your [[G5216]] reward [[G3408]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] for [[G1063]] so [[G3779]] persecuted they [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] which were [[G3588]] before [[G4253]] you. [[G5216]]

### 13
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] the salt [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] the salt [[G3588]] have lost his savour, [[G3471]] wherewith [[G1722]] shall [[G5101]] it be salted? [[G233]] it is [[G2480]] thenceforth [[G2089]] good [[G2480]] for [[G1519]] nothing, [[G3762]] but [[G3361]] to be cast [[G906]] out, [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] to be trodden under foot [[G2662]] of [[G5259]] men. [[G444]]

### 14
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] the light [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] A city [[G4172]] that is set [[G2749]] on [[G1883]] an hill [[G3735]] cannot [[G1410]] be hid. [[G2928]]

### 15
Neither [[G3761]] do men light [[G2545]] a candle, [[G3088]] and [[G2532]] put [[G5087]] it [[G846]] under [[G5259]] a bushel, [[G3426]] but [[G235]] on [[G1909]] a candlestick; [[G3087]] and [[G2532]] it giveth light [[G2989]] unto all [[G3956]] that are [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house. [[G3614]]

### 16
Let your [[G5216]] light [[G5457]] so [[G3779]] shine [[G2989]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] that [[G3704]] they may see [[G1492]] your [[G5216]] good [[G2570]] works, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] glorify [[G1392]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 17
Think [[G3543]] not [[G3361]] that [[G3754]] I am come [[G2064]] to destroy [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] prophets: [[G4396]] not [[G3756]] I am [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] to destroy, [[G2647]] but [[G235]] to fulfil. [[G4137]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Till [[G2193]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] pass, [[G3928]] one [[G1520]] jot [[G2503]] or [[G2228]] one [[G1520]] tittle [[G2762]] in no [[G3756]] shall [[G3928]] wise [[G3361]] pass [[G3928]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] till [[G2193]] all [[G3956]] be fulfilled. [[G1096]]

### 19
Whosoever [[G3739]] therefore [[G3767]] shall break [[G3089]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1785]] these [[G5130]] least [[G1646]] commandments, [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] shall teach [[G1321]] men [[G444]] so, [[G3779]] he shall be called [[G2564]] the [[G444]] least [[G1646]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven: [[G3772]] but [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall do [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] teach [[G1321]] the same [[G3778]] shall be called [[G2564]] great [[G3173]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] except [[G1437]] your [[G5216]] righteousness [[G1343]] shall exceed [[G4052]] of the scribes [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] in no [[G3756]] ye shall [[G1525]] case [[G3361]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G3588]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 21
Ye have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was said [[G4483]] by them of old time, [[G744]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G5407]] kill; [[G5407]] and [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall kill [[G5407]] shall be [[G2071]] in danger [[G1777]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2920]] judgment: [[G2920]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] whosoever [[G3956]] is angry [[G3710]] with [[G80]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] without a cause [[G1500]] shall be [[G2071]] in danger [[G1777]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2920]] judgment: [[G2920]] and [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall say [[G2036]] to [[G80]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] Raca, [[G4469]] shall be [[G2071]] in danger [[G1777]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4892]] council: [[G4892]] but [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall say, [[G2036]] Thou fool, [[G3474]] shall be [[G2071]] in danger [[G1777]] of [[G1519]] hell [[G1067]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 23
Therefore [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] thou bring [[G4374]] thy [[G4675]] gift [[G1435]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] and there [[G2546]] rememberest [[G3415]] that [[G3754]] thy [[G4675]] brother [[G80]] hath [[G2192]] ought [[G5100]] against [[G2596]] thee; [[G4675]]

### 24
Leave [[G863]] there [[G1563]] thy [[G4675]] gift [[G1435]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] and [[G2532]] go thy way; [[G5217]] first [[G4412]] be reconciled [[G1259]] to [[G80]] thy [[G4675]] brother, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] come [[G2064]] and offer [[G4374]] thy [[G4675]] gift. [[G1435]]

### 25
Agree [[G2468]]  with [[G2132]] thine [[G4675]] adversary [[G476]] quickly, [[G5035]] whiles [[G3755]] thou art [[G1488]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] with [[G3326]] him; [[G846]] lest at any time [[G3379]] the [[G3588]] adversary [[G476]] deliver [[G3860]] thee [[G4571]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2923]] judge, [[G2923]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] judge [[G2923]] deliver [[G3860]] thee [[G4571]] the [[G3588]] to [[G5257]] officer, [[G5257]] and [[G2532]] thou be cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison. [[G5438]]

### 26
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] by no [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G1831]] means [[G3361]] come out [[G1831]] thence, [[G1564]] till [[G2193]] thou hast paid [[G591]] the [[G3588]] uttermost [[G2078]] farthing. [[G2835]]

### 27
Ye have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was said [[G4483]] by them of old time, [[G744]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt commit [[G3431]] adultery: [[G3431]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] whosoever [[G3956]] looketh [[G991]] on a woman [[G1135]] to [[G4314]] lust after [[G1937]] her [[G846]] hath committed adultery [[G3431]] with her [[G846]] already [[G2235]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] thy [[G4675]] right [[G1188]] eye [[G3788]] offend [[G4624]] thee, [[G4571]] pluck [[G1807]] out, [[G1807]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] from [[G575]] thee: [[G4675]] for [[G1063]] it is profitable [[G4851]] for thee [[G4671]] that [[G2443]] one [[G1520]] of [[G3196]] thy [[G4675]] members [[G3196]] should perish, [[G622]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] thy [[G4675]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] should be cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] hell. [[G1067]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] thy [[G4675]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] offend [[G4624]] thee, [[G4571]] cut [[G1581]] it [[G846]] off, [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] from [[G575]] thee: [[G4675]] for [[G1063]] it is profitable [[G4851]] for thee [[G4671]] that [[G2443]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1520]] thy [[G4675]] members [[G3196]] should perish, [[G622]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] thy [[G4675]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] should be cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] hell. [[G1067]]

### 31
It hath been said, [[G4483]] Whosoever [[G3739]] shall put away [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] let him give [[G1325]] her [[G846]] a writing of divorcement: [[G647]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall put away [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] saving [[G3924]] for the cause [[G3056]] of fornication, [[G4202]] causeth [[G4160]] her [[G846]] to commit adultery: [[G3429]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall marry [[G1060]] her that is divorced [[G630]] committeth adultery. [[G3429]]

### 33
Again, [[G3825]] ye have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it hath been said [[G4483]] by them of old time, [[G744]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt thyself, [[G1964]] forswear [[G1964]] but [[G1161]] shalt perform [[G591]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] thine [[G4675]] oaths: [[G3727]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Swear [[G3660]] not [[G3361]] at all; [[G3654]] neither [[G3383]] by [[G1722]] heaven; [[G3772]] for [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] God's [[G2316]] throne: [[G2362]]

### 35
Nor [[G3383]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] for [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] his [[G846]] footstool: [[G5286]] neither [[G3383]] by [[G1519]] Jerusalem; [[G2414]] for [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] the city [[G4172]] the [[G3588]] of [[G935]] great [[G3173]] King. [[G935]]

### 36
Neither [[G3383]] shalt thou swear [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] head, [[G2776]] because [[G3754]] thou canst [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] make [[G4160]] one [[G1520]] hair [[G2359]] white [[G3022]] or [[G2228]] black. [[G3189]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] let [[G2077]] your [[G5216]] communication [[G3056]] be, [[G2077]] Yea, [[G3483]] yea; [[G3483]] Nay, [[G3756]] nay: [[G3756]] for [[G1161]] whatsoever is more than [[G4053]] these [[G5130]] cometh [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 38
Ye have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it hath been said, [[G4483]] An eye [[G3788]] for [[G473]] an eye, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] a tooth [[G3599]] for [[G473]] a tooth: [[G3599]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That ye resist [[G436]] not [[G3361]] evil: [[G4190]] but [[G235]] whosoever [[G3748]] shall smite [[G4474]] thee [[G4571]] on [[G1909]] thy [[G4675]] right [[G1188]] cheek, [[G4600]] turn [[G4762]] to him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] also. [[G2532]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] if [[G2532]] any man [[G3588]] will [[G2309]] sue [[G2919]] thee [[G4671]] at the law, [[G2919]] and [[G2532]] take away [[G2983]] thy [[G4675]] coat, [[G5509]] let [[G863]] him [[G846]] have [[G863]] cloke [[G2440]] also. [[G2532]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3748]] shall compel to go [[G29]] thee [[G4571]] a [[G1520]] mile, [[G3400]] go [[G5217]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] twain. [[G1417]]

### 42
Give [[G1325]] to him that asketh [[G154]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] him that would [[G2309]] borrow [[G1155]] of [[G575]] thee [[G4675]] turn [[G654]] not [[G3361]] thou away. [[G654]]

### 43
Ye have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it hath been said, [[G4483]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] thy [[G4675]] neighbour, [[G4139]] and [[G2532]] hate [[G3404]] thine [[G4675]] enemy. [[G2190]]

### 44
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Love [[G25]] your [[G5216]] enemies, [[G2190]] bless [[G2127]] them that curse [[G2672]] you, [[G5209]] do [[G4160]] good [[G2573]] to them that hate [[G3404]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] pray [[G4336]] for [[G5228]] them which despitefully use [[G1908]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] persecute [[G1377]] you; [[G5209]]

### 45
That [[G3704]] ye may be [[G1096]] the children [[G5207]] of your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] for [[G3754]] his [[G846]] he maketh to [[G393]] sun [[G2246]] rise [[G393]] on [[G1909]] the evil [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] on the good, [[G18]] and [[G2532]] sendeth rain [[G1026]] on [[G1909]] the just [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] on the unjust. [[G94]]

### 46
For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] ye love [[G25]] them which love [[G25]] you, [[G5209]] what [[G5101]] reward [[G3408]] have ye? [[G2192]] do [[G4160]] not [[G3780]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] publicans [[G5057]] the [[G3588]] same? [[G846]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] ye salute [[G782]] your [[G5216]] brethren [[G80]] only, [[G3440]] what [[G5101]] do [[G4160]] more [[G4053]] ye [[G4160]] do [[G4160]] not [[G3780]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] publicans [[G5057]] so? [[G3779]]

### 48
Be [[G2071]] ye [[G5210]] therefore [[G3767]] perfect, [[G5046]] even as [[G5618]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] perfect. [[G5046]]
