### 1
Then [[G5119]] came [[G4334]] to Jesus [[G2424]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] which [[G3588]] were of [[G575]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 2
Why [[G1302]] thy [[G4675]] do [[G3845]] disciples [[G3101]] transgress [[G3845]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4245]] elders? [[G4245]] for [[G1063]] they wash [[G3538]] not [[G3756]] their [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] when [[G3752]] they eat [[G2068]] bread. [[G740]]

### 3
he [[G3588]] But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G1302]] ye [[G5210]] do [[G3845]] also [[G2532]] transgress [[G3845]] commandment [[G1785]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] your [[G5216]] tradition? [[G3862]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] commanded, [[G1781]] saying, [[G3004]] Honour [[G5091]] thy [[G4675]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother: [[G3384]] and, [[G2532]] He that curseth [[G2551]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother, [[G3384]] let him die [[G5053]] the death. [[G2288]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] say, [[G3004]] Whosoever [[G3739]] shall say to [[G2036]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother, [[G3384]] a [[G3384]] gift, [[G1435]] by whatsoever [[G3739]] thou [[G1437]] mightest be profited [[G5623]] by [[G1537]] me; [[G1700]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] honour [[G5091]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] Thus [[G2532]] have ye made of none effect [[G208]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] your [[G5216]] tradition. [[G3862]]

### 7
hypocrites, [[G5273]] well [[G2573]] did [[G4395]] Esaias [[G2268]] prophesy [[G4395]] of [[G4012]] you, [[G5216]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 8
This [[G3778]] people [[G2992]] draweth nigh [[G1448]] unto me [[G3427]] with [[G4750]] their [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] honoureth [[G5091]] me [[G3165]] with lips; [[G5491]] but [[G1161]] their [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] is [[G568]] far [[G4206]] from [[G575]] me. [[G1700]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] in vain [[G3155]] they do worship [[G4576]] me, [[G3165]] teaching [[G1321]] doctrines [[G1319]] the commandments [[G1778]] of men. [[G444]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] he called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Hear, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] understand: [[G4920]]

### 11
Not [[G3756]] that which goeth [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] defileth [[G2840]] a [[G3588]] man; [[G444]] but [[G235]] that which cometh out [[G1607]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mouth, [[G4750]] this [[G5124]] defileth [[G2840]] a [[G3588]] man. [[G444]]

### 12
Then [[G5119]] came [[G4334]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Knowest thou [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] were offended, [[G4624]] after they heard [[G191]] this saying? [[G3056]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Every [[G3956]] plant, [[G5451]] which [[G3739]] my [[G3450]] heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G5452]] planted, [[G5452]] shall be rooted up. [[G1610]]

### 14
Let [[G863]] them [[G846]] alone: [[G863]] they be [[G1526]] blind [[G5185]] leaders [[G3595]] of the blind. [[G5185]] And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] the blind [[G5185]] lead [[G3594]] the blind, [[G5185]] both [[G297]] shall fall [[G4098]] into [[G1519]] the ditch. [[G999]]

### 15
Then [[G1161]] answered [[G611]] Peter [[G4074]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Declare [[G5419]] unto us [[G2254]] this [[G3778]] parable. [[G3850]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Are [[G2075]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] yet [[G188]] without understanding? [[G801]]

### 17
Do not yet [[G3768]] ye [[G3539]] understand, [[G3539]] that [[G3754]] whatsoever [[G3956]] entereth [[G1531]] in at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] goeth [[G5562]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] belly, [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] is cast out [[G1544]] into [[G1519]] the draught? [[G856]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] those things which proceed [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] come forth [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] heart; [[G2588]] and they [[G2548]] defile [[G2840]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G444]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] out [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2588]] heart [[G2588]] proceed [[G1831]] evil [[G4190]] thoughts, [[G1261]] murders, [[G5408]] adulteries, [[G3430]] fornications, [[G4202]] thefts, [[G2829]] false witness, [[G5577]] blasphemies: [[G988]]

### 20
These [[G5023]] are [[G2076]] which defile [[G2840]] a [[G3588]] man: [[G444]] but [[G1161]] to eat [[G5315]] unwashen [[G449]] with [[G5495]] hands [[G5495]] defileth [[G2840]] not [[G3756]] a [[G3588]] man. [[G444]]

### 21
Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G1831]] thence, [[G1564]] and departed [[G402]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G3313]] of Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon. [[G4605]]

### 22
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a woman [[G1135]] of Canaan [[G5478]] came [[G1831]] out [[G575]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] coasts, [[G3725]] and cried [[G2905]] unto him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Have mercy [[G1653]] on me, [[G3165]] O Lord, [[G2962]] Son [[G5207]] of David; [[G1138]] my [[G3450]] daughter [[G2364]] grievously [[G2560]] is vexed with a [[G1139]] devil. [[G1139]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] her [[G846]] not [[G3756]] a word. [[G3056]] And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] and besought [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Send [[G630]] her [[G846]] away; [[G630]] for [[G3754]] she crieth [[G2896]] after [[G3693]] us. [[G2257]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] I am [[G649]] sent [[G649]] but [[G3361]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lost [[G622]] sheep [[G4263]] of the house [[G3624]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 25
Then [[G1161]] came [[G2064]] she [[G3588]] and worshipped [[G4352]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] help [[G997]] me. [[G3427]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] It is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] meet [[G2570]] to take [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] children's [[G5043]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] to cast [[G906]] to dogs. [[G2952]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Truth, [[G3483]] Lord: [[G2962]] yet [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] dogs [[G2952]] eat [[G2068]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] crumbs [[G5589]] which [[G4098]] fall [[G4098]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] masters' [[G2962]] table. [[G5132]]

### 28
Then [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] O [[G5599]] woman, [[G1135]] great [[G3173]] thy [[G4675]] faith: [[G4102]] be it [[G1096]] unto thee [[G4671]] even as [[G5613]] thou wilt. [[G2309]] And [[G2532]] her [[G846]] daughter [[G2364]] was made whole [[G2390]] from [[G575]] that very [[G1565]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] departed [[G3327]] from thence, [[G1564]] and came [[G2064]] nigh [[G3844]] unto [[G2281]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] of Galilee; [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] went up [[G305]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] and sat down [[G2521]] there. [[G1563]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] multitudes [[G3793]] came [[G4334]] unto [[G4334]] him, [[G846]] having [[G2192]] with [[G3326]] them [[G1438]] lame, [[G5560]] blind, [[G5185]] dumb, [[G2974]] maimed, [[G2948]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] others, [[G2087]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G4496]] them [[G846]] down [[G4496]] at [[G3844]] Jesus' [[G2424]] feet; [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] he healed [[G2323]] them: [[G846]]

### 31
Insomuch that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] wondered, [[G2296]] when they saw [[G991]] the dumb [[G2974]] to speak, [[G2980]] the maimed [[G2948]] to be whole, [[G5199]] the lame [[G5560]] to walk, [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] the blind [[G5185]] to see: [[G991]] and [[G2532]] they glorified [[G1392]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 32
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] called [[G4341]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] and said, [[G2036]] I have compassion [[G4697]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] because [[G3754]] they continue with [[G4357]] me [[G3427]] now [[G2235]] three [[G5140]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3756]]  to [[G5101]] eat: [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] I will [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] send [[G630]] them [[G846]] away [[G630]] fasting, [[G3523]] lest [[G3379]] they faint [[G1590]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Whence [[G4159]] should we have [[G2254]] so much [[G5118]] bread [[G740]] in [[G1722]] the wilderness, [[G2047]] as [[G5620]] to fill [[G5526]] so great [[G5118]] a multitude? [[G3793]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] How many [[G4214]] loaves [[G740]] have ye? [[G2192]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Seven, [[G2033]] and [[G2532]] a few [[G3641]] little fishes. [[G2485]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] he commanded [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] to sit down [[G377]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] he took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fishes, [[G2486]] and gave thanks, [[G2168]] and brake [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] to [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3793]] multitude. [[G3793]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] they did [[G5315]] all [[G3956]] eat, [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were filled: [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] they took up [[G142]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2801]] broken [[G2801]] that was left [[G4052]] seven [[G2033]] baskets [[G4711]] full. [[G4134]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] they that did eat [[G2068]] were [[G2258]] four thousand [[G5070]] men, [[G435]] beside [[G5565]] women [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children. [[G3813]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] he sent away [[G630]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] and [[G3793]] took [[G1684]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G3725]] of Magdala. [[G3093]] ship, [[G4143]]
