### 1
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] they drew nigh [[G1448]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] were come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Bethphage, [[G967]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] of Olives, [[G1636]] then [[G5119]] sent [[G649]] Jesus [[G2424]] two [[G1417]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 2
Saying [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] over against [[G561]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] ye shall find [[G2147]] an ass [[G3688]] tied, [[G1210]] and [[G2532]] a colt [[G4454]] with [[G3326]] her: [[G846]] loose [[G3089]] and bring [[G71]] unto me. [[G3427]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] any [[G5100]] say [[G2036]] ought [[G5100]] unto you, [[G5213]] ye shall say, [[G2046]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] of them; [[G846]] and [[G1161]] straightway [[G2112]] he will send [[G649]] them. [[G846]]

### 4
All [[G3650]] this [[G5124]] was done, [[G1096]] that [[G2443]] it might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 5
Tell ye [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] daughter [[G2364]] of Sion, [[G4622]] Behold, [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] King [[G935]] cometh [[G2064]] unto thee, [[G4671]] meek, [[G4239]] and [[G2532]] sitting [[G1910]] upon [[G1909]] an ass, [[G3688]] and [[G2532]] a colt [[G4454]] the foal [[G5207]] of an ass. [[G5268]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] went, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] did [[G4160]] as [[G2531]] Jesus [[G2424]] commanded [[G4367]] them, [[G846]]

### 7
And brought [[G71]] the [[G3588]] ass, [[G3688]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] colt, [[G4454]] and [[G2532]] put [[G2007]] on [[G1883]] them [[G846]] their [[G846]] clothes, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] they set [[G1940]] thereon. [[G1883]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] very great [[G4118]] a [[G3793]] multitude [[G3793]] spread [[G4766]] their [[G1438]] garments [[G2440]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way; [[G3598]] others [[G243]] cut down [[G2875]] branches [[G2798]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] trees, [[G1186]] and [[G2532]] strawed [[G4766]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] multitudes [[G3793]] that went before, [[G4254]] and [[G2532]] that followed, [[G190]] cried, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] Hosanna [[G5614]] the [[G3588]] to [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of David: [[G1138]] Blessed [[G2127]] he that cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of the Lord; [[G2962]] Hosanna [[G5614]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] highest. [[G5310]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] when was [[G1525]] he [[G846]] come [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] was moved, [[G4579]] saying, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] this? [[G3778]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] said, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] of [[G575]] Nazareth [[G3478]] of Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] cast out [[G1544]] all [[G3956]] them that sold [[G4453]] and [[G2532]] bought [[G59]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] overthrew [[G2690]] the [[G3588]] tables [[G5132]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2855]] moneychangers, [[G2855]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seats [[G2515]] of them that sold [[G4453]] doves, [[G4058]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] It is written, [[G1125]] My [[G3450]] house [[G3624]] shall be called [[G2564]] the house [[G3624]] of prayer; [[G4335]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] have made [[G4160]] it [[G846]] a den [[G4693]] of thieves. [[G3027]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the blind [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] the lame [[G5560]] came [[G4334]] to him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple; [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] he healed [[G2323]] them. [[G846]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] wonderful things [[G2297]] that [[G3739]] he did, [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] children [[G3816]] crying [[G2896]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Hosanna [[G5614]] the [[G3588]] to [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of David; [[G1138]] they were sore displeased, [[G23]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Hearest thou [[G191]] what [[G5101]] these [[G3778]] say? [[G3004]] And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Yea; [[G3483]] never [[G3763]] have ye [[G314]] read, [[G314]] Out of [[G1537]] the mouth [[G4750]] of babes [[G3516]] and [[G2532]] sucklings [[G2337]] thou hast perfected [[G2675]] praise? [[G136]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he left [[G2641]] them, [[G846]] and went [[G1831]] out [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city [[G4172]] into [[G1519]] Bethany; [[G963]] and [[G2532]] he lodged [[G835]] there. [[G1563]]

### 18
Now [[G1161]] in the morning [[G4405]] as he returned [[G1877]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] he hungered. [[G3983]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] when he saw [[G1492]] a [[G3391]] fig tree [[G4808]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] he [[G3598]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] nothing [[G3762]] thereon, [[G1722]] but [[G1487]] leaves [[G5444]] only, [[G3440]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto it, [[G846]] no [[G3371]] Let [[G1096]] fruit [[G2590]] grow [[G1096]] on [[G1537]] thee [[G4675]] henceforward [[G3371]] for ever. [[G1519]] And [[G2532]] presently [[G3916]] the [[G3588]] fig tree [[G4808]] withered [[G3583]] away. [[G3583]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] when [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] saw [[G1492]] they marvelled, [[G2296]] saying, [[G3004]] How [[G4459]] soon [[G3916]] is away! [[G3583]] the [[G3588]] fig tree [[G4808]] withered [[G3583]]

### 21
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] If [[G1437]] ye have [[G2192]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] doubt [[G1252]] not, [[G3361]] not [[G3756]] ye shall [[G4160]] only [[G3440]] do [[G4160]] this [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] to fig [[G4808]] tree, [[G4808]] but [[G235]] also if [[G2579]] ye shall say [[G2036]] unto [[G3735]] this [[G5129]] mountain, [[G3735]] Be thou removed, [[G142]] and [[G2532]] be thou cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]] it shall be done. [[G1096]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] all things, [[G3956]] whatsoever [[G3745]] ye shall ask [[G154]] in [[G1722]] prayer, [[G4335]] believing, [[G4100]] ye shall receive. [[G2983]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] when was [[G2064]] he [[G846]] come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] came [[G4334]] unto him [[G846]] as he was teaching, [[G1321]] and said, [[G3004]] By [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] doest [[G4160]] these things? [[G5023]] thou [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] gave [[G1325]] thee [[G4671]] this [[G3778]] authority? [[G1849]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I also [[G2504]] will ask [[G2065]] you [[G5209]] one [[G1520]] thing, [[G3056]] which [[G3739]] if [[G1437]] ye tell [[G2036]] me, [[G3427]] I in like wise [[G2504]] will tell [[G2046]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I do [[G4160]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 25
The [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] of John, [[G2491]] whence [[G4159]] was [[G2258]] it? [[G2258]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] or [[G2228]] of [[G1537]] men? [[G444]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] reasoned [[G1260]] with [[G3844]] themselves, [[G1438]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1437]] we shall say, [[G2036]] From [[G1537]] heaven; [[G3772]] he will say [[G2046]] unto us, [[G2254]] Why [[G1302]] not [[G3756]] did ye [[G4100]] then [[G3767]] believe [[G4100]] him? [[G846]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] we shall say, [[G2036]] Of [[G1537]] men; [[G444]] we fear [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people; [[G3793]] for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] hold [[G2192]] John [[G2491]] as [[G5613]] a prophet. [[G4396]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] they answered [[G611]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and said, [[G2036]] cannot [[G3756]] We [[G1492]] tell. [[G1492]] And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] said [[G5346]] unto them, [[G846]] Neither [[G3761]] tell [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I do [[G4160]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] what [[G5101]] think [[G1380]] ye? [[G5213]] A man [[G444]] had [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] sons; [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] he came [[G4334]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4413]] first, [[G4413]] and said, [[G2036]] Son, [[G5043]] go [[G5217]] work [[G2038]] to day [[G4594]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] vineyard. [[G290]]

### 29
He [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] I will [[G2309]] not: [[G3756]] but [[G1161]] afterward [[G5305]] he repented, [[G3338]] and went. [[G565]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] he came [[G4334]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1208]] second, [[G1208]] and said [[G2036]] likewise. [[G5615]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] I [[G1473]] sir: [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] went [[G565]] not. [[G3756]]

### 31
Whether [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] them [[G3588]] twain [[G1417]] did [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of father? [[G3962]] They [[G3004]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] harlots [[G4204]] go [[G4254]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] before [[G4254]] you. [[G5209]]

### 32
For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] the way [[G3598]] of righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] ye believed [[G4100]] him [[G846]] not: [[G3756]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] harlots [[G4204]] believed [[G4100]] him: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] ye, [[G5210]] when ye had seen [[G1492]] repented [[G3338]] not [[G3756]] afterward, [[G5305]] that [[G3588]] ye might believe [[G4100]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
Hear [[G191]] another [[G243]] parable: [[G3850]] There was [[G2258]] a [[G444]] certain [[G5100]] householder, [[G3617]] which [[G3748]] planted [[G5452]] a vineyard, [[G290]] and [[G2532]] hedged [[G5418]] it [[G846]] round about, [[G4060]] and [[G2532]] digged [[G3736]] a winepress [[G3025]] in [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] built [[G3618]] a tower, [[G4444]] and [[G2532]] let [[G1554]] it [[G846]] out [[G1554]] to husbandmen, [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] went into a far country: [[G589]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2590]] fruit [[G2590]] drew near, [[G1448]] he sent [[G649]] his [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] husbandmen, [[G1092]] that they might receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] fruits [[G2590]] of it. [[G846]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] husbandmen [[G1092]] took [[G2983]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] and beat [[G1194]] one, [[G3739]] and [[G1161]] killed [[G615]] another, [[G3739]] and [[G1161]] stoned [[G3036]] another. [[G3739]]

### 36
Again, [[G3825]] he sent [[G649]] other [[G243]] servants [[G1401]] more [[G4119]] the [[G3588]] than [[G4413]] first: [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] they did [[G4160]] unto them [[G846]] likewise. [[G5615]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] last [[G5305]] of all [[G5305]] he sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] his [[G846]] son, [[G5207]] saying, [[G3004]] They will reverence [[G1788]] my [[G3450]] son. [[G5207]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G1492]] husbandmen [[G1092]] saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] son, [[G5207]] they said [[G2036]] among [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] heir; [[G2818]] come, [[G1205]] let us kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] let us seize on [[G2722]] his [[G846]] inheritance. [[G2817]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] they caught [[G2983]] him, [[G846]] and cast [[G1544]] out [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] of [[G290]] vineyard, [[G290]] and [[G2532]] slew [[G615]]

### 40
When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] of [[G290]] vineyard [[G290]] cometh, [[G2064]] what [[G5101]] will he do [[G4160]] unto [[G1092]] those [[G1565]] husbandmen? [[G1092]]

### 41
They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] miserably [[G2560]] He will [[G622]] destroy [[G622]] those [[G846]] wicked men, [[G2556]] and [[G2532]] will let out [[G1554]] vineyard [[G290]] other [[G243]] unto [[G1092]] husbandmen, [[G1092]] which [[G3748]] shall render [[G591]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] fruits [[G2590]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] seasons. [[G2540]]

### 42
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] never [[G3763]] Did ye [[G314]] read [[G314]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] scriptures, The [[G1124]] stone [[G3037]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] builders [[G3618]] rejected, [[G593]] the same [[G3778]] is become [[G1096]] the [[G1519]] head [[G2776]] of the corner: [[G1137]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1096]] the Lord's [[G2962]] doing, [[G3844]] and [[G2532]] it is [[G2076]] marvellous [[G2298]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] eyes? [[G3788]]

### 43
Therefore [[G1223]] say I [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] shall be taken [[G142]] from [[G575]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] given [[G1325]] to a nation [[G1484]] bringing forth [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] fruits [[G2590]] thereof. [[G846]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] whosoever shall fall [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] this [[G5126]] stone [[G3037]] shall be broken: [[G4917]] but [[G1161]] on [[G1909]] whomsoever [[G3739]] it shall fall, [[G4098]] it will grind to powder. [[G3039]] him [[G846]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] when had [[G191]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] heard [[G191]] his [[G846]] parables, [[G3850]] they perceived [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] he spake [[G3004]] of [[G4012]] them. [[G846]]

### 46
But [[G2532]] when they sought [[G2212]] to lay hands on [[G2902]] him, [[G846]] they feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] because [[G1894]] they took [[G2192]] him [[G846]] for [[G5613]] a prophet. [[G4396]]
