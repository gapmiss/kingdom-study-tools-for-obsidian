### 1
Take heed that [[G4337]] ye do [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] your [[G5216]] alms [[G1654]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] to [[G4314]] be seen [[G2300]] of them: [[G846]] otherwise [[G1161]] ye [[G3756]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] reward [[G3408]] of [[G3844]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 2
Therefore [[G3767]] when [[G3752]] thou doest [[G4160]] alms, [[G1654]] do not [[G3361]] sound a trumpet [[G4537]] before [[G1715]] thee, [[G4675]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] hypocrites [[G5273]] do [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] streets, [[G4505]] that [[G3704]] they may have glory [[G1392]] of [[G5259]] men. [[G444]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] They have [[G568]] their [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] thou [[G4675]] when [[G4160]] doest [[G4160]] alms, [[G1654]] not [[G3361]] let [[G1097]] thy [[G4675]] left hand [[G710]] know [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] thy [[G4675]] right hand [[G1188]] doeth: [[G4160]]

### 4
That [[G3704]] thine [[G4675]] alms [[G1654]] may be [[G5600]] in [[G1722]] secret: [[G2927]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] seeth [[G991]] in [[G1722]] secret [[G2927]] himself [[G846]] shall reward [[G591]] thee [[G4671]] openly. [[G5318]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] thou prayest, [[G4336]] not [[G3756]] thou shalt [[G2071]] be [[G2071]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] hypocrites [[G5273]] for [[G3754]] they love [[G5368]] to pray [[G4336]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] corners [[G1137]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4113]] streets, [[G4113]] that [[G3704]] they [[G302]] may be seen [[G5316]] of men. [[G444]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] They have [[G568]] their [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] thou, [[G4771]] when [[G3752]] thou prayest, [[G4336]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] thy [[G4675]] closet, [[G5009]] and [[G2532]] when thou hast shut [[G2808]] thy [[G4675]] door, [[G2374]] pray [[G4336]] to [[G3962]] thy [[G4675]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] secret; [[G2927]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] Father [[G3962]] which seeth [[G991]] in [[G1722]] secret [[G2927]] shall reward [[G591]] thee [[G4671]] openly. [[G5318]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] when ye pray, [[G4336]] not [[G3361]] use vain [[G945]] repetitions, [[G945]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] heathen [[G1482]] for [[G1063]] they think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] they shall be heard [[G1522]] for [[G1722]] their [[G846]] much speaking. [[G4180]]

### 8
not [[G3361]] Be [[G3666]] ye therefore [[G3767]] like [[G3666]] unto them: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] knoweth [[G1492]] what things [[G3739]] ye have [[G2192]] need of, [[G5532]] before [[G4253]] ye [[G5209]] ask [[G154]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
After this manner [[G3779]] therefore [[G3767]] pray [[G4336]] ye: [[G5210]] Our [[G2257]] Father [[G3962]] which art [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] Hallowed be [[G37]] thy [[G4675]] name. [[G3686]]

### 10
Thy [[G4675]] kingdom [[G932]] come. [[G2064]] Thy [[G4675]] will [[G2307]] be done [[G1096]] in [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 11
Give [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] this day [[G4594]] our [[G2257]] daily [[G1967]] bread. [[G740]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] forgive [[G863]] us [[G2254]] our [[G2257]] debts, [[G3783]] as [[G5613]] we [[G2249]] forgive [[G863]] our [[G2257]] debtors. [[G3781]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] lead [[G1533]] us [[G2248]] not [[G3361]] into [[G1519]] temptation, [[G3986]] but [[G235]] deliver [[G4506]] us [[G2248]] from [[G575]] evil: [[G4190]] For [[G3754]] thine [[G4675]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] power, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] glory, [[G1391]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] ye forgive [[G863]] men [[G444]] their [[G846]] trespasses, [[G3900]] your [[G5216]] heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] will [[G863]] also [[G2532]] forgive [[G863]] you: [[G5213]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] ye forgive [[G863]] not [[G3361]] men [[G444]] their [[G846]] trespasses, [[G3900]] neither [[G3761]] your [[G5216]] will [[G863]] Father [[G3962]] forgive [[G863]] your [[G5216]] trespasses. [[G3900]]

### 16
Moreover [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] ye fast, [[G3522]] be [[G1096]] not, [[G3361]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] hypocrites, [[G5273]] of a sad countenance: [[G4659]] for [[G1063]] they disfigure [[G853]] their [[G846]] faces, [[G4383]] that [[G3704]] they may appear [[G5316]] unto men [[G444]] to fast. [[G3522]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] They have [[G568]] their [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] thou, [[G4771]] when thou fastest, [[G3522]] anoint [[G218]] thine [[G4675]] head, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] wash [[G3538]] thy [[G4675]] face; [[G4383]]

### 18
That [[G3704]] thou appear [[G5316]] not [[G3361]] unto men [[G444]] to fast, [[G3522]] but [[G235]] unto [[G3962]] thy [[G4675]] Father [[G3962]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] secret: [[G2927]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] Father, [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] seeth [[G991]] in [[G1722]] secret, [[G2927]] shall reward [[G591]] thee [[G4671]] openly. [[G5318]]

### 19
Lay [[G2343]] not [[G3361]] up [[G2343]] for yourselves [[G5213]] treasures [[G2344]] upon [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] where [[G3699]] moth [[G4597]] and [[G2532]] rust [[G1035]] doth corrupt, [[G853]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] thieves [[G2812]] break through [[G1358]] and [[G2532]] steal: [[G2813]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] lay up [[G2343]] for yourselves [[G5213]] treasures [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] where [[G3699]] neither [[G3777]] moth [[G4597]] nor [[G3777]] rust [[G1035]] doth corrupt, [[G853]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] thieves [[G2812]] not [[G3756]] do break [[G1358]] through [[G1358]] nor [[G3761]] steal: [[G2813]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] where [[G3699]] your [[G5216]] treasure [[G2344]] is, [[G2076]] there [[G1563]] will [[G2071]] your [[G5216]] heart [[G2588]] be [[G2071]] also. [[G2532]]

### 22
The [[G3588]] light [[G3088]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4983]] body [[G4983]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] eye: [[G3788]] if [[G1437]] therefore [[G3767]] thine [[G4675]] eye [[G3788]] be [[G5600]] single, [[G573]] thy [[G4675]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] shall be [[G2071]] full of light. [[G5460]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] thine [[G4675]] eye [[G3788]] be [[G5600]] evil, [[G4190]] thy [[G4675]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] shall be [[G2071]] full of darkness. [[G4652]] If [[G1487]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] that is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] thee [[G4671]] be [[G2076]] darkness, [[G4655]] how great [[G4214]] that darkness! [[G4655]]

### 24
No man [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] serve [[G1398]] two [[G1417]] masters: [[G2962]] for [[G1063]] either [[G2228]] he will hate [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] one, [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] other; [[G2087]] or else [[G2228]] he will hold to [[G472]] the one, [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] despise [[G2706]] the [[G3588]] other. [[G2087]] Ye [[G3756]] cannot [[G1410]] serve [[G1398]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] mammon. [[G3126]]

### 25
Therefore [[G1223]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] no [[G3361]] Take [[G3309]] thought [[G3309]] for [[G5590]] your [[G5216]] life, [[G5590]] what [[G5101]] ye shall eat, [[G5315]] or [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] ye shall drink; [[G4095]] nor yet [[G3366]] for [[G4983]] your [[G5216]] body, [[G4983]] what [[G5101]] ye shall put on. [[G1746]] Is [[G2076]] not [[G3780]] the [[G3588]] life [[G5590]] more [[G4119]] than meat, [[G5160]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] than raiment? [[G1742]]

### 26
Behold [[G1689]] the [[G3588]] fowls [[G4071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] air: [[G3772]] for [[G3754]] they sow [[G4687]] not, [[G3756]] neither [[G3761]] do they reap, [[G2325]] nor [[G3761]] gather [[G4863]] into [[G1519]] barns; [[G596]] yet [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] feedeth [[G5142]] them. [[G846]] not [[G3756]] ye [[G5210]] Are [[G1308]] much [[G3123]] better [[G1308]] than they? [[G846]]

### 27
Which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] by taking thought [[G3309]] can [[G1410]] add [[G4369]] one [[G1520]] cubit [[G4083]] unto [[G1909]] his [[G846]] stature? [[G2244]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] why [[G5101]] take ye thought [[G3309]] for [[G4012]] raiment? [[G1742]] Consider [[G2648]] the [[G3588]] lilies [[G2918]] the [[G3588]] of [[G68]] field, [[G68]] how [[G4459]] they grow; [[G837]] they toil [[G2872]] not, [[G3756]] neither [[G3761]] do they spin: [[G3514]]

### 29
And yet [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] even [[G3761]] Solomon [[G4672]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] not [[G3761]] was arrayed [[G4016]] like [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] of these. [[G5130]]

### 30
Wherefore, [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] so [[G3779]] clothe [[G294]] the [[G3588]] grass [[G5528]] the [[G3588]] of [[G68]] field, [[G68]] to day [[G4594]] which [[G5607]] is, [[G5607]] and [[G2532]] to morrow [[G839]] is cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the oven, [[G2823]] not [[G3756]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] you, [[G5209]] O ye of little faith? [[G3640]]

### 31
Therefore [[G3767]] no [[G3361]] take [[G3309]] thought, [[G3309]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] shall we eat? [[G5315]] or, [[G2228]] What [[G5101]] shall we drink? [[G4095]] or, [[G2228]] Wherewithal [[G5101]] shall we be clothed? [[G4016]]

### 32
(For [[G1063]] after all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] the [[G3588]] do [[G1934]] Gentiles [[G1484]] seek:) [[G1934]] for [[G1063]] your [[G5216]] heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] knoweth [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] ye have need [[G5535]] of things. [[G5130]] all [[G537]] these [[G5130]]

### 33
But [[G1161]] seek ye [[G2212]] first [[G4412]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] righteousness; [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] shall be added [[G4369]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 34
therefore [[G3767]] Take [[G3309]] no [[G3361]] thought [[G3309]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] morrow: [[G839]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] morrow [[G839]] shall take thought [[G3309]] for the things [[G3588]] of itself. [[G1438]] Sufficient [[G713]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2250]] day [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G2549]] thereof. [[G846]]
