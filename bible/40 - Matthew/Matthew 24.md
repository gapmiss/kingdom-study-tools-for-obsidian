### 1
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went out, [[G1831]] and departed [[G4198]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] temple: [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to [[G4334]] for to shew [[G1925]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] buildings [[G3619]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2411]] temple. [[G2411]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] See [[G991]] not [[G3756]] ye [[G991]] all [[G3956]] these things? [[G5023]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] not [[G3756]] There shall be [[G863]] left [[G863]] here [[G5602]] one stone [[G3037]] upon [[G1909]] another, [[G3037]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] shall be thrown [[G2647]] down. [[G2647]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] as [[G2521]] he [[G846]] sat [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] of [[G3588]] Olives, [[G1636]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] unto him [[G846]] privately, [[G2596]] saying, [[G3004]] Tell [[G2036]] us, [[G2254]] when [[G4219]] these things [[G5023]] shall [[G2071]] be? [[G2071]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] of [[G3952]] thy [[G4674]] coming, [[G3952]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] end [[G4930]] of the [[G3588]] world? [[G165]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Take heed that [[G991]] no [[G3361]] man [[G5100]] deceive [[G4105]] you. [[G5209]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] saying, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Christ; [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] shall deceive [[G4105]] many. [[G4183]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] ye shall [[G3195]] hear [[G191]] of wars [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] rumours [[G189]] of wars: [[G4171]] see that [[G3708]] not [[G3361]] ye be [[G2360]] troubled: [[G2360]] for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] must [[G1163]] come to pass, [[G1096]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] is [[G2076]] not yet. [[G3768]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] nation [[G1484]] shall rise [[G1453]] against [[G1909]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kingdom [[G932]] against [[G1909]] kingdom: [[G932]] and [[G2532]] there shall be [[G2071]] famines, [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] pestilences, [[G3061]] and [[G2532]] earthquakes, [[G4578]] in [[G2596]] divers places. [[G5117]]

### 8
All [[G3956]] these [[G5023]] the beginning [[G746]] of sorrows. [[G5604]]

### 9
Then [[G5119]] shall they deliver [[G3860]] you [[G5209]] up to be [[G1519]] afflicted, [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] shall kill [[G615]] you: [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] ye shall be [[G2071]] hated [[G3404]] of [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] for [[G1223]] my [[G3450]] name's [[G3686]] sake. [[G1223]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall be [[G4624]] many [[G4183]] offended, [[G4624]] and [[G2532]] shall betray [[G3860]] one another, [[G240]] and [[G2532]] shall hate [[G3404]] one another. [[G240]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] false prophets [[G5578]] shall rise, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] shall deceive [[G4105]] many. [[G4183]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] because [[G1223]] iniquity [[G458]] shall abound, [[G4129]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of many [[G4183]] shall wax cold. [[G5594]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] he that shall endure [[G5278]] unto [[G1519]] the end, [[G5056]] the same [[G3778]] shall be saved. [[G4982]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] gospel [[G2098]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom [[G932]] shall be preached [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] world [[G3625]] for [[G1519]] a witness [[G3142]] all [[G3956]] unto [[G1484]] nations; [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall [[G2240]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] come. [[G2240]]

### 15
When [[G3752]] therefore [[G3767]] ye shall [[G1492]] see [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] abomination [[G946]] of desolation, [[G2050]] spoken of [[G4483]] by [[G1223]] Daniel [[G1158]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] stand [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G5117]] holy [[G40]] place, [[G5117]] (whoso [[G3588]] readeth, [[G314]] let him understand:) [[G3539]]

### 16
Then [[G5119]] them [[G3588]] let [[G5343]] which be [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Judaea [[G2449]] flee [[G5343]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] mountains: [[G3735]]

### 17
him [[G3588]] Let come [[G2597]] which is [[G3588]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetop [[G1430]] not [[G3361]] down [[G2597]] to take [[G142]] any thing [[G5100]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] house: [[G3614]]

### 18
Neither [[G3361]] him [[G3588]] let [[G1994]] which is in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] field [[G68]] return [[G1994]] back [[G3694]] to take [[G142]] his [[G846]] clothes. [[G2440]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] unto them [[G3588]] that are [[G2192]] with [[G1722]] child, [[G1064]] and [[G2532]] to them [[G3588]] that give suck [[G2337]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days! [[G2250]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] pray ye [[G4336]] that [[G2443]] your [[G5216]] flight [[G5437]] be [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] in the winter, [[G5494]] neither [[G3366]] on [[G1722]] the sabbath day: [[G4521]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] then [[G5119]] shall be [[G2071]] great [[G3173]] tribulation, [[G2347]] such as [[G3634]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] since [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] of the world [[G2889]] to [[G2193]] this [[G3588]] time, [[G3568]] no, [[G3761]] nor [[G3756]] ever [[G3361]] shall be. [[G1096]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] except [[G1487]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] should be shortened, [[G2856]] no [[G3756]] there [[G302]] should be [[G4982]] flesh [[G4561]] saved: [[G4982]] but [[G1161]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] elect's [[G1588]] sake [[G1223]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] shall be shortened. [[G2856]]

### 23
Then [[G5119]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] shall say [[G2036]] unto you, [[G5213]] Lo, [[G2400]] here [[G5602]] Christ, [[G5547]] or [[G2228]] there; [[G5602]] believe [[G4100]] not. [[G3361]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] there shall arise [[G1453]] false Christs, [[G5580]] and [[G2532]] false prophets, [[G5578]] and [[G2532]] shall shew [[G1325]] great [[G3173]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders; [[G5059]] insomuch that, [[G5620]] if [[G1487]] possible, [[G1415]] they shall deceive [[G4105]] the [[G3588]] very [[G2532]] elect. [[G1588]]

### 25
Behold, [[G2400]] I have told before. [[G4280]] you [[G5213]]

### 26
Wherefore [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] they shall say [[G2036]] unto you, [[G5213]] Behold, [[G2400]] he is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] desert; [[G2048]] go [[G1831]] not [[G3361]] forth: [[G1831]] behold, [[G2400]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] secret chambers; [[G5009]] believe [[G4100]] not. [[G3361]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] lightning [[G796]] cometh [[G1831]] out [[G575]] of the east, [[G395]] and [[G2532]] shineth [[G5316]] even unto [[G2193]] the west; [[G1424]] so [[G3779]] shall [[G2071]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] be. [[G2071]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] wheresoever [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] carcase [[G4430]] is, [[G5600]] there [[G1563]] will be gathered [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] eagles [[G105]] together. [[G4863]]

### 29
Immediately [[G2112]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] tribulation [[G2347]] of [[G2250]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] shall be [[G4654]] sun [[G2246]] darkened, [[G4654]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G1325]] give [[G1325]] her [[G846]] light, [[G5338]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] stars [[G792]] shall fall [[G4098]] from [[G575]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] powers [[G1411]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] heavens [[G3772]] shall be shaken: [[G4531]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall appear [[G5316]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall [[G2875]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] tribes [[G5443]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] mourn, [[G2875]] and [[G2532]] they shall see [[G3700]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] clouds [[G3507]] of heaven [[G3772]] with [[G3326]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] he shall send [[G649]] his [[G846]] angels [[G32]] with [[G3326]] a [[G5456]] great [[G3173]] sound [[G5456]] of a trumpet, [[G4536]] and [[G2532]] they shall gather together [[G1996]] his [[G846]] elect [[G1588]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] winds, [[G417]] from [[G575]] one end [[G206]] of heaven [[G3772]] to [[G2193]] the other. [[G206]]

### 32
Now [[G1161]] learn [[G3129]] a [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fig [[G3588]] tree; [[G4808]] When [[G3752]] his [[G846]] branch [[G2798]] is [[G1096]] yet [[G2235]] tender, [[G527]] and [[G2532]] putteth forth [[G1631]] leaves, [[G5444]] ye know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] summer [[G2330]] nigh: [[G1451]]

### 33
So [[G3779]] likewise [[G2532]] ye, [[G5210]] when [[G3752]] ye shall see [[G1492]] all [[G3956]] these things, [[G5023]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] near, [[G1451]] at [[G1909]] the doors. [[G2374]]

### 34
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] This [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] shall pass, [[G3928]] not [[G3756]] till [[G2193]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] be fulfilled. [[G1096]]

### 35
Heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] shall pass away, [[G3928]] but [[G1161]] my [[G3450]] words [[G3056]] not [[G3756]] shall pass [[G3928]] away. [[G3928]]

### 36
But [[G1161]] of [[G4012]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] hour [[G5610]] knoweth [[G1492]] no [[G3762]] no, not [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] of [[G3588]] heaven, [[G3772]] but [[G1487]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] only. [[G3441]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of Noe [[G3575]] so [[G3779]] shall [[G2071]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] be. [[G2071]]

### 38
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] that [[G3588]] were [[G2258]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] flood [[G2627]] they were eating [[G5176]] and [[G2532]] drinking, [[G4095]] marrying [[G1060]] and [[G2532]] giving in marriage, [[G1547]] until [[G891]] the day [[G2250]] that [[G3739]] Noe [[G3575]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ark, [[G2787]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] knew [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] flood [[G2627]] came, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] took [[G142]] them all [[G537]] away; [[G142]] so [[G3779]] shall [[G2071]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] be. [[G2071]]

### 40
Then [[G5119]] two [[G1417]] shall [[G2071]] be [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] field; [[G68]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] shall be taken, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G1520]] left. [[G863]]

### 41
Two [[G1417]] grinding [[G229]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mill; [[G3459]] the one [[G1520]] shall be taken, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] the other [[G1520]] left. [[G863]]

### 42
Watch [[G1127]] therefore: [[G3767]] for [[G3754]] ye know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G4169]] hour [[G5610]] your [[G5216]] Lord [[G2962]] doth come. [[G2064]]

### 43
But [[G1161]] know [[G1097]] this, [[G1565]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] goodman of the house [[G3617]] had known [[G1492]] what [[G4169]] in [[G5438]] watch [[G5438]] the [[G3588]] thief [[G2812]] would come, [[G2064]] he would have watched, [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] would have [[G1439]] suffered [[G1439]] his [[G846]] house [[G3614]] to be broken up. [[G1358]]

### 44
Therefore [[G1223]] be [[G1096]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] ready: [[G2092]] for [[G3754]] such [[G3739]] in an [[G5610]] hour [[G5610]] as ye think [[G1380]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] man [[G444]] cometh. [[G2064]]

### 45
Who [[G5101]] then [[G687]] is [[G2076]] a [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] wise [[G5429]] servant, [[G1401]] whom [[G3739]] his [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] hath made ruler [[G2525]] over [[G1909]] his [[G846]] household, [[G2322]] to give [[G1325]] them [[G846]] meat [[G5160]] in [[G1722]] due season? [[G2540]]

### 46
Blessed [[G3107]] that [[G1565]] servant, [[G1401]] whom [[G3739]] his [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] when he cometh [[G2064]] shall find [[G2147]] so [[G3779]] doing. [[G4160]]

### 47
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] he shall make [[G2525]] him [[G846]] ruler [[G2525]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] goods. [[G5224]]

### 48
But [[G1161]] and if [[G1437]] that [[G1565]] evil [[G2556]] servant [[G1401]] shall say [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] My [[G3450]] lord [[G2962]] delayeth [[G5549]] his coming; [[G2064]]

### 49
And [[G2532]] shall begin [[G756]] to smite [[G5180]] fellowservants, [[G4889]] and [[G1161]] to eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] drunken; [[G3184]]

### 50
The [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] of [[G1401]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] shall come [[G2240]] in [[G1722]] a day [[G2250]] when [[G3739]] he looketh for [[G4328]] not [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] an hour [[G5610]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] he is of, [[G1097]] aware [[G1097]]

### 51
And [[G2532]] shall cut asunder, [[G1371]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] appoint [[G5087]] his [[G846]] portion [[G3313]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] hypocrites: [[G5273]] there [[G1563]] shall be [[G2071]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of teeth. [[G3599]]
