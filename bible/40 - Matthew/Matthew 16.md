### 1
The [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] also with [[G2532]] the Sadducees [[G4523]] came, [[G4334]] and tempting [[G3985]] desired [[G1905]] him [[G846]] that he would shew [[G1925]] them [[G846]] a sign [[G4592]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 2
He [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] When it is [[G1096]] evening, [[G3798]] ye say, [[G3004]] fair weather: [[G2105]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] is red. [[G4449]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] in the morning, [[G4404]] foul weather [[G5494]] to day: [[G4594]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] is red [[G4449]] and lowring. [[G4768]] O hypocrites, [[G5273]] ye [[G3772]] can [[G1097]] discern [[G1252]] the [[G3588]] face [[G4383]] of the [[G3588]] sky; [[G3772]] but [[G1161]] can [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] ye [[G1410]] the [[G3588]] signs [[G4592]] of the [[G3588]] times? [[G2540]]

### 4
A wicked [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] adulterous [[G3428]] generation [[G1074]] seeketh after [[G1934]] a sign; [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] there shall be [[G1325]] sign [[G4592]] given [[G1325]] unto it, [[G846]] but [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] of the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Jonas. [[G2495]] And [[G2532]] he left [[G2641]] them, [[G846]] and departed. [[G565]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when were [[G2064]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side, [[G4008]] they had forgotten [[G1950]] to take [[G2983]] bread. [[G740]]

### 6
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Take heed [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] leaven [[G2219]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] of the Sadducees. [[G4523]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] reasoned [[G1260]] among [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] saying, [[G3004]] because [[G3754]] we have taken [[G2983]] no [[G3756]] bread. [[G740]]

### 8
when [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] perceived, [[G1097]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] O ye of little faith, [[G3640]] why [[G5101]] reason ye [[G1260]] among [[G1722]] yourselves, [[G1438]] because [[G3754]] ye have brought [[G2983]] no [[G3756]] bread? [[G740]]

### 9
not yet [[G3768]] Do ye [[G3539]] understand, [[G3539]] neither [[G3761]] remember [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] the [[G3588]] of five [[G4000]] thousand, [[G4000]] and [[G2532]] how many [[G4214]] baskets [[G2894]] ye took up? [[G2983]]

### 10
Neither [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] loaves [[G740]] the [[G3588]] of four [[G5070]] thousand, [[G5070]] and [[G2532]] how many [[G4214]] baskets [[G4711]] ye took up? [[G2983]]

### 11
How [[G4459]] is it that [[G4459]] not [[G3756]] ye do [[G3539]] understand [[G3539]] that [[G3754]] I spake [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] to you [[G5213]] concerning [[G4012]] bread, [[G740]] that ye should beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] leaven [[G2219]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] of the Sadducees? [[G4523]]

### 12
Then [[G5119]] understood they [[G4920]] how that [[G3754]] he bade [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] leaven [[G2219]] of bread, [[G740]] but [[G235]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] doctrine [[G1322]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] of the Sadducees. [[G4523]]

### 13
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G3313]] of Caesarea [[G2542]] Philippi, [[G5376]] he asked [[G2065]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] saying, [[G3004]] Whom [[G5101]] do that [[G3004]] men [[G444]] say [[G3004]] I [[G3165]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] am? [[G1511]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Some [[G3303]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist: [[G3588]] some, [[G243]] Elias; [[G2243]] and [[G1161]] others, [[G2087]] Jeremias, [[G2408]] or [[G2228]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 15
He saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] But [[G1161]] whom [[G5101]] say [[G3004]] ye [[G5210]] I [[G3165]] that [[G3004]] am? [[G1511]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Blessed [[G3107]] art [[G1488]] thou, [[G1488]] Simon [[G4613]] Barjona: [[G920]] for [[G3754]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood [[G129]] not [[G3756]] hath revealed [[G601]] unto thee, [[G4671]] but [[G235]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] I [[G2504]] say [[G3004]] also [[G2504]] unto thee, [[G4671]] That [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] rock [[G4073]] I will build [[G3618]] my [[G3450]] church; [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] the gates [[G4439]] of hell [[G86]] not [[G3756]] shall against [[G2729]] prevail [[G2729]] it. [[G846]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] I will give [[G1325]] unto thee [[G4671]] the [[G3588]] keys [[G2807]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven: [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G3739]] thou [[G1437]] shalt bind [[G1210]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] shall be [[G2071]] bound [[G1210]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G3739]] thou [[G1437]] shalt loose [[G3089]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] shall be [[G2071]] loosed [[G3089]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 20
Then [[G5119]] charged he [[G1291]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] that [[G2443]] they should tell [[G2036]] no man [[G3367]] that [[G3754]] he [[G846]] was [[G2076]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 21
From [[G575]] that time [[G5119]] forth [[G575]] began [[G756]] Jesus [[G2424]] to shew [[G1166]] unto his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] how that [[G3754]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] go [[G565]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] suffer [[G3958]] many things [[G4183]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] be killed, [[G615]] and [[G2532]] be raised again [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day. [[G2250]]

### 22
Then [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] took [[G4355]] him, [[G846]] and [[G4074]] began to [[G756]] rebuke [[G2008]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Be it far [[G2436]] from thee, [[G4671]] Lord: [[G2962]] this [[G5124]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2071]] be [[G2071]] unto thee. [[G4671]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] turned, [[G4762]] and said [[G2036]] unto Peter, [[G4074]] Get [[G5217]] thee [[G5217]] behind [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] Satan: [[G4567]] thou art [[G1488]] an offence [[G4625]] unto me: [[G3450]] for [[G3754]] thou savourest [[G5426]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] things [[G3588]] that be [[G3588]] of God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] those [[G3588]] that [[G3588]] be [[G3588]] of men. [[G444]]

### 24
Then [[G5119]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] will [[G2309]] come [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] let him deny [[G533]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] his [[G846]] cross, [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3739]] will [[G2309]] save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] shall lose [[G622]] it: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] will lose [[G622]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G1752]] my [[G1700]] sake [[G1752]] shall find [[G2147]] it. [[G846]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] is [[G5623]] a man [[G444]] profited, [[G5623]] if [[G1437]] he shall gain [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G1161]] lose [[G2210]] his own [[G846]] soul? [[G5590]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] shall [[G1325]] a man [[G444]] give [[G1325]] in exchange [[G465]] for [[G5590]] his [[G846]] soul? [[G5590]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] shall [[G3195]] come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G3962]] his [[G846]] Father [[G3962]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] angels; [[G32]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] he shall reward [[G591]] every man [[G1538]] according to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] works. [[G4234]]

### 28
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] There be [[G1526]] some [[G5100]] standing [[G2476]] here, [[G5602]] which [[G3748]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G1089]] taste [[G1089]] of death, [[G2288]] till [[G2193]] they see [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] man [[G444]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] kingdom.
