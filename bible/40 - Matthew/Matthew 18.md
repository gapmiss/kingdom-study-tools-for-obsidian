### 1
At [[G1722]] the same [[G1565]] time [[G5610]] came [[G4334]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] unto [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] saying, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] the greatest [[G3187]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3772]] heaven? [[G3772]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] called [[G4341]] a little child [[G3813]] unto him, [[G4341]] and set [[G2476]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of them, [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Except [[G1437]] ye be converted, [[G4762]] and [[G2532]] become [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] little [[G3588]] children, [[G3813]] not [[G3756]] ye shall [[G1525]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 4
Whosoever [[G3748]] therefore [[G3767]] shall humble [[G5013]] himself [[G1438]] as [[G5613]] this [[G5124]] little child, [[G3813]] the same [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] greatest [[G3187]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven. [[G3772]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] whoso [[G3739]] shall receive [[G1209]] one [[G1520]] such [[G5108]] little child [[G3813]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] name [[G3686]] receiveth [[G1209]] me. [[G1691]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] whoso [[G3739]] shall offend [[G4624]] one [[G1520]] of ones [[G3398]] these [[G5130]] little [[G3398]] which [[G3588]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] me, [[G1691]] it were better [[G4851]] for him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] a millstone [[G3458]] were hanged [[G2910]] about [[G1909]] his [[G846]] neck, [[G5137]] and [[G2532]] he were drowned [[G2670]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] depth [[G3989]] of the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 7
Woe [[G3759]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2889]] world [[G2889]] because [[G575]] of offences! [[G4625]] for [[G1063]] must needs [[G318]] it [[G2076]] be [[G2076]] that [[G2064]] offences [[G4625]] come; [[G2064]] but [[G4133]] woe [[G3759]] to [[G444]] that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] offence [[G4625]] cometh! [[G2064]]

### 8
Wherefore [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] thy [[G4675]] hand [[G5495]] or [[G2228]] thy [[G4675]] foot [[G4228]] offend [[G4624]] thee, [[G4571]] cut [[G1581]] them [[G846]] off, [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] from [[G575]] thee: [[G4675]] it is [[G2076]] better [[G2570]] for thee [[G4671]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] life [[G2222]] halt [[G5560]] or [[G2228]] maimed, [[G2948]] rather than [[G2228]] having [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] hands [[G5495]] or [[G2228]] two [[G1417]] feet [[G4228]] to be cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] everlasting [[G166]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] thine [[G4675]] eye [[G3788]] offend [[G4624]] thee, [[G4571]] pluck [[G1807]] it [[G846]] out, [[G1807]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] from [[G575]] thee: [[G4675]] it is [[G2076]] better [[G2570]] for thee [[G4671]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] life [[G2222]] with one eye, [[G3442]] rather than [[G2228]] having [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] eyes [[G3788]] to be cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] hell [[G1067]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 10
Take heed that [[G3708]] ye despise [[G2706]] not [[G3361]] one [[G1520]] of ones; [[G3398]] these [[G5130]] little [[G3398]] for [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] their [[G846]] angels [[G32]] do [[G991]] always [[G3956]] behold [[G991]] the [[G3588]] face [[G4383]] of [[G3962]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] which is in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is come [[G2064]] to save [[G4982]] that which was lost. [[G622]]

### 12
How [[G5101]] think [[G1380]] ye? [[G5213]] if [[G1437]] a [[G5100]] man [[G444]] have [[G1096]] an hundred [[G1540]] sheep, [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] be gone astray, [[G4105]] not [[G3780]] doth he [[G863]] leave [[G863]] the [[G3588]] ninety and nine, [[G1768]] and goeth [[G4198]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] mountains, [[G3735]] and seeketh [[G2212]] that which is gone astray? [[G4105]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] so be that [[G1096]] he find [[G2147]] it, [[G846]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] he [[G3754]] rejoiceth [[G5463]] more [[G3123]] of [[G1909]] that [[G846]] than [[G2228]] of [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ninety and nine [[G1768]] which went [[G4105]] not [[G3361]] astray. [[G4105]]

### 14
Even so [[G3779]] it is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] the will [[G2307]] of [[G3962]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] that [[G2443]] one [[G1520]] of ones [[G3398]] these [[G5130]] little [[G3398]] should perish. [[G622]]

### 15
Moreover [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] thy [[G4675]] brother [[G80]] shall trespass [[G264]] against [[G1519]] thee, [[G4571]] go [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] tell his [[G1651]] him [[G846]] fault [[G1651]] between [[G3342]] thee [[G4675]] and [[G2532]] him [[G846]] alone: [[G3441]] if [[G1437]] he shall hear [[G191]] thee, [[G4675]] thou hast gained [[G2770]] thy [[G4675]] brother. [[G80]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] not [[G3361]] he will [[G191]] hear [[G191]] take [[G3880]] with [[G3326]] thee [[G4675]] one [[G1520]] or [[G2228]] two [[G1417]] more, [[G2089]] that [[G2443]] in [[G1909]] the mouth [[G4750]] two [[G1417]] of [[G3144]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] witnesses [[G3144]] every [[G3956]] word [[G4487]] may be established. [[G2476]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] he shall neglect to hear [[G3878]] them, [[G846]] tell [[G2036]] unto the [[G3588]] church: [[G1577]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] he [[G1577]] neglect to hear [[G3878]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] let him be [[G2077]] unto thee [[G4671]] as [[G5618]] an heathen man [[G1482]] and [[G2532]] a [[G3588]] publican. [[G5057]]

### 18
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Whatsoever [[G3745]] ye shall bind [[G1210]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] shall be [[G2071]] bound [[G1210]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G3745]] ye shall loose [[G3089]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] shall be [[G2071]] loosed [[G3089]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 19
Again [[G3825]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] two [[G1417]] of you [[G5216]] shall agree [[G4856]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] as touching [[G4012]] any [[G3956]] thing [[G4229]] that [[G3739]] they shall ask, [[G154]] it shall be done [[G1096]] for them [[G846]] of [[G3844]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] which is in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] where [[G3757]] two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] are [[G1526]] gathered together [[G4863]] in [[G1519]] my [[G1699]] name, [[G3686]] there [[G1563]] am I [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of them. [[G846]]

### 21
Then [[G5119]] came [[G4334]] Peter [[G4074]] to him, [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] how oft [[G4212]] shall [[G264]] my [[G3450]] brother [[G80]] sin [[G264]] against [[G1519]] me, [[G1691]] and [[G2532]] I forgive [[G863]] him? [[G846]] till [[G2193]] seven times? [[G2034]]

### 22
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] I say [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Until [[G2193]] seven times: [[G2034]] but, [[G235]] Until [[G2193]] seventy times [[G1441]] seven. [[G2033]]

### 23
Therefore [[G1223]] is [[G3666]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]]  of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] likened [[G3666]] unto a certain [[G444]] king, [[G935]] which [[G3739]] would [[G2309]] take [[G4868]] account [[G3056]] of [[G3326]] his [[G846]] servants. [[G1401]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] when had [[G756]] he [[G846]] begun [[G756]] to reckon, [[G4868]] one [[G1520]] was brought [[G4374]] unto him, [[G846]] which owed him [[G3781]] ten thousand [[G3463]] talents. [[G5007]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] forasmuch as [[G1161]] he [[G846]] had [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] to pay, [[G591]] his [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] commanded [[G2753]] him [[G846]] to be sold, [[G4097]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] he had, [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] payment to be made. [[G591]]

### 26
The [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] therefore [[G3767]] fell down, [[G4098]] and worshipped [[G4352]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] have patience [[G3114]] with [[G1909]] me, [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] I will pay [[G591]] thee [[G4671]] all. [[G3956]]

### 27
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] of [[G1401]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] was moved with compassion, [[G4697]] and loosed [[G630]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] forgave [[G863]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] debt. [[G1156]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] went out, [[G1831]] and found [[G2147]] one [[G1520]] of [[G4889]] his [[G846]] fellowservants, [[G4889]] which [[G3739]] owed [[G3784]] him [[G846]] an hundred [[G1540]] pence: [[G1220]] and [[G2532]] he laid hands [[G2902]] on him, [[G846]] and took by the throat, [[G4155]] saying, [[G3004]] Pay [[G591]] me [[G3427]] that [[G5100]] thou owest. [[G3784]]

### 29
And [[G3767]] his [[G846]] fellowservant [[G4889]] fell [[G4098]] down [[G4098]] at [[G1519]] his [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and besought [[G3870]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Have patience [[G3114]] with [[G1909]] me, [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] I will pay [[G591]] thee [[G4671]] all. [[G3956]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] would [[G2309]] not: [[G3756]] but [[G235]] went [[G565]] and [[G565]] cast [[G906]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] till [[G2193]] he [[G3739]] should pay [[G591]] the [[G3588]] debt. [[G3784]]

### 31
So [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] his [[G846]] fellowservants [[G4889]] saw [[G1492]] what was done, [[G1096]] they were [[G3076]] very [[G4970]] sorry, [[G3076]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] and told [[G1285]] unto [[G2962]] their [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] all [[G3956]] that was done. [[G1096]]

### 32
Then [[G5119]] his [[G846]] lord, [[G2962]] after that he had called [[G4341]] him, [[G846]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] O thou [[G1401]] wicked [[G4190]] servant, [[G1401]] I forgave [[G863]] thee [[G4671]] all [[G3956]] that [[G1565]] debt, [[G3782]] because [[G1893]] thou desiredst [[G3870]] me: [[G3165]]

### 33
Shouldest [[G1163]] not [[G3756]] thou [[G4571]] also [[G2532]] have had compassion [[G1653]] on [[G4889]] thy [[G4675]] fellowservant, [[G4889]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] had pity [[G1653]] on thee? [[G4571]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] was wroth, [[G3710]] and delivered [[G3860]] him [[G846]] to the [[G3588]] tormentors, [[G930]] till [[G2193]] he [[G3739]] should pay [[G591]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] was due [[G3784]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 35
So likewise [[G3779]] my [[G3450]] shall [[G4160]] heavenly [[G2032]] Father [[G3962]] do [[G4160]] also [[G2532]] unto you, [[G5213]] if [[G1437]] ye [[G863]] from [[G575]] your [[G5216]] hearts [[G2588]] forgive [[G863]] not [[G3361]] every one [[G1538]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] their [[G846]] trespasses. [[G3900]]
