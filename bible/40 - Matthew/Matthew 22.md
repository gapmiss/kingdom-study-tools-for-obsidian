### 1
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and spake [[G2036]] unto them [[G846]] again [[G3825]] by [[G1722]] parables, [[G3850]] and said, [[G3004]]

### 2
The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is like unto [[G3666]] a certain [[G444]] king, [[G935]] which [[G3748]] made [[G4160]] a marriage [[G1062]] for [[G5207]] his [[G846]] son, [[G5207]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] sent forth [[G649]] his [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] to call [[G2564]] them that were bidden [[G2564]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wedding: [[G1062]] and [[G2532]] they would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] come. [[G2064]]

### 4
Again, [[G3825]] he sent forth [[G649]] other [[G243]] servants, [[G1401]] saying, [[G3004]] Tell [[G2036]] them which are bidden, [[G2564]] Behold, [[G2400]] I have prepared [[G2090]] my [[G3450]] dinner: [[G712]] my [[G3450]] oxen [[G5022]] and [[G2532]] fatlings [[G4619]] killed, [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] all things [[G3956]] ready: [[G2092]] come [[G1205]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] marriage. [[G1062]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] made light of [[G272]] and went their ways, [[G565]] one [[G3588]] to [[G1519]] his [[G2398]] farm, [[G68]] another [[G3588]] to [[G1519]] his [[G846]] merchandise: [[G1711]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] remnant [[G3062]] took [[G2902]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] and entreated spitefully, [[G5195]] and [[G2532]] slew [[G615]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] when [[G191]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] heard [[G191]] he was wroth: [[G3710]] and [[G2532]] he sent forth [[G3992]] his [[G846]] armies, [[G4753]] and destroyed [[G622]] those [[G1565]] murderers, [[G5406]] and [[G2532]] burned up [[G1714]] their [[G846]] city. [[G4172]]

### 8
Then [[G5119]] saith [[G3004]] he [[G3004]] to [[G1401]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] The [[G3588]] wedding [[G1062]] is [[G2076]] ready, [[G2092]] but [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] which were bidden [[G2564]] were [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] worthy. [[G514]]

### 9
Go ye [[G4198]] therefore [[G3767]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] highways, [[G1327]] and [[G2532]] as many [[G3745]] as [[G302]] ye shall find, [[G2147]] bid [[G2564]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] marriage. [[G1062]]

### 10
So [[G2532]] those [[G1565]] servants [[G1401]] went out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] highways, [[G3598]] and gathered together [[G4863]] all [[G3956]] as many as [[G3745]] they found, [[G2147]] both [[G5037]] bad [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] good: [[G18]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wedding [[G1062]] was furnished [[G4130]] with guests. [[G345]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] when in [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] came [[G1525]] to see [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] guests, [[G345]] he saw [[G1492]] there [[G1563]] a man [[G444]] not [[G3756]] which had [[G1746]] on [[G1746]] a wedding [[G1062]] garment: [[G1742]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Friend, [[G2083]] how [[G4459]] camest [[G1525]] thou in [[G1525]] hither [[G5602]] not [[G3361]] having [[G2192]] a [[G1742]] wedding [[G1062]] garment? [[G1742]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] was speechless. [[G5392]]

### 13
Then [[G5119]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1249]] servants, [[G1249]] Bind [[G1210]] him [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] foot, [[G4228]] and take away, [[G142]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G1544]] into [[G1519]] outer [[G1857]] darkness; [[G4655]] there [[G1563]] shall be [[G2071]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of teeth. [[G3599]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] are [[G1526]] called, [[G2822]] but [[G1161]] few [[G3641]] chosen. [[G1588]]

### 15
Then [[G5119]] went [[G4198]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] and took [[G2983]] counsel [[G4824]] how [[G3704]] they might entangle [[G3802]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] talk. [[G3056]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] they sent out [[G649]] unto him [[G846]] their [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Herodians, [[G2265]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] thou art [[G1488]] true, [[G227]] and [[G2532]] teachest [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] truth, [[G225]] neither [[G2532]] carest [[G3199]] thou [[G4671]] for [[G4012]] any [[G3762]] for [[G1063]] thou regardest [[G991]] not [[G3756]] the [[G1519]] person [[G4383]] of men. [[G444]]

### 17
Tell [[G2036]] us [[G2254]] therefore, [[G3767]] What [[G5101]] thinkest [[G1380]] thou? [[G4671]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] to give [[G1325]] tribute [[G2778]] unto Caesar, [[G2541]] or [[G2228]] not? [[G3756]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] perceived [[G1097]] their [[G846]] wickedness, [[G4189]] and said, [[G2036]] Why [[G5101]] tempt ye [[G3985]] me, [[G3165]] hypocrites? [[G5273]]

### 19
Shew [[G1925]] me [[G3427]] the [[G3588]] tribute [[G2778]] money. [[G3546]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] brought [[G4374]] unto him [[G846]] a penny. [[G1220]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Whose [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] image [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] superscription? [[G1923]]

### 21
They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Caesar's. [[G2541]] Then [[G5119]] saith he [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Render [[G591]] therefore [[G3767]] unto Caesar [[G2541]] the [[G3588]] things [[G3588]] which are Caesar's; [[G2541]] and [[G2532]] unto God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] things [[G3588]] that are God's. [[G2316]]

### 22
When [[G2532]] they had heard [[G191]] they marvelled, [[G2296]] and [[G2532]] left [[G863]] him, [[G846]] and went their way. [[G565]]

### 23
The [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] came [[G4334]] to him [[G846]] the Sadducees, [[G4523]] which say that [[G3004]] there is [[G1511]] no [[G3361]] resurrection, [[G386]] and [[G2532]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]]

### 24
Saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] Moses [[G3475]] said, [[G2036]] If [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] die, [[G599]] having [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] children, [[G5043]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] shall marry [[G1918]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] raise up [[G450]] seed [[G4690]] unto [[G80]] his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]]

### 25
Now [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] with [[G3844]] us [[G2254]] seven [[G2033]] brethren: [[G80]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first, [[G4413]] when he had married a wife, [[G1060]] deceased, [[G5053]] and, [[G2532]] having [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] issue, [[G4690]] left [[G863]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] unto [[G80]] his [[G846]] brother: [[G80]]

### 26
Likewise [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] also, [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third, [[G5154]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] seventh. [[G2033]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] last [[G5305]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] died [[G599]] also. [[G2532]]

### 28
Therefore [[G3767]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] whose [[G5101]] wife [[G1135]] shall she be [[G2071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2033]] seven? [[G2033]] for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] they [[G2192]] had [[G2192]] her. [[G846]]

### 29
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye do err, [[G4105]] not [[G3361]] knowing [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] scriptures, [[G1124]] nor [[G3366]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 30
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] neither [[G3777]] they [[G1060]] marry, [[G1060]] nor [[G3777]] are given in marriage, [[G1547]] but [[G235]] are [[G1526]] as [[G5613]] the angels [[G32]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] as touching [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3498]] dead, [[G3498]] not [[G3756]] have ye [[G314]] read [[G314]] that which was spoken [[G4483]] unto you [[G5213]] by [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 32
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jacob? [[G2384]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] the God [[G2316]] of the dead, [[G3498]] but [[G235]] of the living. [[G2198]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] when [[G191]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] heard [[G191]] they were astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] doctrine. [[G1322]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] when had [[G191]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] he had put to [[G5392]] the [[G3588]] Sadducees [[G4523]] silence, [[G5392]] they [[G3588]] were gathered [[G4863]] together. [[G1909]]

### 35
Then [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] a lawyer, [[G3544]] asked [[G1905]] tempting [[G3985]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 36
Master, [[G1320]] which [[G4169]] the [[G1785]] great [[G3173]] commandment [[G1785]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law? [[G3551]]

### 37
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] the Lord [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] God [[G2316]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] soul, [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] mind. [[G1271]]

### 38
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the first [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] commandment. [[G1785]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] the second [[G1208]] like unto [[G3664]] it, [[G846]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] thy [[G4675]] neighbour [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] thyself. [[G4572]]

### 40
On [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] two [[G1417]] commandments [[G1785]] hang [[G2910]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 41
While [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] were gathered together, [[G4863]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked [[G1905]] them, [[G846]]

### 42
Saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] think [[G1380]] ye [[G5213]] of [[G4012]] Christ? [[G5547]] whose [[G5101]] son [[G5207]] is he? [[G2076]] They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] of David. [[G1138]]

### 43
He saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] How [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] David [[G1138]] doth [[G2564]] in [[G1722]] spirit [[G4151]] call [[G2564]] him [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 44
The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G2962]] my [[G3450]] Lord, [[G2962]] Sit [[G2521]] thou [[G2521]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] right hand, [[G1188]] till [[G2193]] I [[G302]] make [[G5087]] thine [[G4675]] enemies [[G2190]] thy [[G4675]] footstool? [[G5286]]

### 45
If [[G1487]] David [[G1138]] then [[G3767]] call [[G2564]] him [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G4459]] is he [[G2076]] his [[G846]] son? [[G5207]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] was able [[G1410]] to answer [[G611]] him [[G846]] a word, [[G3056]] neither [[G3761]] durst [[G5111]] any [[G5100]] from [[G575]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] forth [[G575]] ask [[G1905]] him [[G846]] any more [[G3765]]
