### 1
The [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] went [[G1831]] Jesus [[G2424]] out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] and sat [[G2521]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea side. [[G2281]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] multitudes [[G3793]] were gathered together [[G4863]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] so that [[G5620]] he [[G846]] went [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] a ship, [[G4143]] and sat; [[G2521]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] multitude [[G3793]] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] shore. [[G123]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he spake [[G2980]] many things [[G4183]] unto them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] parables, [[G3850]] saying, [[G3004]] Behold, [[G2400]] a sower [[G4687]] went forth [[G1831]] to sow; [[G4687]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] when [[G1722]] he [[G846]] sowed, [[G4687]] some [[G3739]] fell [[G4098]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] way side, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fowls [[G4071]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] devoured [[G2719]] them [[G846]] up: [[G2719]]

### 5
Some [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] upon [[G1909]] stony places, [[G4075]] where [[G3699]] they had [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] much [[G4183]] earth: [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] forthwith [[G2112]] they sprung up, [[G1816]] because [[G1223]] they had [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] deepness [[G899]] of earth: [[G1093]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] when the sun [[G2246]] was up, [[G393]] they were scorched; [[G2739]] and [[G2532]] because [[G1223]] they had [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] root, [[G4491]] they withered away. [[G3583]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] some [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] among [[G1909]] thorns; [[G173]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] thorns [[G173]] sprung up, [[G305]] and [[G2532]] choked [[G638]] them: [[G846]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] other [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] into [[G1909]] good [[G2570]] ground, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] brought forth [[G1325]] fruit, [[G2590]] some [[G3739]] an hundredfold, [[G1540]] some [[G3739]] sixtyfold, [[G1835]] some [[G3739]] thirtyfold. [[G5144]]

### 9
Who hath [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came, [[G4334]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Why [[G1302]] speakest thou [[G2980]] unto them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] parables? [[G3850]]

### 11
He [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Because [[G3754]] it is given [[G1325]] unto you [[G5213]] to know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] mysteries [[G3466]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven, [[G3772]] but [[G1161]] to them [[G1565]] not [[G3756]] it is [[G1325]] given. [[G1325]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3748]] hath, [[G2192]] to him [[G846]] shall be given, [[G1325]] and [[G2532]] he shall have more abundance: [[G4052]] but [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3748]] hath [[G2192]] not, [[G3756]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] shall be taken away [[G142]] even [[G2532]] that [[G3739]] he hath. [[G2192]]

### 13
Therefore [[G1223]] speak [[G2980]] to them [[G846]] I [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] parables: [[G3850]] because [[G3754]] seeing [[G991]] they [[G991]] see [[G991]] not; [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] hearing [[G191]] they hear [[G191]] not, [[G3756]] neither [[G3761]] do they understand. [[G4920]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] them [[G846]] is fulfilled [[G378]] the [[G3588]] prophecy [[G4394]] of Esaias, [[G2268]] which saith, [[G3004]] By hearing [[G189]] ye shall hear, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] shall [[G4920]] not [[G3361]] understand; [[G4920]] and [[G2532]] seeing [[G991]] ye shall see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] shall [[G1492]] not [[G3361]] perceive: [[G1492]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] this [[G5127]] people's [[G2992]] heart [[G2588]] is waxed gross, [[G3975]] and [[G2532]] ears [[G3775]] are dull of [[G917]] hearing, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] they have closed; [[G2576]] lest at any time [[G3379]] they should see [[G1492]] with eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] hear [[G191]] with ears, [[G3775]] and [[G2532]] should understand [[G4920]] with heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] should be converted, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] I should heal [[G2390]] them. [[G846]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] blessed [[G3107]] your [[G5216]] eyes, [[G3788]] for [[G3754]] they see: [[G991]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] ears, [[G3775]] for [[G3754]] they hear. [[G191]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] righteous [[G1342]] have desired [[G1937]] to see [[G1492]] which [[G3739]] ye see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] have [[G1492]] seen [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] to hear [[G191]] which [[G3739]] ye hear, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] have [[G191]] heard [[G191]]

### 18
Hear [[G191]] ye [[G5210]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4687]] sower. [[G4687]]

### 19
When any one [[G3956]] heareth [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] understandeth [[G4920]] not, [[G3361]] then cometh [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] wicked [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] catcheth away [[G726]] that which was sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] he which received seed [[G4687]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] way side. [[G3598]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] he that received the seed [[G4687]] into [[G1909]] stony places, [[G4075]] the same [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] he that heareth [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] anon [[G2117]] with [[G3326]] joy [[G5479]] receiveth [[G2983]] it; [[G846]]

### 21
Yet [[G1161]] hath he [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] root [[G4491]] in [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] dureth [[G2076]] for a while: [[G4340]] for [[G1161]] when [[G1161]] tribulation [[G2347]] or [[G2228]] persecution [[G1375]] ariseth [[G1096]] because [[G1223]] of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] by and by [[G2117]] he is offended. [[G4624]]

### 22
He [[G3588]] also [[G1161]] that received seed [[G4687]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] thorns [[G173]] is [[G2076]] he [[G3778]] that heareth [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word; [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] care [[G3308]] of this [[G5127]] world, [[G165]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] deceitfulness [[G539]] of riches, [[G4149]] choke [[G4846]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] he becometh [[G1096]] unfruitful. [[G175]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that received seed [[G4687]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] ground [[G1093]] is [[G2076]] he [[G3778]] that heareth [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] understandeth [[G4920]] which [[G3739]] also [[G1211]] beareth fruit, [[G2592]] and [[G2532]] bringeth forth, [[G4160]] some [[G3739]] an hundredfold, [[G1540]] some [[G3739]] sixty, [[G1835]] some [[G3739]] thirty. [[G5144]]

### 24
Another [[G243]] parable [[G3850]] put he forth [[G3908]] unto them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is likened unto [[G3666]] a man [[G444]] which sowed [[G4687]] good [[G2570]] seed [[G4690]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] field: [[G68]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] while [[G1722]] men [[G444]] slept, [[G2518]] his [[G846]] enemy [[G2190]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] sowed [[G4687]] tares [[G2215]] among [[G303]] the wheat, [[G4621]] and [[G2532]] went his way. [[G565]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] blade [[G5528]] was sprung up, [[G985]] and [[G2532]] brought forth [[G4160]] fruit, [[G2590]] then [[G5119]] appeared [[G5316]] the [[G3588]] tares [[G2215]] also. [[G2532]]

### 27
So [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] servants [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3617]] householder [[G3617]] came [[G4334]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Sir, [[G2962]] not [[G3780]] didst thou [[G4687]] sow [[G4687]] good [[G2570]] seed [[G4690]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4674]] field? [[G68]] from whence [[G4159]] then [[G3767]] hath it [[G2192]] tares? [[G2215]]

### 28
He [[G3588]] said [[G5346]] unto them, [[G846]] An enemy [[G2190]] hath done [[G4160]] this. [[G5124]] The [[G3588]] servants [[G1401]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Wilt [[G2309]] thou [[G2309]] then [[G3767]] that we go [[G565]] and gather up? [[G4816]] them [[G846]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G5346]] Nay; [[G3756]] lest [[G3379]] while ye gather up [[G4816]] the [[G3588]] tares, [[G2215]] ye [[G2215]] root [[G1610]] up also [[G1610]] the [[G3588]] wheat [[G4621]] with [[G260]] them. [[G846]]

### 30
Let [[G863]] both [[G297]] grow together [[G4885]] until [[G3360]] the [[G3588]] harvest: [[G2326]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] of harvest [[G2326]] I will say [[G2046]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2327]] reapers, [[G2327]] Gather ye together [[G4816]] first [[G4412]] the [[G3588]] tares, [[G2215]] and [[G2532]] bind [[G1210]] them [[G846]] in [[G1519]] bundles [[G1197]] to [[G4314]] burn [[G2618]] them: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] gather [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] wheat [[G4621]] into [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] barn. [[G596]]

### 31
Another [[G243]] parable [[G3850]] put he forth [[G3908]] unto them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] like to [[G3664]] a grain [[G2848]] of mustard seed, [[G4615]] which [[G3739]] a man [[G444]] took, [[G2983]] and sowed [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] field: [[G68]]

### 32
Which [[G3739]] indeed [[G3303]] is [[G2076]] the least [[G3398]] of all [[G3956]] seeds: [[G4690]] but [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] it is grown, [[G837]] it is [[G2076]] the greatest [[G3173]] among herbs, [[G3001]] and [[G2532]] becometh [[G1096]] a tree, [[G1186]] so that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] air [[G3772]] come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] lodge [[G2681]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] branches [[G2798]] thereof. [[G846]]

### 33
Another [[G243]] parable [[G3850]] spake [[G2980]] he [[G2980]] unto them; [[G846]] The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] like unto [[G3664]] leaven, [[G2219]] which [[G3739]] a woman [[G1135]] took, [[G2983]] and hid [[G1470]] in [[G1519]] three [[G5140]] measures [[G4568]] of meal, [[G224]] till [[G2193]] the whole [[G3650]] was leavened. [[G2220]]

### 34
All [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] spake [[G2980]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3793]] multitude [[G3793]] in [[G1722]] parables; [[G3850]] and [[G2532]] without [[G5565]] a parable [[G3850]] spake he [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] unto them: [[G846]]

### 35
That [[G3704]] it might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]] I will open [[G455]] my [[G3450]] mouth [[G4750]] in [[G1722]] parables; [[G3850]] I will utter [[G2044]] things which have been kept secret [[G2928]] from [[G575]] the foundation [[G2602]] of the world. [[G2889]]

### 36
Then [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] sent [[G863]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] away, [[G863]] and went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house: [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] unto him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Declare [[G5419]] unto us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2215]] tares [[G2215]] the [[G3588]] of [[G68]] field. [[G68]]

### 37
He [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] He that soweth [[G4687]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] seed [[G4690]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man; [[G444]]

### 38
The [[G3588]] field [[G68]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] world; [[G2889]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] seed [[G4690]] are [[G3778]] the children [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom; [[G932]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] tares [[G2215]] are [[G1526]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4190]] wicked [[G4190]]

### 39
The [[G3588]] enemy [[G2190]] that sowed [[G4687]] them [[G846]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] devil; [[G1228]] the [[G3588]] harvest [[G2326]] is [[G2076]] the end [[G4930]] the [[G3588]] of [[G165]] world; [[G165]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] reapers [[G2327]] are [[G1526]] the angels. [[G32]]

### 40
As [[G5618]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] tares [[G2215]] are gathered [[G4816]] and [[G2532]] burned [[G2618]] in the fire; [[G4442]] so [[G3779]] shall it be [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] end [[G4930]] of this [[G5127]] world. [[G165]]

### 41
The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] shall send forth [[G649]] his [[G846]] angels, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] they shall gather [[G4816]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] all [[G3956]] things [[G3956]] that offend, [[G4625]] and [[G2532]] them which do [[G4160]] iniquity; [[G458]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] shall cast [[G906]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] a furnace [[G2575]] of fire: [[G4442]] there [[G1563]] shall be [[G2071]] wailing [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of teeth. [[G3599]]

### 43
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] shall shine [[G1584]] righteous [[G1342]] forth [[G1584]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3962]] their [[G846]] Father. [[G3962]] Who hath [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 44
Again, [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] like unto [[G3664]] treasure [[G2344]] hid [[G2928]] in [[G1722]] a field; [[G68]] the which [[G3739]] when a man [[G444]] hath found, [[G2147]] he hideth, [[G2928]] and [[G2532]] for [[G575]] joy [[G5479]] thereof [[G846]] goeth [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] selleth [[G4453]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] he hath, [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] buyeth [[G59]] that [[G1565]] field. [[G68]]

### 45
Again, [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] like unto [[G3664]] a merchant [[G1713]] man, [[G444]] seeking [[G2212]] goodly [[G2570]] pearls: [[G3135]]

### 46
Who, [[G3739]] when he had found [[G2147]] one [[G1520]] pearl [[G3135]] of great price, [[G4186]] went [[G565]] and sold [[G4097]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] he had, [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] bought [[G59]] it. [[G846]]

### 47
Again, [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] like unto [[G3664]] a net, [[G4522]] that was cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] gathered [[G4863]] of [[G1537]] every [[G3956]] kind: [[G1085]]

### 48
Which, [[G3739]] when [[G3753]] it was full, [[G4137]] they drew [[G307]] to [[G1909]] shore, [[G123]] and [[G2532]] sat down, [[G2523]] and gathered [[G4816]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] into [[G1519]] vessels, [[G30]] but [[G1161]] cast [[G906]] the [[G3588]] bad [[G4550]] away. [[G1854]]

### 49
So [[G3779]] shall it be [[G2071]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] end [[G4930]] the [[G3588]] of [[G165]] world: [[G165]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] shall come forth, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] sever [[G873]] the [[G3588]] wicked [[G4190]] from [[G1537]] among [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] just, [[G1342]]

### 50
And [[G2532]] shall cast [[G906]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] furnace [[G2575]] of fire: [[G4442]] there [[G1563]] shall be [[G2071]] wailing [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of teeth. [[G3599]]

### 51
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Have ye understood [[G4920]] all [[G3956]] these things? [[G5023]] They [[G3004]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Yea, [[G3483]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 52
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] he [[G3588]] unto them, [[G846]] Therefore [[G1223]] every [[G3956]] scribe [[G1122]] instructed [[G3100]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] like unto [[G3664]] a man [[G444]] an householder, [[G3617]] which [[G3748]] bringeth forth [[G1544]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] treasure [[G2344]] new [[G2537]] and [[G2532]] old.
