### 18
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] birth [[G1083]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] was [[G2258]] on this wise: [[G3779]] When as [[G1063]] his [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] Mary [[G3137]] was espoused [[G3423]] to [[G3588]] Joseph, [[G2501]] before [[G4250]] they [[G846]] came [[G2228]] together, [[G4905]] she was found [[G2147]] with [[G2192]] child [[G1064]] of [[G1537]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 19
Then [[G1161]] Joseph [[G2501]] her [[G846]] husband, [[G435]] being [[G5607]] a just [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] willing [[G2309]] to make a publick example, [[G3856]] her [[G846]] was minded [[G1014]] to put away [[G630]] her [[G846]] privily. [[G2977]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] he [[G846]] while on [[G1760]] thought [[G1760]] these things, [[G5023]] behold, [[G2400]] the angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] appeared [[G5316]] unto him [[G846]] in [[G2596]] a dream, [[G3677]] saying, [[G3004]] Joseph, [[G2501]] thou son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] fear [[G5399]] not [[G3361]] to take unto thee [[G3880]] Mary [[G3137]] thy [[G4675]] wife: [[G1135]] for that [[G1063]] which [[G3588]] is conceived [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] she shall bring forth [[G5088]] a son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt call [[G2564]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] JESUS: [[G2424]] for [[G1063]] he [[G846]] shall save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] people [[G2992]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] sins. [[G266]]

### 22
Now [[G1161]] all [[G3650]] this [[G5124]] was done, [[G1096]] that it [[G2443]] might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which [[G3588]] was spoken [[G4483]] of [[G5259]] the Lord [[G3588]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 23
Behold, [[G2400]] a virgin [[G3933]] shall be [[G2192]] with [[G1722]] child, [[G1064]] and [[G2532]] shall bring forth [[G5088]] a son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] they shall call [[G2564]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] Emmanuel, [[G1694]] which [[G3739]] being interpreted [[G3177]] is, [[G2076]] God [[G2316]] with [[G3326]] us. [[G2257]]

### 24
Then [[G1161]] Joseph [[G2501]] being raised [[G1326]] from [[G575]] sleep [[G5258]] did [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] had bidden [[G4367]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] took [[G3880]] unto him [[G3880]] his [[G846]] wife: [[G1135]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] knew [[G1097]] her [[G846]] not [[G3756]] till [[G2193]] she had brought forth [[G5088]] her [[G846]] firstborn [[G4416]] son: [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] he called [[G2564]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] JESUS. [[G2424]]
