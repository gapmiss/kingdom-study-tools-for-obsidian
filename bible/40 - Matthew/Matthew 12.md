### 1
At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G4198]] on [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] sabbath day [[G4521]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] corn; [[G4702]] and [[G1161]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were an hungred, [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to pluck [[G5089]] the ears of corn, [[G4719]] and [[G2532]] to eat. [[G2068]]

### 2
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G1161]] Pharisees [[G5330]] saw [[G1492]] they said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Behold, [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] disciples [[G3101]] do [[G4160]] that which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1832]] lawful [[G1832]] to do [[G4160]] upon [[G1722]] the sabbath day. [[G4521]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] Have ye [[G314]] read [[G314]] what [[G5101]] David [[G1138]] did, [[G4160]] when [[G3753]] he [[G846]] was an hungred, [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that were [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] him; [[G846]]

### 4
How [[G4459]] he entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] did [[G4286]] eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] shewbread, [[G740]] which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] lawful [[G1832]] for him [[G846]] to eat, [[G5315]] neither [[G3761]] for them [[G3588]] which were with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] but [[G1487]] only [[G3441]] for [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] priests? [[G2409]]

### 5
Or [[G2228]] not [[G3756]] have ye [[G314]] read [[G314]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] how that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] days [[G4521]] the [[G3588]] priests [[G2409]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] profane [[G953]] the [[G3588]] sabbath, [[G4521]] and [[G2532]] are [[G1526]] blameless? [[G338]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] in this place [[G5602]] is [[G2076]] greater than [[G3187]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye had known [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] meaneth, [[G2076]] I will have [[G2309]] mercy, [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] sacrifice, [[G2378]] would [[G302]] ye have [[G2613]] not [[G3756]] condemned [[G2613]] the [[G3588]] guiltless. [[G338]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is [[G2076]] Lord [[G2962]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of sabbath [[G4521]] day. [[G4521]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when he was departed [[G3327]] thence, [[G1564]] he went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] their [[G846]] synagogue: [[G4864]]

### 10
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there was [[G2258]] a man [[G444]] which had [[G2192]] hand [[G5495]] withered. [[G3584]] And [[G2532]] they asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] to heal [[G2323]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] days? [[G4521]] that [[G2443]] they might accuse [[G2723]] him. [[G846]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] man [[G444]] shall there be [[G2071]] among [[G1537]] you, [[G5216]] that [[G3739]] shall have [[G2192]] one [[G1520]] sheep, [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] it [[G5124]] fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] a pit [[G999]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] day, [[G4521]] not [[G3780]] will he lay on [[G2902]] hold [[G2902]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] lift [[G1453]] out? [[G1453]]

### 12
How much [[G4214]] then [[G3767]] is [[G1308]] a man [[G444]] better [[G1308]] than a sheep? [[G4263]] Wherefore [[G5620]] it is lawful [[G1832]] to do [[G4160]] well [[G2573]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] days. [[G4521]]

### 13
Then [[G5119]] saith [[G3004]] he [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to [[G444]] man, [[G444]] Stretch [[G1614]] forth [[G1614]] thine [[G4675]] hand. [[G5495]] And [[G2532]] he stretched forth; [[G1614]] and [[G2532]] it was restored [[G600]] whole, [[G5199]] like as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] other. [[G243]]

### 14
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] went out, [[G1831]] and held [[G2983]] a council [[G4824]] against [[G2596]] him, [[G846]] how [[G3704]] they might destroy [[G622]] him. [[G846]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] when [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1097]] he withdrew himself [[G402]] from thence: [[G1564]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] multitudes [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he healed [[G2323]] them [[G846]] all; [[G3956]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] charged [[G2008]] them [[G846]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] they should [[G4160]] make [[G4160]] him [[G846]] known: [[G5318]]

### 17
That [[G3704]] it might be fulfilled [[G4137]] which was spoken [[G4483]] by [[G1223]] Esaias [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 18
Behold [[G2400]] my [[G3450]] servant, [[G3816]] whom [[G3739]] I have chosen; [[G140]] my [[G3450]] beloved, [[G27]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] my [[G3450]] soul [[G5590]] is well pleased: [[G2106]] I will put [[G5087]] my [[G3450]] spirit [[G4151]] upon [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he shall shew [[G518]] judgment [[G2920]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1484]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 19
not [[G3756]] He shall [[G2051]] strive, [[G2051]] nor [[G3761]] cry; [[G2905]] neither [[G3761]] shall [[G191]] any man [[G5100]] hear [[G191]] his [[G846]] voice [[G5456]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] streets. [[G4113]]

### 20
A bruised [[G4937]] reed [[G2563]] not [[G3756]] shall he [[G2608]] break, [[G2608]] and [[G2532]] smoking [[G5188]] flax [[G3043]] not [[G3756]] shall he [[G4570]] quench, [[G4570]] till [[G2193]] he send forth [[G1544]] judgment [[G2920]] unto [[G1519]] victory. [[G3534]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] the Gentiles [[G1484]] shall [[G1679]] trust. [[G1679]]

### 22
Then [[G5119]] was brought [[G4374]] unto him [[G846]] one possessed with a devil, [[G1139]] blind, [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] dumb: [[G2974]] and [[G2532]] he healed [[G2323]] him, [[G846]] insomuch that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] blind [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] dumb [[G2974]] both [[G2532]] spake [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] saw. [[G991]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] were amazed, [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] Is [[G2076]] not [[G3385]] this [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of David? [[G1138]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G1161]] Pharisees [[G5330]] heard [[G191]] they said, [[G2036]] This [[G3778]] not [[G3756]] doth out [[G1544]] cast [[G1544]] devils, [[G1140]] but [[G1487]] by [[G1722]] Beelzebub [[G954]] the prince [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1140]] devils. [[G1140]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1492]] their [[G846]] thoughts, [[G1761]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Every [[G3956]] kingdom [[G932]] divided [[G3307]] against [[G2596]] itself [[G1438]] is brought to desolation; [[G2049]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] city [[G4172]] or [[G2228]] house [[G3614]] divided [[G3307]] against [[G2596]] itself [[G1438]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2476]] stand: [[G2476]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] Satan [[G4567]] cast out [[G1544]] Satan, [[G4567]] he is divided [[G3307]] against [[G1909]] himself; [[G1438]] how [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] shall [[G2476]] his [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] stand? [[G2476]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] by [[G1722]] Beelzebub [[G954]] cast out [[G1544]] devils, [[G1140]] by [[G1722]] whom do [[G5101]] your [[G5216]] children [[G5207]] cast [[G1544]] out? [[G1544]] therefore [[G1223]] they [[G846]] shall be [[G2071]] your [[G5216]] judges. [[G2923]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] cast out [[G1544]] devils [[G1140]] by [[G1722]] the Spirit [[G4151]] of God, [[G2316]] then [[G686]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is come [[G5348]] unto [[G1909]] you. [[G5209]]

### 29
Or else [[G2228]] how [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] one [[G5100]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] a strong man's [[G2478]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] spoil [[G1283]] his [[G846]] goods, [[G4632]] except [[G1437]] he [[G1210]] first [[G4412]] bind [[G1210]] the [[G3588]] strong man? [[G2478]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] he will spoil [[G1283]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]]

### 30
He that is [[G5607]] not [[G3361]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] is [[G2076]] against [[G2596]] me; [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] he that gathereth [[G4863]] not [[G3361]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] scattereth abroad. [[G4650]]

### 31
Wherefore [[G1223]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] All [[G3956]] manner of [[G3956]] sin [[G266]] and [[G2532]] blasphemy [[G988]] shall be forgiven [[G863]] unto men: [[G444]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] blasphemy [[G988]] the [[G3588]] Ghost [[G4151]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G863]] forgiven [[G863]] unto men. [[G444]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] speaketh [[G2036]] a word [[G3056]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man, [[G444]] it shall be forgiven [[G863]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] speaketh [[G2036]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] not [[G3756]] it shall be [[G863]] forgiven [[G863]] him, [[G846]] neither [[G3777]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] world, [[G165]] neither [[G3777]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] to come. [[G3195]]

### 33
Either [[G2228]] make [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G1186]] good, [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] fruit [[G2590]] good; [[G2570]] or else [[G2228]] make [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G1186]] corrupt, [[G4550]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] fruit [[G2590]] corrupt: [[G4550]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G1186]] is known [[G1097]] by [[G1537]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 34
O generation [[G1081]] of vipers, [[G2191]] how [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] ye, [[G1410]] being [[G5607]] evil, [[G4190]] speak [[G2980]] good things? [[G18]] for [[G1063]] out [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4051]] abundance [[G4051]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2588]] heart [[G2588]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] speaketh. [[G2980]]

### 35
A [[G444]] good [[G18]] man [[G444]] out of [[G1537]] good [[G18]] treasure [[G2344]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2588]] heart [[G2588]] bringeth forth [[G1544]] good things: [[G18]] and [[G2532]] an [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] man [[G444]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] treasure [[G2344]] bringeth forth [[G1544]] evil things. [[G4190]] the [[G3588]]

### 36
But [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] every [[G3956]] idle [[G692]] word [[G4487]] that [[G3739]] men [[G444]] shall speak, [[G2980]] they shall give [[G591]] account [[G3056]] thereof [[G4012]] in [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] of judgment. [[G2920]]

### 37
For [[G1063]] by [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] words [[G3056]] thou shalt be justified, [[G1344]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] words [[G3056]] thou shalt be condemned. [[G2613]]

### 38
Then [[G5119]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1122]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] of the Pharisees [[G5330]] answered, [[G611]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] we would [[G2309]] see [[G1492]] a sign [[G4592]] from [[G575]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] An [[G1074]] evil [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] adulterous [[G3428]] generation [[G1074]] seeketh after [[G1934]] a sign; [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] there shall be [[G1325]] sign [[G4592]] given [[G1325]] to it, [[G846]] but [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophet [[G4396]] Jonas: [[G2495]]

### 40
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] Jonas [[G2495]] was [[G2258]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] nights [[G3571]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] whale's [[G2785]] belly; [[G2836]] so [[G3779]] shall [[G2071]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] be [[G2071]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] nights [[G3571]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 41
The men [[G435]] of Nineveh [[G3536]] shall rise [[G450]] in [[G1722]] judgment [[G2920]] with [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] generation, [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] shall condemn [[G2632]] it: [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they repented [[G3340]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] preaching [[G2782]] of Jonas; [[G2495]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a greater [[G4119]] than Jonas [[G2495]] here. [[G5602]]

### 42
The queen [[G938]] of the south [[G3558]] shall rise up [[G1453]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2920]] with [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] generation, [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] shall condemn [[G2632]] it: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] she came [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] uttermost parts [[G4009]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of Solomon; [[G4672]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a greater [[G4119]] than Solomon [[G4672]] here. [[G5602]]

### 43
When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] is gone [[G1831]] out of [[G575]] a man, [[G444]] he walketh [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] dry [[G504]] places, [[G5117]] seeking [[G2212]] rest, [[G372]] and [[G2532]] findeth [[G2147]] none. [[G3756]]

### 44
Then [[G5119]] he saith, [[G3004]] I will return [[G1994]] into [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] house [[G3624]] from whence [[G3606]] I came out; [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] when [[G2532]] he is come, [[G2064]] he findeth [[G2147]] empty, [[G4980]] swept, [[G4563]] and [[G2532]] garnished. [[G2885]]

### 45
Then [[G5119]] goeth he, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] taketh [[G3880]] with [[G3326]] himself [[G1438]] seven [[G2033]] other [[G2087]] spirits [[G4151]] more wicked [[G4191]] than himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] they enter in [[G1525]] and dwell [[G2730]] there: [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] of [[G444]] that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] is [[G1096]] worse [[G5501]] the [[G3588]] than [[G4413]] first. [[G4413]] Even so [[G3779]] shall it be [[G2071]] also [[G2532]] unto [[G1074]] this [[G3778]] wicked [[G4190]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 46
While [[G1161]] he [[G846]] yet [[G2089]] talked [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3793]] people, [[G3793]] behold, [[G2400]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brethren [[G80]] stood [[G2476]] without, [[G1854]] desiring [[G2212]] to speak [[G2980]] with him. [[G846]]

### 47
Then [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Behold, [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] brethren [[G80]] stand [[G2476]] without, [[G1854]] desiring [[G2212]] to speak [[G2980]] with thee. [[G4671]]

### 48
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto him that told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] mother? [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] are [[G1526]] my [[G3450]] brethren? [[G80]]

### 49
And [[G2532]] he stretched forth [[G1614]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] toward [[G1909]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and said, [[G2036]] Behold [[G2400]] my [[G3450]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] brethren! [[G80]]

### 50
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3748]] shall do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G3962]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] the same [[G846]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] brother, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] sister, [[G79]] and [[G2532]] mother. [[G3384]]
