[[2 Thessalonians 3|←]] • [[1 Timothy 2|→]]

---

### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] an apostle [[G652]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] by [[G2596]] the commandment [[G2003]] of God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Saviour, [[G4990]] and [[G2532]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] hope; [[G1680]]

### 2
Unto Timothy, [[G5095]] own [[G1103]] son [[G5043]] in [[G1722]] the faith: [[G4102]] Grace, [[G5485]] mercy, [[G1656]] peace, [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 3
As [[G2531]] I besought [[G3870]] thee [[G4571]] to abide still [[G4357]] at [[G1722]] Ephesus, [[G2181]] when I went [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] that [[G2443]] thou mightest charge [[G3853]] some [[G5100]] that they teach other doctrine, [[G2085]] no [[G3361]]

### 4
Neither [[G3366]] give heed to [[G4337]] fables [[G3454]] and [[G2532]] endless [[G562]] genealogies, [[G1076]] which [[G3748]] minister [[G3930]] questions, [[G2214]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] godly [[G2316]] edifying [[G3622]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] faith: [[G4102]]

### 5
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3852]] commandment [[G3852]] is [[G2076]] charity [[G26]] out of [[G1537]] a pure [[G2513]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] a good [[G18]] conscience, [[G4893]] and [[G2532]] faith [[G4102]] unfeigned: [[G505]]

### 6
From which [[G3739]] some [[G5100]] having swerved [[G795]] have turned aside [[G1624]] unto [[G1519]] vain jangling; [[G3150]]

### 7
Desiring [[G2309]] to be [[G1511]] teachers of the law; [[G3547]] understanding [[G3539]] neither [[G3383]] what [[G3739]] they say, [[G3004]] nor [[G3383]] whereof [[G4012]] they affirm. [[G1226]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] good, [[G2570]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] use [[G5530]] it [[G846]] lawfully; [[G3545]]

### 9
Knowing [[G1492]] this, [[G5124]] that [[G3754]] the law [[G3551]] not [[G3756]] is for [[G2749]] made [[G2749]] a righteous man, [[G1342]] but [[G1161]] for the lawless [[G459]] and [[G2532]] disobedient, [[G506]] for the ungodly [[G765]] and [[G2532]] for sinners, [[G268]] for unholy [[G462]] and [[G2532]] profane, [[G952]] for murderers of fathers [[G3964]] and [[G2532]] murderers of mothers, [[G3389]] for manslayers, [[G409]]

### 10
For whoremongers, [[G4205]] for them that defile themselves with mankind, [[G733]] for menstealers, [[G405]] for liars, [[G5583]] for perjured persons, [[G1965]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] there be that is to [[G480]] other thing [[G2087]] contrary [[G480]] sound [[G5198]] doctrine; [[G1319]]

### 11
According to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] glorious [[G1391]] gospel of [[G2098]] the [[G3588]] blessed [[G3107]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] was committed to trust. [[G4100]] my [[G1473]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] thank [[G5485]] I [[G2192]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G2257]] Lord, [[G2962]] who hath enabled [[G1743]] me, [[G3165]] for that [[G3754]] he counted [[G2233]] me [[G3165]] faithful, [[G4103]] putting me [[G5087]] into [[G1519]] the ministry; [[G1248]]

### 13
Who was [[G5607]] before [[G4386]] a [[G3588]] blasphemer, [[G989]] and [[G2532]] a persecutor, [[G1376]] and [[G2532]] injurious: [[G5197]] but [[G235]] I obtained mercy, [[G1653]] because [[G3754]] I did [[G4160]] ignorantly [[G50]] in [[G1722]] unbelief. [[G570]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] was exceeding abundant [[G5250]] with [[G3326]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] love [[G26]] which [[G3588]] is [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 15
This [[G3588]] a faithful [[G4103]] saying, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] worthy [[G514]] of all [[G3956]] acceptation, [[G594]] that [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] to save [[G4982]] sinners; [[G268]] of whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] chief. [[G4413]]

### 16
Howbeit [[G235]] for [[G1223]] this cause [[G5124]] I obtained mercy, [[G1653]] that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] me [[G1698]] first [[G4413]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] might shew forth [[G1731]] all [[G3956]] longsuffering, [[G3115]] for [[G4314]] a pattern [[G5296]] to them which should hereafter [[G3195]] believe [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] life [[G2222]] everlasting. [[G166]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] unto the King [[G935]] eternal, [[G165]] immortal, [[G862]] invisible, [[G517]] the only [[G3441]] wise [[G4680]] God, [[G2316]] honour [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 18
This [[G3778]] charge [[G3852]] I commit [[G3908]] unto thee, [[G4671]] son [[G5043]] Timothy, [[G5095]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] prophecies [[G4394]] which went before [[G4254]] on [[G1909]] thee, [[G4571]] that [[G2443]] thou mightest [[G4754]] by [[G1722]] them [[G846]] war [[G4754]] a [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] warfare; [[G4752]]

### 19
Holding [[G2192]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] a good [[G18]] conscience; [[G4893]] which [[G3739]] some [[G5100]] having put away [[G683]] concerning [[G4012]] faith [[G4102]] have made shipwreck: [[G3489]]

### 20
Of whom [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] Hymenaeus [[G5211]] and [[G2532]] Alexander; [[G223]] whom [[G3739]] I have delivered [[G3860]] unto [[G4567]] Satan, [[G4567]] that [[G2443]] they may learn [[G3811]] not [[G3361]] to blaspheme. [[G987]]
