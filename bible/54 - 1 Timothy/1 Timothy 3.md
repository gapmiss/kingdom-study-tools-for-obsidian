This [[G3588]] a true [[G4103]] saying, [[G3056]] If [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] desire [[G3713]] the office of a bishop, [[G1984]] he desireth [[G1937]] a good [[G2570]] work. [[G2041]]

### 2
A [[G3588]] bishop [[G1985]] then [[G3767]] must [[G1163]] be [[G1511]] blameless, [[G423]] the husband [[G435]] of one [[G1520]] wife, [[G1135]] vigilant, [[G3524]] sober, [[G4998]] of good behaviour, [[G2887]] given to hospitality, [[G5382]] apt to teach; [[G1317]]

### 3
Not [[G3361]] given to wine, [[G3943]] no [[G3361]] striker, [[G4131]] not [[G3361]] greedy of filthy lucre; [[G146]] but [[G235]] patient, [[G1933]] not a brawler, [[G269]] not covetous; [[G866]]

### 4
One that ruleth [[G4291]] well [[G2573]] his own [[G2398]] house, [[G3624]] having [[G2192]] his children [[G5043]] in [[G1722]] subjection [[G5292]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] gravity; [[G4587]]

### 5
(For [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] know how [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] to rule [[G4291]] his own [[G2398]] house, [[G3624]] how [[G4459]] of the [[G1577]] shall he take care [[G1959]] church [[G1577]] of God?) [[G2316]]

### 6
Not [[G3361]] a novice, [[G3504]] lest [[G3361]] being lifted up with pride [[G5187]] he fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] the condemnation [[G2917]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1228]] devil. [[G1228]]

### 7
Moreover [[G1161]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] have [[G2192]] a good [[G2570]] report [[G3141]] of [[G575]] them which are [[G3588]] without; [[G1855]] lest [[G3361]] he fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] reproach [[G3680]] and [[G2532]] the snare [[G3803]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1228]] devil. [[G1228]]

### 8
Likewise [[G5615]] the deacons [[G1249]] grave, [[G4586]] not [[G3361]] doubletongued, [[G1351]] not [[G3361]] given to [[G4337]] much [[G4183]] wine, [[G3631]] not [[G3361]] greedy of filthy lucre; [[G146]]

### 9
Holding [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4102]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] a pure [[G2513]] conscience. [[G4893]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] these [[G3778]] let be [[G1381]] also [[G2532]] first [[G4412]] proved; [[G1381]] then [[G1534]] let them use the office of a deacon, [[G1247]] being [[G5607]] blameless. [[G410]]

### 11
Even so [[G5615]] wives [[G1135]] grave, [[G4586]] not [[G3361]] slanderers, [[G1228]] sober, [[G3524]] faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 12
the deacons [[G1249]] Let [[G2077]] be [[G2077]] the husbands [[G435]] of one [[G1520]] wife, [[G1135]] ruling [[G4291]] their children [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] their own [[G2398]] houses [[G3624]] well. [[G2573]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] they that have used the office of a deacon [[G1247]] well [[G2573]] purchase [[G4046]] to themselves [[G1438]] a good [[G2570]] degree, [[G898]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] boldness [[G3954]] in [[G1722]] the faith [[G4102]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 14
These things [[G5023]] write I [[G1125]] unto thee, [[G4671]] hoping [[G1679]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] thee [[G4571]] shortly: [[G5032]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] I tarry long, [[G1019]] that [[G2443]] thou mayest know [[G1492]] how [[G4459]] thou oughtest [[G1163]] to behave thyself [[G390]] in [[G1722]] the house [[G3624]] of God, [[G2316]] which [[G3748]] is [[G2076]] the church [[G1577]] of the living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] the pillar [[G4769]] and [[G2532]] ground [[G1477]] the [[G3588]] of [[G225]] truth. [[G225]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] without controversy [[G3672]] great [[G3173]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of [[G2150]] godliness: [[G2150]] God [[G2316]] was manifest [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] the flesh, [[G4561]] justified [[G1344]] in [[G1722]] the Spirit, [[G4151]] seen [[G3700]] of angels, [[G32]] preached [[G2784]] unto [[G1722]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] believed on [[G4100]] in [[G1722]] the world, [[G2889]] received up [[G353]] into [[G1722]] glory.
