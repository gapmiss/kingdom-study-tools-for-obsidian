For [[G5228]] kings, [[G935]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that are [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] authority; [[G5247]] that [[G2443]] we may lead [[G1236]] a quiet [[G2263]] and [[G2532]] peaceable [[G2272]] life [[G979]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] godliness [[G2150]] and [[G2532]] honesty. [[G4587]]

For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] good [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] acceptable [[G587]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Saviour; [[G4990]]

### 4
Who [[G3739]] will have [[G2309]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] to be saved, [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G1519]] the knowledge [[G1922]] of the truth. [[G225]]

For [[G1063]] one [[G1520]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] mediator [[G3316]] between God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] men, [[G444]] the man [[G444]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus; [[G2424]]

### 6
Who gave [[G1325]] himself [[G1438]] a ransom [[G487]] for [[G5228]] all, [[G3956]]  to be [[G3588]] testified [[G3142]] in due [[G2398]] time. [[G2540]]

### 7
Whereunto [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am ordained [[G5087]] a preacher, [[G2783]] and [[G2532]] an apostle, [[G652]] (I speak [[G3004]] the truth [[G225]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] lie [[G5574]] not;) [[G3756]] a teacher [[G1320]] of the Gentiles [[G1484]] in [[G1722]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] verity. [[G225]]

In like manner [[G5615]] also, [[G2532]] that [[G2885]] women [[G1135]] adorn [[G2885]] themselves [[G1438]] in [[G1722]] modest [[G2887]] apparel, [[G2689]] with [[G3326]] shamefacedness [[G127]] and [[G2532]] sobriety; [[G4997]] not [[G3361]] with [[G1722]] broided hair, [[G4117]] or [[G2228]] gold, [[G5557]] or [[G2228]] pearls, [[G3135]] or [[G2228]] costly [[G4185]] array; [[G2441]]

### 10
But [[G235]] (which [[G3739]] becometh [[G4241]] women [[G1135]] professing [[G1861]] godliness) [[G2317]] with [[G1223]] good [[G18]] works. [[G2041]]

the woman [[G1135]] Let [[G3129]] learn [[G3129]] in [[G1722]] silence [[G2271]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] subjection. [[G5292]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] I suffer [[G2010]] not [[G3756]] a woman [[G1135]] to teach, [[G1321]] nor [[G3761]] to usurp authority over [[G831]] the man, [[G435]] but [[G235]] to be [[G1511]] in [[G1722]] silence. [[G2271]]

And [[G2532]] Adam [[G76]] not [[G3756]] was [[G538]] deceived, [[G538]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] being deceived [[G538]] was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the transgression. [[G3847]]

### 15
Notwithstanding [[G1161]] she shall be saved [[G4982]] in [[G1223]] childbearing, [[G5042]] if [[G1437]] they continue [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] charity [[G26]] and [[G2532]] holiness [[G38]] with [[G3326]] sobriety. [[G4997]]
