### 1
Rebuke [[G1969]] not [[G3361]] an elder, [[G4245]] but [[G235]] intreat [[G3870]] as [[G5613]] a father; [[G3962]] the younger men [[G3501]] as [[G5613]] brethren; [[G80]]

### 2
The elder women [[G4245]] as [[G5613]] mothers; [[G3384]] the younger [[G3501]] as [[G5613]] sisters, [[G79]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] purity. [[G47]]

### 3
Honour [[G5091]] widows [[G5503]] that are [[G3689]] widows [[G5503]] indeed. [[G3689]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] widow [[G5503]] have [[G2192]] children [[G5043]] or [[G2228]] nephews, [[G1549]] let them learn [[G3129]] first [[G4412]] to shew piety [[G2151]] at [[G2398]] home, [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] requite [[G287]] to their [[G591]] parents: [[G4269]] for [[G1063]] that [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] good [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] acceptable [[G587]] before [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]]

### 5
Now [[G1161]] she that [[G3588]] is [[G3689]] a widow [[G5503]] indeed, [[G3689]] and [[G2532]] desolate, [[G3443]] trusteth [[G1679]] in [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] continueth in [[G4357]] supplications [[G1162]] and [[G2532]] prayers [[G4335]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day. [[G2250]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] she that [[G3588]] liveth in pleasure [[G4684]] is dead [[G2348]] while she liveth. [[G2198]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] these things [[G5023]] give in charge, [[G3853]] that [[G2443]] they may be [[G5600]] blameless. [[G423]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] provide for [[G4306]] not [[G3756]] his own, [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] specially [[G3122]] for those of his own house, [[G3609]] he hath denied [[G720]] the [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] worse [[G5501]] than an infidel. [[G571]]

### 9
Let be taken into the [[G2639]] not [[G3361]] a widow [[G5503]] number [[G2639]] under [[G1640]] threescore [[G1835]] years old, [[G2094]] having been [[G1096]] the wife [[G1135]] of one [[G1520]] man, [[G435]]

### 10
Well reported of [[G3140]] for [[G1722]] good [[G2570]] works; [[G2041]] if [[G1487]] she have brought up children, [[G5044]] if [[G1487]] she have lodged strangers, [[G3580]] if [[G1487]] she have washed [[G3538]] the saints' [[G40]] feet, [[G4228]] if [[G1487]] she have relieved [[G1884]] the afflicted, [[G2346]] if [[G1487]] she have diligently followed [[G1872]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work. [[G2041]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] the younger [[G3501]] widows [[G5503]] refuse: [[G3868]] for [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] they have begun to wax wanton against [[G2691]] Christ, [[G5547]] they will [[G2309]] marry; [[G1060]]

### 12
Having [[G2192]] damnation, [[G2917]] because [[G3754]] they have cast off [[G114]] their [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] withal [[G260]] they learn [[G3129]] idle, [[G692]] wandering about [[G4022]] from house to house; [[G3614]] and [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] idle, [[G692]] but [[G235]] tattlers [[G5397]] also [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] busybodies, [[G4021]] speaking [[G2980]] things which [[G3588]] they ought [[G1163]] not. [[G3361]]

### 14
I will [[G1014]] therefore [[G3767]] the younger women [[G3501]] that [[G1060]] marry, [[G1060]] bear children, [[G5041]] guide the house, [[G3616]] give [[G1325]] none [[G3367]] occasion [[G874]] the [[G3588]] to [[G480]] adversary [[G480]] to speak reproachfully. [[G3059]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] some [[G5100]] already [[G2235]] are turned [[G1624]] aside [[G1624]] after [[G3694]] Satan. [[G4567]]

### 16
If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] man [[G4103]] or [[G2228]] woman that believeth [[G4103]] have [[G2192]] widows, [[G5503]] let them relieve [[G1884]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] let be [[G916]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] charged; [[G916]] that [[G2443]] it may relieve [[G1884]] them that [[G3588]] are [[G3689]] widows [[G5503]] indeed. [[G3689]]

### 17
the [[G3588]] Let be counted [[G515]] elders [[G4245]] that rule [[G4291]] well [[G2573]] worthy [[G515]] of double [[G1362]] honour, [[G5092]] especially [[G3122]] they who labour [[G2872]] in [[G1722]] the word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] doctrine. [[G1319]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] saith, [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G5392]] muzzle [[G5392]] the ox [[G1016]] that treadeth out the corn. [[G248]] And, [[G2532]] The [[G3588]] labourer [[G2040]] worthy [[G514]] of his [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]]

### 19
Against [[G2596]] an elder [[G4245]] receive [[G3858]] not [[G3361]] an accusation, [[G2724]] but [[G1622]] before [[G1909]] two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] witnesses. [[G3144]]

### 20
Them that sin [[G264]] rebuke [[G1651]] before [[G1799]] all, [[G3956]] that [[G2443]] others [[G3062]] also [[G2532]] fear. [[G5401]] may [[G2192]]

### 21
I charge [[G1263]] before [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elect [[G1588]] angels, [[G32]] that [[G2443]] thou observe [[G5442]] these things [[G5023]] without [[G5565]] preferring one before another, [[G4299]] doing [[G4160]] nothing [[G3367]] by [[G2596]] partiality. [[G4346]]

### 22
hands [[G5495]] Lay [[G2007]] suddenly [[G5030]] on [[G2007]] no man, [[G3367]] neither [[G3366]] be partaker of [[G2841]] other men's [[G245]] sins: [[G266]] keep [[G5083]] thyself [[G4572]] pure. [[G53]]

### 23
no longer [[G3371]] Drink [[G5202]] water, [[G5202]] but [[G235]] use [[G5530]] a little [[G3641]] wine [[G3631]] for sake [[G1223]] thy [[G4675]] stomach's [[G4751]] and [[G2532]] thine [[G4675]] often [[G4437]] infirmities. [[G769]]

### 24
Some [[G5100]] men's [[G444]] sins [[G266]] are [[G1526]] open beforehand, [[G4271]] going before [[G4254]] to [[G1519]] judgment; [[G2920]] and [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] they [[G2532]] follow after. [[G1872]]

### 25
Likewise [[G5615]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] works [[G2041]] are [[G2076]] manifest beforehand; [[G4271]] and [[G2532]] they that are [[G2192]] otherwise [[G247]] cannot [[G1410]] be hid. [[G2928]]
