### 1
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] speaketh [[G3004]] expressly, [[G4490]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] the latter [[G5306]] times [[G2540]] some [[G5100]] shall depart from [[G868]] the [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] giving heed to [[G4337]] seducing [[G4108]] spirits, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] doctrines [[G1319]] of devils; [[G1140]]

### 2
Speaking lies [[G5573]] in [[G1722]] hypocrisy; [[G5272]] having with a hot iron; [[G2743]] their [[G2398]] conscience [[G4893]] seared [[G2743]]

### 3
Forbidding [[G2967]] to marry, [[G1060]] to abstain from [[G567]] meats, [[G1033]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath created [[G2936]] to [[G1519]] be received [[G3336]] with [[G3326]] thanksgiving [[G2169]] of them which believe [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] know [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

### 4
For [[G3754]] every [[G3956]] creature [[G2938]] of God [[G2316]] good, [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] nothing [[G3762]] to be refused, [[G579]] if it be received [[G2983]] with [[G3326]] thanksgiving: [[G2169]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] it is sanctified [[G37]] by [[G1223]] the word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] prayer. [[G1783]]

### 6
put in remembrance of [[G5294]] If thou [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] these things, [[G5023]] thou shalt be [[G2071]] a good [[G2570]] minister [[G1249]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] nourished up in [[G1789]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of [[G4102]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] of [[G2570]] good [[G2570]] doctrine, [[G1319]] whereunto [[G3739]] thou hast attained. [[G3877]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] refuse [[G3868]] profane [[G952]] and [[G2532]] old wives' [[G1126]] fables, [[G3454]] and [[G1161]] exercise [[G1128]] thyself [[G4572]] unto [[G4314]] godliness. [[G2150]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] bodily [[G4984]] exercise [[G1129]] profiteth [[G2076]] little: [[G3641]] but [[G1161]] godliness [[G2150]] is [[G2076]] profitable [[G5624]] unto [[G4314]] all things, [[G3956]] having [[G2192]] promise [[G1860]] of the life [[G2222]] that now is, [[G3568]] and [[G2532]] of that which is to come. [[G3195]]

### 9
This [[G3588]] a faithful [[G4103]] saying [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] worthy [[G514]] of all [[G3956]] acceptation. [[G594]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] therefore [[G1519]] we [[G2872]] both [[G2532]] labour [[G2872]] and [[G2532]] suffer reproach, [[G3679]] because [[G3754]] we trust [[G1679]] in [[G1909]] the living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the Saviour [[G4990]] of all [[G3956]] men, [[G444]] specially [[G3122]] of those that believe. [[G4103]]

### 11
These things [[G5023]] command [[G3853]] and [[G2532]] teach. [[G1321]]

### 12
no man [[G3367]] Let [[G2706]] despise [[G2706]] thy [[G4675]] youth; [[G3503]] but [[G235]] be thou [[G1096]] an example [[G5179]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4103]] believers, [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] word, [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] conversation, [[G391]] in [[G1722]] charity, [[G26]] in [[G1722]] spirit, [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] faith, [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] purity. [[G47]]

### 13
Till [[G2193]] I come, [[G2064]] give attendance [[G4337]] to [[G320]] reading, [[G320]] to [[G3874]] exhortation, [[G3874]] to [[G1319]] doctrine. [[G1319]]

### 14
Neglect [[G272]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G5486]] that is in [[G1722]] thee, [[G4671]] which [[G3739]] was given [[G1325]] thee [[G4671]] by [[G1223]] prophecy, [[G4394]] with [[G3326]] the laying on [[G1936]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5495]] hands [[G5495]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4244]] presbytery. [[G4244]]

### 15
Meditate upon [[G3191]] these things; [[G5023]] give thyself wholly [[G2468]] to [[G1722]] them; [[G5125]] that [[G2443]] thy [[G4675]] profiting [[G4297]] appear [[G5318]] may [[G5600]] to [[G1722]] all. [[G3956]]

### 16
Take heed unto [[G1907]] thyself, [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1319]] doctrine; [[G1319]] continue in [[G1961]] them: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] in doing [[G4160]] this [[G5124]] both [[G2532]] thou shalt [[G4982]] save [[G4982]] thyself, [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] them that hear [[G191]] thee.
