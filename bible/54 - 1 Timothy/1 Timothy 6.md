### 1
as many as [[G3745]] Let [[G2233]] servants [[G1401]] are [[G1526]] under [[G5259]] the yoke [[G2218]] count [[G2233]] their own [[G2398]] masters [[G1203]] worthy [[G514]] of all [[G3956]] honour, [[G5092]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] doctrine [[G1319]] not [[G3361]] be [[G987]] blasphemed. [[G987]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] they that have [[G2192]] believing [[G4103]] masters, [[G1203]] not [[G3361]] let them [[G2706]] despise [[G2706]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1526]] brethren; [[G80]] but [[G235]] rather [[G3123]] do service, [[G1398]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1526]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] beloved, [[G27]] partakers [[G482]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2108]] benefit. [[G2108]] These things [[G5023]] teach [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] exhort. [[G3870]]

### 3
If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] teach otherwise, [[G2085]] and [[G2532]] consent [[G4334]] not [[G3361]] to wholesome [[G5198]] words, [[G3056]] the words [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1319]] doctrine [[G1319]] which is according to [[G2596]] godliness; [[G2150]]

### 4
He is proud, [[G5187]] knowing [[G1987]] nothing, [[G3367]] but [[G235]] doting [[G3552]] about [[G4012]] questions [[G2214]] and [[G2532]] strifes of words, [[G3055]] whereof [[G3739]] cometh [[G1096]] envy, [[G5355]] strife, [[G2054]] railings, [[G988]] evil [[G4190]] surmisings, [[G5283]]

### 5
Perverse disputings [[G3859]] of men [[G444]] of corrupt [[G1311]] minds, [[G3563]] and [[G2532]] destitute [[G650]] the [[G3588]] of [[G225]] truth, [[G225]] supposing that [[G3543]] gain [[G4200]] is [[G1511]] godliness: [[G2150]] from [[G575]] such [[G5108]] withdraw thyself. [[G868]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] godliness [[G2150]] with [[G3326]] contentment [[G841]] is [[G2076]] great [[G3173]] gain. [[G4200]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] we brought [[G1533]] nothing [[G3762]] into [[G1519]] world, [[G2889]] certain [[G1212]]  we [[G3754]] can [[G1410]] carry out. [[G1627]] nothing [[G3761]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] having [[G2192]] food [[G1305]] and [[G2532]] raiment [[G4629]] therewith [[G5125]] let us be [[G714]] content. [[G714]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] they that will [[G1014]] be rich [[G4147]] fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] temptation [[G3986]] and [[G2532]] a snare, [[G3803]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] foolish [[G453]] and [[G2532]] hurtful [[G983]] lusts, [[G1939]] which [[G3748]] drown [[G1036]] men [[G444]] in [[G1519]] destruction [[G3639]] and [[G2532]] perdition. [[G684]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] the love of [[G3588]] money [[G5365]] is [[G2076]] the root [[G4491]] of all [[G3956]] evil: [[G2556]] which [[G3739]] some [[G5100]] while after, [[G3713]] coveted [[G3713]] they have erred [[G635]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] pierced through [[G4044]] themselves [[G1438]] with many [[G4183]] sorrows. [[G3601]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] thou, [[G4771]] O [[G5599]] man [[G444]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] flee [[G5343]] these things; [[G5023]] and [[G1161]] follow after [[G1377]] righteousness, [[G1343]] godliness, [[G2150]] faith, [[G4102]] love, [[G26]] patience, [[G5281]] meekness. [[G4236]]

### 12
Fight [[G75]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] fight [[G73]] of [[G4102]] faith, [[G4102]] lay hold on [[G1949]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] whereunto [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] thou art [[G2564]] called, [[G2564]] and [[G2532]] hast professed [[G3670]] a [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] profession [[G3671]] before [[G1799]] many [[G4183]] witnesses. [[G3144]]

### 13
I give [[G3853]] thee [[G4671]] charge [[G3853]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] who quickeneth [[G2227]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3140]] before [[G1909]] Pontius [[G4194]] Pilate [[G4091]] witnessed [[G3140]] a [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] confession; [[G3671]]

### 14
That [[G5083]] thou [[G4571]] keep [[G5083]] commandment [[G1785]] without spot, [[G784]] unrebukeable, [[G423]] until [[G3360]] the [[G3588]] appearing [[G2015]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 15
Which [[G3739]] in his [[G2398]] times [[G2540]] he shall shew, [[G1166]] the [[G3588]] blessed [[G3107]] and [[G2532]] only [[G3441]] Potentate, [[G1413]] the [[G3588]] King of [[G935]] kings, [[G936]] and [[G2532]] Lord [[G2962]] of lords; [[G2961]]

### 16
Who [[G3588]] only [[G3441]] hath [[G2192]] immortality, [[G110]] dwelling in [[G3611]] the light [[G5457]] which no man can approach unto; [[G676]] whom [[G3739]] no [[G3762]] man [[G444]] hath seen, [[G1492]] nor [[G3761]] can [[G1410]] see: [[G1492]] to whom [[G3739]] honour [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] power [[G2904]] everlasting. [[G166]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 17
Charge [[G3853]] them that are rich [[G4145]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3568]] world, [[G165]] not [[G3361]] that they be [[G5309]] highminded, [[G5309]] nor [[G3366]] trust [[G1679]] in [[G1909]] uncertain [[G83]] riches, [[G4149]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] who giveth [[G3930]] us [[G2254]] richly [[G4146]] all things [[G3956]] to [[G1519]] enjoy; [[G619]]

### 18
That they do good, [[G14]] that they be rich [[G4147]] in [[G1722]] good [[G2570]] works, [[G2041]] ready to distribute, [[G2130]] willing to communicate; [[G2843]]

### 19
Laying up in store [[G597]] for themselves [[G1438]] a good [[G2570]] foundation [[G2310]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] time to come, [[G3195]] that [[G2443]] they may lay hold on [[G1949]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 20
O [[G5599]] Timothy, [[G5095]] keep [[G5442]]  that which is [[G3588]] committed to thy trust, [[G3872]] avoiding [[G1624]] profane [[G952]] vain babblings, [[G2757]] and [[G2532]] oppositions [[G477]] of science [[G1108]] falsely so called: [[G5581]]

### 21
Which [[G3739]] some [[G5100]] professing [[G1861]] have erred [[G795]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] Grace [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] thee. [[G4675]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 255
The first [[G4413]] to [[G4314]] Timothy [[G5095]] was written [[G1125]] from [[G575]] Laodicea, [[G2993]] which [[G3748]] is [[G1510]] the chiefest city [[G3390]] of Phrygia [[G5435]] Pacatiana. [[G3818]]
