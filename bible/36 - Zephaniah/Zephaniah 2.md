### 1
Gather yourselves together, [[H7197]] yea, gather together, [[H7197]] O nation [[H1471]] not [[H3808]] desired; [[H3700]]

### 2
Before [[H2962]] the decree [[H2706]] bring forth, [[H3205]] the day [[H3117]] pass [[H5674]] as the chaff, [[H4671]] before [[H3808]] the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] you, before [[H2962]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 3
Seek [[H1245]]  ye [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] ye meek [[H6035]] of the earth, [[H776]] which [[H834]] have wrought [[H6466]] his judgment; [[H4941]] seek [[H1245]] righteousness, [[H6664]] seek [[H1245]] meekness: [[H6038]] it may be [[H194]] ye shall be hid [[H5641]] in the day [[H3117]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] anger. [[H639]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] Gaza [[H5804]] shall be [[H1961]] forsaken, [[H5800]] and Ashkelon [[H831]] a desolation: [[H8077]] they shall drive out [[H1644]] Ashdod [[H795]] at the noon day, [[H6672]] and Ekron [[H6138]] shall be rooted up. [[H6131]]

### 5
Woe [[H1945]] unto the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the sea [[H3220]] coast, [[H2256]] the nation [[H1471]] of the Cherethites! [[H3774]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] against [[H5921]] you; O Canaan, [[H3667]] the land [[H776]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] I will even destroy [[H6]] thee, that there shall be no [[H369]] inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 6
And the sea [[H3220]] coast [[H2256]] shall be [[H1961]] dwellings [[H5116]] cottages [[H3741]] for shepherds, [[H7462]] and folds [[H1448]] for flocks. [[H6629]]

### 7
And the coast [[H2256]] shall be [[H1961]] for the remnant [[H7611]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah; [[H3063]] they shall feed [[H7462]] thereupon: [[H5921]] in the houses [[H1004]] of Ashkelon [[H831]] shall they lie down [[H7257]] in the evening: [[H6153]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] shall visit [[H6485]] them, and turn away [[H7725]] their captivity. [[H7622]]

### 8
I have heard [[H8085]] the reproach [[H2781]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and the revilings [[H1421]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] whereby [[H834]] they have reproached [[H2778]] my people, [[H5971]] and magnified [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] their border. [[H1366]]

### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Surely [[H3588]] Moab [[H4124]] shall be [[H1961]] as Sodom, [[H5467]] and the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] as Gomorrah, [[H6017]] the breeding [[H4476]] of nettles, [[H2738]] and saltpits, [[H4417]] and a perpetual [[H5704]] desolation: [[H8077]] the residue [[H7611]] of my people [[H5971]] shall spoil [[H962]] them, and the remnant [[H3499]] of my people [[H1471]] shall possess them. [[H5157]]

### 10
This [[H2063]] shall they have for [[H8478]] their pride, [[H1347]] because [[H3588]] they have reproached [[H2778]] and magnified [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 11
The Lord [[H3068]] terrible [[H3372]] unto [[H5921]] them: for [[H3588]] he will famish [[H7329]] all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of the earth; [[H776]] and shall worship [[H7812]] him, every one [[H376]] from his place, [[H4725]] all [[H3605]] the isles [[H339]] of the heathen. [[H1471]]

### 12
Ye [[H859]] Ethiopians [[H3569]] also, [[H1571]] ye [[H1992]] slain [[H2491]] by my sword. [[H2719]]

### 13
And he will stretch out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the north, [[H6828]] and destroy [[H6]] Assyria; [[H804]] and will make [[H7760]] Nineveh [[H5210]] a desolation, [[H8077]] dry [[H6723]] like a wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 14
And flocks [[H5739]] shall lie down [[H7257]] in the midst [[H8432]] of her, all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the nations: [[H1471]] both [[H1571]] the cormorant [[H6893]] and [[H1571]] the bittern [[H7090]] shall lodge [[H3885]] in the upper lintels [[H3730]] of it; voice [[H6963]] shall sing [[H7891]] in the windows; [[H2474]] desolation [[H2721]] in the thresholds: [[H5592]] for [[H3588]] he shall uncover [[H6168]] the cedar work. [[H731]]

### 15
This [[H2063]] the rejoicing [[H5947]] city [[H5892]] that dwelt [[H3427]] carelessly, [[H983]] that said [[H559]] in her heart, [[H3824]] I [[H589]] and none beside [[H657]] me: how [[H349]] is she become [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H8047]] a place for beasts [[H2416]] to lie down in! [[H4769]] every one [[H3605]] that passeth by [[H5674]] her shall hiss, [[H8319]] wag [[H5128]] his hand. [[H3027]]
