The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Zephaniah [[H6846]] the son [[H1121]] of Cushi, [[H3569]] the son [[H1121]] of Gedaliah, [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Amariah, [[H568]] the son [[H1121]] of Hizkiah, [[H2396]] in the days [[H3117]] of Josiah [[H2977]] the son [[H1121]] of Amon, [[H526]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
I will utterly [[H622]] consume [[H5486]] all [[H3605]] from off [[H5921]] the land, [[H6440]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
I will consume [[H5486]] man [[H120]] and beast; [[H929]] I will consume [[H5486]] the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] and the fishes [[H1709]] of the sea, [[H3220]] and the stumblingblocks [[H4384]] with [[H854]] the wicked; [[H7563]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] man [[H120]] from off [[H5921]] the land, [[H127]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
I will also stretch out [[H5186]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] the remnant [[H7605]] of Baal [[H1168]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] the name [[H8034]] of the Chemarims [[H3649]] with [[H5973]] the priests; [[H3548]]

### 5
And them that worship [[H7812]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] upon [[H5921]] the housetops; [[H1406]] and them that worship [[H7812]] that swear [[H7650]] by the Lord, [[H3068]] and that swear [[H7650]] by Malcham; [[H4445]]

### 6
And them that are turned back [[H5472]] from [[H310]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and that [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] sought [[H1245]] the Lord, [[H3068]] nor [[H3808]] inquired [[H1875]] for him. [[H1875]]

### 7
Hold thy peace [[H2013]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3069]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] at hand: [[H7138]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath prepared [[H3559]] a sacrifice, [[H2077]] he hath bid [[H6942]] his guests. [[H7121]]

### 8
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in the day [[H3117]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] sacrifice, [[H2077]] that I will punish [[H6485]] the princes, [[H8269]] and the king's [[H4428]] children, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] such as are clothed [[H3847]] with strange [[H5237]] apparel. [[H4403]]

### 9
In the same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] also will I punish [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] those that leap [[H1801]] on [[H5921]] the threshold, [[H4670]] which fill [[H4390]] their masters' [[H113]] houses [[H1004]] with violence [[H2555]] and deceit. [[H4820]]

### 10
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the noise [[H6963]] of a cry [[H6818]] from the fish [[H1709]] gate, [[H8179]] and an howling [[H3215]] from [[H4480]] the second, [[H4932]] and a great [[H1419]] crashing [[H7667]] from the hills. [[H1389]]

### 11
Howl, [[H3213]] ye inhabitants [[H3427]] of Maktesh, [[H4389]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the merchant [[H3667]] people [[H5971]] are cut down; [[H1820]] all [[H3605]] they that bear [[H5187]] silver [[H3701]] are cut off. [[H3772]]

### 12
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] I will search [[H2664]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with candles, [[H5216]] and punish [[H6485]] the men [[H376]] that are settled [[H7087]] on [[H5921]] their lees: [[H8105]] that say [[H559]] in their heart, [[H3824]] The Lord [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] do good, [[H3190]] neither [[H3808]] will he do evil. [[H7489]]

### 13
Therefore their goods [[H2428]] shall become [[H1961]] a booty, [[H4933]] and their houses [[H1004]] a desolation: [[H8077]] they shall also build [[H1129]] houses, [[H1004]] but not [[H3808]] inhabit [[H3427]] and they shall plant [[H5193]] vineyards, [[H3754]] but not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] thereof. [[H3196]]

### 14
The great [[H1419]] day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] near, [[H7138]] near, [[H7138]] and hasteth [[H4118]] greatly, [[H3966]] the voice [[H6963]] of the day [[H3117]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] the mighty man [[H1368]] shall cry [[H6873]] there [[H8033]] bitterly. [[H4751]]

### 15
That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] a day [[H3117]] of wrath, [[H5678]] a day [[H3117]] of trouble [[H6869]] and distress, [[H4691]] a day [[H3117]] of wasteness [[H7722]] and desolation, [[H4875]] a day [[H3117]] of darkness [[H2822]] and gloominess, [[H653]] a day [[H3117]] of clouds [[H6051]] and thick darkness, [[H6205]]

### 16
A day [[H3117]] of the trumpet [[H7782]] and alarm [[H8643]] against [[H5921]] the fenced [[H1219]] cities, [[H5892]] and against [[H5921]] the high [[H1364]] towers. [[H6438]]

### 17
And I will bring distress [[H6887]] upon men, [[H120]] that they shall walk [[H1980]] like blind men, [[H5787]] because [[H3588]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord: [[H3068]] and their blood [[H1818]] shall be poured out [[H8210]] as dust, [[H6083]] and their flesh [[H3894]] as the dung. [[H1561]]

### 18
Neither [[H3808]] their silver [[H3701]] nor [[H1571]] their gold [[H2091]] shall be able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] them in the day [[H3117]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] wrath; [[H5678]] but the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] shall be devoured [[H398]] by the fire [[H784]] of his jealousy: [[H7068]] for [[H3588]] he shall make [[H6213]] even [[H389]] a speedy [[H926]] riddance [[H3617]] of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] them that dwell [[H3427]] in the land.
