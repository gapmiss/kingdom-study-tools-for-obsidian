### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to her that is filthy [[H4754]] and polluted, [[H1351]] to the oppressing [[H3238]] city! [[H5892]]

### 2
She obeyed [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the voice; [[H6963]] she received [[H3947]] not [[H3808]] correction; [[H4148]] she trusted [[H982]] not [[H3808]] in the Lord; [[H3068]] she drew not near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] her God. [[H430]]

### 3
Her princes [[H8269]] within [[H7130]] her roaring [[H7580]] lions; [[H738]] her judges [[H8199]] evening [[H6153]] wolves; [[H2061]] they gnaw not the bones [[H1633]] till the morrow. [[H1242]]

### 4
Her prophets [[H5030]] light [[H6348]] treacherous [[H900]] persons: [[H582]] her priests [[H3548]] have polluted [[H2490]] the sanctuary, [[H6944]] they have done violence [[H2554]] to the law. [[H8451]]

### 5
The just [[H6662]] Lord [[H3068]] in the midst [[H7130]] thereof; he will not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] iniquity: [[H5766]] every [[H1242]] morning [[H1242]] doth he bring [[H5414]] his judgment [[H4941]] to light, [[H216]] he faileth [[H5737]] not; [[H3808]] but the unjust [[H5767]] knoweth [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] shame. [[H1322]]

### 6
I have cut off [[H3772]] the nations: [[H1471]] their towers [[H6438]] are desolate; [[H8074]] I made their streets [[H2351]] waste, [[H2717]] that none [[H1097]] passeth by: [[H5674]] their cities [[H5892]] are destroyed, [[H6658]] so that there is no [[H1097]] man, [[H376]] that there is none [[H369]] inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 7
I said, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] thou wilt fear me, [[H3372]] thou wilt receive [[H3947]] instruction; [[H4148]] so their dwelling [[H4583]] should not [[H3808]] be cut off, [[H3772]] howsoever [[H834]] I punished [[H6485]]  them: [[H5921]] but [[H403]] they rose early, [[H7925]] corrupted [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] their doings. [[H5949]]

### 8
Therefore [[H3651]] wait [[H2442]] ye upon me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] until the day [[H3117]] that I rise up [[H6965]] to the prey: [[H5706]] for [[H3588]] my determination [[H4941]] to gather [[H622]] the nations, [[H1471]] that I may assemble [[H6908]] the kingdoms, [[H4467]] to pour [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] them mine indignation, [[H2195]] all [[H3605]] my fierce [[H2740]] anger: [[H639]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] shall be devoured [[H398]] with the fire [[H784]] of my jealousy. [[H7068]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] then [[H227]] will I turn [[H2015]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] a pure [[H1305]] language, [[H8193]] that they may all [[H3605]] call [[H7121]] upon the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to serve [[H5647]] him with one [[H259]] consent. [[H7926]]

### 10
From beyond [[H5676]] the rivers [[H5104]] of Ethiopia [[H3568]] my suppliants, [[H6282]] the daughter [[H1323]] of my dispersed, [[H6327]] shall bring [[H2986]] mine offering. [[H4503]]

### 11
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shalt thou not [[H3808]] be ashamed [[H954]] for all [[H3605]] thy doings, [[H5949]] wherein [[H834]] thou hast transgressed [[H6586]] against me: for [[H3588]] then [[H227]] I will take away [[H5493]] out of the midst [[H7130]] of thee them that rejoice [[H5947]] in thy pride, [[H1346]] and thou shalt no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] be haughty [[H1361]] because of my holy [[H6944]] mountain. [[H2022]]

### 12
I will also leave [[H7604]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee an afflicted [[H6041]] and poor [[H1800]] people, [[H5971]] and they shall trust [[H2620]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
The remnant [[H7611]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] nor [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] lies; [[H3577]] neither [[H3808]] shall a deceitful [[H8649]] tongue [[H3956]] be found [[H4672]] in their mouth: [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] shall feed [[H7462]] and lie down, [[H7257]] and none [[H369]] shall make afraid. [[H2729]]

### 14
Sing, [[H7442]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion; [[H6726]] shout, [[H7321]] O Israel; [[H3478]] be glad [[H8055]] and rejoice [[H5937]] with all [[H3605]] the heart, [[H3820]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 15
The Lord [[H3068]] hath taken away [[H5493]] thy judgments, [[H4941]] he hath cast out [[H6437]] thine enemy: [[H341]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the Lord, [[H3068]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee: thou shalt not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] evil [[H7451]] any more. [[H5750]]

### 16
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] it shall be said [[H559]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Fear [[H3372]] thou not: [[H408]] Zion, [[H6726]] Let not [[H408]] thine hands [[H3027]] be slack. [[H7503]]

### 17
The Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee mighty; [[H1368]] he will save, [[H3467]] he will rejoice [[H7797]] over [[H5921]] thee with joy; [[H8057]] he will rest [[H2790]] in his love, [[H160]] he will joy [[H1523]] over [[H5921]] thee with singing. [[H7440]]

### 18
I will gather [[H622]] sorrowful [[H3013]] for the solemn assembly, [[H4150]] are [[H1961]] of [[H4480]] thee, the reproach [[H2781]] of [[H5921]] it a burden. [[H4864]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2005]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I will undo [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that afflict [[H6031]] thee: and I will save [[H3467]] her that halteth, [[H6760]] and gather [[H6908]] her that was driven out; [[H5080]] and I will get [[H7760]] them praise [[H8416]] and fame [[H8034]] in every [[H3605]] land [[H776]] where they have been put to shame. [[H1322]]

### 20
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] will I bring [[H935]] you even in the time [[H6256]] that I gather [[H6908]] you: for [[H3588]] I will make [[H5414]] you a name [[H8034]] and a praise [[H8416]] among all [[H3605]] people [[H5971]] of the earth, [[H776]] when I turn back [[H7725]] your captivity [[H7622]] before your eyes, [[H5869]] saith [[H559]] the Lord.
