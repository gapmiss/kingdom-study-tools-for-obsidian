### 1
And Elisha [[H477]] the prophet [[H5030]] called [[H7121]] one [[H259]] of the children [[H1121]] of the prophets, [[H5030]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Gird up [[H2296]] thy loins, [[H4975]] and take [[H3947]] this [[H2088]] box [[H6378]] of oil [[H8081]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] and go [[H1980]] to Ramoth-gilead: [[H7433]]

### 2
And when thou comest [[H935]] thither, [[H8033]] look out [[H7200]] there [[H8033]] Jehu [[H3058]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the son [[H1121]] of Nimshi, [[H5250]] and go in, [[H935]] and make him arise up [[H6965]] from among [[H8432]] his brethren, [[H251]] and carry [[H935]] him to an inner [[H2315]] chamber; [[H2315]]

### 3
Then take [[H3947]] the box [[H6378]] of oil, [[H8081]] and pour [[H3332]] on [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I have anointed [[H4886]] thee king [[H4428]] over [[H413]] Israel. [[H3478]] Then open [[H6605]] the door, [[H1817]] and flee, [[H5127]] and tarry [[H2442]] not. [[H3808]]

### 4
So the young man, [[H5288]] the young man [[H5288]] the prophet, [[H5030]] went [[H1980]] to Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]]

### 5
And when he came, [[H935]] behold, [[H2009]] the captains [[H8269]] of the host [[H2428]] sitting; [[H3427]] and he said, [[H559]] I have an errand [[H1697]] to [[H413]] thee, O captain. [[H8269]] And Jehu [[H3058]] said, [[H559]] Unto [[H413]] which [[H4310]] of all [[H3605]] us? And he said, [[H559]] To [[H413]] thee, O captain. [[H8269]]

### 6
And he arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H935]] into the house; [[H1004]] and he poured [[H3332]] the oil [[H8081]] on [[H413]] his head, [[H7218]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I have anointed [[H4886]] thee king [[H4428]] over [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] over [[H413]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And thou shalt smite [[H5221]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] thy master, [[H113]] that I may avenge [[H5358]] the blood [[H1818]] of my servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] and the blood [[H1818]] of all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] at the hand [[H3027]] of Jezebel. [[H348]]

### 8
For the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] shall perish: [[H6]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] from Ahab [[H256]] him that pisseth [[H8366]] against the wall, [[H7023]] and him that is shut up [[H6113]] and left [[H5800]] in Israel: [[H3478]]

### 9
And I will make [[H5414]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] like the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] and like the house [[H1004]] of Baasha [[H1201]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahijah: [[H281]]

### 10
And the dogs [[H3611]] shall eat [[H398]] Jezebel [[H348]] in the portion [[H2506]] of Jezreel, [[H3157]] and none [[H369]] to bury [[H6912]] And he opened [[H6605]] the door, [[H1817]] and fled. [[H5127]]

### 11
Then Jehu [[H3058]] came forth [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the servants [[H5650]] of his lord: [[H113]] and said [[H559]] unto him, all well? [[H7965]] wherefore [[H4069]] came [[H935]] this [[H2088]] mad [[H7696]] to [[H413]] thee? And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Ye [[H859]] know [[H3045]] the man, [[H376]]  and [[H853]] his communication. [[H7879]]

### 12
And they said, [[H559]] false; [[H8267]] tell [[H5046]] us now. [[H4994]] And he said, [[H559]] Thus [[H2063]] and thus [[H2063]] spake [[H559]] he to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I have anointed [[H4886]] thee king [[H4428]] over [[H413]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 13
Then they hasted, [[H4116]] and took [[H3947]] every man [[H376]] his garment, [[H899]] and put [[H7760]] under [[H8478]] him on [[H413]] the top [[H1634]] of the stairs, [[H4609]] and blew [[H8628]] with trumpets, [[H7782]] saying, [[H559]] Jehu [[H3058]] is king. [[H4427]]

### 14
So Jehu [[H3058]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the son [[H1121]] of Nimshi [[H5250]] conspired [[H7194]] against [[H413]] Joram. [[H3141]] (Now Joram [[H3141]] had [[H1961]] kept [[H8104]] Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]] he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H6440]] of Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria. [[H758]]

### 15
But king [[H4428]] Joram [[H3088]] was returned [[H7725]] to be healed [[H7495]] in Jezreel [[H3157]] of [[H4480]] the wounds [[H4347]] which [[H834]] the Syrians [[H761]] had given [[H5221]] him, when he fought [[H3898]] with [[H854]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria.) [[H758]] And Jehu [[H3058]] said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] it be [[H3426]] your minds, [[H5315]] let none [[H408]] go forth [[H3318]] escape [[H6412]] out of [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] to go [[H1980]] to tell [[H5046]] in Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 16
So Jehu [[H3058]] rode in a chariot, [[H7392]] and went [[H1980]] to Jezreel; [[H3157]] for [[H3588]] Joram [[H3141]] lay [[H7901]] there. [[H8033]] And Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] was come down [[H3381]] to see [[H7200]] Joram. [[H3141]]

### 17
And there stood [[H5975]] a watchman [[H6822]] on [[H5921]] the tower [[H4026]] in Jezreel, [[H3157]] and he spied [[H7200]] the company [[H8229]] of Jehu [[H3058]] as he came, [[H935]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] a company. [[H8229]] And Joram [[H3088]] said, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] an horseman, [[H7395]] and send [[H7971]] to meet [[H7125]] them, and let him say, [[H559]] peace? [[H7965]]

### 18
So there went [[H1980]] one on horseback [[H7392]] to meet [[H7125]] him, and said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] peace? [[H7965]] And Jehu [[H3058]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] hast thou to do with peace? [[H7965]] turn [[H5437]] thee behind [[H310]] me. And the watchman [[H6822]] told, [[H5046]] saying, [[H559]] The messenger [[H4397]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] them, [[H1992]] but he cometh not again. [[H7725]]

### 19
Then he sent out [[H7971]] a second [[H8145]] on horseback, [[H7392]] which came [[H935]] to [[H413]] them, and said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] peace? [[H7965]] And Jehu [[H3058]] answered, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] hast thou to do with peace? [[H7965]] turn [[H5437]] thee behind [[H310]] me. [[H413]]

### 20
And the watchman [[H6822]] told, [[H5046]] saying, [[H559]] He came [[H935]] even [[H5704]] unto [[H413]] them, and cometh not again: [[H7725]] and the driving [[H4491]] like the driving [[H4491]] of Jehu [[H3058]] the son [[H1121]] of Nimshi; [[H5250]] for [[H3588]] he driveth [[H5090]] furiously. [[H7697]]

### 21
And Joram [[H3088]] said, [[H559]] Make ready. [[H631]] And his chariot [[H7393]] was made ready. [[H631]] And Joram [[H3088]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went out, [[H3318]] each [[H376]] in his chariot, [[H7393]] and they went out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] Jehu, [[H3058]] and met [[H4672]] him in the portion [[H2513]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite. [[H3158]]

### 22
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Joram [[H3088]] saw [[H7200]] Jehu, [[H3058]] that he said, [[H559]] peace, [[H7965]] Jehu? [[H3058]] And he answered, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] peace, [[H7965]] so long as [[H5704]] the whoredoms [[H2183]] of thy mother [[H517]] Jezebel [[H348]] and her witchcrafts [[H3785]] many? [[H7227]]

### 23
And Joram [[H3088]] turned [[H2015]] his hands, [[H3027]] and fled, [[H5127]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahaziah, [[H274]] treachery, [[H4820]] O Ahaziah. [[H274]]

### 24
And Jehu [[H3058]] drew a bow [[H7198]] with his full [[H4390]] strength, [[H3027]] and smote [[H5221]] Jehoram [[H3088]] between [[H996]] his arms, [[H2220]] and the arrow [[H2678]] went out [[H3318]] at his heart, [[H3820]] and he sunk down [[H3766]] in his chariot. [[H7393]]

### 25
Then said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Bidkar [[H920]] his captain, [[H7991]] Take up, [[H5375]] cast [[H7993]] him in the portion [[H2513]] of the field [[H7704]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite: [[H3158]] for [[H3588]] remember [[H2142]] how that, when I [[H589]] and thou [[H859]] rode [[H7392]] together [[H6776]] after [[H310]] Ahab [[H256]] his father, [[H1]] the Lord [[H3068]] laid [[H5375]] this [[H2088]] burden [[H4853]] upon [[H5921]] him; [[H5921]]

### 26
Surely [[H518]] I have seen [[H7200]] yesterday [[H570]] the blood [[H1818]] of Naboth, [[H5022]] and the blood [[H1818]] of his sons, [[H1121]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and I will requite [[H7999]] thee in this [[H2063]] plat, [[H2513]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]] Now [[H6258]] therefore take [[H5375]] cast [[H7993]] him into the plat [[H2513]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
But when Ahaziah [[H274]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] saw [[H7200]] he fled [[H5127]] by the way [[H1870]] of the garden [[H1588]] house. [[H1004]] And Jehu [[H3058]] followed [[H7291]] after [[H310]] him, and said, [[H559]] Smite [[H5221]] him also [[H1571]] in [[H413]] the chariot. [[H4818]] at the going up [[H4608]] to Gur, [[H1483]] which [[H834]] by [[H853]] Ibleam. [[H2991]] And he fled [[H5127]] to Megiddo, [[H4023]] and died [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]]

### 28
And his servants [[H5650]] carried [[H7392]]  him in a chariot [[H853]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and buried [[H6912]] him in his sepulchre [[H6900]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 29
And in the eleventh [[H6240]] year [[H8141]] of Joram [[H3141]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] began Ahaziah [[H274]] to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 30
And when Jehu [[H3058]] was come [[H935]] to Jezreel, [[H3157]] Jezebel [[H348]] heard [[H8085]] and she painted [[H7760]] her face, [[H5869]] and tired [[H3190]] her head, [[H7218]] and looked out [[H8259]] at [[H1157]] a window. [[H2474]]

### 31
And as Jehu [[H3058]] entered in [[H935]] at the gate, [[H8179]] she said, [[H559]] Zimri [[H2174]] peace, [[H7965]] who slew [[H2026]] his master? [[H113]]

### 32
And he lifted up [[H5375]] his face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] the window, [[H2474]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] on my side? [[H854]] who? [[H4310]] And there looked out [[H8259]] to [[H413]] him two [[H8147]] three [[H7969]] eunuchs. [[H5631]]

### 33
And he said, [[H559]] Throw her down. [[H8058]] So they threw her down: [[H8058]] and of her blood [[H1818]] was sprinkled [[H5137]] on [[H413]] the wall, [[H7023]] and on [[H413]] the horses: [[H5483]] and he trode her under foot. [[H7429]]

### 34
And when he was come in, [[H935]] he did eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and said, [[H559]] Go, see [[H6485]] now [[H4994]] this [[H2063]] cursed [[H779]] and bury [[H6912]] her: for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] a king's [[H4428]] daughter. [[H1323]]

### 35
And they went [[H1980]] to bury [[H6912]] her: but they found [[H4672]] no more [[H3808]] of her than [[H518]] the skull, [[H1538]] and the feet, [[H7272]] and the palms [[H3709]] of hands. [[H3027]]

### 36
Wherefore they came again, [[H7725]] and told [[H5046]] him. And he said, [[H559]] This [[H1931]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] his servant [[H5650]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite, [[H8664]] saying, [[H559]] In the portion [[H2506]] of Jezreel [[H3157]] shall dogs [[H3611]] eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of Jezebel: [[H348]]

### 37
And the carcase [[H5038]] of Jezebel [[H348]] shall be [[H1961]] as dung [[H1828]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the field [[H7704]] in the portion [[H2506]] of Jezreel; [[H3157]] that [[H834]] they shall not [[H3808]] say, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] Jezebel. [[H348]]
