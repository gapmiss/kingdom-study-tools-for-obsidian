In his days [[H3117]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] came up, [[H5927]] and Jehoiakim [[H3079]] became [[H1961]] his servant [[H5650]] three [[H7969]] years: [[H8141]] then he turned [[H7725]] and rebelled [[H4775]] against him. [[H4775]]

And the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]]  against him [[H853]] bands [[H1416]] of the Chaldees, [[H3778]] and bands [[H1416]] of the Syrians, [[H758]] and bands [[H1416]] of the Moabites, [[H4124]] and bands [[H1416]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and sent [[H7971]] them against Judah [[H3063]] to destroy [[H6]] it, according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] his servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]]

### 3
Surely [[H389]] at [[H5921]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon Judah, [[H3063]] to remove [[H5493]] out of [[H5921]] his sight, [[H6440]] for the sins [[H2403]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did; [[H6213]]

### 4
And also [[H1571]] for the innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] that [[H834]] he shed: [[H8210]] for he filled [[H4390]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with innocent [[H5355]] blood; [[H1818]] which the Lord [[H3068]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] pardon. [[H5545]]
