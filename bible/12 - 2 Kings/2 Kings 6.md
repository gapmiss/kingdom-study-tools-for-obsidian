### 1
And the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] we [[H587]] dwell [[H3427]] with [[H6440]] thee is too strait [[H6862]] for [[H4480]] us. [[H4480]]

### 2
Let us go, [[H1980]] we pray thee, [[H4994]] unto [[H5704]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and take [[H3947]] thence [[H8033]] every man [[H376]] a [[H259]] beam, [[H6982]] and let us make [[H6213]] us a place [[H4725]] there, [[H8033]] where [[H8033]] we may dwell. [[H3427]] And he answered, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] ye. [[H1980]]

### 3
And one [[H259]] said, [[H559]] Be content, [[H2974]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] thy servants. [[H5650]] And he answered, [[H559]] I [[H589]] will go. [[H1980]]

### 4
So he went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] them. And when they came [[H935]] to Jordan, [[H3383]] they cut down [[H1504]] wood. [[H6086]]

### 5
But as one [[H259]] was [[H1961]] felling [[H5307]] a beam, [[H6982]] the axe head [[H1270]] fell [[H5307]] into [[H413]] the water: [[H4325]] and he cried, [[H6817]] and said, [[H559]] Alas, [[H162]] master! [[H113]] for it [[H1931]] was borrowed. [[H7592]]

### 6
And the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] Where [[H575]] fell [[H5307]] it? And he shewed [[H7200]]  him [[H853]] the place. [[H4725]] And he cut down [[H7094]] a stick, [[H6086]] and cast [[H7993]] in thither; [[H8033]] and the iron [[H1270]] did swim. [[H6687]]

### 7
Therefore said [[H559]] he, Take up [[H7311]] to thee. And he put out [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] and took [[H3947]] it. [[H3947]]

### 8
Then the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] warred [[H3898]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and took counsel [[H3289]] with [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] saying, [[H559]] In [[H413]] such [[H6423]] and such [[H492]] a place [[H4725]] my camp. [[H8466]]

### 9
And the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Beware [[H8104]] that thou pass [[H5674]] not such [[H2088]] a place; [[H4725]] for [[H3588]] thither [[H8033]] the Syrians [[H758]] are come down. [[H5185]]

### 10
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] told [[H559]] him and warned [[H2094]] him of, and saved himself [[H8104]] there, [[H8033]] not [[H3808]] once [[H259]] nor [[H3808]] twice. [[H8147]]

### 11
Therefore the heart [[H3820]] of the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] was sore troubled [[H5590]] for [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] thing; [[H1697]] and he called [[H7121]] his servants, [[H5650]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Will ye not [[H3808]] shew [[H5046]] me which [[H4310]] of us [[H7945]] for [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 12
And one [[H259]] of his servants [[H5650]] said, [[H559]] None, [[H3808]] my lord, [[H113]] O king: [[H4428]] but [[H3588]] Elisha, [[H477]] the prophet [[H5030]] that [[H834]] in Israel, [[H3478]] telleth [[H5046]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] thou speakest [[H1696]] in thy bedchamber. [[H2315]]

### 13
And he said, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and spy [[H7200]] where [[H351]] he [[H1931]] that I may send [[H7971]] and fetch [[H3947]] him. And it was told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] in Dothan. [[H1886]]

### 14
Therefore sent [[H7971]] he thither [[H8033]] horses, [[H5483]] and chariots, [[H7393]] and a great [[H3515]] host: [[H2428]] and they came [[H935]] by night, [[H3915]] and compassed [[H5362]] the city [[H5892]] about. [[H5892]]

### 15
And when the servant [[H8334]] of the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] was risen [[H6965]] early, [[H7925]] and gone forth, [[H3318]] behold, [[H2009]] an host [[H2428]] compassed [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] both with horses [[H5483]] and chariots. [[H7393]] And his servant [[H5288]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Alas, [[H162]] my master! [[H113]] how [[H349]] shall we do? [[H6213]]

### 16
And he answered, [[H559]] Fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] they that [[H834]] with [[H854]] us more [[H7227]] than they that [[H834]] with [[H854]] them. [[H854]]

### 17
And Elisha [[H477]] prayed, [[H6419]] and said, [[H559]] Lord, [[H3068]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] open [[H6491]] his eyes, [[H5869]] that he may see. [[H7200]] And the Lord [[H3068]] opened [[H6491]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the young man; [[H5288]] and he saw: [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the mountain [[H2022]] full [[H4390]] of horses [[H5483]] and chariots [[H7393]] of fire [[H784]] round about [[H5439]] Elisha. [[H477]]

### 18
And when they came down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] him, Elisha [[H477]] prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] Smite [[H5221]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H1471]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] with blindness. [[H5575]] And he smote [[H5221]] them with blindness [[H5575]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Elisha. [[H477]]

### 19
And Elisha [[H477]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, This [[H2088]] not [[H3808]] the way, [[H1870]] neither [[H3808]] this [[H2090]] the city: [[H5892]] follow [[H1980]] me, and I will bring [[H1980]] you to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] ye seek. [[H1245]] But he led [[H1980]] them to Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 20
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they were come [[H935]] into Samaria, [[H8111]] that Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] Lord, [[H3068]] open [[H6491]] the eyes [[H5869]] of these [[H428]] that they may see. [[H7200]] And the Lord [[H3068]] opened [[H6491]] their eyes, [[H5869]] and they saw; [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 21
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] when he saw [[H7200]] them, My father, [[H1]] shall I smite [[H5221]] shall I smite [[H5221]]

### 22
And he answered, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] smite [[H5221]] wouldest thou [[H859]] smite [[H5221]] those whom [[H834]] thou hast taken captive [[H7617]] with thy sword [[H2719]] and with thy bow? [[H7198]] set [[H7760]] bread [[H3899]] and water [[H4325]] before [[H6440]] them, that they may eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] their master. [[H113]]

### 23
And he prepared [[H3739]] great [[H1419]] provision [[H3740]] for them: and when they had eaten [[H398]] and drunk, [[H8354]] he sent them away, [[H7971]] and they went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] their master. [[H113]] So the bands [[H1416]] of Syria [[H758]] came [[H935]] no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] into the land [[H776]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after this, [[H310]] that Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] gathered [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] his host, [[H4264]] and went up, [[H5927]] and besieged [[H6696]] Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 25
And there was [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] famine [[H7458]] in Samaria: [[H8111]] and, behold, [[H2009]] they besieged [[H6696]] it, until [[H5704]] an ass's [[H2543]] head [[H7218]] was [[H1961]] for fourscore [[H8084]] of silver, [[H3701]] and the fourth part [[H7255]] of a cab [[H6894]] of dove's dung [[H2755]] for five [[H2568]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 26
And as the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] was [[H1961]] passing by [[H5674]] upon [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] there cried [[H6817]] a woman [[H802]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Help, [[H3467]] my lord, [[H113]] O king. [[H4428]]

### 27
And he said, [[H559]] If the Lord [[H3068]] do not [[H408]] help [[H3467]] thee, whence [[H370]] shall I help [[H3467]] thee? out of [[H4480]] the barnfloor, [[H1637]] or [[H176]] out of [[H4480]] the winepress? [[H3342]]

### 28
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto her, What [[H4100]] aileth thee? And she answered, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] woman [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Give [[H5414]] thy son, [[H1121]] that we may eat [[H398]] him to day, [[H3117]] and we will eat [[H398]] my son [[H1121]] to morrow. [[H4279]]

### 29
So we boiled [[H1310]] my son, [[H1121]] and did eat [[H398]] him: and I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her on the next [[H312]] day, [[H3117]] Give [[H5414]] thy son, [[H1121]] that we may eat [[H398]] him: and she hath hid [[H2244]] her son. [[H1121]]

### 30
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the king [[H4428]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the woman, [[H802]] that he rent [[H7167]] his clothes; [[H899]] and he [[H1931]] passed by [[H5674]] upon [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] and the people [[H5971]] looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] sackcloth [[H8242]] within [[H1004]] upon [[H5921]] his flesh. [[H1320]]

### 31
Then he said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] do [[H6213]] so [[H3541]] and more [[H3254]] also [[H3541]] to me, if [[H518]] the head [[H7218]] of Elisha [[H477]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphat [[H8202]] shall stand [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] him this day. [[H3117]]

### 32
But Elisha [[H477]] sat [[H3427]] in his house, [[H1004]] and the elders [[H2205]] sat [[H3427]] with [[H854]] him; and sent [[H7971]] a man [[H376]] from before [[H6440]] him: but ere [[H2962]] the messenger [[H4397]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] him, he [[H1931]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the elders, [[H2205]] See [[H7200]] ye how [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] son [[H1121]] of a murderer [[H7523]] hath sent [[H7971]] to take away [[H5493]] mine head? [[H7218]] look, [[H7200]] when the messenger [[H4397]] cometh, [[H935]] shut [[H5462]] the door, [[H1817]] and hold him fast [[H3905]] at the door: [[H1817]] not [[H3808]] the sound [[H6963]] of his master's [[H113]] feet [[H7272]] behind [[H310]] him? [[H310]]

### 33
And while he yet [[H5750]] talked [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] them, behold, [[H2009]] the messenger [[H4397]] came down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] him: and he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] of [[H853]] the Lord; [[H3068]] what [[H4100]] should I wait [[H3176]] for the Lord [[H3068]] any longer? [[H5750]]
