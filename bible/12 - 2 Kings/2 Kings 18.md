Now it came to pass [[H1961]] in the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Hoshea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Elah [[H425]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahaz [[H271]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began to reign. [[H4427]]

### 2
Twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] was [[H1961]] he when he began to reign; [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] twenty [[H6242]] and nine [[H8672]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] His mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] also Abi, [[H21]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zachariah. [[H2148]]

### 3
And he did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] his father [[H1]] did. [[H6213]]

### 4
He [[H1931]] removed [[H5493]] the high places, [[H1116]] and brake [[H7665]] the images, [[H4676]] and cut down [[H3772]] the groves, [[H842]] and brake in pieces [[H3807]] the brasen [[H5178]] serpent [[H5175]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had made: [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] unto [[H5704]] those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H1961]] burn incense [[H6999]] to it: and he called [[H7121]] it Nehushtan. [[H5180]]

### 5
He trusted [[H982]] in the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] so that after [[H310]] him was [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] like him [[H3644]] among all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] nor that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 6
For he clave [[H1692]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from following [[H310]] him, but kept [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] him; he prospered [[H7919]] whithersoever [[H3605]] he went forth: [[H3318]] and he rebelled [[H4775]] against the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and served [[H5647]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 8
He [[H1931]] smote [[H5221]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] unto [[H5704]] Gaza, [[H5804]] and the borders [[H1366]] thereof, from the tower [[H4026]] of the watchmen [[H5341]] to [[H5704]] the fenced [[H4013]] city. [[H5892]]

### 9
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] which [[H1931]] the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] of Hoshea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Elah [[H425]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Shalmaneser [[H8022]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] came up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Samaria, [[H8111]] and besieged [[H6696]] it. [[H5921]]

### 10
And at the end [[H7097]] of three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] they took [[H3920]] it: in the sixth [[H8337]] year [[H8141]] of Hezekiah, [[H2396]] that [[H1931]] the ninth [[H8672]] year [[H8141]] of Hoshea [[H1954]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Samaria [[H8111]] was taken. [[H3920]]

### 11
And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] did carry away [[H1540]] Israel [[H3478]] unto Assyria, [[H804]] and put [[H5148]] them in Halah [[H2477]] and in Habor [[H2249]] the river [[H5104]] of Gozan, [[H1470]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of the Medes: [[H4074]]

### 12
Because [[H5921]] they obeyed [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] but transgressed [[H5674]] his covenant, [[H1285]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] commanded, [[H6680]] and would not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] nor [[H3808]] do [[H6213]]

### 13
Now in the fourteenth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] did Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the fenced [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and took [[H8610]] them. [[H8610]]

### 14
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] to Lachish, [[H3923]] saying, [[H559]] I have offended; [[H2398]] return [[H7725]] from [[H5921]]  me: [[H853]] that which [[H834]] thou puttest [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] me will I bear. [[H5375]] And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] appointed [[H7760]] unto [[H5921]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] and thirty [[H7970]] talents [[H3603]] of gold. [[H2091]]

### 15
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] gave [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the silver [[H3701]] that was found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and in the treasures [[H214]] of the king's [[H4428]] house. [[H1004]]

### 16
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] did Hezekiah [[H2396]] cut off [[H7112]] the doors [[H1817]] of the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the pillars [[H547]] which [[H834]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had overlaid, [[H6823]] and gave [[H5414]] it to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 17
And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] sent [[H7971]] Tartan [[H8661]] and Rabsaris [[H7249]] and Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] from [[H4480]] Lachish [[H3923]] to [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] with a great [[H3515]] host [[H2426]] against Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And they went up [[H5927]] and came [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And when they were come up, [[H5927]] they came [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] by the conduit [[H8585]] of the upper [[H5945]] pool, [[H1295]] which [[H834]] in the highway [[H4546]] of the fuller's [[H3526]] field. [[H7704]]

### 18
And when they had called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] there came out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] them Eliakim [[H471]] the son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] which [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the household, [[H1004]] and Shebna [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Joah [[H3098]] the son [[H1121]] of Asaph [[H623]] the recorder. [[H2142]]

### 19
And Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Speak [[H559]] ye now [[H4994]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the great [[H1419]] king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] What [[H4100]] confidence [[H986]] this [[H2088]] wherein [[H834]] thou trustest? [[H982]]

### 20
Thou sayest, [[H559]] (but [[H389]] vain [[H8193]] words,) [[H1697]] counsel [[H6098]] and strength [[H1369]] for the war. [[H4421]] Now [[H6258]] on [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] dost thou trust, [[H982]] that [[H3588]] thou rebellest [[H4775]] against me? [[H4775]]

### 21
Now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] thou trustest [[H982]] upon [[H5921]] the staff [[H4938]] of this [[H2088]] bruised [[H7533]] reed, [[H7070]] upon [[H5921]] Egypt, [[H4714]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] if a man [[H376]] lean, [[H5564]] it will go [[H935]] into his hand, [[H3709]] and pierce [[H5344]] it: so [[H3651]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto all [[H3605]] that trust [[H982]] on [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 22
But if [[H3588]] ye say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, We trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God: [[H430]] not [[H3808]] that he, [[H1931]] whose [[H834]] high places [[H1116]] and whose altars [[H4196]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] hath taken away, [[H5493]] and hath said [[H559]] to Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Ye shall worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] altar [[H4196]] in Jerusalem? [[H3389]]

### 23
Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] give pledges [[H6148]] to [[H854]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and I will deliver [[H5414]] thee two thousand [[H505]] horses, [[H5483]] if [[H518]] thou be able [[H3201]] on thy part to set [[H5414]] riders [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 24
How [[H349]] then wilt thou turn away [[H7725]] the face [[H6440]] of one [[H259]] captain [[H6346]] of the least [[H6996]] of my master's [[H113]] servants, [[H5650]] and put thy trust [[H982]] on [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] for chariots [[H7393]] and for horsemen? [[H6571]]

### 25
Am I now [[H6258]] come up [[H5927]] without [[H1107]] the Lord [[H3068]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] to destroy [[H7843]] it? The Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] me, Go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and destroy [[H7843]] it. [[H7843]]

### 26
Then said [[H559]] Eliakim [[H471]] the son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] and Shebna, [[H7644]] and Joah, [[H3098]] unto [[H413]] Rab-shakeh, [[H7262]] Speak, [[H1696]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] to [[H413]] thy servants [[H5650]] in the Syrian language; [[H762]] for [[H3588]] we [[H587]] understand [[H8085]] and talk [[H1696]] not [[H408]] with [[H5973]] us in the Jews' language [[H3066]] in the ears [[H241]] of the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the wall. [[H2346]]

### 27
But Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Hath my master [[H113]] sent [[H7971]] me to [[H5921]] thy master, [[H113]] and to [[H413]] thee, to speak [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words? [[H1697]] not [[H3808]] to [[H5921]] the men [[H376]] which sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] that they may eat [[H398]] their own dung, [[H2755]] and drink [[H8354]] their own piss [[H7890]] with you? [[H5973]]

### 28
Then Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] stood [[H5975]] and cried [[H7121]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] in the Jews' language, [[H3066]] and spake, [[H1696]] saying, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the great [[H1419]] king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria: [[H804]]

### 29
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] Let not [[H408]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] deceive [[H5377]] you: for [[H3588]] he shall not [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] you out of his hand: [[H3027]]

### 30
Neither [[H408]] let Hezekiah [[H2396]] make you trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] will surely [[H5337]] deliver [[H5337]]  us, and [[H853]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] shall not [[H3808]] be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 31
Hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah: [[H2396]] for [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] Make [[H6213]] with [[H854]] me by a present, [[H1293]] and come out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] me, and eat [[H398]] ye every man [[H376]] of his own vine, [[H1612]] and every one [[H376]] of his fig tree, [[H8384]] and drink [[H8354]] ye every one [[H376]] the waters [[H4325]] of his cistern: [[H953]]

### 32
Until [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] and take you away [[H3947]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] like your own land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] of corn [[H1715]] and wine, [[H8492]] a land [[H776]] of bread [[H3899]] and vineyards, [[H3754]] a land [[H776]] of oil [[H3323]] olive [[H2132]] and of honey, [[H1706]] that ye may live, [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die: [[H4191]] and hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] unto [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] when [[H3588]] he persuadeth [[H5496]] you, saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] will deliver [[H5337]] us. [[H5337]]

### 33
Hath any [[H376]] of the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H1471]] delivered [[H5337]] at all [[H5337]] his land [[H776]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria? [[H804]]

### 34
Where [[H346]] the gods [[H430]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] and of Arpad? [[H774]] where [[H346]] the gods [[H430]] of Sepharvaim, [[H5617]] Hena, [[H2012]] and Ivah? [[H5755]] have they delivered [[H5337]] Samaria [[H8111]] out of mine hand? [[H3027]]

### 35
Who [[H4310]] they among all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of the countries, [[H776]] that [[H834]] have delivered [[H5337]] their country [[H776]] out of mine hand, [[H3027]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] should deliver [[H5337]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] out of mine hand? [[H3027]]

### 36
But the people [[H5971]] held their peace, [[H2790]] and answered [[H6030]] him not [[H3808]] a word: [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] the king's [[H4428]] commandment [[H4687]] was, saying, [[H559]] Answer [[H6030]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 37
Then came [[H935]] Eliakim [[H471]] the son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] which [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the household, [[H1004]] and Shebna [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Joah [[H3098]] the son [[H1121]] of Asaph [[H623]] the recorder, [[H2142]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] with clothes [[H899]] rent, [[H7167]] and told [[H5046]] him the words [[H1697]] of Rab-shakeh. [[H7262]]
