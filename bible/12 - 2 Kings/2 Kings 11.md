And he commanded [[H6680]] them, saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] ye shall do; [[H6213]] A third part [[H7992]] of [[H4480]] you that enter in [[H935]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] shall even be keepers [[H8104]] of the watch [[H4931]] of the king's [[H4428]] house; [[H1004]]

And a third part [[H7992]] at the gate [[H8179]] of Sur; [[H5495]] and a third part [[H7992]] at the gate [[H8179]] behind [[H310]] the guard: [[H7323]] so shall ye keep [[H8104]] the watch [[H4931]] of the house, [[H1004]] that it be not broken down. [[H4535]]

And ye shall compass [[H5362]] the king [[H4428]] round about, [[H5439]] every man [[H376]] with his weapons [[H3627]] in his hand: [[H3027]] and he that cometh [[H935]] within [[H413]] the ranges, [[H7713]] let him be slain: [[H4191]] and be [[H1961]] ye with [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] as he goeth out [[H3318]] and as he cometh in. [[H935]]

### 9
And the captains [[H8269]] over the hundreds [[H3967]] did [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] commanded: [[H6680]] and they took [[H3947]] every man [[H376]] his men [[H376]] that were to come in [[H935]] on the sabbath, [[H7676]] with [[H5973]] them that should go out [[H3318]] on the sabbath, [[H7676]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest. [[H3548]]

### 10
And to the captains [[H8269]] over hundreds [[H3967]] did the priest [[H3548]] give [[H5414]] king [[H4428]] David's [[H1732]] spears [[H2595]] and shields, [[H7982]] that [[H834]] in the temple [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

[[H1004]]

### 12
And he brought forth [[H3318]] the king's [[H4428]] son, [[H1121]] and put [[H5414]] the crown [[H5145]] upon [[H5921]] him, and the testimony; [[H5715]] and they made him king, [[H4427]] and anointed [[H4886]] him; and they clapped [[H5221]] their hands, [[H3709]] and said, [[H559]] God save [[H2421]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 13
And when Athaliah [[H6271]] heard [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] of the guard [[H7323]] of the people, [[H5971]] she came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] into the temple [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
And when she looked, [[H7200]] behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] a pillar, [[H5982]] as the manner [[H4941]] and the princes [[H8269]] and the trumpeters [[H2689]] by [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] rejoiced, [[H8056]] and blew [[H8628]] with trumpets: [[H2689]] and Athaliah [[H6271]] rent [[H7167]] her clothes, [[H899]] and cried, [[H7121]] Treason, [[H7195]] Treason. [[H7195]]

### 15
But Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] commanded [[H6680]] the captains [[H8269]] of the hundreds, [[H3967]] the officers [[H6485]] of the host, [[H2428]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Have her forth [[H3318]] without [[H1004]] the ranges: [[H7713]] and him that followeth [[H935]] her kill [[H4191]] with the sword. [[H2719]] For [[H3588]] the priest [[H3548]] had said, [[H559]] Let her not [[H408]] be slain [[H4191]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

And they laid [[H7760]] hands [[H3027]] on her; and she went [[H935]] by the way [[H1870]] by the which the horses [[H5483]] came [[H3996]] into the king's [[H4428]] house: [[H1004]] and there [[H8033]] was she slain. [[H4191]]

And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] went [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and brake it down; [[H5422]] his altars [[H4196]] and his images [[H6754]] brake they in pieces [[H7665]] thoroughly, [[H3190]] and slew [[H2026]] Mattan [[H4977]] the priest [[H3548]] of Baal [[H1168]] before [[H6440]] the altars. [[H4196]] And the priest [[H3548]] appointed [[H7760]] officers [[H6486]] over [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
