In the seventeenth [[H6240]] year [[H8141]] of Pekah [[H6492]] the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] Ahaz [[H271]] the son [[H1121]] of Jotham [[H3147]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began to reign. [[H4427]]

### 2
Twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] Ahaz [[H271]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and reigned [[H4427]] sixteen [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and did [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] like David [[H1732]] his father. [[H1]]

### 3
But he walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] yea, [[H1571]]  and made [[H853]] his son [[H1121]] to pass through [[H5674]] the fire, [[H784]] according to the abominations [[H8441]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] cast out [[H3423]] from before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
And he sacrificed [[H2076]] and burnt incense [[H6999]] in the high places, [[H1116]] and on [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree. [[H6086]]

### 5
Then [[H227]] Rezin [[H7526]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] and Pekah [[H6492]] son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] came up [[H5927]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] to war: [[H4421]] and they besieged [[H6696]] Ahaz, [[H271]] but could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] overcome [[H3898]]

### 6
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Rezin [[H7526]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] recovered [[H7725]] Elath [[H359]] to Syria, [[H758]] and drave [[H5394]] the Jews [[H3064]] from Elath: [[H359]] and the Syrians [[H726]] came [[H935]] to Elath, [[H359]] and dwelt [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 7
So Ahaz [[H271]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Tiglath-pileser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] saying, [[H559]] I [[H589]] thy servant [[H5650]] and thy son: [[H1121]] come up, [[H5927]] and save [[H3467]] me out of the hand [[H3709]] of the king [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] and out of the hand [[H3709]] of the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 8
And Ahaz [[H271]] took [[H3947]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] that was found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and in the treasures [[H214]] of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and sent [[H7971]] a present [[H7810]] to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 9
And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] him: for the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] went up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] Damascus, [[H1834]] and took [[H8610]] it, and carried it captive [[H1540]] to Kir, [[H7024]] and slew [[H4191]] Rezin. [[H7526]]

### 10
And king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] went [[H1980]] to Damascus [[H1834]] to meet [[H7125]] Tiglath-pileser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and saw [[H7200]] an altar [[H4196]] that [[H834]] at Damascus: [[H1834]] and king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Urijah [[H223]] the priest [[H3548]] the fashion [[H1823]] of the altar, [[H4196]] and the pattern [[H8403]] of it, according to all [[H3605]] the workmanship [[H4639]] thereof. [[H4639]]

### 11
And Urijah [[H223]] the priest [[H3548]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] had sent [[H7971]] from Damascus: [[H1834]] so [[H3651]] Urijah [[H223]] the priest [[H3548]] made [[H6213]] against [[H5704]] king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] came [[H935]] from Damascus. [[H1834]]

### 12
And when the king [[H4428]] was come [[H935]] from Damascus, [[H1834]] the king [[H4428]] saw [[H7200]] the altar: [[H4196]] and the king [[H4428]] approached [[H7126]] to [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and offered [[H5927]] thereon. [[H5921]]

### 13
And he burnt [[H6999]] his burnt offering [[H5930]] and his meat offering, [[H4503]] and poured [[H5258]] his drink offering, [[H5262]] and sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] of his [[H834]] peace offerings, [[H8002]] upon [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]]

### 14
And he brought [[H7126]] also the brasen [[H5178]] altar, [[H4196]] which [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] from [[H853]] the forefront [[H6440]] of the house, [[H1004]] from between [[H996]] the altar [[H4196]] and the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and put [[H5414]] it on [[H5921]] the north [[H6828]] side [[H3409]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

### 15
And king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] commanded [[H6680]] Urijah [[H223]] the priest, [[H3548]] saying, [[H559]] Upon [[H5921]] the great [[H1419]] altar [[H4196]] burn [[H6999]] the morning [[H1242]] burnt offering, [[H5930]] and the evening [[H6153]] meat offering, [[H4503]] and the king's [[H4428]] burnt sacrifice, [[H5930]] and his meat offering, [[H4503]] with the burnt offering [[H5930]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and their meat offering, [[H4503]] and their drink offerings; [[H5262]] and sprinkle [[H2236]] upon [[H5921]] it all [[H3605]] the blood [[H1818]] of the burnt offering, [[H5930]] and all [[H3605]] the blood [[H1818]] of the sacrifice: [[H2077]] and the brasen [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] shall be [[H1961]] for me to inquire [[H1239]]

### 16
Thus did [[H6213]] Urijah [[H223]] the priest, [[H3548]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] commanded. [[H6680]]

### 17
And king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] cut off [[H7112]] the borders [[H4526]] of the bases, [[H4350]] and removed [[H5493]] the laver [[H3595]] from off [[H5921]] them; and took down [[H3381]] the sea [[H3220]] from off [[H5921]] the brasen [[H5178]] oxen [[H1241]] that [[H834]] under [[H8478]] it, and put [[H5414]] it upon [[H5921]] a pavement [[H4837]] of stones. [[H68]]

### 18
And the covert [[H4329]] for the sabbath [[H7676]] that [[H834]] they had built [[H1129]] in the house, [[H1004]] and the king's [[H4428]] entry [[H3996]] without, [[H2435]] turned [[H5437]] he from the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] for [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 19
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Ahaz [[H271]] which [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 20
And Ahaz [[H271]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David: [[H1732]] and Hezekiah [[H2396]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
