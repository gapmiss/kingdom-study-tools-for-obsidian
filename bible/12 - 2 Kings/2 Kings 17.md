### 1
In the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Ahaz [[H271]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began Hoshea [[H1954]] the son [[H1121]] of Elah [[H425]] to reign [[H4427]] in Samaria [[H8111]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] nine [[H8672]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] but [[H7535]] not [[H3808]] as the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 3
Against [[H5921]] him came up [[H5927]] Shalmaneser [[H8022]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria; [[H804]] and Hoshea [[H1954]] became [[H1961]] his servant, [[H5650]] and gave [[H7725]] him presents. [[H4503]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] found [[H4672]] conspiracy [[H7195]] in Hoshea: [[H1954]] for he had sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] So [[H5471]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and brought [[H5927]] no [[H3808]] present [[H4503]] to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] as year [[H8141]] by year: [[H8141]] therefore the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] shut him up, [[H6113]] and bound [[H631]] him in prison. [[H1004]]

### 5
Then the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] came up [[H5927]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] and went up [[H5927]] to Samaria, [[H8111]] and besieged [[H6696]] it three [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]]

### 6
In the ninth [[H8671]] year [[H8141]] of Hoshea [[H1954]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] took [[H3920]] Samaria, [[H8111]] and carried [[H1540]] Israel [[H3478]]  away [[H853]] into Assyria, [[H804]] and placed [[H3427]] them in Halah [[H2477]] and in Habor [[H2249]] the river [[H5104]] of Gozan, [[H1470]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of the Medes. [[H4074]]

### 7
For it was, [[H1961]] that [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] had sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] which had brought them up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and had feared [[H3372]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]]

### 8
And walked [[H1980]] in the statutes [[H2708]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] cast out [[H3423]] from before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] they had made. [[H6213]]

### 9
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did secretly [[H2644]] things [[H1697]] that [[H834]] not [[H3808]] right [[H3651]] against [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and they built [[H1129]] them high places [[H1116]] in all [[H3605]] their cities, [[H5892]] from the tower [[H4026]] of the watchmen [[H5341]] to [[H5704]] the fenced [[H4013]] city. [[H5892]]

### 10
And they set them up [[H5324]] images [[H4676]] and groves [[H842]] in [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] hill, [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree: [[H6086]]

### 11
And there [[H8033]] they burnt incense [[H6999]] in all [[H3605]] the high places, [[H1116]] as the heathen [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] carried away [[H1540]] before [[H6440]] them; and wrought [[H6213]] wicked [[H7451]] things [[H1697]] to provoke [[H3707]] the Lord [[H3068]] to anger: [[H3068]]

### 12
For they served [[H5647]] idols, [[H1544]] whereof [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] unto them, Ye shall not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 13
Yet the Lord [[H3068]] testified [[H5749]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and against Judah, [[H3063]] by [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] the prophets, [[H5030]] all [[H3605]] the seers, [[H2374]] saying, [[H559]] Turn [[H7725]] ye from your evil [[H7451]] ways, [[H1870]] and keep [[H8104]] my commandments [[H4687]] my statutes, [[H2708]] according to all [[H3605]] the law [[H8451]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] your fathers, [[H1]] and which [[H834]] I sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] you by [[H3027]] my servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]]

### 14
Notwithstanding they would not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] but hardened [[H7185]] their necks, [[H6203]] like to the neck [[H6203]] of their fathers, [[H1]] that [[H834]] did not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] in the Lord [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]]

### 15
And they rejected [[H3988]] his statutes, [[H2706]] and his covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] he made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] their fathers, [[H1]] and his testimonies [[H5715]] which [[H834]] he testified [[H5749]] against them; and they followed [[H1980]] vanity, [[H1892]] and became vain, [[H1891]] and went after [[H310]] the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] them, whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had charged [[H6680]] them, that they should not [[H1115]] do [[H6213]] like them. [[H6213]]

### 16
And they left [[H5800]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and made [[H6213]] them molten images, [[H4541]] two [[H8147]] calves, [[H5695]] and made [[H6213]] a grove, [[H842]] and worshipped [[H7812]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and served [[H5647]] Baal. [[H1168]]

### 17
And they caused [[H853]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters [[H1323]] to pass through [[H5674]] the fire, [[H784]] and used [[H7080]] divination [[H7081]] and enchantments, [[H5172]] and sold themselves [[H4376]] to do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to provoke him to anger. [[H3707]]

### 18
Therefore the Lord [[H3068]] was very [[H3966]] angry [[H599]] with Israel, [[H3478]] and removed [[H5493]] them out of [[H5921]] his sight: [[H6440]] there was none [[H3808]] left [[H7604]] but [[H7535]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Judah [[H3063]] only. [[H905]]

### 19
Also [[H1571]] Judah [[H3063]] kept [[H8104]] not [[H3808]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] but walked [[H1980]] in the statutes [[H2708]] of Israel [[H3478]] which [[H834]] they made. [[H6213]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] rejected [[H3988]] all [[H3605]] the seed [[H2233]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and afflicted [[H6031]] them, and delivered [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of spoilers, [[H8154]] until [[H5704]] he had cast [[H7993]] them out of his sight. [[H6440]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] he rent [[H7167]] Israel [[H3478]] from [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of David; [[H1732]]  and they made [[H853]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] king: [[H4427]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] drave [[H5077]] Israel [[H3478]] from following [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and made them sin [[H2398]] a great [[H1419]] sin. [[H2401]]

### 22
For the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] which [[H834]] he did; [[H6213]] they departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from [[H4480]] them; [[H4480]]

### 23
Until [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] removed [[H5493]] Israel [[H3478]] out of [[H5921]] his sight, [[H6440]] as [[H834]] he had said [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]] So was Israel [[H3478]] carried away [[H1540]] out of [[H5921]] their own land [[H127]] to Assyria [[H804]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 24
And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] brought [[H935]] from Babylon, [[H894]] and from Cuthah, [[H3575]] and from Ava, [[H5755]] and from Hamath, [[H2574]] and from Sepharvaim, [[H5617]] and placed [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Samaria [[H8111]] instead [[H8478]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and they possessed [[H3423]] Samaria, [[H8111]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] thereof. [[H5892]]

### 25
And it was [[H1961]] at the beginning [[H8462]] of their dwelling [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] they feared [[H3372]] not [[H3808]] the Lord: [[H3068]] therefore the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] lions [[H738]] among them, which slew [[H2026]] of them. [[H2026]]

### 26
Wherefore they spake [[H559]] to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] saying, [[H559]] The nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] thou hast removed, [[H1540]] and placed [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the manner [[H4941]] of the God [[H430]] of the land: [[H776]] therefore he hath sent [[H7971]] lions [[H738]] among them, and, behold, [[H2009]] they slay [[H4191]] them, because [[H834]] they know [[H3045]] not [[H369]] the manner [[H4941]] of the God [[H430]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 27
Then the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] commanded, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]] Carry [[H1980]] thither [[H8033]] one [[H259]] of the priests [[H3548]] whom [[H834]] ye brought [[H1540]] from thence; [[H8033]] and let them go [[H1980]] and dwell [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] and let him teach [[H3384]]  them [[H853]] the manner [[H4941]] of the God [[H430]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 28
Then one [[H259]] of the priests [[H3548]] whom [[H834]] they had carried away [[H1540]] from Samaria [[H8111]] came [[H935]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in Beth-el, [[H1008]] and taught [[H3384]] them how [[H349]] they should fear [[H3372]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 29
Howbeit every nation [[H1471]] made [[H6213]] gods [[H430]] of their own, and put [[H3240]] in the houses [[H1004]] of the high places [[H1116]] which [[H834]] the Samaritans [[H8118]] had made, [[H6213]] every nation [[H1471]] in their cities [[H5892]] wherein [[H834]] they [[H1992]] dwelt. [[H3427]]

### 30
And the men [[H376]] of Babylon [[H894]] made [[H6213]] Succoth-benoth, [[H5524]] and the men [[H376]] of Cuth [[H3575]] made [[H6213]] Nergal, [[H5370]] and the men [[H376]] of Hamath [[H2574]] made [[H6213]] Ashima, [[H807]]

### 31
And the Avites [[H5757]] made [[H6213]] Nibhaz [[H5026]] and Tartak, [[H8662]] and the Sepharvites [[H5616]] burnt [[H8313]] their children [[H1121]] in fire [[H784]] to Adrammelech [[H152]] and Anammelech, [[H6048]] the gods [[H430]] of Sepharvaim. [[H5617]]

### 32
So they feared [[H1961]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and made [[H6213]] unto themselves of the lowest [[H7098]] of them priests [[H3548]] of the high places, [[H1116]] which sacrificed [[H6213]] for them in the houses [[H1004]] of the high places. [[H1116]]

### 33
They feared [[H1961]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] their own gods, [[H430]] after the manner [[H4941]] of the nations [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] they carried away [[H1540]] from thence. [[H8033]]

### 34
Unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] they [[H1992]] do [[H6213]] after the former [[H7223]] manners: [[H4941]] they fear [[H3372]] not [[H369]] the Lord, [[H3068]] neither [[H369]] do [[H6213]] they after their statutes, [[H2708]] or after their ordinances, [[H4941]] or after the law [[H8451]] and commandment [[H4687]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] the children [[H1121]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] whom [[H834]] he named [[H7760]] Israel; [[H3478]]

### 35
With [[H854]] whom the Lord [[H3068]] had made [[H3772]] a covenant, [[H1285]] and charged [[H6680]] them, saying, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] nor [[H3808]] bow yourselves [[H7812]] to them, nor [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] them, nor [[H3808]] sacrifice [[H2076]] to them: [[H2076]]

### 36
But [[H3588]] the Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] brought you up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and a stretched out [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] him shall ye fear, [[H3372]] and him shall ye worship, [[H7812]] and to him shall ye do sacrifice. [[H2076]]

### 37
And the statutes, [[H2706]] and the ordinances, [[H4941]] and the law, [[H8451]] and the commandment, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] he wrote [[H3789]] for you, ye shall observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] for evermore; [[H3117]] and ye shall not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

### 38
And the covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] I have made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] you ye shall not [[H3808]] forget; [[H7911]] neither [[H3808]] shall ye fear [[H3372]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

### 39
But [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] ye shall fear; [[H3372]] and he [[H1931]] shall deliver [[H5337]] you out of the hand [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] your enemies. [[H341]]

### 40
Howbeit they did not [[H3808]] hearken, [[H8085]] but [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] did [[H6213]] after their former [[H7223]] manner. [[H4941]]

### 41
So these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] feared [[H1961]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] their graven images, [[H6456]] both [[H1571]] their children, [[H1121]] and their children's [[H1121]] children: [[H1121]] as [[H834]] did [[H6213]] their fathers, [[H1]] so do [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]
