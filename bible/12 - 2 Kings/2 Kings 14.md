In the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Joash [[H3101]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3099]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] reigned [[H4427]] Amaziah [[H558]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

He was [[H1961]] twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and reigned [[H4427]] twenty [[H6242]] and nine [[H8672]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Jehoaddan [[H3086]] of [[H4480]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
And he did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] yet [[H7535]] not [[H3808]] like David [[H1732]] his father: [[H1]] he did [[H6213]] according to all things [[H3605]] as [[H834]] Joash [[H3101]] his father [[H1]] did. [[H6213]]

### 4
Howbeit [[H7535]] the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] taken away: [[H5493]] as yet [[H5750]] the people [[H5971]] did sacrifice [[H2076]] and burnt incense [[H6999]] on the high places. [[H1116]]

### 5
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as soon as [[H834]] the kingdom [[H4467]] was confirmed [[H2388]] in his hand, [[H3027]] that he slew [[H5221]] his servants [[H5650]] which had slain [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] his father. [[H1]]

### 6
But the children [[H1121]] of the murderers [[H5221]] he slew [[H4191]] not: [[H3808]] according unto that which is written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] wherein [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]] The fathers [[H1]] shall not [[H3808]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] the children, [[H1121]] nor [[H3808]] the children [[H1121]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] the fathers; [[H1]] but [[H3588]] every man [[H376]] shall be put to death [[H4191]] for his own sin. [[H2399]]

### 7
He [[H1931]] slew [[H5221]] of Edom [[H123]] in the valley [[H1516]] of salt [[H4417]] ten [[H6235]] thousand, [[H505]] and took [[H8610]] Selah [[H5554]] by war, [[H4421]] and called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of it Joktheel [[H3371]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 8
Then [[H227]] Amaziah [[H558]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Jehoash, [[H3060]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] son [[H1121]] of Jehu, [[H3058]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Come, [[H1980]] let us look [[H7200]] one another in the face. [[H6440]]

### 9
And Jehoash [[H3060]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] The thistle [[H2336]] that [[H834]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] the cedar [[H730]] that [[H834]] in Lebanon, [[H3844]] saying, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]] thy daughter [[H1323]] to my son [[H1121]] to wife: [[H802]] and there passed by [[H5674]] a wild [[H7704]] beast [[H2416]] that [[H834]] in Lebanon, [[H3844]] and trode down [[H7429]] the thistle. [[H2336]]

### 10
Thou hast indeed [[H5221]] smitten [[H5221]] Edom, [[H123]] and thine heart [[H3820]] hath lifted thee up: [[H5375]] glory [[H3513]] and tarry [[H3427]] at home: [[H1004]] for why [[H4100]] shouldest thou meddle [[H1624]] to hurt, [[H7451]] that thou shouldest fall, [[H5307]] thou, [[H859]] and Judah [[H3063]] with [[H5973]] thee? [[H5973]]

### 11
But Amaziah [[H558]] would not [[H3808]] hear. [[H8085]] Therefore Jehoash [[H3060]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went up; [[H5927]] and he [[H1931]] and Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] looked [[H7200]] one another in the face [[H6440]] at Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] which [[H834]] to Judah. [[H3063]]

### 12
And Judah [[H3063]] was put to the worse [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel; [[H3478]] and they fled [[H5127]] every man [[H376]] to their tents. [[H168]]

### 13
And Jehoash [[H3060]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] took [[H8610]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoash [[H3060]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahaziah, [[H274]] at Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] and came [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and brake down [[H6555]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] from the gate [[H8179]] of Ephraim [[H669]] unto [[H5704]] the corner [[H6438]] gate, [[H8179]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 14
And he took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] and all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] that were found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and in the treasures [[H214]] of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and hostages, [[H1121]] and returned [[H7725]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]

[[H3478]]

### 16
And Jehoash [[H3060]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in Samaria [[H8111]] with [[H5973]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 17
And Amaziah [[H558]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] lived [[H2421]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Jehoash [[H3060]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] fifteen [[H2568]] years. [[H8141]]

### 19
Now they made [[H7194]] a conspiracy [[H7195]] against [[H5921]] him in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and he fled [[H5127]] to Lachish; [[H3923]] but they sent [[H7971]] after [[H310]] him to Lachish, [[H3923]] and slew [[H4191]] him there. [[H8033]]

### 20
And they brought [[H5375]] him on [[H5921]] horses: [[H5483]] and he was buried [[H6912]] at Jerusalem [[H3389]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 22
He [[H1931]] built [[H1129]] Elath, [[H359]] and restored [[H7725]] it to Judah, [[H3063]] after that [[H310]] the king [[H4428]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers. [[H1]]

### 23
In the fifteenth [[H6240]] year [[H8141]] of Amaziah [[H558]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] began to reign [[H4427]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] forty [[H705]] and one [[H259]] years.
