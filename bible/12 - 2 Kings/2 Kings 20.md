In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] was Hezekiah [[H2396]] sick [[H2470]] unto death. [[H4191]] And the prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] him, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Set thine house [[H1004]] in order; [[H6680]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] shalt die, [[H4191]] and not [[H3808]] live. [[H2421]]

### 2
Then he turned [[H5437]] his face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] the wall, [[H7023]] and prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
I beseech thee, [[H577]] O Lord, [[H3068]] remember [[H2142]] now [[H4994]] how [[H834]] I have walked [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee in truth [[H571]] and with a perfect [[H8003]] heart, [[H3824]] and have done [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] in thy sight. [[H5869]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] And wept [[H1058]] sore. [[H1419]]

### 4
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] afore [[H3808]] Isaiah [[H3470]] was gone out [[H3318]] into the middle [[H8484]] court, [[H2691]] that the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]]

### 5
Turn again, [[H7725]] and tell [[H559]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] the captain [[H5057]] of my people, [[H5971]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of David [[H1732]] thy father, [[H1]] I have heard [[H8085]] thy prayer, [[H8605]] I have seen [[H7200]] thy tears: [[H1832]] behold, [[H2005]] I will heal [[H7495]] thee: on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] thou shalt go up [[H5927]] unto the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And I will add [[H3254]] unto [[H5921]] thy days [[H3117]] fifteen [[H2568]] years; [[H8141]] and I will deliver [[H5337]] thee and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] out of the hand [[H3709]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria; [[H804]] and I will defend [[H1598]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] for mine own sake, [[H4616]] and for my servant [[H5650]] David's [[H1732]] sake. [[H4616]]

### 7
And Isaiah [[H3470]] said, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] a lump [[H1690]] of figs. [[H8384]] And they took [[H3947]] and laid [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] the boil, [[H7822]] and he recovered. [[H2421]]

### 8
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] What [[H4100]] the sign [[H226]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will heal [[H7495]] me, and that I shall go up [[H5927]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] the third [[H7992]] day? [[H3117]]

### 9
And Isaiah [[H3470]] said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] sign [[H226]] shalt thou have of [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he hath spoken: [[H1696]] shall the shadow [[H6738]] go forward [[H1980]] ten [[H6235]] degrees, [[H4609]] or [[H518]] go back [[H7725]] ten [[H6235]] degrees? [[H4609]]

### 10
And Hezekiah [[H3169]] answered, [[H559]] It is a light thing [[H7043]] for the shadow [[H6738]] to go down [[H5186]] ten [[H6235]] degrees: [[H4609]] nay, [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] let the shadow [[H6738]] return [[H7725]] backward [[H322]] ten [[H6235]] degrees. [[H4609]]

### 11
And Isaiah [[H3470]] the prophet [[H5030]] cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and he brought [[H7725]] the shadow [[H6738]] ten [[H6235]] degrees [[H4609]] backward, [[H322]] by which [[H834]] it had gone down [[H3381]] in the dial [[H4609]] of Ahaz. [[H271]]

### 12
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Berodach-baladan, [[H1255]] the son [[H1121]] of Baladan, [[H1081]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] and a present [[H4503]] unto [[H413]] Hezekiah: [[H2396]] for [[H3588]] he had heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] had been sick. [[H2470]]

### 13
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H5921]] them, and shewed [[H7200]]  them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of his precious things, [[H5238]] the silver, [[H3701]] and the gold, [[H2091]] and the spices, [[H1314]] and the precious [[H2896]] ointment, [[H8081]] and the house [[H1004]] of his armour, [[H3627]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was found [[H4672]] in his treasures: [[H214]] there was [[H1961]] nothing [[H1697]] in his house, [[H1004]] nor in all [[H3605]] his dominion, [[H4475]] that [[H834]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] shewed [[H7200]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 14
Then came [[H935]] Isaiah [[H3470]] the prophet [[H5030]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] said [[H559]] these [[H428]] men? [[H376]] and from whence [[H370]] came [[H935]] they unto [[H413]] thee? And Hezekiah [[H2396]] said, [[H559]] They are come [[H935]] from a far [[H7350]] country, [[H776]] from Babylon. [[H894]]

### 15
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have they seen [[H7200]] in thine house? [[H1004]] And Hezekiah [[H2396]] answered, [[H559]] All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in mine house [[H1004]] have they seen: [[H7200]] there is [[H1961]] nothing [[H1697]] among my treasures [[H214]] that [[H834]] I have not [[H3808]] shewed [[H7200]] them. [[H7200]]

### 16
And Isaiah [[H3470]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] that all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in thine house, [[H1004]] and that which [[H834]] thy fathers [[H1]] have laid up in store [[H686]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] shall be carried [[H5375]] into Babylon: [[H894]] nothing [[H1697]] shall be left, [[H3498]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
And of thy sons [[H1121]] that [[H834]] shall issue [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] thee, which [[H834]] thou shalt beget, [[H3205]] shall they take away; [[H3947]] and they shall be [[H1961]] eunuchs [[H5631]] in the palace [[H1964]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 19
Then said [[H559]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] unto [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] Good [[H2896]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] thou hast spoken. [[H1696]] And he said, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] if [[H518]] peace [[H7965]] and truth [[H571]] be [[H1961]] in my days? [[H3117]]

### 20
And the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Hezekiah, [[H2396]] and all [[H3605]] his might, [[H1369]] and how [[H834]] he made [[H6213]] a pool, [[H1295]] and a conduit, [[H8585]] and brought [[H935]] water [[H4325]] into the city, [[H5892]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 21
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers: [[H1]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
