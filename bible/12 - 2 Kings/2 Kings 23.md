And the king [[H4428]] went up [[H5927]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] with [[H854]] him, and the priests, [[H3548]] and the prophets, [[H5030]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] both small [[H6996]] and great: [[H1419]] and he read [[H7121]] in their ears [[H241]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the book [[H5612]] of the covenant [[H1285]] which was found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] a pillar, [[H5982]] and made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and to keep [[H8104]] his commandments [[H4687]] and his testimonies [[H5715]] and his statutes [[H2708]] with all [[H3605]] heart [[H3820]] and all [[H3605]] soul, [[H5315]] to perform [[H6965]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] that were written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] book. [[H5612]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] stood [[H5975]] to the covenant. [[H1285]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] and the priests [[H3548]] of the second order, [[H4932]] and the keepers [[H8104]] of the door, [[H5592]] to bring forth [[H3318]] out of the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] that were made [[H6213]] for Baal, [[H1168]] and for the grove, [[H842]] and for all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven: [[H8064]] and he burned [[H8313]] them without [[H2351]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the fields [[H7709]] of Kidron, [[H6939]] and carried [[H5375]] the ashes [[H6083]] of them unto Beth-el. [[H1008]]

### 5
And he put down [[H7673]] the idolatrous priests, [[H3649]] whom [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had ordained [[H5414]] to burn incense [[H6999]] in the high places [[H1116]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the places round about [[H4524]] Jerusalem; [[H3389]] them also that burned incense [[H6999]] unto Baal, [[H1168]] to the sun, [[H8121]] and to the moon, [[H3394]] and to the planets, [[H4208]] and to all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 6
And he brought out [[H3318]] the grove [[H842]] from the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] without [[H2351]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] unto [[H413]] the brook [[H5158]] Kidron, [[H6939]] and burned [[H8313]] it at the brook [[H5158]] Kidron, [[H6939]] and stamped small [[H1854]] to powder, [[H6083]] and cast [[H7993]] the powder [[H6083]] thereof upon [[H5921]] the graves [[H6913]] of the children [[H1121]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 7
And he brake down [[H5422]] the houses [[H1004]] of the sodomites, [[H6945]] that [[H834]] by the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] where [[H834]] the women [[H802]] wove [[H707]] hangings [[H1004]] for the grove. [[H842]]

### 8
And he brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] the priests [[H3548]] out of the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and defiled [[H2930]] the high places [[H1116]] where [[H834]] the priests [[H3548]] had burned incense, [[H6999]] from Geba [[H1387]] to [[H5704]] Beer-sheba, [[H884]] and brake down [[H5422]] the high places [[H1116]] of the gates [[H8179]] that [[H834]] in the entering in [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of Joshua [[H3091]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] on [[H5921]] a man's [[H376]] left hand [[H8040]] at the gate [[H8179]] of the city. [[H5892]]

### 9
Nevertheless [[H389]] the priests [[H3548]] of the high places [[H1116]] came not up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] but [[H3588]] they did eat [[H398]] of the unleavened bread [[H4682]] among [[H8432]] their brethren. [[H251]]

### 10
And he defiled [[H2930]] Topheth, [[H8612]] which [[H834]] in the valley [[H1516]] of the children [[H1121]] of Hinnom, [[H2011]] that no [[H1115]] man [[H376]]  might make [[H853]] his son [[H1121]] or his daughter [[H1323]] to pass through [[H5674]] the fire [[H784]] to Molech. [[H4432]]

### 11
And he took away [[H7673]] the horses [[H5483]] that [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had given [[H5414]] to the sun, [[H8121]] at the entering in [[H935]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] by [[H413]] the chamber [[H3957]] of Nathan-melech [[H5419]] the chamberlain, [[H5631]] which [[H834]] in the suburbs, [[H6503]] and burned [[H8313]] the chariots [[H4818]] of the sun [[H8121]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 12
And the altars [[H4196]] that [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the top [[H1406]] of the upper chamber [[H5944]] of Ahaz, [[H271]] which [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had made, [[H6213]] and the altars [[H4196]] which [[H834]] Manasseh [[H4519]] had made [[H6213]] in the two [[H8147]] courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] did the king [[H4428]] beat down, [[H5422]] and brake down [[H7323]] from thence, [[H8033]] and cast [[H7993]] the dust [[H6083]] of them into [[H413]] the brook [[H5158]] Kidron. [[H6939]]

### 13
And the high places [[H1116]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] on the right hand [[H3225]] of the mount [[H2022]] of corruption, [[H4889]] which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] had builded [[H1129]] for Ashtoreth [[H6253]] the abomination [[H8251]] of the Zidonians, [[H6722]] and for Chemosh [[H3645]] the abomination [[H8251]] of the Moabites, [[H4124]] and for Milcom [[H4445]] the abomination [[H8441]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] did the king [[H4428]] defile. [[H2930]]

### 14
And he brake in pieces [[H7665]] the images, [[H4676]] and cut down [[H3772]] the groves, [[H842]] and filled [[H4390]] their places [[H4725]] with the bones [[H6106]] of men. [[H120]]

### 15
Moreover [[H1571]] the altar [[H4196]] that [[H834]] at Beth-el, [[H1008]] the high place [[H1116]] which [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] who [[H834]]  made [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] to sin, [[H2398]] had made, [[H6213]] both [[H1571]] that [[H1931]] altar [[H4196]] and the high place [[H1116]] he brake down, [[H5422]] and burned [[H8313]] the high place, [[H1116]] stamped small [[H1854]] to powder, [[H6083]] and burned [[H8313]] the grove. [[H842]]

### 16
And as Josiah [[H2977]] turned [[H6437]] himself, he spied [[H7200]] the sepulchres [[H6913]] that [[H834]] there [[H8033]] in the mount, [[H2022]] and sent, [[H7971]] and took [[H3947]] the bones [[H6106]] out of [[H4480]] the sepulchres, [[H6913]] and burned [[H8313]] upon [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and polluted [[H2930]] it, according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] proclaimed, [[H7121]] who [[H834]] proclaimed [[H7121]] these [[H428]] words. [[H1697]]

### 17
Then he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] title [[H6725]] that [[H1975]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] see? [[H7200]] And the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] told [[H559]] him, the sepulchre [[H6913]] of the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] came [[H935]] from Judah, [[H3063]] and proclaimed [[H7121]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] that [[H834]] thou hast done [[H6213]] against [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of Beth-el. [[H1008]]

### 18
And he said, [[H559]] Let him alone; [[H3240]] let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] move [[H5128]] his bones. [[H6106]] So they let his bones [[H6106]] alone, [[H4422]] with [[H854]] the bones [[H6106]] of the prophet [[H5030]] that [[H834]] came out [[H935]] of Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 19
And [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the houses [[H1004]] also [[H1571]] of the high places [[H1116]] that [[H834]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] which [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] had made [[H6213]] to provoke to anger, [[H3707]] Josiah [[H2977]] took away, [[H5493]] and did [[H6213]] to them according to all [[H3605]] the acts [[H4639]] that [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] in Beth-el. [[H1008]]

### 20
And he slew [[H2076]] all [[H3605]] the priests [[H3548]] of the high places [[H1116]] that [[H834]] there [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] the altars, [[H4196]] and burned [[H8313]] men's [[H120]] bones [[H6106]] upon [[H5921]] them, and returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 21
And the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Keep [[H6213]] the passover [[H6453]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] as written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of this [[H2088]] covenant. [[H1285]]

### 22
Surely [[H3588]] there was not [[H3808]] holden [[H6213]] such [[H2088]] a passover [[H6453]] from the days [[H3117]] of the judges [[H8199]] that [[H834]] judged [[H8199]] Israel, [[H3478]] nor in all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] nor of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah; [[H3063]]

### 23
But [[H3588]] in the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Josiah, [[H2977]] this [[H2088]] passover [[H6453]] was holden [[H6213]] to the Lord [[H3068]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 24
Moreover [[H1571]] the familiar spirits, [[H178]] and the wizards, [[H3049]] and the images, [[H8655]] and the idols, [[H1544]] and all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8251]] that [[H834]] were spied [[H7200]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] did Josiah [[H2977]] put away, [[H1197]] that [[H4616]] he might perform [[H6965]] the words [[H1697]] of the law [[H8451]] which were written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] that [[H834]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest [[H3548]] found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 25
And like unto him [[H3644]] was [[H1961]] there no [[H3808]] king [[H4428]] before [[H6440]] him, that [[H834]] turned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] his heart, [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] his soul, [[H5315]] and with all [[H3605]] his might, [[H3966]] according to all [[H3605]] the law [[H8451]] of Moses; [[H4872]] neither [[H3808]] after [[H310]] him arose [[H6965]] there like him. [[H3644]]

### 26
Notwithstanding [[H389]] the Lord [[H3068]] turned [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] from the fierceness [[H2740]] of his great [[H1419]] wrath, [[H639]] wherewith [[H834]] his anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Judah, [[H3063]] because [[H5921]] of all [[H3605]] the provocations [[H3708]] that [[H834]] Manasseh [[H4519]] had provoked [[H3707]] him withal. [[H3707]]

### 27
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] I will remove [[H5493]] Judah [[H3063]] also [[H1571]] out of [[H5921]] my sight, [[H6440]] as [[H834]] I have removed [[H5493]] Israel, [[H3478]] and will cast off [[H3988]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] which [[H834]] I have chosen, [[H977]] and the house [[H1004]] of which [[H834]] I said, [[H559]] My name [[H8034]] shall be [[H1961]] there. [[H8033]]

### 28
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 29
In his days [[H3117]] Pharaoh-nechoh [[H6549]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] went up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] to [[H5921]] the river [[H5104]] Euphrates: [[H6578]] and king [[H4428]] Josiah [[H2977]] went [[H1980]] against [[H7125]] him; and he slew [[H4191]] him at Megiddo, [[H4023]] when he had seen [[H7200]] him. [[H7200]]

### 30
And his servants [[H5650]] carried chariot [[H7392]] him in a dead [[H4191]] from Megiddo, [[H4023]] and brought [[H935]] him to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and buried [[H6912]] him in his own sepulchre. [[H6900]] And the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] took [[H3947]] Jehoahaz [[H3059]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] and anointed [[H4886]] him, and made him king [[H4427]] in his father's [[H1]] stead. [[H8478]]

### 31
Jehoahaz [[H3059]] twenty [[H6242]] and three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign; [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Hamutal, [[H2537]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] of Libnah. [[H3841]]

### 32
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] his fathers [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]]

### 33
And Pharaoh-nechoh [[H6549]] put him in bands [[H631]] at Riblah [[H7247]] in the land [[H776]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] that he might not reign [[H4427]] in Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and put [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] to a tribute [[H6066]] of an hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] and a talent [[H3603]] of gold. [[H2091]]

### 34
And Pharaoh-nechoh [[H6549]]  made [[H853]] Eliakim [[H471]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4427]] in the room [[H8478]] of Josiah [[H2977]] his father, [[H1]] and turned [[H5437]] his name [[H8034]] to Jehoiakim, [[H3079]] and took away: [[H3947]] Jehoahaz [[H3059]] and he came [[H935]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] and died [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]]

### 35
And Jehoiakim [[H3079]] gave [[H5414]] the silver [[H3701]] and the gold [[H2091]] to Pharaoh; [[H6547]] but [[H389]] he taxed [[H6186]] the land [[H776]] to give [[H5414]] the money [[H3701]] according [[H5921]] to the commandment [[H6310]] of Pharaoh: [[H6547]] he exacted [[H5065]] the silver [[H3701]] and the gold [[H2091]]  of [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] of every one [[H376]] according to his taxation, [[H6187]] to give [[H5414]] unto Pharaoh-nechoh. [[H6549]]

### 36
Jehoiakim [[H3079]] twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign; [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] eleven [[H259]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Zebudah, [[H2080]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Pedaiah [[H6305]] of [[H4480]] Rumah. [[H7316]]

### 37
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] his fathers [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]]
