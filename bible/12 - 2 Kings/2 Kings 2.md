### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the Lord [[H3068]] would take up [[H5927]] Elijah [[H452]] into heaven [[H8064]] by a whirlwind, [[H5591]] that Elijah [[H452]] went [[H1980]] with Elisha [[H477]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 2
And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] Tarry [[H3427]] here, [[H6311]] I pray thee; [[H4994]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent [[H7971]] me to [[H5704]] Beth-el. [[H1008]] And Elisha [[H477]] said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] and thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] leave [[H5800]] thee. So they went down [[H3381]] to Beth-el. [[H1008]]

### 3
And the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] that [[H834]] at Beth-el [[H1008]] came forth [[H3318]] to [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Knowest [[H3045]] thou that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will take away [[H3947]] thy master [[H113]] from [[H5921]] thy head [[H7218]] to day? [[H3117]] And he said, [[H559]] Yea, [[H1571]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] hold ye your peace. [[H2814]]

### 4
And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] unto him, Elisha, [[H477]] tarry [[H3427]] here, [[H6311]] I pray thee; [[H4994]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent [[H7971]] me to Jericho. [[H3405]] And he said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] and thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] leave [[H5800]] thee. So they came [[H935]] to Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 5
And the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] that [[H834]] at Jericho [[H3405]] came [[H5066]] to [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Knowest [[H3045]] thou that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will take away [[H3947]] thy master [[H113]] from [[H5921]] thy head [[H7218]] to day? [[H3117]] And he answered, [[H559]] Yea, [[H1571]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] hold ye your peace. [[H2814]]

### 6
And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] unto him, Tarry, [[H3427]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] here; [[H6311]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent [[H7971]] me to Jordan. [[H3383]] And he said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] and thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] leave [[H5800]] thee. And they two [[H8147]] went on. [[H1980]]

### 7
And fifty [[H2572]] men [[H582]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] went, [[H1980]] and stood [[H5975]] to view [[H5048]] afar off: [[H7350]] and they two [[H8147]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 8
And Elijah [[H452]] took [[H3947]] his mantle, [[H155]] and wrapped together, [[H1563]] and smote [[H5221]] the waters, [[H4325]] and they were divided [[H2673]] hither [[H2008]] and thither, [[H2008]] so that they two [[H8147]] went over [[H5674]] on dry ground. [[H2724]]

### 9
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they were gone over, [[H5674]] that Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] Ask [[H7592]] what [[H4100]] I shall do [[H6213]] for thee, before [[H2962]] I be taken away [[H3947]] from [[H5973]] thee. And Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] let a double [[H8147]] portion [[H6310]] of thy spirit [[H7307]] be [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] Thou hast asked [[H7592]] a hard thing: [[H7185]] if [[H518]] thou see [[H7200]] me taken [[H3947]] from [[H853]] thee, it shall be [[H1961]] so [[H3651]] unto thee; but if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] it shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as they [[H1992]] still [[H1980]] went on, [[H1980]] and talked, [[H1696]] that, behold, [[H2009]] a chariot [[H7393]] of fire, [[H784]] and horses [[H5483]] of fire, [[H784]] and parted [[H6504]] them both [[H8147]] asunder; [[H996]] and Elijah [[H452]] went up [[H5927]] by a whirlwind [[H5591]] into heaven. [[H8064]]

### 12
And Elisha [[H477]] saw [[H7200]] and he [[H1931]] cried, [[H6817]] My father, [[H1]] my father, [[H1]] the chariot [[H7393]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the horsemen [[H6571]] thereof. And he saw [[H7200]] him no [[H3808]] more: [[H5750]] and he took hold [[H2388]] of his own clothes, [[H899]] and rent [[H7167]] them in two [[H8147]] pieces. [[H7168]]

### 13
He took up [[H7311]]  also [[H853]] the mantle [[H155]] of Elijah [[H452]] that [[H834]] fell [[H5307]] from [[H5921]] him, and went back, [[H7725]] and stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] of Jordan; [[H3383]]

### 14
And he took [[H3947]] the mantle [[H155]] of Elijah [[H452]] that [[H834]] fell [[H5307]] from [[H5921]] him, and smote [[H5221]] the waters, [[H4325]] and said, [[H559]] Where [[H346]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Elijah? [[H452]] and when he [[H1931]] also [[H637]] had smitten [[H5221]] the waters, [[H4325]] they parted [[H2673]] hither [[H2008]] and thither: [[H2008]] and Elisha [[H477]] went over. [[H5674]]

### 15
And when the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] which [[H834]] to view [[H5048]] at Jericho [[H3405]] saw [[H7200]] him, they said, [[H559]] The spirit [[H7307]] of Elijah [[H452]] doth rest [[H5117]] on [[H5921]] Elisha. [[H477]] And they came [[H935]] to meet [[H7125]] him, and bowed themselves [[H7812]] to the ground [[H776]] before him. [[H776]]

### 16
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] there be [[H3426]] with [[H854]] thy servants [[H5650]] fifty [[H2572]] strong [[H2428]] men; [[H1121]] let them go, [[H1980]] we pray thee, [[H4994]] and seek [[H1245]] thy master: [[H113]] lest peradventure [[H6435]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath taken him up, [[H5375]] and cast [[H7993]] him upon some [[H259]] mountain, [[H2022]] or [[H176]] into some [[H259]] valley. [[H1516]] And he said, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] send. [[H7971]]

### 17
And when they urged [[H6484]] him till [[H5704]] he was ashamed, [[H954]] he said, [[H559]] Send. [[H7971]] They sent [[H7971]] therefore fifty [[H2572]] men; [[H376]] and they sought [[H1245]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] but found [[H4672]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 18
And when they came again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] him, (for he [[H1931]] tarried [[H3427]] at Jericho,) [[H3405]] he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Did I not [[H3808]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, Go [[H1980]] not? [[H408]]

### 19
And the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] Behold, [[H2009]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] the situation [[H4186]] of this city [[H5892]] pleasant, [[H2896]] as [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] seeth: [[H7200]] but the water [[H4325]] naught, [[H7451]] and the ground [[H776]] barren. [[H7921]]

### 20
And he said, [[H559]] Bring [[H3947]] me a new [[H2319]] cruse, [[H6746]] and put [[H7760]] salt [[H4417]] therein. [[H8033]] And they brought [[H3947]] to [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 21
And he went forth [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] the spring [[H4161]] of the waters, [[H4325]] and cast [[H7993]] the salt [[H4417]] in there, [[H8033]] and said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I have healed [[H7495]] these [[H428]] waters; [[H4325]] there shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] from thence [[H8033]] any more [[H5750]] death [[H4194]] or barren [[H7921]]

### 22
So the waters [[H4325]] were healed [[H7495]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] according to the saying [[H1697]] of Elisha [[H477]] which [[H834]] he spake. [[H1696]]

### 23
And he went up [[H5927]] from thence [[H8033]] unto Beth-el: [[H1008]] and as he [[H1931]] was going up [[H5927]] by the way, [[H1870]] there came forth [[H3318]] little [[H6996]] children [[H5288]] out of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] and mocked [[H7046]] him, and said [[H559]] unto him, Go up, [[H5927]] thou bald head; [[H7142]] go up, [[H5927]] thou bald head. [[H7142]]

### 24
And he turned [[H6437]] back, [[H310]] and looked [[H7200]] on them, and cursed [[H7043]] them in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And there came forth [[H3318]] two [[H8147]] she bears [[H1677]] out of [[H4480]] the wood, [[H3293]] and tare [[H1234]] forty [[H705]] and two [[H8147]] children of them. [[H3206]]

### 25
And he went [[H1980]] from thence [[H8033]] to [[H413]] mount [[H2022]] Carmel, [[H3760]] and from thence [[H8033]] he returned [[H7725]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]
