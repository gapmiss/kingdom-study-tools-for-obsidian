In the three [[H7969]] and twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of Joash [[H3101]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] Jehoahaz [[H3059]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehu [[H3058]] began to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] seventeen [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and followed [[H1980]] the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] which [[H834]]  made [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] to sin; [[H2398]] he departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] therefrom. [[H4480]]

### 3
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and he delivered [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of Ben-hadad [[H1130]] the son [[H1121]] of Hazael, [[H2371]] all [[H3605]] days. [[H3117]]

### 4
And Jehoahaz [[H3059]] besought [[H2470]]  the [[H6440]] Lord, [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] him: for [[H3588]] he saw [[H7200]] the oppression [[H3906]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] oppressed [[H3905]] them. [[H3905]]

### 5
(And the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] a saviour, [[H3467]] so that they went out [[H3318]] from under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Syrians: [[H758]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] dwelt [[H3427]] in their tents, [[H168]] as beforetime. [[H8032]]

### 6
Nevertheless [[H389]] they departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from the sins [[H2403]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] who [[H834]]  made [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] sin, [[H2398]] walked [[H1980]] therein: and there remained [[H5975]] the grove [[H842]] also [[H1571]] in Samaria.) [[H8111]]

### 7
Neither [[H3588]] did he leave [[H7604]] of the people [[H5971]] to Jehoahaz [[H3059]] but [[H3588]] fifty [[H2572]] horsemen, [[H6571]] and ten [[H6235]] chariots, [[H7393]] and ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] footmen; [[H7273]] for [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] had destroyed [[H6]] them, and had made [[H7760]] them like the dust [[H6083]] by threshing. [[H1758]]

### 8
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoahaz, [[H3059]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and his might, [[H1369]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 9
And Jehoahaz [[H3059]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers; [[H1]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in Samaria: [[H8111]] and Joash [[H3101]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 10
In the thirty [[H7970]] and seventh [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began Jehoash [[H3060]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] sixteen [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]]

### 11
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] he departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] who [[H834]]  made [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] sin: [[H2398]] he walked [[H1980]] therein. [[H1980]]

### 12
And the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Joash, [[H3101]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and his might [[H1369]] wherewith [[H834]] he fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 13
And Joash [[H3101]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers; [[H1]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] sat [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] his throne: [[H3678]] and Joash [[H3101]] was buried [[H6912]] in Samaria [[H8111]] with [[H5973]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 14
Now Elisha [[H477]] was fallen sick [[H2470]] of [[H854]] his sickness [[H2483]] whereof [[H834]] he died. [[H4191]] And Joash [[H3101]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] came down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] him, and wept [[H1058]] over [[H5921]] his face, [[H6440]] and said, [[H559]] O my father, [[H1]] my father, [[H1]] the chariot [[H7393]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the horsemen [[H6571]] thereof. [[H6571]]

### 15
And Elisha [[H477]] said [[H559]] unto him, Take [[H3947]] bow [[H7198]] and arrows. [[H2671]] And he took [[H3947]] unto [[H413]] him bow [[H7198]] and arrows. [[H2671]]

### 16
And he said [[H559]] to the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Put [[H7392]] thine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the bow. [[H7198]] And he put [[H7392]] his hand [[H3027]] and Elisha [[H477]] put [[H7760]] his hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the king's [[H4428]] hands. [[H3027]]

### 17
And he said, [[H559]] Open [[H6605]] the window [[H2474]] eastward. [[H6924]] And he opened [[H6605]] Then Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] Shoot. [[H3384]] And he shot. [[H3384]] And he said, [[H559]] The arrow [[H2671]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] deliverance, [[H8668]] and the arrow [[H2671]] of deliverance [[H8668]] from Syria: [[H758]] for thou shalt smite [[H5221]] the Syrians [[H758]] in Aphek, [[H663]] till [[H5704]] thou have consumed [[H3615]]

### 18
And he said, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] the arrows. [[H2671]] And he took [[H3947]] And he said [[H559]] unto the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Smite [[H5221]] upon the ground. [[H776]] And he smote [[H5221]] thrice, [[H7969]] and stayed. [[H5975]]

### 19
And the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] was wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] him, and said, [[H559]] Thou shouldest have smitten [[H5221]] five [[H2568]] or [[H176]] six [[H8337]] times; [[H6471]] then [[H227]] hadst thou smitten [[H5221]] Syria [[H758]] till [[H5704]] thou hadst consumed [[H3615]] whereas now [[H6258]] thou shalt smite [[H5221]] Syria [[H758]] thrice. [[H7969]]

### 20
And Elisha [[H477]] died, [[H4191]] and they buried [[H6912]] him. And the bands [[H1416]] of the Moabites [[H4124]] invaded [[H935]] the land [[H776]] at the coming in [[H935]] of the year. [[H8141]]

### 21
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as they [[H1992]] were burying [[H6912]] a man, [[H376]] that, behold, [[H2009]] they spied [[H7200]] a band [[H1416]] and they cast [[H7993]] the man [[H376]] into the sepulchre [[H6913]] of Elisha: [[H477]] and when the man [[H376]] was let down, [[H1980]] and touched [[H5060]] the bones [[H6106]] of Elisha, [[H477]] he revived, [[H2421]] and stood up [[H6965]] on [[H5921]] his feet. [[H7272]]

### 22
But Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] oppressed [[H3905]] Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Jehoahaz. [[H3059]]

### 23
And the Lord [[H3068]] was gracious [[H2603]] unto them, and had compassion on [[H7355]] them, and had respect [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] them, because of [[H4616]] his covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob, [[H3290]] and would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] them, neither [[H3808]] cast [[H7993]] he them from [[H5921]] his presence [[H6440]] as yet. [[H5704]]

### 24
So Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] died; [[H4191]] and Ben-hadad [[H1130]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 25
And Jehoash [[H3060]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] took [[H3947]] again [[H7725]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of Ben-hadad [[H1130]] the son [[H1121]] of Hazael [[H2371]] the cities, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] he had taken [[H3947]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] his father [[H1]] by war. [[H4421]] Three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] did Joash [[H3101]] beat [[H5221]] him, and recovered [[H7725]] the cities [[H5892]] of Israel. [[H3478]]
