### 1
Then spake [[H1696]] Elisha [[H477]] unto [[H413]] the woman, [[H802]] whose [[H834]] son [[H1121]] he had restored to life, [[H2421]] saying, [[H559]] Arise, [[H6965]] and go [[H1980]] thou [[H859]] and thine household, [[H1004]] and sojourn [[H1481]] wheresoever [[H834]] thou canst sojourn: [[H1481]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath called [[H7121]] for a famine; [[H7458]] and it shall also [[H1571]] come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] the land [[H776]] seven [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And the woman [[H802]] arose, [[H6965]] and did [[H6213]] after the saying [[H1697]] of the man [[H376]] of God: [[H430]] and she [[H1931]] went [[H1980]] with her household, [[H1004]] and sojourned [[H1481]] in the land [[H776]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] seven [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]]

### 3
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the seven [[H7651]] years' [[H8141]] end, [[H7097]] that the woman [[H802]] returned [[H7725]] out of the land [[H776]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] and she went forth [[H3318]] to cry [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] for [[H413]] her house [[H1004]] and for [[H413]] her land. [[H7704]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] talked [[H1696]] with [[H413]] Gehazi [[H1522]] the servant [[H5288]] of the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]] Tell [[H5608]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] all [[H3605]] the great things [[H1419]] that [[H834]] Elisha [[H477]] hath done. [[H6213]]

### 5
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as he [[H1931]] was telling [[H5608]] the king [[H4428]] how [[H834]] he had restored [[H2421]] a dead body [[H4191]]  to life, [[H853]] that, behold, [[H2009]] the woman, [[H802]] whose [[H834]] son [[H1121]] he had restored to life, [[H2421]] cried [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] for [[H5921]] her house [[H1004]] and for [[H5921]] her land. [[H7704]] And Gehazi [[H1522]] said, [[H559]] My lord, [[H113]] O king, [[H4428]] this [[H2063]] the woman, [[H802]] and this [[H2088]] her son, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] Elisha [[H477]] restored to life. [[H2421]]

### 6
And when the king [[H4428]] asked [[H7592]] the woman, [[H802]] she told [[H5608]] him. So the king [[H4428]] appointed [[H5414]] unto her a certain [[H259]] officer, [[H5631]] saying, [[H559]] Restore [[H7725]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] hers, and all [[H3605]] the fruits [[H8393]] of the field [[H7704]] since the day [[H3117]] that she left [[H5800]] the land, [[H776]] even until [[H5704]] now. [[H6258]]

### 7
And Elisha [[H477]] came [[H935]] to Damascus; [[H1834]] and Ben-hadad [[H1130]] the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] was sick; [[H2470]] and it was told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] The man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] is come [[H935]] hither. [[H2008]]

### 8
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Hazael, [[H2371]] Take [[H3947]] a present [[H4503]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] and go, [[H1980]] meet [[H7125]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and inquire [[H1875]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H854]] him, saying, [[H559]] Shall I recover [[H2421]] of this disease? [[H2483]]

### 9
So Hazael [[H2371]] went [[H1980]] to meet [[H7125]] him, and took [[H3947]] a present [[H4503]] with him, [[H3027]] even of every [[H3605]] good thing [[H2898]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] forty [[H705]] camels' [[H1581]] burden, [[H4853]] and came [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him, and said, [[H559]] Thy son [[H1121]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] hath sent [[H7971]] me to [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Shall I recover [[H2421]] of this disease? [[H2483]]

### 10
And Elisha [[H477]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Go, [[H1980]] say [[H559]] unto him, Thou mayest certainly [[H2421]] recover: [[H2421]] howbeit the Lord [[H3068]] hath shewed [[H7200]] me that [[H3588]] he shall surely [[H4191]] die. [[H4191]]

### 11
And he settled [[H5975]] his countenance [[H6440]] stedfastly, [[H7760]] until [[H5704]] he was ashamed: [[H954]] and the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] wept. [[H1058]]

### 12
And Hazael [[H2371]] said, [[H559]] Why [[H4069]] weepeth [[H1058]] my lord? [[H113]] And he answered, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] thou wilt do [[H6213]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] their strong holds [[H4013]] wilt thou set [[H7971]] on fire, [[H784]] and their young men [[H970]] wilt thou slay [[H2026]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and wilt dash [[H7376]] their children, [[H5768]] and rip up [[H1234]] their women with child. [[H2030]]

### 13
And Hazael [[H2371]] said, [[H559]] But [[H3588]] what, [[H4100]] thy servant [[H5650]] a dog, [[H3611]] that [[H3588]] he should do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] thing? [[H1697]] And Elisha [[H477]] answered, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath shewed [[H7200]] me that thou king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Syria. [[H758]]

### 14
So he departed [[H1980]] from [[H853]] Elisha, [[H477]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] his master; [[H113]] who said [[H559]] to him, What [[H4100]] said [[H559]] Elisha [[H477]] to thee? And he answered, [[H559]] He told [[H559]] me thou shouldest surely [[H2421]] recover. [[H2421]]

### 15
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that he took [[H3947]] a thick cloth, [[H4346]] and dipped [[H2881]] in water, [[H4325]] and spread [[H6566]] on [[H5921]] his face, [[H6440]] so that he died: [[H4191]] and Hazael [[H2371]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 16
And in the fifth [[H2568]] year [[H8141]] of Joram [[H3141]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] then king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Jehoram [[H3088]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began to reign. [[H4427]]

### 17
Thirty [[H7970]] and two [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] was [[H1961]] he when he began to reign; [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] eight [[H8083]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 18
And he walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] did [[H6213]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab: [[H256]] for [[H3588]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Ahab [[H256]] was [[H1961]] his wife: [[H802]] and he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 19
Yet the Lord [[H3068]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] Judah [[H3063]] for David [[H1732]] his servant's [[H5650]] sake, [[H4616]] as [[H834]] he promised [[H559]] him to give [[H5414]] him alway [[H3117]] a light, [[H5216]] to his children. [[H1121]]

### 20
In his days [[H3117]] Edom [[H123]] revolted [[H6586]] from under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and made [[H4427]] a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] themselves. [[H5921]]

### 21
So Joram [[H3141]] went over [[H5674]] to Zair, [[H6811]] and all [[H3605]] the chariots [[H7393]] with [[H5973]] him: and he [[H1931]] rose [[H6965]] by night, [[H3915]] and smote [[H5221]] the Edomites [[H123]] which compassed him about, [[H5437]] and the captains [[H8269]] of the chariots: [[H7393]] and the people [[H5971]] fled [[H5127]] into their tents. [[H168]]

### 22
Yet Edom [[H123]] revolted [[H6586]] from under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Judah [[H3063]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] Then [[H227]] Libnah [[H3841]] revolted [[H6586]] at the same [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

### 23
And the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Joram, [[H3141]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 24
And Joram [[H3141]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David: [[H1732]] and Ahaziah [[H274]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 25
In the twelfth [[H6240]] year [[H8141]] of Joram [[H3141]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] did Ahaziah [[H274]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] begin to reign. [[H4427]]

### 26
Two [[H8147]] and twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] Ahaziah [[H274]] when he began to reign; [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] one [[H259]] year [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Athaliah, [[H6271]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Omri [[H6018]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
And he walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] and did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] as the house [[H1004]] of Ahab: [[H256]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the son in law [[H2860]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab. [[H256]]

### 28
And he went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Joram [[H3141]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] to the war [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] in Ramoth-gilead; [[H7433]] and the Syrians [[H761]] wounded [[H5221]] Joram. [[H3141]]

### 29
And king [[H4428]] Joram [[H3141]] went back [[H7725]] to be healed [[H7495]] in Jezreel [[H3157]] of [[H4480]] the wounds [[H4347]] which [[H834]] the Syrians [[H761]] had given [[H5221]] him at Ramah, [[H7414]] when he fought [[H3898]] against [[H854]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria. [[H758]] And Ahaziah [[H274]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went down [[H3381]] to see [[H7200]] Joram [[H3141]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] in Jezreel, [[H3157]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was sick.
