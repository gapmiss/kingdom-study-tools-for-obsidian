### 1
Now Naaman, [[H5283]] captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] of the king [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] was [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] man [[H376]] with [[H6440]] his master, [[H113]] and honourable, [[H5375]] because [[H3588]] by him the Lord [[H3068]] had given [[H5414]] deliverance [[H8668]] unto Syria: [[H758]] he was [[H1961]] also a mighty [[H1368]] man [[H376]] in valour, [[H2428]] a leper. [[H6879]]

### 2
And the Syrians [[H758]] had gone out [[H3318]] by companies, [[H1416]] and had brought away captive [[H7617]] out of the land [[H776]] of Israel [[H3478]] a little [[H6996]] maid; [[H5291]] and she waited [[H1961]] on [[H6440]] Naaman's [[H5283]] wife. [[H802]]

### 3
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her mistress, [[H1404]] Would God [[H305]] my lord [[H113]] with [[H6440]] the prophet [[H5030]] that [[H834]] in Samaria! [[H8111]] for [[H227]] he would recover [[H622]] him of his leprosy. [[H6883]]

### 4
And went in, [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] his lord, [[H113]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H2063]] and thus [[H2063]] said [[H1696]] the maid [[H5291]] that [[H834]] of the land [[H776]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] said, [[H559]] Go to, [[H1980]] go, [[H935]] and I will send [[H7971]] a letter [[H5612]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And he departed, [[H1980]] and took [[H3947]] with him [[H3027]] ten [[H6235]] talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] and six [[H8337]] thousand [[H505]] of gold, [[H2091]] and ten [[H6235]] changes [[H2487]] of raiment. [[H899]]

### 6
And he brought [[H935]] the letter [[H5612]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Now [[H6258]] when this [[H2088]] letter [[H5612]] is come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, behold, [[H2009]] I have sent [[H7971]] Naaman [[H5283]] my servant [[H5650]] to [[H413]] thee, that thou mayest recover [[H622]] him of his leprosy. [[H6883]]

### 7
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] had read [[H7121]] the letter, [[H5612]] that he rent [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] God, [[H430]] to kill [[H4191]] and to make alive, [[H2421]] that [[H3588]] this man [[H2088]] doth send [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] me to recover [[H622]] a man [[H376]] of his leprosy? [[H6883]] wherefore [[H389]] consider, [[H3045]] I pray you, [[H4994]] and see [[H7200]] how [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] seeketh a quarrel [[H579]] against me. [[H579]]

### 8
And it was [[H1961]] when Elisha [[H477]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] had rent [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] that he sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] hast thou rent [[H7167]] thy clothes? [[H899]] let him come [[H935]] now [[H4994]] to [[H413]] me, and he shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a prophet [[H5030]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 9
So Naaman [[H5283]] came [[H935]] with his horses [[H5483]] and with his chariot, [[H7393]] and stood [[H5975]] at the door [[H6607]] of the house [[H1004]] of Elisha. [[H477]]

### 10
And Elisha [[H477]] sent [[H7971]] a messenger [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and wash [[H7364]] in Jordan [[H3383]] seven [[H7651]] times, [[H6471]] and thy flesh [[H1320]] shall come again [[H7725]] to thee, and thou shalt be clean. [[H2891]]

### 11
But Naaman [[H5283]] was wroth, [[H7107]] and went away, [[H1980]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I thought, [[H559]] He will surely [[H3318]] come out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] me, and stand, [[H5975]] and call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] and strike [[H5130]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H413]] the place, [[H4725]] and recover [[H622]] the leper. [[H6879]]

### 12
not [[H3808]] Abana [[H71]] and Pharpar, [[H6554]] rivers [[H5104]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] better [[H2896]] than all [[H3605]] the waters [[H4325]] of Israel? [[H3478]] may I not [[H3808]] wash [[H7364]] in them, and be clean? [[H2891]] So he turned [[H6437]] and went away [[H1980]] in a rage. [[H2534]]

### 13
And his servants [[H5650]] came near, [[H5066]] and spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, and said, [[H559]] My father, [[H1]] the prophet [[H5030]] had bid [[H1696]] thee great [[H1419]] thing, [[H1697]] wouldest thou not [[H3808]] have done [[H6213]] how much rather then, [[H637]] when [[H3588]] he saith [[H559]] to [[H413]] thee, Wash, [[H7364]] and be clean? [[H2891]]

### 14
Then went he down, [[H3381]] and dipped [[H2881]] himself seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] in Jordan, [[H3383]] according to the saying [[H1697]] of the man [[H376]] of God: [[H430]] and his flesh [[H1320]] came again [[H7725]] like unto the flesh [[H1320]] of a little [[H6996]] child, [[H5288]] and he was clean. [[H2891]]

### 15
And he returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] his company, [[H4264]] and came, [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him: and he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] now [[H4994]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] no [[H369]] God [[H430]] in all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] but [[H3588]] in Israel: [[H3478]] now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] take [[H3947]] a blessing [[H1293]] of [[H853]] thy servant. [[H5650]]

### 16
But he said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] I stand, [[H5975]] I will receive [[H3947]] none. And he urged [[H6484]] him to take [[H3947]] but he refused. [[H3985]]

### 17
And Naaman [[H5283]] said, [[H559]] Shall there not [[H3808]] then, I pray thee, [[H4994]] be given [[H5414]] to thy servant [[H5650]] two [[H6776]] mules' [[H6505]] burden [[H4853]] of earth? [[H127]] for [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] will henceforth [[H5750]] offer [[H6213]] neither [[H3808]] burnt offering [[H5930]] nor sacrifice [[H2077]] unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] but [[H3588]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
In this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] the Lord [[H3068]] pardon [[H5545]] thy servant, [[H5650]] when my master [[H113]] goeth [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of Rimmon [[H7417]] to worship [[H7812]] there, [[H8033]] and he [[H1931]] leaneth [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] my hand, [[H3027]] and I bow myself [[H7812]] in the house [[H1004]] of Rimmon: [[H7417]] when I bow down myself [[H7812]] in the house [[H1004]] of Rimmon, [[H7417]] the Lord [[H3068]] pardon [[H5545]] thy servant [[H5650]] in this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 19
And he said [[H559]] unto him, Go [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]] So he departed [[H1980]] from [[H853]] him a little [[H3530]] way. [[H776]]

### 20
But Gehazi, [[H1522]] the servant [[H5288]] of Elisha [[H477]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] my master [[H113]] hath spared [[H2820]] Naaman [[H5283]] this [[H2088]] Syrian, [[H761]] in not receiving [[H3947]] at his hands [[H3027]] that which [[H834]] he brought: [[H935]] but, [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] I will run [[H7323]] after [[H310]] him, and take [[H3947]] somewhat [[H3972]] of [[H853]] him. [[H853]]

### 21
So Gehazi [[H1522]] followed [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Naaman. [[H5283]] And when Naaman [[H5283]] saw [[H7200]] running [[H7323]] after [[H310]] him, he lighted down [[H5307]] from [[H5921]] the chariot [[H4818]] to meet [[H7125]] him, and said, [[H559]] all well? [[H7965]]

### 22
And he said, [[H559]] All well. [[H7965]] My master [[H113]] hath sent [[H7971]] me, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] even now [[H6258]] there be come [[H935]] to [[H413]] me from mount [[H2022]] Ephraim [[H669]] two [[H8147]] young men [[H5288]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets: [[H5030]] give [[H5414]] them, I pray thee, [[H4994]] a talent [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] and two [[H8147]] changes [[H2487]] of garments. [[H899]]

### 23
And Naaman [[H5283]] said, [[H559]] Be content, [[H2974]] take [[H3947]] two talents. [[H3603]] And he urged [[H6555]] him, and bound [[H6887]] two talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] in two [[H8147]] bags, [[H2754]] with two [[H8147]] changes [[H2487]] of garments, [[H899]] and laid [[H5414]] upon [[H413]] two [[H8147]] of his servants; [[H5288]] and they bare [[H5375]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 24
And when he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the tower, [[H6076]] he took [[H3947]] from their hand, [[H3027]] and bestowed [[H6485]] in the house: [[H1004]]  and he let [[H853]] the men [[H582]] go, [[H7971]] and they departed. [[H1980]]

### 25
But he [[H1931]] went in, [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H413]] his master. [[H113]] And Elisha [[H477]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Whence [[H370]] Gehazi? [[H1522]] And he said, [[H559]] Thy servant [[H5650]] went [[H1980]] no [[H3808]] whither. [[H575]]

### 26
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Went [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] mine heart [[H3820]] when [[H834]] the man [[H376]] turned again [[H2015]] from [[H5921]] his chariot [[H4818]] to meet [[H7125]] thee? a time [[H6256]] to receive [[H3947]] money, [[H3701]] and to receive [[H3947]] garments, [[H899]] and oliveyards, [[H2132]] and vineyards, [[H3754]] and sheep, [[H6629]] and oxen, [[H1241]] and menservants, [[H5650]] and maidservants? [[H8198]]

### 27
The leprosy [[H6883]] therefore of Naaman [[H5283]] shall cleave [[H1692]] unto thee, and unto thy seed [[H2233]] for ever. [[H5769]] And he went out [[H3318]] from his presence [[H6440]] a leper [[H6879]] as snow. [[H7950]]
