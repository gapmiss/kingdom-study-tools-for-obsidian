### 1
Manasseh [[H4519]] twelve [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and reigned [[H4427]] fifty [[H2572]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Hephzibah. [[H2657]]

### 2
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] after the abominations [[H8441]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] cast out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
For he built up [[H1129]] again [[H7725]] the high places [[H1116]] which [[H834]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] his father [[H1]] had destroyed; [[H6]] and he reared up [[H6965]] altars [[H4196]] for Baal, [[H1168]] and made [[H6213]] a grove, [[H842]] as [[H834]] did [[H6213]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and worshipped [[H7812]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and served [[H5647]] them. [[H5647]]

### 4
And he built [[H1129]] altars [[H4196]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] of which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] In Jerusalem [[H3389]] will I put [[H7760]] my name. [[H8034]]

### 5
And he built [[H1129]] altars [[H4196]] for all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] in the two [[H8147]] courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And he made [[H853]] his son [[H1121]] pass through [[H5674]] the fire, [[H784]] and observed times, [[H6049]] and used enchantments, [[H5172]] and dealt [[H6213]] with familiar spirits [[H178]] and wizards: [[H3049]] he wrought [[H6213]] much [[H7235]] wickedness [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to provoke to anger. [[H3707]]

### 7
And he set [[H7760]] a graven image [[H6459]] of the grove [[H842]] that [[H834]] he had made [[H6213]] in the house, [[H1004]] of which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and to [[H413]] Solomon [[H8010]] his son, [[H1121]] In this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] I have chosen [[H977]] out of all [[H3605]] tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] will I put [[H7760]] my name [[H8034]] for ever: [[H5769]]

### 8
Neither [[H3808]] will I make the feet [[H7272]] of Israel [[H3478]] move [[H5110]] any more [[H3254]] out of [[H4480]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] their fathers; [[H1]] only [[H7535]] if [[H518]] they will observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] them, and according to all [[H3605]] the law [[H8451]] that [[H834]] my servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] them. [[H6680]]

### 9
But they hearkened [[H8085]] not: [[H3808]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] seduced [[H8582]] them to do [[H6213]] more evil [[H7451]] than [[H4480]] did the nations [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] destroyed [[H8045]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] his servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]]

### 11
Because [[H3282]] Manasseh [[H4519]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] hath done [[H6213]] these [[H428]] abominations, [[H8441]] hath done wickedly [[H7489]] above all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Amorites [[H567]] did, [[H6213]] which [[H834]] before [[H6440]]  him, and hath made [[H853]] Judah [[H3063]] also [[H1571]] to sin [[H2398]] with his idols: [[H1544]]

### 12
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I bringing [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah, [[H3063]] that [[H834]] whosoever [[H3605]] heareth [[H8085]] of it, both [[H8147]] his ears [[H241]] shall tingle. [[H6750]]

### 13
And I will stretch [[H5186]] over [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] the line [[H6957]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] and the plummet [[H4949]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab: [[H256]] and I will wipe [[H4229]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] as [[H834]] wipeth [[H4229]] a dish, [[H6747]] wiping [[H4229]] and turning [[H2015]] upside down. [[H6440]]

### 14
And I will forsake [[H5203]] the remnant [[H7611]] of mine inheritance, [[H5159]] and deliver [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies; [[H341]] and they shall become [[H1961]] a prey [[H957]] and a spoil [[H4933]] to all [[H3605]] their enemies; [[H341]]

### 15
Because [[H3282]] they have done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in my sight, [[H5869]] and have [[H1961]] provoked me to anger, [[H3707]] since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] their fathers [[H1]] came forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] even unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 16
Moreover [[H1571]] Manasseh [[H4519]] shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] very [[H3966]] much, [[H7235]] till [[H5704]] he had filled [[H4390]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] from one end [[H6310]] to another; [[H6310]] beside his sin [[H2403]] wherewith [[H834]] he made Judah [[H3063]] to sin, [[H2398]] in doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and his sin [[H2403]] that [[H834]] he sinned, [[H2398]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 18
And Manasseh [[H4519]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the garden [[H1588]] of his own house, [[H1004]] in the garden [[H1588]] of Uzza: [[H5798]] and Amon [[H526]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 19
Amon [[H526]] twenty [[H6242]] and two [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] two [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Meshullemeth, [[H4922]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Haruz [[H2743]] of [[H4480]] Jotbah. [[H3192]]

### 20
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Manasseh [[H4519]] did. [[H6213]]

### 21
And he walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] walked in, [[H1980]] and served [[H5647]] the idols [[H1544]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] served, [[H5647]] and worshipped [[H7812]] them: [[H7812]]

### 22
And he forsook [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of his fathers, [[H1]] and walked [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] in the way [[H1870]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
And the servants [[H5650]] of Amon [[H526]] conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] him, and slew [[H4191]] the king [[H4428]] in his own house. [[H1004]]

### 24
And the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] slew [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] them that had conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] king [[H4428]] Amon; [[H526]] and the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]]  made [[H853]] Josiah [[H2977]] his son [[H1121]] king [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 25
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Amon [[H526]] which [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 26
And he was buried [[H6912]] in his sepulchre [[H6900]] in the garden [[H1588]] of Uzza: [[H5798]] and Josiah [[H2977]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
