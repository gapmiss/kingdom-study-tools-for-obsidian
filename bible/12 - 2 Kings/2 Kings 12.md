### 1
In the seventh [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of Jehu [[H3058]] Jehoash [[H3060]] began to reign; [[H4427]] and forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] reigned [[H4427]] he in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Zibiah [[H6645]] of Beer-sheba. [[H884]]

### 2
And Jehoash [[H3060]] did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] his days [[H3117]] wherein [[H834]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] instructed [[H3384]] him. [[H3384]]

### 3
But [[H7535]] the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] taken away: [[H5493]] the people [[H5971]] still [[H5750]] sacrificed [[H2076]] and burnt incense [[H6999]] in the high places. [[H1116]]

### 4
And Jehoash [[H3060]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the priests, [[H3548]] All [[H3605]] the money [[H3701]] of the dedicated things [[H6944]] that [[H834]] is brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the money [[H3701]] of every one [[H376]] that passeth [[H5674]] the money [[H3701]] that every man [[H5315]] is set at, [[H6187]] all [[H3605]] the money [[H3701]] that [[H834]] cometh [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] any man's [[H376]] heart [[H3820]] to bring [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 5
Let the priests [[H3548]] take [[H3947]] to them, every man [[H376]] of [[H853]] his acquaintance: [[H4378]] and let them [[H1992]] repair [[H2388]] the breaches [[H919]] of the house, [[H1004]] wheresoever [[H3605]] any breach [[H919]] shall be found. [[H4672]]

### 6
But it was [[H1961]] in the three [[H7969]] and twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Jehoash [[H3060]] the priests [[H3548]] had not [[H3808]] repaired [[H2388]] the breaches [[H919]] of the house. [[H1004]]

### 7
Then king [[H4428]] Jehoash [[H3060]] called [[H7121]] for Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest, [[H3548]] and the priests, [[H3548]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Why [[H4069]] repair [[H2388]] ye not [[H369]] the breaches [[H919]] of the house? [[H1004]] now [[H6258]] therefore receive [[H3947]] no [[H408]] money [[H3701]] of [[H853]] your acquaintance, [[H4378]] but [[H3588]] deliver [[H5414]] it for the breaches [[H919]] of the house. [[H1004]]

### 8
And the priests [[H3548]] consented [[H225]] to receive [[H3947]] no [[H1115]] money [[H3701]] of [[H853]] the people, [[H5971]] neither [[H1115]] to repair [[H2388]] the breaches [[H919]] of the house. [[H1004]]

### 9
But Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] took [[H3947]] a [[H259]] chest, [[H727]] and bored [[H5344]] a hole [[H2356]] in the lid [[H1817]] of it, and set [[H5414]] it beside [[H681]] the altar, [[H4196]] on the right side [[H3225]] as one [[H376]] cometh [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and the priests [[H3548]] that kept [[H8104]] the door [[H5592]] put [[H5414]] therein [[H8033]] all [[H3605]] the money [[H3701]] brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
And it was [[H1961]] when they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] much [[H7227]] money [[H3701]] in the chest, [[H727]] that the king's [[H4428]] scribe [[H5608]] and the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] came up, [[H5927]] and they put up in bags, [[H6696]] and told [[H4487]] the money [[H3701]] that was found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
And they gave [[H5414]] the money, [[H3701]] being told, [[H8505]] into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of them that did [[H6213]] the work, [[H4399]] that had the oversight [[H6485]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and they laid it out [[H3318]] to the carpenters [[H2796]] and builders, [[H1129]] that wrought [[H6213]] upon the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 12
And to masons, [[H1443]] and hewers [[H2672]] of stone, [[H68]] and to buy [[H7069]] timber [[H6086]] and hewed [[H4274]] stone [[H68]] to repair [[H2388]] the breaches [[H919]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and for all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was laid out [[H3318]] for [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] to repair [[H2394]]

### 13
Howbeit [[H389]] there were not [[H3808]] made [[H6213]] for the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] bowls [[H5592]] of silver, [[H3701]] snuffers, [[H4212]] basons, [[H4219]] trumpets, [[H2689]] any [[H3605]] vessels [[H3627]] of gold, [[H2091]] or vessels [[H3627]] of silver, [[H3701]] of [[H4480]] the money [[H3701]] brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 14
But [[H3588]] they gave [[H5414]] that to the workmen, [[H4399]] and repaired [[H2388]]  therewith [[H853]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
Moreover they reckoned [[H2803]] not [[H3808]] with [[H854]] the men, [[H582]] into [[H5921]] whose [[H834]] hand [[H3027]] they delivered [[H5414]] the money [[H3701]] to be bestowed [[H5414]] on workmen: [[H4399]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] dealt [[H6213]] faithfully. [[H530]]

### 16
The trespass [[H817]] money [[H3701]] and sin [[H2403]] money [[H3701]] was not [[H3808]] brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] it was [[H1961]] the priests'. [[H3548]]

### 17
Then [[H227]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] went up, [[H5927]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] Gath, [[H1661]] and took [[H3920]] it: and Hazael [[H2371]] set [[H7760]] his face [[H6440]] to go up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 18
And Jehoash [[H3060]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the hallowed things [[H6944]] that [[H834]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] and Jehoram, [[H3088]] and Ahaziah, [[H274]] his fathers, [[H1]] kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] had dedicated, [[H6942]] and his own hallowed things, [[H6944]] and all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] found [[H4672]] in the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and in the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and sent [[H7971]] to Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria: [[H758]] and he went away [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 19
And the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Joash, [[H3101]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 20
And his servants [[H5650]] arose, [[H6965]] and made [[H7194]] a conspiracy, [[H7195]] and slew [[H5221]] Joash [[H3101]] in the house [[H1004]] of Millo, [[H4407]] which goeth down [[H3381]] to Silla. [[H5538]]

### 21
For Jozachar [[H3108]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimeath, [[H8100]] and Jehozabad [[H3075]] the son [[H1121]] of Shomer, [[H7763]] his servants, [[H5650]] smote [[H5221]] him, and he died; [[H4191]] and they buried [[H6912]] him with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David: [[H1732]] and Amaziah [[H558]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead.
