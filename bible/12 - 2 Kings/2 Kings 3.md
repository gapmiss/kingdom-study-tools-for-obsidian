### 1
Now Jehoram [[H3088]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] began to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Samaria [[H8111]] the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and reigned [[H4427]] twelve [[H8147]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And he wrought [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] but [[H7535]] not [[H3808]] like his father, [[H1]] and like his mother: [[H517]] for he put away [[H5493]] the image [[H4676]] of Baal [[H1168]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] had made. [[H6213]]

### 3
Nevertheless [[H7535]] he cleaved [[H1692]] unto the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] which [[H834]]  made [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] to sin; [[H2398]] he departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] therefrom. [[H4480]]

### 4
And Mesha [[H4338]] king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] was [[H1961]] a sheepmaster, [[H5349]] and rendered [[H7725]] unto the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] an hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] lambs, [[H3733]] and an hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] rams, [[H352]] with the wool. [[H6785]]

### 5
But it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Ahab [[H256]] was dead, [[H4194]] that the king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] rebelled [[H6586]] against the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
And king [[H4428]] Jehoram [[H3088]] went out [[H3318]] of Samaria [[H8111]] the same [[H1931]] time, [[H3117]] and numbered [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And he went [[H1980]] and sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] The king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] hath rebelled [[H6586]] against me: wilt thou go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] me against [[H413]] Moab [[H4124]] to battle? [[H4421]] And he said, [[H559]] I will go up: [[H5927]] I as thou my people [[H5971]] as thy people, [[H5971]] my horses [[H5483]] as thy horses. [[H5483]]

### 8
And he said, [[H559]] Which [[H335]] way [[H1870]] shall we go up? [[H5927]] And he answered, [[H559]] The way [[H1870]] through the wilderness [[H4057]] of Edom. [[H123]]

### 9
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went, [[H1980]] and the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the king [[H4428]] of Edom: [[H123]] and they fetched a compass [[H5437]] of seven [[H7651]] days' [[H3117]] journey: [[H1870]] and there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] water [[H4325]] for the host, [[H4264]] and for the cattle [[H929]] that [[H834]] followed [[H7272]] them. [[H7272]]

### 10
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] Alas! [[H162]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath called together, [[H7121]] these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] kings [[H4428]] to deliver [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Moab! [[H4124]]

### 11
But Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said, [[H559]] not [[H369]] here [[H6311]] a prophet [[H5030]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that we may inquire [[H1875]]  of [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H854]] him? And one [[H259]] of the king [[H4428]] of Israel's [[H3478]] servants [[H5650]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Here [[H6311]] Elisha [[H477]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphat, [[H8202]] which [[H834]] poured [[H3332]] water [[H4325]] on [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of Elijah. [[H452]]

### 12
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said, [[H559]] The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is [[H3426]] with [[H854]] him. So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] and the king [[H4428]] of Edom [[H123]] went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 13
And Elisha [[H477]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] What [[H4100]] have I to do with thee? get [[H1980]] thee to [[H413]] the prophets [[H5030]] of thy father, [[H1]] and to [[H413]] the prophets [[H5030]] of thy mother. [[H517]] And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto him, Nay: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath called together, [[H7121]] these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] kings [[H4428]] to deliver [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 14
And Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] liveth, [[H2416]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] I stand, [[H5975]] surely, [[H3588]] were it not that [[H3884]] I [[H589]] regard [[H5375]] the presence [[H6440]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] I would not look [[H5027]] toward [[H413]] thee, nor [[H518]] see [[H7200]] thee. [[H7200]]

### 15
But now [[H6258]] bring [[H3947]] me a minstrel. [[H5059]] And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the minstrel [[H5059]] played, [[H5059]] that the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 16
And he said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Make [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] valley [[H5158]] full of ditches. [[H1356]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] wind, [[H7307]] neither [[H3808]] shall ye see [[H7200]] rain; [[H1653]] yet that [[H1931]] valley [[H5158]] shall be filled [[H4390]] with water, [[H4325]] that ye may drink, [[H8354]] both ye, [[H859]] and your cattle, [[H4735]] and your beasts. [[H929]]

### 18
And this [[H2063]] is a light thing [[H7043]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] he will deliver [[H5414]] the Moabites [[H4124]] also into your hand. [[H3027]]

### 19
And ye shall smite [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] fenced [[H4013]] city, [[H5892]] and every [[H3605]] choice [[H4004]] city, [[H5892]] and shall fell [[H5307]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] tree, [[H6086]] and stop [[H5640]] all [[H3605]] wells [[H4599]] of water, [[H4325]] and mar [[H3510]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] piece [[H2513]] of land with stones. [[H68]]

### 20
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the morning, [[H1242]] when the meat offering [[H4503]] was offered, [[H5927]] that, behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H935]] water [[H4325]] by the way [[H1870]] of Edom, [[H123]] and the country [[H776]] was filled [[H4390]] with [[H854]] water. [[H4325]]

### 21
And when all [[H3605]] the Moabites [[H4124]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the kings [[H4428]] were come up [[H5927]] to fight [[H3898]] against them, they gathered all [[H6817]] that were able to put on [[H2296]] armour, [[H2290]] and upward, [[H4605]] and stood [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] the border. [[H1366]]

### 22
And they rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and the sun [[H8121]] shone [[H2224]] upon [[H5921]] the water, [[H4325]] and the Moabites [[H4124]] saw [[H7200]] the water [[H4325]] on the other side [[H5048]] red [[H122]] as blood: [[H1818]]

### 23
And they said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] blood: [[H1818]] the kings [[H4428]] are surely [[H2717]] slain, [[H2717]] and they have smitten [[H5221]] one [[H376]] another: [[H7453]] now [[H6258]] therefore, Moab, [[H4124]] to the spoil. [[H7998]]

### 24
And when they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the Israelites [[H3478]] rose up [[H6965]] and smote [[H5221]] the Moabites, [[H4124]] so that they fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] them: but they went forward [[H5221]] smiting [[H5221]] the Moabites, [[H4124]] even in country. [[H4124]]

### 25
And they beat down [[H2040]] the cities, [[H5892]] and on every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] piece [[H2513]] of land cast [[H7993]] every man [[H376]] his stone, [[H68]] and filled [[H4390]] it; and they stopped [[H5640]] all [[H3605]] the wells [[H4599]] of water, [[H4325]] and felled [[H5307]] all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] trees: [[H6086]] only [[H5704]] in Kir-haraseth [[H7025]] left [[H7604]] they the stones [[H68]] thereof; howbeit the slingers [[H7051]] went about [[H5437]] and smote [[H5221]] it. [[H5221]]

### 26
And when the king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the battle [[H4421]] was too sore [[H2388]] for [[H4480]] him, he took [[H3947]] with [[H854]] him seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] swords, [[H2719]] to break through [[H1234]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Edom: [[H123]] but they could [[H3201]] not. [[H3808]]

### 27
Then he took [[H3947]] his eldest [[H1060]] son [[H1121]] that [[H834]] should have reigned [[H4427]] in his stead, [[H8478]] and offered [[H5927]] him a burnt offering [[H5930]] upon [[H5921]] the wall. [[H2346]] And there was [[H1961]] great [[H1419]] indignation [[H7110]] against [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] and they departed [[H5265]] from [[H5921]] him, and returned [[H7725]] to land. [[H776]]
