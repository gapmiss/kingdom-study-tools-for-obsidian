### 5
And let them deliver [[H5414]] it into [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of the doers [[H6213]] of the work, [[H4399]] that have the oversight [[H6485]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and let them give [[H5414]] it to the doers [[H6213]] of the work [[H4399]] which [[H834]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to repair [[H2388]] the breaches [[H919]] of the house, [[H1004]]

Howbeit [[H389]] there was no [[H3808]] reckoning made [[H2803]] with [[H854]] them of the money [[H3701]] that was delivered [[H5414]] into [[H5921]] their hand, [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] dealt [[H6213]] faithfully. [[H530]]

### 8
And Hilkiah [[H2518]] the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] said [[H559]] unto [[H5921]] Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] I have found [[H4672]] the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And Hilkiah [[H2518]] gave [[H5414]] the book [[H5612]] to [[H413]] Shaphan, [[H8227]] and he read [[H7121]] it. [[H7121]]

### 9
And Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe [[H5608]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and brought [[H7725]] the king [[H4428]] word [[H1697]]  again, [[H853]] and said, [[H559]] Thy servants [[H5650]] have gathered [[H5413]] the money [[H3701]] that was found [[H4672]] in the house, [[H1004]] and have delivered [[H5414]] it into [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of them that do [[H6213]] the work, [[H4399]] that have the oversight [[H6485]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
And Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe [[H5608]] shewed [[H5046]] the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest [[H3548]] hath delivered [[H5414]] me a book. [[H5612]] And Shaphan [[H8227]] read [[H7121]] it before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the king [[H4428]] had heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the book [[H5612]] of the law, [[H8451]] that he rent [[H7167]] his clothes. [[H899]]

### 12
And the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Ahikam [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] and Achbor [[H5907]] the son [[H1121]] of Michaiah, [[H4320]] and Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Asahiah [[H6222]] a servant [[H5650]] of the king's, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]]

### 13
Go [[H1980]] ye, inquire [[H1875]]  of [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] for [[H1157]] me, and for [[H1157]] the people, [[H5971]] and for [[H1157]] all [[H3605]] Judah, [[H3063]] concerning [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] that is found: [[H4672]] for [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] the wrath [[H2534]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] is kindled [[H3341]] against us, because [[H5921]] our fathers [[H1]] have not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2088]] book, [[H5612]] to do [[H6213]] according unto all [[H3605]] that which is written [[H3789]] concerning [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 14
So Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Ahikam, [[H296]] and Achbor, [[H5907]] and Shaphan, [[H8227]] and Asahiah, [[H6222]] went [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] Huldah [[H2468]] the prophetess, [[H5031]] the wife [[H802]] of Shallum [[H7967]] the son [[H1121]] of Tikvah, [[H8616]] the son [[H1121]] of Harhas, [[H2745]] keeper [[H8104]] of the wardrobe; [[H899]] (now she [[H1931]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the college;) [[H4932]] and they communed [[H1696]] with [[H413]] her. [[H413]]

### 15
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Tell [[H559]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] sent [[H7971]] you to [[H413]] me, [[H413]]

### 16
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and upon [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]]  thereof, [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the book [[H5612]] which [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] hath read: [[H7121]]

### 17
Because [[H8478]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and have burned incense [[H6999]] unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] that [[H4616]] they might provoke me to anger [[H3707]] with all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] of their hands; [[H3027]] therefore my wrath [[H2534]] shall be kindled [[H3341]] against this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and shall not [[H3808]] be quenched. [[H3518]]

### 18
But to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] which sent [[H7971]] you to inquire [[H1875]]  of [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] to [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thou hast heard; [[H8085]]

### 19
Because [[H3282]] thine heart [[H3824]] was tender, [[H7401]] and thou hast humbled thyself [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when thou heardest [[H8085]] what [[H834]] I spake [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and against [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof, that they should become [[H1961]] a desolation [[H8047]] and a curse, [[H7045]] and hast rent [[H7167]] thy clothes, [[H899]] and wept [[H1058]] before [[H6440]] me; I [[H595]] also [[H1571]] have heard [[H8085]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
Behold [[H2005]] therefore, [[H3651]] I will gather [[H622]] thee unto [[H5921]] thy fathers, [[H1]] and thou shalt be gathered [[H622]] into [[H413]] thy grave [[H6913]] in peace; [[H7965]] and thine eyes [[H5869]] shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] will bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]] And they brought [[H7725]] the king [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] again. [[H1697]]
