### 1
Now there cried [[H6817]] a certain [[H259]] woman [[H802]] of the wives [[H802]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] unto [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] saying, [[H559]] Thy servant [[H5650]] my husband [[H376]] is dead; [[H4191]] and thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] did [[H1961]] fear [[H3372]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and the creditor [[H5383]] is come [[H935]] to take [[H3947]]  unto him [[H853]] my two [[H8147]] sons [[H3206]] to be bondmen. [[H5650]]

### 2
And Elisha [[H477]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, What [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] for thee? tell [[H5046]] me, what [[H4100]] hast [[H3426]] thou in the house? [[H1004]] And she said, [[H559]] Thine handmaid [[H8198]] hath not [[H369]] any thing [[H3605]] in the house, [[H1004]] save [[H3588]] a pot [[H610]] of oil. [[H8081]]

### 3
Then he said, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] borrow [[H7592]] thee vessels [[H3627]] abroad [[H2351]] of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] thy neighbours, [[H7934]] empty [[H7386]] vessels; [[H3627]] borrow not a few. [[H4591]]

### 4
And when thou art come in, [[H935]] thou shalt shut [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] upon [[H1157]] thee and upon [[H1157]] thy sons, [[H1121]] and shalt pour out [[H3332]] into [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] vessels, [[H3627]] and thou shalt set aside [[H5265]] that which is full. [[H4392]]

### 5
So she went [[H1980]] from [[H853]] him, and shut [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] upon [[H1157]] her and upon [[H1157]] her sons, [[H1121]] who [[H1992]] brought [[H5066]] to [[H413]] her; and she [[H1931]] poured out. [[H3332]]

### 6
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the vessels [[H3627]] were full, [[H4390]] that she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her son, [[H1121]] Bring [[H5066]] me yet [[H5750]] a vessel. [[H3627]] And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, not [[H369]] a vessel [[H3627]] more. [[H5750]] And the oil [[H8081]] stayed. [[H5975]]

### 7
Then she came [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] And he said, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] sell [[H4376]] the oil, [[H8081]] and pay [[H7999]] thy debt, [[H5386]] and live [[H2421]] thou [[H859]] and thy children [[H1121]] of the rest. [[H3498]]

### 8
And it fell [[H1961]] on a day, [[H3117]] that Elisha [[H477]] passed [[H5674]] to [[H413]] Shunem, [[H7766]] where [[H8033]] a great [[H1419]] woman; [[H802]] and she constrained [[H2388]] him to eat [[H398]] bread. [[H3899]] And it was, [[H1961]] as oft [[H1767]] as he passed by, [[H5674]] he turned in [[H5493]] thither [[H8033]] to eat [[H398]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 9
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her husband, [[H376]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I perceive [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] an holy [[H6918]] man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] which passeth by [[H5674]] us continually. [[H8548]]

### 10
Let us make [[H6213]] a little [[H6996]] chamber, [[H5944]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] on the wall; [[H7023]] and let us set [[H7760]] for him there [[H8033]] a bed, [[H4296]] and a table, [[H7979]] and a stool, [[H3678]] and a candlestick: [[H4501]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] when he cometh [[H935]] to [[H413]] us, that he shall turn in [[H5493]] thither. [[H8033]]

### 11
And it fell [[H1961]] on a day, [[H3117]] that he came [[H935]] thither, [[H8033]] and he turned [[H5493]] into [[H413]] the chamber, [[H5944]] and lay [[H7901]] there. [[H8033]]

### 12
And he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Gehazi [[H1522]] his servant, [[H5288]] Call [[H7121]] this [[H2063]] Shunammite. [[H7767]] And when he had called [[H7121]] her, she stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 13
And he said [[H559]] unto him, Say [[H559]] now [[H4994]] unto [[H413]] her, Behold, [[H2009]] thou hast been careful [[H2729]] for [[H413]] us with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] care; [[H2731]] what [[H4100]] to be done [[H6213]] for thee? wouldest [[H3426]] thou be spoken [[H1696]] for to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] or [[H176]] to [[H413]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host? [[H6635]] And she answered, [[H559]] I [[H595]] dwell [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] mine own people. [[H5971]]

### 14
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] then to be done [[H6213]] for her? And Gehazi [[H1522]] answered, [[H559]] Verily [[H61]] she hath no [[H369]] child, [[H1121]] and her husband [[H376]] is old. [[H2204]]

### 15
And he said, [[H559]] Call [[H7121]] her. And when he had called [[H7121]] her, she stood [[H5975]] in the door. [[H6607]]

### 16
And he said, [[H559]] About this [[H2088]] season, [[H4150]] according to the time [[H6256]] of life, [[H2416]] thou [[H859]] shalt embrace [[H2263]] a son. [[H1121]] And she said, [[H559]] Nay, [[H408]] my lord, [[H113]] man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] do not lie [[H3576]] unto thine handmaid. [[H8198]]

### 17
And the woman [[H802]] conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] at that [[H2088]] season [[H4150]] that [[H834]] Elisha [[H477]] had said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] her, according to the time [[H6256]] of life. [[H2416]]

### 18
And when the child [[H3206]] was grown, [[H1431]] it fell [[H1961]] on a day, [[H3117]] that he went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] to [[H413]] the reapers. [[H7114]]

### 19
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] My head, [[H7218]] my head. [[H7218]] And he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] a lad, [[H5288]] Carry [[H5375]] him to [[H413]] his mother. [[H517]]

### 20
And when he had taken [[H5375]] him, and brought [[H935]] him to [[H413]] his mother, [[H517]] he sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] her knees [[H1290]] till [[H5704]] noon, [[H6672]] and died. [[H4191]]

### 21
And she went up, [[H5927]] and laid [[H7901]] him on [[H5921]] the bed [[H4296]] of the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and shut [[H5462]] upon [[H1157]] him, and went out. [[H3318]]

### 22
And she called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] her husband, [[H376]] and said, [[H559]] Send [[H7971]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] the young men, [[H5288]] and one [[H259]] of the asses, [[H860]] that I may run [[H7323]] to [[H5704]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and come again. [[H7725]]

### 23
And he said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4069]] wilt thou [[H859]] go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] him to day? [[H3117]] neither [[H3808]] new moon, [[H2320]] nor [[H3808]] sabbath. [[H7676]] And she said, [[H559]] well. [[H7965]]

### 24
Then she saddled [[H2280]] an ass, [[H860]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her servant, [[H5288]] Drive, [[H5090]] and go forward; [[H1980]] slack [[H6113]] not [[H408]] riding [[H7392]] for me, except [[H3588]] I bid [[H559]] thee. [[H559]]

### 25
So she went [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] to [[H413]] mount [[H2022]] Carmel. [[H3760]] And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] saw off, [[H7200]]  her afar [[H5048]] that he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Gehazi [[H1522]] his servant, [[H5288]] Behold, [[H2009]] that [[H1975]] Shunammite: [[H7767]]

### 26
Run [[H7323]] now, [[H6258]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] to meet [[H7125]] her, and say [[H559]] unto her, well [[H7965]] with thee? well [[H7965]] with thy husband? [[H376]] well [[H7965]] with the child? [[H3206]] And she answered, [[H559]] well. [[H7965]]

### 27
And when she came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] to [[H413]] the hill, [[H2022]] she caught [[H2388]] him by the feet: [[H7272]] but Gehazi [[H1522]] came near [[H5066]] to thrust her away. [[H1920]] And the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] Let her alone; [[H7503]] for [[H3588]] her soul [[H5315]] vexed [[H4843]] within her: and the Lord [[H3068]] hath hid [[H5956]] from [[H4480]] me, and hath not [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] me. [[H5046]]

### 28
Then she said, [[H559]] Did I desire [[H7592]] a son [[H1121]] of [[H853]] my lord? [[H113]] did I not [[H3808]] say, [[H559]] Do not [[H3808]] deceive [[H7952]] me? [[H7952]]

### 29
Then he said [[H559]] to Gehazi, [[H1522]] Gird up [[H2296]] thy loins, [[H4975]] and take [[H3947]] my staff [[H4938]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] and go thy way: [[H1980]] if [[H3588]] thou meet [[H4672]] any man, [[H376]] salute [[H1288]] him not; [[H3808]] and if [[H3588]] any [[H376]] salute [[H1288]] thee, answer again: [[H6030]] him not [[H3808]] and lay [[H7760]] my staff [[H4938]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the child. [[H5288]]

### 30
And the mother [[H517]] of the child [[H5288]] said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] and thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] leave [[H5800]] thee. And he arose, [[H6965]] and followed [[H1980]] her. [[H310]]

### 31
And Gehazi [[H1522]] passed on [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] them, and laid [[H7760]] the staff [[H4938]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the child; [[H5288]] but neither [[H369]] voice, [[H6963]] nor [[H369]] hearing. [[H7182]] Wherefore he went again [[H7725]] to meet [[H7125]] him, and told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] The child [[H5288]] is not [[H3808]] awaked. [[H6974]]

### 32
And when Elisha [[H477]] was come [[H935]] into the house, [[H1004]] behold, [[H2009]] the child [[H5288]] was dead, [[H4191]] laid [[H7901]] upon [[H5921]] his bed. [[H4296]]

### 33
He went in [[H935]] therefore, and shut [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] upon [[H1157]] them twain, [[H8147]] and prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 34
And he went up, [[H5927]] and lay [[H7901]] upon [[H5921]] the child, [[H3206]] and put [[H7760]] his mouth [[H6310]] upon [[H5921]] his mouth, [[H6310]] and his eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and his hands [[H3709]] upon [[H5921]] his hands: [[H3709]] and he stretched [[H1457]] himself upon [[H5921]] the child; and the flesh [[H1320]] of the child [[H3206]] waxed warm. [[H2552]]

### 35
Then he returned, [[H7725]] and walked [[H1980]] in the house [[H1004]] to [[H259]] and fro; [[H259]] and went up, [[H5927]] and stretched [[H1457]] himself upon [[H5921]] him: and the child [[H5288]] sneezed [[H2237]] seven [[H7651]] times, [[H6471]] and the child [[H5288]] opened [[H6491]] his eyes. [[H5869]]

### 36
And he called [[H7121]] Gehazi, [[H1522]] and said, [[H559]] Call [[H7121]] this [[H2063]] Shunammite. [[H7767]] So he called [[H7121]] her. And when she was come in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] him, he said, [[H559]] Take up [[H5375]] thy son. [[H1121]]

### 37
Then she went in, [[H935]] and fell [[H5307]] at [[H5921]] his feet, [[H7272]] and bowed herself [[H7812]] to the ground, [[H776]] and took up [[H5375]] her son, [[H1121]] and went out. [[H3318]]

### 38
And Elisha [[H477]] came again [[H7725]] to Gilgal: [[H1537]] and a dearth [[H7458]] in the land; [[H776]] and the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] sitting [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] him: and he said [[H559]] unto his servant, [[H5288]] Set on [[H8239]] the great [[H1419]] pot, [[H5518]] and seethe [[H1310]] pottage [[H5138]] for the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets. [[H5030]]

### 39
And one [[H259]] went out [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the field [[H7704]] to gather [[H3950]] herbs, [[H219]] and found [[H4672]] a wild [[H7704]] vine, [[H1612]] and gathered [[H3950]] thereof [[H4480]] wild [[H7704]] gourds [[H6498]] his lap [[H899]] full, [[H4393]] and came [[H935]] and shred [[H6398]] into [[H413]] the pot [[H5518]] of pottage: [[H5138]] for [[H3588]] they knew [[H3045]] not. [[H3808]]

### 40
So they poured out [[H3332]] for the men [[H376]] to eat. [[H398]] And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as they were eating [[H398]] of the pottage, [[H5138]] that they [[H1992]] cried out, [[H6817]] and said, [[H559]] O man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] death [[H4194]] in the pot. [[H5518]] And they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]]

### 41
But he said, [[H559]] Then bring [[H3947]] meal. [[H7058]] And he cast [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the pot; [[H5518]] and he said, [[H559]] Pour out [[H3332]] for the people, [[H5971]] that they may eat. [[H398]] And there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] harm [[H1697]] in the pot. [[H5518]]

### 42
And there came [[H935]] a man [[H376]] from Baal-shalisha, [[H1190]] and brought [[H935]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] bread [[H3899]] of the firstfruits, [[H1061]] twenty [[H6242]] loaves [[H3899]] of barley, [[H8184]] and full ears of corn [[H3759]] in the husk [[H6861]] thereof. And he said, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]] unto the people, [[H5971]] that they may eat. [[H398]]

### 43
And his servitor [[H8334]] said, [[H559]] What, [[H4100]] should I set [[H5414]] this [[H2088]] before [[H6440]] an hundred [[H3967]] men? [[H376]] He said again, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]] the people, [[H5971]] that they may eat: [[H398]] for [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] They shall eat, [[H398]] and shall leave [[H3498]]

### 44
So he set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] them, and they did eat, [[H398]] and left [[H3498]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
