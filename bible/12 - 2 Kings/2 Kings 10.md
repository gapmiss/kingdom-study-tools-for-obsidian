### 1
And Ahab [[H256]] had seventy [[H7657]] sons [[H1121]] in Samaria. [[H8111]] And Jehu [[H3058]] wrote [[H3789]] letters, [[H5612]] and sent [[H7971]] to Samaria, [[H8111]] unto [[H413]] the rulers [[H8269]] of Jezreel, [[H3157]] to the elders, [[H2205]] and to [[H413]] them that brought up [[H539]] Ahab's [[H256]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Now [[H6258]] as soon as this [[H2088]] letter [[H5612]] cometh [[H935]] to [[H413]] you, seeing your master's [[H113]] sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] you, and with [[H854]] you chariots [[H7393]] and horses, [[H5483]] a fenced [[H4013]] city [[H5892]] also, and armour; [[H5402]]

### 3
Look even out [[H7200]] the best [[H2896]] and meetest [[H3477]] of your master's [[H113]] sons, [[H1121]] and set [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] his father's [[H1]] throne, [[H3678]] and fight [[H3898]] for [[H5921]] your master's [[H113]] house. [[H1004]]

### 4
But they were exceedingly [[H3966]] afraid, [[H3372]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] not [[H3808]] before [[H6440]] him: how [[H349]] then shall we [[H587]] stand? [[H5975]]

### 5
And he that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the house, [[H1004]] and he that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the city, [[H5892]] the elders [[H2205]] also, and the bringers up [[H539]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Jehu, [[H3058]] saying, [[H559]] We [[H587]] thy servants, [[H5650]] and will do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou shalt bid [[H559]] us; we will not [[H3808]] make any [[H376]] king: [[H4427]] do [[H6213]] thou good [[H2896]] in thine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 6
Then he wrote [[H3789]] a letter [[H5612]] the second time [[H8145]] to [[H413]] them, saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] ye [[H859]] mine, and ye [[H859]] will hearken [[H8085]] unto my voice, [[H6963]] take [[H3947]]  ye [[H853]] the heads [[H7218]] of the men [[H376]] your master's [[H113]] sons, [[H1121]] and come [[H935]] to [[H413]] me to Jezreel [[H3157]] by to morrow [[H4279]] this time. [[H6256]] Now the king's [[H4428]] sons, [[H1121]] seventy [[H7657]] persons, [[H376]] with [[H854]] the great men [[H1419]] of the city, [[H5892]] which brought them up. [[H1431]]

### 7
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the letter [[H5612]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] them, that they took [[H3947]] the king's [[H4428]] sons, [[H1121]] and slew [[H7819]] seventy [[H7657]] persons, [[H376]] and put [[H7760]] their heads [[H7218]] in baskets, [[H1731]] and sent [[H7971]] him to Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 8
And there came [[H935]] a messenger, [[H4397]] and told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] They have brought [[H935]] the heads [[H7218]] of the king's [[H4428]] sons. [[H1121]] And he said, [[H559]] Lay [[H7760]] ye them in two [[H8147]] heaps [[H6652]] at the entering in [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] until [[H5704]] the morning. [[H1242]]

### 9
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the morning, [[H1242]] that he went out, [[H3318]] and stood, [[H5975]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] Ye [[H859]] righteous: [[H6662]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] my master, [[H113]] and slew [[H2026]] him: but who [[H4310]] slew [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] these? [[H428]]

### 10
Know [[H3045]] now [[H645]] that [[H3588]] there shall fall [[H5307]] unto the earth [[H776]] nothing [[H3808]] of the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab: [[H256]] for the Lord [[H3068]] hath done [[H6213]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] his servant [[H5650]] Elijah. [[H452]]

### 11
So Jehu [[H3058]] slew [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] that remained [[H7604]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] in Jezreel, [[H3157]] and all [[H3605]] his great men, [[H1419]] and his kinsfolks, [[H3045]] and his priests, [[H3548]] until [[H5704]] he left [[H7604]] him none [[H1115]] remaining. [[H8300]]

### 12
And he arose [[H6965]] and departed, [[H935]] and came [[H1980]] to Samaria. [[H8111]] as he [[H1931]] at the shearing [[H7462]] house [[H1004]] in the way, [[H1870]]

### 13
Jehu [[H3058]] met [[H4672]]  with [[H853]] the brethren [[H251]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] ye? [[H859]] And they answered, [[H559]] We [[H587]] the brethren [[H251]] of Ahaziah; [[H274]] and we go down [[H3381]] to salute [[H7965]] the children [[H1121]] of the king [[H4428]] and the children [[H1121]] of the queen. [[H1377]]

### 14
And he said, [[H559]] Take [[H8610]] them alive. [[H2416]] And they took [[H8610]] them alive, [[H2416]] and slew [[H7819]] them at [[H413]] the pit [[H953]] of the shearing house, [[H1044]] two [[H8147]] and forty [[H705]] men; [[H376]] neither [[H3808]] left [[H7604]] he any [[H376]] of them. [[H376]]

### 15
And when he was departed [[H1980]] thence, [[H8033]] he lighted on [[H4672]] Jehonadab [[H3082]] the son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] to meet [[H7125]] him: and he saluted [[H1288]] him, and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] him, Is [[H3426]] thine heart [[H3824]] right, [[H3477]] as [[H834]] my heart [[H3824]] with [[H5973]] thy heart? [[H3824]] And Jehonadab [[H3082]] answered, [[H559]] It is. [[H3426]] If it be, [[H3426]] give [[H5414]] thine hand. [[H3027]] And he gave [[H5414]] his hand; [[H3027]] and he took him up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] him into [[H413]] the chariot. [[H4818]]

### 16
And he said, [[H559]] Come [[H1980]] with [[H854]] me, and see [[H7200]] my zeal [[H7068]] for the Lord. [[H3068]] So they made him ride [[H7392]] in his chariot. [[H7393]]

### 17
And when he came [[H935]] to Samaria, [[H8111]] he slew [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] that remained [[H7604]] unto Ahab [[H256]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] till [[H5704]] he had destroyed [[H8045]] him, according to the saying [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Elijah. [[H452]]

### 18
And Jehu [[H3058]] gathered together, [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Ahab [[H256]] served [[H5647]] Baal [[H1168]] a little; [[H4592]] Jehu [[H3058]] shall serve [[H5647]] him much. [[H7235]]

### 19
Now [[H6258]] therefore call [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] me all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Baal, [[H1168]] all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5647]] and all [[H3605]] his priests; [[H3548]] let none [[H376]] be wanting: [[H6485]] for [[H3588]] I have a great [[H1419]] sacrifice [[H2077]] to Baal; [[H1168]] whosoever [[H3605]] shall be wanting, [[H6485]] he shall not [[H3808]] live. [[H2421]] But Jehu [[H3058]] did [[H6213]] in subtilty, [[H6122]] to the intent [[H4616]] that he might destroy [[H6]] the worshippers [[H5647]] of Baal. [[H1168]]

### 20
And Jehu [[H3058]] said, [[H559]] Proclaim [[H6942]] a solemn assembly [[H6116]] for Baal. [[H1168]] And they proclaimed [[H7121]]

### 21
And Jehu [[H3058]] sent [[H7971]] through all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]] and all [[H3605]] the worshippers [[H5647]] of Baal [[H1168]] came, [[H935]] so that there was not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] left [[H7604]] that [[H834]] came [[H935]] not. [[H3808]] And they came [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of Baal; [[H1168]] and the house [[H1004]] of Baal [[H1168]] was full [[H4390]] from one end [[H6310]] to another. [[H6310]]

### 22
And he said [[H559]] unto him that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the vestry, [[H4458]] Bring forth [[H3318]] vestments [[H3830]] for all [[H3605]] the worshippers [[H5647]] of Baal. [[H1168]] And he brought them forth [[H3318]] vestments. [[H4403]]

### 23
And Jehu [[H3058]] went, [[H935]] and Jehonadab [[H3082]] the son [[H1121]] of Rechab, [[H7394]] into the house [[H1004]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and said [[H559]] unto the worshippers [[H5647]] of Baal, [[H1168]] Search, [[H2664]] and look [[H7200]] that [[H6435]] there be [[H3426]] here [[H6311]] with [[H5973]] you none of the servants [[H5650]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] but [[H3588]] the worshippers [[H5647]] of Baal [[H1168]] only. [[H905]]

### 24
And when they went in [[H935]] to offer [[H6213]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and burnt offerings, [[H5930]] Jehu [[H3058]] appointed [[H7760]] fourscore [[H8084]] men [[H376]] without, [[H2351]] and said, [[H559]] any [[H376]] of [[H4480]] the men [[H376]] whom [[H834]] I [[H589]] have brought [[H935]] into [[H5921]] your hands [[H3027]] escape, [[H4422]] his life [[H5315]] for [[H8478]] the life [[H5315]] of him. [[H5315]]

### 25
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as soon as he had made an end [[H3615]] of offering [[H6213]] the burnt offering, [[H5930]] that Jehu [[H3058]] said [[H559]] to the guard [[H7323]] and to the captains, [[H7991]] Go in, [[H935]] slay [[H5221]] them; let none [[H376]] come forth. [[H3318]] And they smote [[H5221]] them with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword; [[H2719]] and the guard [[H7323]] and the captains [[H7991]] cast out, [[H7993]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H5704]] the city [[H5892]] of the house [[H1004]] of Baal. [[H1168]]

### 26
And they brought forth [[H3318]] the images [[H4676]] out of the house [[H1004]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and burned [[H8313]] them. [[H8313]]

### 27
And they brake down [[H5422]] the image [[H4676]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and brake down [[H5422]] the house [[H1004]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and made [[H7760]] it a draught house [[H4163]] unto [[H5704]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 28
Thus Jehu [[H3058]] destroyed [[H8045]] Baal [[H1168]] out of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 29
Howbeit [[H7535]] the sins [[H2399]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] who [[H834]]  made [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] to sin, [[H2398]] Jehu [[H3058]] departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from after [[H310]] them, the golden [[H2091]] calves [[H5695]] that [[H834]] in Beth-el, [[H1008]] and that [[H834]] in Dan. [[H1835]]

### 30
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jehu, [[H3058]] Because [[H3282]] thou hast done well [[H2895]] in executing [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in mine eyes, [[H5869]] hast done [[H6213]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in mine heart, [[H3824]] thy children [[H1121]] of the fourth [[H7243]] shall sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 31
But Jehu [[H3058]] took no heed [[H8104]] to walk [[H1980]] in the law [[H8451]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] with all [[H3605]] his heart: [[H3824]] for he departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from [[H5921]] the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] which [[H834]]  made [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] to sin. [[H2398]]

### 32
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] began [[H2490]] to cut short: [[H7096]] Israel [[H3478]] and Hazael [[H2371]] smote [[H5221]] them in all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Israel; [[H3478]]

### 33
From [[H4480]] Jordan [[H3383]] eastward, [[H4217]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] the Gadites, [[H1425]] and the Reubenites, [[H7206]] and the Manassites, [[H4520]] from Aroer, [[H6177]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H5158]] Arnon, [[H769]] even Gilead [[H1568]] and Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 34
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehu, [[H3058]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and all [[H3605]] his might, [[H1369]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 35
And Jehu [[H3058]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers: [[H1]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in Samaria. [[H8111]] And Jehoahaz [[H3059]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 36
And the time [[H3117]] that [[H834]] Jehu [[H3058]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Samaria [[H8111]] twenty [[H6242]] and eight [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]]
