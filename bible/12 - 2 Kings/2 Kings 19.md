### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when king [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] heard [[H8085]] that he rent [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] and covered himself [[H3680]] with sackcloth, [[H8242]] and went [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
And he sent [[H7971]] Eliakim, [[H471]] which [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the household, [[H1004]] and Shebna [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and the elders [[H2205]] of the priests, [[H3548]] covered [[H3680]] with sackcloth, [[H8242]] to [[H413]] Isaiah [[H3470]] the prophet [[H5030]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz. [[H531]]

### 3
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] a day [[H3117]] of trouble, [[H6869]] and of rebuke, [[H8433]] and blasphemy: [[H5007]] for [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] are come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the birth, [[H4866]] and not [[H369]] strength [[H3581]] to bring forth. [[H3205]]

### 4
It may be [[H194]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will hear [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of Rab-shakeh, [[H7262]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] his master [[H113]] hath sent [[H7971]] to reproach [[H2778]] the living [[H2416]] God; [[H430]] and will reprove [[H3198]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath heard: [[H8085]] wherefore lift up [[H5375]] prayer [[H8605]] for [[H1157]] the remnant [[H7611]] that are left. [[H4672]]

### 5
So the servants [[H5650]] of king [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Isaiah. [[H3470]]

### 6
And Isaiah [[H3470]] said [[H559]] unto them, Thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] to [[H413]] your master, [[H113]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Be not afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thou hast heard, [[H8085]] with which [[H834]] the servants [[H5288]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] have blasphemed [[H1442]] me. [[H1442]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H5414]] a blast [[H7307]] upon him, and he shall hear [[H8085]] a rumour, [[H8052]] and shall return [[H7725]] to his own land; [[H776]] and I will cause him to fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] in his own land. [[H776]]

### 8
So Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] returned, [[H7725]] and found [[H4672]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] warring [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] Libnah: [[H3841]] for [[H3588]] he had heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] he was departed [[H5265]] from Lachish. [[H3923]]

### 9
And when he heard [[H8085]] say [[H559]] of [[H413]] Tirhakah [[H8640]] king [[H4428]] of Ethiopia, [[H3568]] Behold, [[H2009]] he is come out [[H3318]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H854]] thee: he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] saying, [[H559]]

### 10
Thus [[H3541]] shall ye speak [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] Let not [[H408]] thy God [[H430]] in whom [[H834]] thou [[H859]] trustest [[H982]] deceive [[H5377]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall not [[H3808]] be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2009]] thou [[H859]] hast heard [[H8085]] what [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] have done [[H6213]] to all [[H3605]] lands, [[H776]] by destroying them utterly: [[H2763]] and shalt thou [[H859]] be delivered? [[H5337]]

### 12
Have the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H1471]] delivered [[H5337]] them which [[H834]] my fathers [[H1]] have destroyed; [[H7843]] Gozan, [[H1470]] and Haran, [[H2771]] and Rezeph, [[H7530]] and the children [[H1121]] of Eden [[H5729]] which [[H834]] in Thelasar? [[H8515]]

### 13
Where [[H335]] the king [[H4428]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] and the king [[H4428]] of Arpad, [[H774]] and the king [[H4428]] of the city [[H5892]] of Sepharvaim, [[H5617]] of Hena, [[H2012]] and Ivah? [[H5755]]

### 14
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] received [[H3947]] the letter [[H5612]] of the hand [[H3027]] of the messengers, [[H4397]] and read [[H7121]] it: and Hezekiah [[H2396]] went up [[H5927]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and spread [[H6566]] it before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] prayed [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which dwellest [[H3427]] the cherubims, [[H3742]] thou [[H859]] art the God, [[H430]] thou alone, [[H905]] of all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth; [[H776]] thou [[H859]] hast made [[H6213]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]]

### 16
Lord, [[H3068]] bow down [[H5186]] thine ear, [[H241]] and hear: [[H8085]] open, [[H6491]] Lord, [[H3068]] thine eyes, [[H5869]] and see: [[H7200]] and hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of Sennacherib, [[H5576]] which [[H834]] hath sent [[H7971]] him to reproach [[H2778]] the living [[H2416]] God. [[H430]]

### 17
Of a truth, [[H551]] Lord, [[H3068]] the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] have destroyed [[H2717]] the nations [[H1471]]  and [[H853]] their lands, [[H776]]

### 18
And have cast [[H5414]] their gods [[H430]] into the fire: [[H784]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] no [[H3808]] gods, [[H430]] but [[H3588]] the work [[H4639]] of men's [[H120]] hands, [[H3027]] wood [[H6086]] and stone: [[H68]] therefore they have destroyed [[H6]] them. [[H6]]

### 19
Now [[H6258]] therefore, O Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] save [[H3467]] thou us out of his hand, [[H3027]] that all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth [[H776]] may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] the Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] thou only. [[H905]]

### 20
Then Isaiah [[H3470]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] thou hast prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] me against [[H413]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] I have heard. [[H8085]]

### 21
This [[H2088]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] him; The virgin [[H1330]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] hath despised [[H959]] thee, laughed thee to scorn; [[H3932]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] hath shaken [[H5128]] her head [[H7218]] at thee. [[H310]]

### 22
Whom [[H4310]] hast thou reproached [[H2778]] and blasphemed? [[H1442]] and against [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] hast thou exalted [[H7311]] voice, [[H6963]] and lifted up [[H5375]] thine eyes [[H5869]] on high? [[H4791]] against [[H5921]] the Holy [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 23
By [[H3027]] thy messengers [[H4397]] thou hast reproached [[H2778]] the Lord, [[H136]] and hast said, [[H559]] With the multitude [[H7230]] of my chariots [[H7393]] I [[H589]] am come up [[H5927]] to the height [[H4791]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] to the sides [[H3411]] of Lebanon, [[H3844]] and will cut down [[H3772]] the tall [[H6967]] cedar trees [[H730]] thereof, the choice [[H4004]] fir trees [[H1265]] thereof: and I will enter [[H935]] into the lodgings [[H4411]] of his borders, [[H7093]] the forest [[H3293]] of his Carmel. [[H3760]]

### 24
I [[H589]] have digged [[H6979]] and drunk [[H8354]] strange [[H2114]] waters, [[H4325]] and with the sole [[H3709]] of my feet [[H6471]] have I dried up [[H2717]] all [[H3605]] the rivers [[H2975]] of besieged places. [[H4693]]

### 25
Hast thou not [[H3808]] heard [[H8085]] long ago [[H7350]] I have done [[H6213]] it, of ancient [[H6924]] times [[H3117]] that I have formed [[H3335]] it? now [[H6258]] have I brought [[H935]] it to pass, that thou shouldest be [[H1961]] to lay waste [[H7582]] fenced [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] ruinous [[H5327]] heaps. [[H1530]]

### 26
Therefore their inhabitants [[H3427]] were of small [[H7116]] power, [[H3027]] they were dismayed [[H2865]] and confounded; [[H954]] they were [[H1961]] the grass [[H6212]] of the field, [[H7704]] and the green [[H3419]] herb, [[H1877]] the grass [[H2682]] on the housetops, [[H1406]] and blasted [[H7711]] before [[H6440]] it be grown up. [[H7054]]

### 27
But I know [[H3045]] thy abode, [[H3427]] and thy going out, [[H3318]] and thy coming in, [[H935]] and thy rage [[H7264]] against [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 28
Because [[H3282]] thy rage [[H7264]] against [[H413]] me and thy tumult [[H7600]] is come up [[H5927]] into mine ears, [[H241]] therefore I will put [[H7760]] my hook [[H2397]] in thy nose, [[H639]] and my bridle [[H4964]] in thy lips, [[H8193]] and I will turn thee back [[H7725]] by the way [[H1870]] by which [[H834]] thou camest. [[H935]]

### 29
And this [[H2088]] a sign [[H226]] unto thee, Ye shall eat [[H398]] this year [[H8141]] such things as grow [[H5599]] of themselves, and in the second [[H8145]] year [[H8141]] that which springeth [[H7823]] of the same; and in the third [[H7992]] year [[H8141]] sow [[H2232]] ye, and reap, [[H7114]] and plant [[H5193]] vineyards, [[H3754]] and eat [[H398]] the fruits [[H6529]] thereof. [[H6529]]

### 30
And the remnant [[H7604]] that is escaped [[H6413]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] shall yet again [[H3254]] take root [[H8328]] downward, [[H4295]] and bear [[H6213]] fruit [[H6529]] upward. [[H4605]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] out of Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall go forth [[H3318]] a remnant, [[H7611]] and they that escape [[H6413]] out of mount [[H2022]] Zion: [[H6726]] the zeal [[H7068]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall do [[H6213]] this. [[H2063]]

### 32
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] concerning [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] He shall not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] into [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] nor [[H3808]] shoot [[H3384]] an arrow [[H2671]] there, [[H8033]] nor [[H3808]] come before [[H6923]] it with shield, [[H4043]] nor [[H3808]] cast [[H8210]] a bank [[H5550]] against [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 33
By the way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] he came, [[H935]] by the same shall he return, [[H7725]] and shall not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] into [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 34
For I will defend [[H1598]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] to save [[H3467]] it, for mine own sake, [[H4616]] and for my servant [[H5650]] David's [[H1732]] sake. [[H4616]]

### 35
And it came to pass [[H1961]] that [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] that the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] went out, [[H3318]] and smote [[H5221]] in the camp [[H4264]] of the Assyrians [[H804]] an hundred [[H3967]] fourscore [[H8084]] and five [[H2568]] thousand: [[H505]] and when they arose early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] behold, [[H2009]] they all [[H3605]] dead [[H4191]] corpses. [[H6297]]

### 36
So Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] departed, [[H5265]] and went [[H1980]] and returned, [[H7725]] and dwelt [[H3427]] at Nineveh. [[H5210]]

### 37
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as he [[H1931]] was worshipping [[H7812]] in the house [[H1004]] of Nisroch [[H5268]] his god, [[H430]] that Adrammelech [[H152]] and Sharezer his sons [[H8272]] smote [[H5221]] him with the sword: [[H2719]] and they [[H1992]] escaped [[H4422]] into the land [[H776]] of Armenia. [[H780]] And Esarhaddon [[H634]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
