### 1
Then Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] ye the word [[H1697]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] To morrow [[H4279]] about this time [[H6256]] a measure [[H5429]] of fine flour [[H5560]] for a shekel, [[H8255]] and two measures [[H5429]] of barley [[H8184]] for a shekel, [[H8255]] in the gate [[H8179]] of Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 2
Then a lord [[H7991]] on [[H5921]] whose [[H834]] hand [[H3027]] the king [[H4428]] leaned [[H8172]] answered [[H6030]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] would make [[H6213]] windows [[H699]] in heaven, [[H8064]] might this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] be? [[H1961]] And he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] with thine eyes, [[H5869]] but shalt not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] thereof. [[H8033]]

### 3
And there were [[H1961]] four [[H702]] leprous [[H6879]] men [[H376]] at the entering in [[H6607]] of the gate: [[H8179]] and they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H7453]] Why [[H4100]] sit [[H3427]] we [[H587]] here [[H6311]] until [[H5704]] we die? [[H4191]]

### 4
If [[H518]] we say, [[H559]] We will enter [[H935]] into the city, [[H5892]] then the famine [[H7458]] in the city, [[H5892]] and we shall die [[H4191]] there: [[H8033]] and if [[H518]] we sit still [[H3427]] here, [[H6311]] we die [[H4191]] also. Now [[H6258]] therefore come, [[H1980]] and let us fall [[H5307]] unto [[H413]] the host [[H4264]] of the Syrians: [[H758]] if [[H518]] they save us alive, [[H2421]] we shall live; [[H2421]] and if [[H518]] they kill [[H4191]] us, we shall but die. [[H4191]]

### 5
And they rose up [[H6965]] in the twilight, [[H5399]] to go [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Syrians: [[H758]] and when they were come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the uttermost part [[H7097]] of the camp [[H4264]] of Syria, [[H758]] behold, [[H2009]] no [[H369]] man [[H376]] there. [[H8033]]

### 6
For the Lord [[H136]]  had made [[H853]] the host [[H4264]] of the Syrians [[H758]] to hear [[H8085]] a noise [[H6963]] of chariots, [[H7393]] and a noise [[H6963]] of horses, [[H5483]] the noise [[H6963]] of a great [[H1419]] host: [[H2428]] and they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H251]] Lo, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] hath hired [[H7936]] against [[H5921]]  us [[H853]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the kings [[H4428]] of the Egyptians, [[H4714]] to come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 7
Wherefore they arose [[H6965]] and fled [[H5127]] in the twilight, [[H5399]] and left [[H5800]] their tents, [[H168]] and their horses, [[H5483]] and their asses, [[H2543]] even the camp [[H4264]] as [[H834]] it [[H1931]] and fled [[H5127]] for [[H413]] their life. [[H5315]]

### 8
And when these [[H428]] lepers [[H6879]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the uttermost part [[H7097]] of the camp, [[H4264]] they went [[H935]] into [[H413]] one [[H259]] tent, [[H168]] and did eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and carried [[H5375]] thence [[H8033]] silver, [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and raiment, [[H899]] and went [[H1980]] and hid [[H2934]] and came again, [[H7725]] and entered [[H935]] into [[H413]] another [[H312]] tent, [[H168]] and carried [[H5375]] thence [[H8033]] and went [[H1980]] and hid [[H2934]]

### 9
Then they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H7453]] We [[H587]] do [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] well: [[H3651]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] a day [[H3117]] of good tidings, [[H1309]] and we [[H587]] hold our peace: [[H2814]] if we tarry [[H2442]] till [[H5704]] the morning [[H1242]] light, [[H216]] some mischief [[H5771]] will come upon [[H4672]] us: now [[H6258]] therefore come, [[H1980]] that we may go [[H935]] and tell [[H5046]] the king's [[H4428]] household. [[H1004]]

### 10
So they came [[H935]] and called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the porter [[H7778]] of the city: [[H5892]] and they told [[H5046]] them, saying, [[H559]] We came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Syrians, [[H758]] and, behold, [[H2009]] no [[H369]] man [[H376]] there, [[H8033]] neither voice [[H6963]] of man, [[H120]] but [[H3588]] horses [[H5483]] tied, [[H631]] and asses [[H2543]] tied, [[H631]] and the tents [[H168]] as [[H834]] they [[H1992]]

### 11
And he called [[H7121]] the porters; [[H7778]] and they told [[H5046]] to the king's [[H4428]] house [[H1004]] within. [[H6441]]

### 12
And the king [[H4428]] arose [[H6965]] in the night, [[H3915]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] I will now [[H4994]] shew [[H5046]]  you [[H853]] what [[H834]] the Syrians [[H758]] have done [[H6213]] to us. They know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] we [[H587]] hungry; [[H7457]] therefore are they gone out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the camp [[H4264]] to hide themselves [[H2247]] in the field, [[H7704]] saying, [[H559]] When [[H3588]] they come out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] we shall catch [[H8610]] them alive, [[H2416]] and get [[H935]] into [[H413]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 13
And one [[H259]] of his servants [[H5650]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Let take, [[H3947]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] five [[H2568]] of [[H4480]] the horses [[H5483]] that remain, [[H7604]] which [[H834]] are left [[H7604]] in the city, (behold, [[H2009]] they as all [[H3605]] the multitude [[H1995]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] are left [[H7604]] in it: behold, [[H2009]] they even as all [[H3605]] the multitude [[H1995]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] that [[H834]] are consumed:) [[H8552]] and let us send [[H7971]] and see. [[H7200]]

### 14
They took [[H3947]] therefore two [[H8147]] chariot [[H7393]] horses; [[H5483]] and the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] after [[H310]] the host [[H4264]] of the Syrians, [[H758]] saying, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and see. [[H7200]]

### 15
And they went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] them unto [[H5704]] Jordan: [[H3383]] and, lo, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] the way [[H1870]] full [[H4392]] of garments [[H899]] and vessels, [[H3627]] which [[H834]] the Syrians [[H758]] had cast away [[H7993]] in their haste. [[H2648]] And the messengers [[H4397]] returned, [[H7725]] and told [[H5046]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 16
And the people [[H5971]] went out, [[H3318]] and spoiled [[H962]] the tents [[H4264]] of the Syrians. [[H758]] So a measure [[H5429]] of fine flour [[H5560]] was [[H1961]] for a shekel, [[H8255]] and two measures [[H5429]] of barley [[H8184]] for a shekel, [[H8255]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
And the king [[H4428]] appointed [[H6485]] the lord [[H7991]] on [[H5921]] whose [[H834]] hand [[H3027]] he leaned [[H8172]] to have the charge of [[H5921]] the gate: [[H8179]] and the people [[H5971]] trode upon [[H7429]] him in the gate, [[H8179]] and he died, [[H4191]] as [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had said, [[H1696]] who [[H834]] spake [[H1696]] when the king [[H4428]] came down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 18
And it came to pass [[H1961]] as the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] Two measures [[H5429]] of barley [[H8184]] for a shekel, [[H8255]] and a measure [[H5429]] of fine flour [[H5560]] for a shekel, [[H8255]] shall be [[H1961]] to morrow [[H4279]] about this time [[H6256]] in the gate [[H8179]] of Samaria: [[H8111]]

### 19
And that lord [[H7991]] answered [[H6030]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and said, [[H559]] Now, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] should make [[H6213]] windows [[H699]] in heaven, [[H8064]] might such [[H2088]] a thing [[H1697]] be? [[H1961]] And he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] it with thine eyes, [[H5869]] but shalt not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] thereof. [[H8033]]

### 20
And so [[H3651]] it fell out [[H1961]] unto him: for the people [[H5971]] trode upon [[H7429]] him in the gate, [[H8179]] and he died. [[H4191]]
