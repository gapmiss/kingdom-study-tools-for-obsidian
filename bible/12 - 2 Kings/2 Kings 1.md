### 1
Then Moab [[H4124]] rebelled [[H6586]] against Israel [[H3478]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Ahab. [[H256]]

### 2
And Ahaziah [[H274]] fell down [[H5307]] through [[H1157]] a lattice [[H7639]] in his upper chamber [[H5944]] that [[H834]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] and was sick: [[H2470]] and he sent [[H7971]] messengers, [[H4397]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Go, [[H1980]] inquire [[H1875]] of Baal-zebub [[H1176]] the god [[H430]] of Ekron [[H6138]] whether [[H518]] I shall recover [[H2421]] of this disease. [[H2483]]

### 3
But the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite, [[H8664]] Arise, [[H6965]] go up [[H5927]] to meet [[H7125]] the messengers [[H4397]] of the king [[H4428]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] and say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, not because [[H1097]] not [[H369]] a God [[H430]] in Israel, [[H3478]] ye [[H859]] go [[H1980]] to inquire [[H1875]] of Baal-zebub [[H1176]] the god [[H430]] of Ekron? [[H6138]]

### 4
Now therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] come down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] that bed [[H4296]] on which [[H834]] thou art gone up, [[H5927]] but [[H3588]] shalt surely [[H4191]] die. [[H4191]] And Elijah [[H452]] departed. [[H1980]]

### 5
And when the messengers [[H4397]] turned back [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] him, he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Why [[H4100]] are ye now [[H2088]] turned back? [[H7725]]

### 6
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, There came up [[H5927]] a man [[H376]] to meet [[H7125]] us, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] us, Go, [[H1980]] turn again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] that [[H834]] sent [[H7971]] you, and say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] not because [[H1097]] not [[H369]] a God [[H430]] in Israel, [[H3478]] thou [[H859]] sendest [[H7971]] to inquire [[H1875]] of Baal-zebub [[H1176]] the god [[H430]] of Ekron? [[H6138]] therefore [[H3651]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] come down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] that bed [[H4296]] on which [[H834]] thou art gone up, [[H5927]] but [[H3588]] shalt surely [[H4191]] die. [[H4191]]

### 7
And he said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, What [[H4100]] manner [[H4941]] of man [[H376]] which [[H834]] came up [[H5927]] to meet [[H7125]] you, and told [[H1696]]  you [[H853]] these [[H428]] words? [[H1697]]

### 8
And they answered [[H559]] him, an hairy [[H8181]] man, [[H1167]] and girt [[H247]] with a girdle [[H232]] of leather [[H5785]] about his loins. [[H4975]] And he said, [[H559]] It [[H1931]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite. [[H8664]]

### 9
Then the king sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] him a captain [[H8269]] of fifty [[H2572]] with his fifty. [[H2572]] And he went up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] him: and, behold, [[H2009]] he sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of an hill. [[H2022]] And he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, Thou man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] the king [[H4428]] hath said, [[H1696]] Come down. [[H3381]]

### 10
And Elijah [[H452]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the captain [[H8269]] of fifty, [[H2572]] If [[H518]] I [[H589]] a man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] then let fire [[H784]] come down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and consume [[H398]] thee and thy fifty. [[H2572]] And there came down [[H3381]] fire [[H784]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and consumed [[H398]] him and his fifty. [[H2572]]

### 11
Again [[H7725]] also he sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] him another [[H312]] captain [[H8269]] of fifty [[H2572]] with his fifty. [[H2572]] And he answered [[H6030]] and said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, O man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] thus [[H3541]] hath the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Come down [[H3381]] quickly. [[H4120]]

### 12
And Elijah [[H452]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, If [[H518]] I [[H589]] a man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] let fire [[H784]] come down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and consume [[H398]] thee and thy fifty. [[H2572]] And the fire [[H784]] of God [[H430]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and consumed [[H398]] him and his fifty. [[H2572]]

### 13
And he sent [[H7971]] again [[H7725]] a captain [[H8269]] of the third [[H7992]] fifty [[H2572]] with his fifty. [[H2572]] And the third [[H7992]] captain [[H8269]] of fifty [[H2572]] went up, [[H5927]] and came [[H935]] and fell [[H3766]] on [[H5921]] his knees [[H1290]] before [[H5048]] Elijah, [[H452]] and besought [[H2603]] him, and said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, O man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] let my life, [[H5315]] and the life [[H5315]] of these [[H428]] fifty [[H2572]] thy servants, [[H5650]] be precious [[H3365]] in thy sight. [[H5869]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H3381]] fire [[H784]] down from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and burnt up [[H398]] the two [[H8147]] captains [[H8269]] of the former [[H7223]] fifties [[H2572]] with their fifties: [[H2572]] therefore let my life [[H5315]] now [[H6258]] be precious [[H3365]] in thy sight. [[H5869]]

### 15
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Elijah, [[H452]] Go down [[H3381]] with [[H854]] him: be not afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] him. And he arose, [[H6965]] and went down [[H3381]] with [[H854]] him unto [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 16
And he said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Forasmuch as [[H3282]] thou hast sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to inquire [[H1875]] of Baal-zebub [[H1176]] the god [[H430]] of Ekron, [[H6138]] not because [[H1097]] no [[H369]] God [[H430]] in Israel [[H3478]] to inquire [[H1875]] of his word? [[H1697]] therefore [[H3651]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] come down [[H3381]] off [[H4480]] that bed [[H4296]] on which [[H834]] thou art gone up, [[H5927]] but [[H3588]] shalt surely [[H4191]] die. [[H4191]]

### 17
So he died [[H4191]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] Elijah [[H452]] had spoken. [[H1696]] And Jehoram [[H3088]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead [[H8478]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah; [[H3063]] because [[H3588]] he had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] son. [[H1121]]

### 18
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] which [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]
