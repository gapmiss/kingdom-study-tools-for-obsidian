### 1
Be ye [[G1096]] therefore [[G3767]] followers [[G3402]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] as [[G5613]] dear [[G27]] children; [[G5043]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] as [[G2531]] Christ [[G5547]] also [[G2532]] hath loved [[G25]] us, [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] hath given [[G3860]] himself [[G1438]] for [[G5228]] us [[G2257]] an offering [[G4376]] and [[G2532]] a sacrifice [[G2378]]  to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1519]] a sweetsmelling [[G2175]] savour. [[G3744]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] fornication, [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] uncleanness, [[G167]] or [[G2228]] covetousness, [[G4124]] not be once [[G3366]] let it [[G3687]] named [[G3687]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] as [[G2531]] becometh [[G4241]] saints; [[G40]]

### 4
Neither [[G2532]] filthiness, [[G151]] nor [[G2532]] foolish talking, [[G3473]] nor [[G2228]] jesting, [[G2160]] which [[G3588]] not [[G3756]] are [[G433]] convenient: [[G433]] but [[G235]] rather [[G3123]] giving of thanks. [[G2169]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] ye know, [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] no [[G3956]] whoremonger, [[G4205]] nor [[G2228]] unclean person, [[G169]] nor [[G2228]] covetous man, [[G4123]] who [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] an idolater, [[G1496]] hath [[G2192]] any [[G3756]] inheritance [[G2817]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 6
no man [[G3367]] Let [[G538]] deceive [[G538]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1223]] vain [[G2756]] words: [[G3056]] for because of [[G1063]] these things [[G5023]] cometh [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of [[G543]] disobedience. [[G543]]

### 7
Be ye [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] therefore [[G3767]] partakers [[G4830]] with them. [[G846]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] ye were [[G2258]] sometimes [[G4218]] darkness, [[G4655]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] light [[G5457]] in [[G1722]] the Lord: [[G2962]] walk [[G4043]] as [[G5613]] children [[G5043]] of light: [[G5457]]

### 9
(For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] goodness [[G19]] and [[G2532]] righteousness [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] truth;) [[G225]]

### 10
Proving [[G1381]] what [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] acceptable [[G2101]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] no [[G3361]] have [[G4790]] fellowship [[G4790]] the [[G3588]] with [[G175]] unfruitful [[G175]] works [[G2041]] of [[G4655]] darkness, [[G4655]] but [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] reprove [[G1651]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] a shame [[G149]] even [[G2532]] to speak [[G3004]] of [[G5259]] those things which [[G3588]] are done [[G1096]] of them [[G846]] in secret. [[G2931]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] all things [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] are reproved [[G1651]] are made manifest [[G5319]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] light: [[G5457]] for [[G1063]] whatsoever [[G3956]] doth make manifest [[G5319]] is [[G2076]] light. [[G5457]]

### 14
Wherefore [[G1352]] he saith, [[G3004]] Awake thou [[G1453]] that [[G3588]] sleepest, [[G2518]] and [[G2532]] arise [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] thee [[G4671]] shall give light. [[G2017]]

### 15
See [[G991]] then [[G3767]] that [[G4459]] ye walk [[G4043]] circumspectly, [[G199]] not [[G3361]] as [[G5613]] fools, [[G781]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] wise, [[G4680]]

### 16
Redeeming [[G1805]] the [[G3588]] time, [[G2540]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] are [[G1526]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 17
Wherefore [[G1223]]  ye [[G5124]] be [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] unwise, [[G878]] but [[G235]] understanding [[G4920]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] be [[G3182]] drunk [[G3182]] with [[G1722]] wine, [[G3631]] wherein [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] excess; [[G810]] but [[G235]] be filled [[G4137]] with [[G1722]] the Spirit; [[G4151]]

### 19
Speaking [[G2980]] to yourselves [[G1438]] in psalms [[G5568]] and [[G2532]] hymns [[G5215]] and [[G2532]] spiritual [[G4152]] songs, [[G5603]] singing [[G103]] and [[G2532]] making melody [[G5567]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] heart to [[G2588]] the [[G3588]] Lord; [[G2962]]

### 20
Giving thanks [[G2168]] always [[G3842]] for [[G5228]] all things [[G3956]]  unto [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 21
Submitting [[G5293]] yourselves one to [[G240]] another [[G240]] in [[G1722]] the fear [[G5401]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 22
Wives, [[G1135]] submit yourselves unto [[G5293]] your own [[G2398]] husbands, [[G435]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 23
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] is [[G2076]] the head [[G2776]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1135]] wife, [[G1135]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] Christ [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] is [[G2776]] head [[G2776]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] church: [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] is [[G2076]] the saviour [[G4990]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4983]] body. [[G4983]]

### 24
Therefore [[G235]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] is subject unto [[G5293]] Christ, [[G5547]] so [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] wives [[G1135]] to their own [[G2398]] husbands [[G435]] in [[G1722]] every thing. [[G3956]]

### 25
Husbands, [[G435]] love [[G25]] your [[G1438]] wives, [[G1135]] even as [[G2531]] Christ [[G5547]] also [[G2532]] loved [[G25]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G3860]] himself [[G1438]] for [[G5228]] it; [[G846]]

### 26
That [[G2443]] he [[G846]] might sanctify [[G37]] and cleanse it [[G2511]] with the [[G3588]] washing [[G3067]] of [[G5204]] water [[G5204]] by [[G1722]] the word, [[G4487]]

### 27
That [[G2443]] he might present [[G3936]] it [[G846]] to himself [[G1438]] a glorious [[G1741]] church, [[G1577]] not [[G3361]] having [[G2192]] spot, [[G4696]] or [[G2228]] wrinkle, [[G4512]] or [[G2228]] any [[G5100]] such thing; [[G5108]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] it should be [[G5600]] holy [[G40]] and [[G2532]] without blemish. [[G299]]

### 28
So [[G3779]] ought [[G3784]] men [[G435]] to love [[G25]] their [[G1438]] wives [[G1135]] as [[G5613]] their own [[G1438]] bodies. [[G4983]] He that [[G3588]] loveth [[G25]] his [[G1438]] wife [[G1135]] loveth [[G25]] himself. [[G1438]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] no man [[G3762]] ever yet [[G4218]] hated [[G3404]] his own [[G1438]] flesh; [[G4561]] but [[G235]] nourisheth [[G1625]] and [[G2532]] cherisheth [[G2282]] it, [[G846]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] church: [[G1577]]

### 30
For [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] members [[G3196]] of his [[G846]] body, [[G4983]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] bones. [[G3747]]

### 31
For shall [[G473]] this cause [[G5127]] a man [[G444]] leave [[G2641]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] shall be joined [[G4347]] unto [[G4314]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] they shall [[G2071]] two [[G1417]] be [[G2071]] one [[G1520]] flesh. [[G4561]]

### 32
This [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] a great [[G3173]] mystery: [[G3466]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] speak [[G3004]] concerning [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]]

### 33
Nevertheless [[G4133]] every [[G1520]] let [[G25]] one [[G1520]] of you [[G5210]] in particular [[G1538]] so [[G3779]] love [[G25]] his [[G1438]] wife [[G1135]] even as [[G5613]] himself; [[G1438]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] wife [[G1135]] that [[G2443]] she reverence [[G5399]] husband. [[G435]]
