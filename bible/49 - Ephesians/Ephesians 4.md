### 1
I [[G1473]] therefore, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] prisoner [[G1198]] of [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] beseech [[G3870]] you [[G5209]] that ye walk [[G4043]] worthy [[G516]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2821]] vocation [[G2821]] wherewith [[G3739]] ye are called, [[G2564]]

### 2
With [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] lowliness [[G5012]] and [[G2532]] meekness, [[G4236]] with [[G3326]] longsuffering, [[G3115]] forbearing [[G430]] one another [[G240]] in [[G1722]] love; [[G26]]

### 3
Endeavouring [[G4704]] to keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] unity [[G1775]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] bond [[G4886]] of [[G1515]] peace. [[G1515]]

### 4
one [[G1520]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] Spirit, [[G4151]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] ye are called [[G2564]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] hope [[G1680]] of your [[G5216]] calling; [[G2821]]

### 5
One [[G1520]] Lord, [[G2962]] one [[G1520]] faith, [[G4102]] one [[G1520]] baptism, [[G908]]

### 6
One [[G1520]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] of all, [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] above [[G1909]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] all. [[G3956]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] unto every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of us [[G2257]] is given [[G1325]] grace [[G5485]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] measure [[G3358]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1431]] gift [[G1431]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 8
Wherefore [[G1352]] he saith, [[G3004]] When he ascended up [[G305]] on [[G1519]] high, [[G5311]] he led captive, [[G162]] captivity [[G161]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] gifts [[G1390]] unto [[G444]] men. [[G444]]

### 9
(Now [[G1161]] that [[G3588]] he ascended, [[G305]] what [[G5101]] is it [[G2076]] but [[G3361]] that [[G3754]] also [[G2532]] he [[G2597]] descended [[G2597]] first [[G4412]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lower [[G2737]] parts [[G3313]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth? [[G1093]]

### 10
He that [[G3588]] descended [[G2597]] is [[G2076]] the same [[G846]] also [[G2532]] that [[G3588]] ascended up [[G305]] far above [[G5231]] all [[G3956]] heavens, [[G3772]] that [[G2443]] he might fill [[G4137]] all things.) [[G3956]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] gave [[G1325]] some, [[G3588]] apostles; [[G652]] and [[G1161]] some, [[G3588]] prophets; [[G4396]] and [[G1161]] some, [[G3588]] evangelists; [[G2099]] and [[G1161]] some, [[G3588]] pastors [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] teachers; [[G1320]]

### 12
For [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] perfecting of [[G2677]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] for [[G1519]] the work [[G2041]] of the ministry, [[G1248]] for [[G1519]] the edifying [[G3619]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4983]] body [[G4983]] of [[G5547]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 13
Till [[G3360]] we [[G2658]] all [[G3956]] come [[G2658]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] unity [[G1775]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4102]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1922]] knowledge [[G1922]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] unto [[G1519]] a perfect [[G5046]] man, [[G435]] unto [[G1519]] the measure [[G3358]] of the stature [[G2244]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4138]] fulness [[G4138]] of [[G5547]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 14
That [[G2443]] we be [[G5600]] no more [[G3371]] children, [[G3516]] tossed to and fro, [[G2831]] and [[G2532]] carried about [[G4064]] with every [[G3956]] wind [[G417]] of [[G1319]] doctrine, [[G1319]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sleight [[G2940]] of [[G444]] men, [[G444]] cunning craftiness, [[G3834]] whereby [[G4314]] they [[G3588]] lie in wait [[G3180]]  to deceive; [[G3588]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] speaking the truth [[G226]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] may grow up [[G837]] into [[G1519]] him [[G846]] in all things, [[G3956]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] head, [[G2776]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 16
From [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] body [[G4983]] fitly joined together [[G4883]] and [[G2532]] compacted [[G4822]] by [[G1223]] that which [[G3588]] every [[G3956]] joint [[G860]] supplieth, [[G2024]] according to [[G2596]] the effectual working [[G1753]] in [[G1722]] the measure [[G3358]] of every [[G1538]] part, [[G3313]] maketh [[G4160]] increase [[G838]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4983]] body [[G4983]] unto [[G1519]] the edifying [[G3619]] of itself [[G1438]] in [[G1722]] love. [[G26]]

### 17
This [[G5124]] I say [[G3004]] therefore, [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] testify [[G3143]] in [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] that ye [[G5209]] walk [[G4043]] henceforth [[G2532]] not [[G3371]] as [[G2531]] other [[G3062]] Gentiles [[G1484]] walk, [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the vanity [[G3153]] of their [[G846]] mind, [[G3563]]

### 18
Having [[G4654]] the [[G3588]] understanding [[G1271]] darkened, [[G4654]] being [[G5607]] alienated from [[G526]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] ignorance that [[G52]] is [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4457]] blindness [[G4457]] of their [[G846]] heart: [[G2588]]

### 19
Who [[G3748]] being past feeling [[G524]] have given over [[G3860]] themselves [[G1438]] unto [[G766]] lasciviousness, [[G766]] to [[G1519]] work [[G2039]] all [[G3956]] uncleanness [[G167]] with [[G1722]] greediness. [[G4124]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] not [[G3756]] have [[G3129]] so [[G3779]] learned [[G3129]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 21
If so be that [[G1489]] ye have heard [[G191]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] have been taught [[G1321]] by [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] as [[G2531]] the truth [[G225]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] Jesus: [[G2424]]

### 22
That ye [[G5209]] put off [[G659]] concerning [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] former [[G4387]] conversation [[G391]] the [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] man, [[G444]] which [[G3588]] is corrupt [[G5351]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]]  deceitful [[G539]] lusts; [[G1939]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] be renewed [[G365]] in the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of your [[G5216]] mind; [[G3563]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] that ye put on [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] man, [[G444]] which [[G3588]] after [[G2596]] God [[G2316]] is created [[G2936]] in [[G1722]] righteousness [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] true [[G225]] holiness. [[G3742]]

### 25
Wherefore [[G1352]] putting away [[G659]] lying, [[G5579]] speak [[G2980]] every man [[G1538]] truth [[G225]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] neighbour: [[G4139]] for [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] members [[G3196]] one of another. [[G240]]

### 26
Be ye angry, [[G3710]] and [[G2532]] sin [[G264]] not: [[G3361]] let sun go [[G2246]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] down [[G1931]] upon [[G1909]] your [[G5216]] wrath: [[G3950]]

### 27
Neither [[G3383]] give [[G1325]] place [[G5117]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1228]] devil. [[G1228]]

### 28
that [[G3588]] Let him [[G2813]] stole [[G2813]] steal [[G2813]] no more: [[G3371]] but [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] let him labour, [[G2872]] working [[G2038]] with [[G5495]] hands [[G5495]] the thing which [[G3588]] is good, [[G18]] that [[G2443]] he may have [[G2192]] to give [[G3330]] to him that [[G3588]] needeth. [[G5532]]

### 29
no [[G3361]] Let [[G1607]] corrupt [[G4550]] communication [[G3056]] proceed [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] mouth, [[G4750]] but [[G235]] that [[G1487]] which is [[G5100]] good [[G18]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] use [[G5532]] of edifying, [[G3619]] that [[G2443]] it may minister [[G1325]] grace [[G5485]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G191]] hearers. [[G191]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] grieve [[G3076]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] whereby [[G1722]]  ye are [[G3739]] sealed [[G4972]] unto [[G1519]] the day [[G2250]] of redemption. [[G629]]

### 31
all [[G3956]] Let be put [[G142]] bitterness, [[G4088]] and [[G2532]] wrath, [[G2372]] and [[G2532]] anger, [[G3709]] and [[G2532]] clamour, [[G2906]] and [[G2532]] evil speaking, [[G988]] away [[G142]] from [[G575]] you, [[G5216]] with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] malice: [[G2549]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] be ye [[G1096]] kind [[G5543]] to [[G1519]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] tenderhearted, [[G2155]] forgiving [[G5483]] one another, [[G1438]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] God [[G2316]] for hath [[G1722]] Christ's sake [[G5547]] forgiven [[G5483]] you. [[G5213]]
