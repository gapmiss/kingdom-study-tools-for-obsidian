### 1
For this [[G5127]] cause [[G5484]] I [[G1473]] Paul, [[G3972]] the [[G3588]]  prisoner of [[G1198]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] for [[G5228]] you [[G5216]] Gentiles, [[G1484]]

### 2
If [[G1489]] ye have heard of [[G191]] the [[G3588]] dispensation [[G3622]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5485]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] is given [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] to [[G1519]] you-ward: [[G5209]]

### 3
How that [[G3754]] by [[G2596]] revelation [[G602]] he made known [[G1107]] unto me [[G3427]] the [[G3588]] mystery; [[G3466]] (as [[G2531]] I wrote afore [[G4270]] in [[G1722]] few words, [[G3641]]

### 4
Whereby, [[G3739]]  when [[G4314]] ye read, [[G314]] ye may [[G1410]] understand [[G3539]] my [[G3450]] knowledge [[G4907]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of [[G5547]] Christ) [[G5547]]

### 5
Which [[G3739]] in [[G1722]] other [[G2087]] ages [[G1074]] not [[G3756]] was made [[G1107]] known [[G1107]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G5207]] sons [[G5207]] of [[G444]] men, [[G444]] as [[G5613]] now [[G3568]] it is [[G601]] revealed [[G601]] unto [[G846]] his [[G846]] holy [[G40]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] prophets [[G4396]] by [[G1722]] the Spirit; [[G4151]]

### 6
That [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] should be [[G1511]] fellowheirs, [[G4789]] and [[G2532]] of the same body, [[G4954]] and [[G2532]] partakers [[G4830]] of his [[G846]] promise [[G1860]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gospel: [[G2098]]

### 7
Whereof [[G3739]] I was made [[G1096]] a minister, [[G1249]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5485]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] given [[G1325]] unto me [[G3427]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] working [[G1753]] effectual [[G3588]] of his [[G846]] power. [[G1411]]

### 8
Unto me, [[G1698]] who [[G3588]] am less than the least [[G1647]] of all [[G3956]] saints, [[G40]] is [[G1325]] this [[G3778]] grace [[G5485]] given, [[G1325]] that I should preach [[G2097]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] the [[G3588]] unsearchable [[G421]] riches [[G4149]] of [[G5547]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] to make see [[G5461]] all [[G3956]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] fellowship [[G2842]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3466]] mystery, [[G3466]] which [[G3588]] from [[G575]] the beginning the [[G3588]] of world [[G165]] hath been hid [[G613]] in [[G1722]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] created [[G2936]] all things [[G3956]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 10
To the intent that [[G2443]] now [[G3568]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G746]] principalities [[G746]] and [[G2532]] powers [[G1849]] in [[G1722]] heavenly [[G2032]] might be known [[G1107]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] the [[G3588]] manifold [[G4182]] wisdom [[G4678]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]]

### 11
According to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] eternal [[G165]] purpose [[G4286]] which [[G3739]] he purposed [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G2257]] Lord: [[G2962]]

### 12
In [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] we have [[G2192]] boldness [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] access [[G4318]] with [[G1722]] confidence [[G4006]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of him. [[G846]]

### 13
Wherefore [[G1352]] I desire [[G154]] that ye faint [[G1573]] not [[G3361]] at [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] tribulations [[G2347]] for [[G5228]] you, [[G5216]] which [[G3748]] is [[G2076]] your [[G5216]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 14
For this [[G5127]] cause [[G5484]] I bow [[G2578]] my [[G3450]] knees [[G1119]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

### 15
Of [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] the whole [[G3956]] family [[G3965]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] is named, [[G3687]]

### 16
That [[G2443]] he would grant [[G1325]] you, [[G5213]] according [[G2596]] to [[G4149]] the [[G3588]] riches [[G4149]] of his [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] to be with [[G1411]] strengthened [[G2901]] might [[G1411]] by [[G1223]] his [[G846]] Spirit [[G4151]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] inner [[G2080]] man; [[G444]]

### 17
That [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] may dwell [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] hearts [[G2588]] by [[G1223]] faith; [[G4102]] being rooted [[G4492]] that ye, [[G2443]] and [[G2532]] grounded [[G2311]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]]

### 18
May be able [[G1840]] to [[G2443]] comprehend [[G2638]] with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] saints [[G40]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] breadth, [[G4114]] and [[G2532]] length, [[G3372]] and [[G2532]] depth, [[G899]] and [[G2532]] height; [[G5311]]

### 19
And [[G5037]] to know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] which [[G3588]] passeth [[G5235]] knowledge, [[G1108]] that [[G2443]] ye might be filled [[G4137]] with [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] fulness [[G4138]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 20
Now [[G1161]] unto him that [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to do [[G4160]] exceeding [[G1537]] above [[G5228]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] we ask [[G154]] or [[G2228]] think, [[G3539]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] that [[G3588]] worketh [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] abundantly [[G4053]]

### 21
Unto him [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] by [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] throughout [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] ages, [[G1074]] world [[G165]]  without [[G3588]] end. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
