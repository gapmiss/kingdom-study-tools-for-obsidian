### 1
And [[G2532]] you [[G5209]] who were [[G5607]] dead [[G3498]]  in [[G3588]] trespasses [[G3900]] and [[G2532]] sins; [[G266]]

### 2
Wherein [[G3739]] in [[G1722]] time past [[G4218]] ye walked [[G4043]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] course [[G165]] of this [[G5127]] world, [[G2889]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1849]] power [[G1849]] the [[G3588]] of [[G109]] air, [[G109]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3588]] now [[G3568]] worketh [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of [[G543]] disobedience: [[G543]]

### 3
Among [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] all [[G3956]] had our conversation [[G390]] in times past [[G4218]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] lusts [[G1939]] of our [[G2257]] flesh, [[G4561]] fulfilling [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] desires [[G2307]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1271]] mind; [[G1271]] and [[G2532]] were [[G1510]] by nature [[G5449]] the children [[G5043]] of wrath, [[G3709]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] others. [[G3062]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] God, [[G2316]] who is [[G5607]] rich [[G4145]] in [[G1722]] mercy, [[G1656]] for [[G1223]] his [[G846]] great [[G4183]] love [[G26]] wherewith [[G3739]] he loved [[G25]] us, [[G2248]]

### 5
Even [[G2532]] when [[G5607]] we [[G2248]] were [[G5607]] dead [[G3498]]  in [[G3588]] sins, [[G3900]] hath quickened us together with [[G4806]] Christ, [[G5547]] (by grace [[G5485]] ye are [[G2075]] saved;) [[G4982]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] hath raised up together, [[G4891]] and [[G2532]] made sit together [[G4776]] in [[G1722]] heavenly [[G2032]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus: [[G2424]]

### 7
That [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ages to [[G165]] come [[G1904]] he might shew [[G1731]] the [[G3588]] exceeding [[G5235]] riches [[G4149]] of his [[G846]] grace [[G5485]] in [[G1722]] kindness [[G5544]] toward [[G1909]] us [[G2248]] through [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] by grace [[G5485]] are [[G2075]] ye saved [[G4982]] through [[G1223]] faith; [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] that [[G5124]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] yourselves: [[G5216]] the [[G3588]] gift of [[G1435]] God: [[G2316]]

### 9
Not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] works, [[G2041]] lest [[G3361]] any man [[G5100]] should boast. [[G2744]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] we are [[G2070]] his [[G846]] workmanship, [[G4161]] created [[G2936]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto [[G1909]] good [[G18]] works, [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath before ordained [[G4282]] that [[G2443]] we should walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] them. [[G846]]

### 11
Wherefore [[G1352]] remember, [[G3421]] that [[G3754]] ye [[G5210]] in time past [[G4218]] Gentiles [[G1484]] in [[G1722]] the flesh, [[G4561]] who [[G3588]] are [[G3004]] called [[G3004]] Uncircumcision [[G203]] by [[G5259]] that which [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Circumcision [[G4061]] in [[G1722]] the flesh [[G4561]] made by hands; [[G5499]]

### 12
That [[G3754]] at [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time ye [[G2540]] were [[G2258]] without [[G5565]] Christ, [[G5547]] being aliens [[G526]] from the [[G3588]] commonwealth of [[G4174]] Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] strangers [[G3581]] from the [[G3588]] covenants [[G1242]] of [[G1860]] promise, [[G1860]] having [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] hope, [[G1680]] and [[G2532]] without God [[G112]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world: [[G2889]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] ye [[G5210]] who [[G3588]] sometimes [[G4218]] were [[G5607]] far off [[G3112]] are made [[G1096]] nigh [[G1451]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] he [[G846]] is [[G2076]] our [[G2257]] peace, [[G1515]] who [[G3588]] hath made [[G4160]] both [[G297]] one, [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] hath broken down [[G3089]] the middle [[G3588]] wall [[G3320]] of [[G5418]] partition [[G5418]]

### 15
Having abolished [[G2673]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] flesh [[G4561]] the [[G3588]] enmity, [[G2189]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of [[G1785]] commandments [[G1785]] in [[G1722]] ordinances; [[G1378]] for [[G1519]] to [[G2443]] make [[G2936]] in [[G1722]] himself [[G1438]] of twain [[G1417]] one [[G1520]] new [[G2537]] man, [[G444]] making [[G4160]] peace; [[G1515]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] that he [[G846]] might reconcile [[G604]] both [[G297]] unto [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] body [[G4983]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] cross, [[G4716]] having slain [[G615]] the [[G3588]] enmity [[G2189]] thereby: [[G1722]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] and preached [[G2097]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G5213]] which [[G3588]] were afar off, [[G3112]] and [[G2532]]  to them that [[G3588]] were [[G1451]] nigh. [[G1451]]

### 18
For [[G3754]] through [[G1223]] him [[G846]] we [[G2192]] both [[G297]] have [[G2192]] access [[G4318]] by [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] Spirit [[G4151]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 19
Now [[G3767]] therefore [[G686]] ye are [[G2075]] no more [[G3765]] strangers [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] foreigners, [[G3941]] but [[G235]] fellowcitizens [[G4847]] with [[G40]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] of the household [[G3609]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]]

### 20
And are built [[G2026]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] foundation [[G2310]] the [[G3588]] of [[G652]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] prophets, [[G4396]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] himself [[G846]] being [[G5607]] the chief corner [[G204]]

### 21
In [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] building [[G3619]] fitly framed together [[G4883]] groweth [[G837]] unto [[G1519]] an holy [[G40]] temple [[G3485]] in [[G1722]] the Lord: [[G2962]]

### 22
In [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] are builded together [[G4925]] for [[G1519]] an habitation [[G2732]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1722]] the Spirit. [[G4151]]
