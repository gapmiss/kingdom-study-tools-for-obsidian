### 1
Children, [[G5043]] obey [[G5219]] your [[G5216]] parents [[G1118]] in [[G1722]] the Lord: [[G2962]] for [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] right. [[G1342]]

### 2
Honour [[G5091]] thy [[G4675]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother; [[G3384]] (which [[G3748]] is [[G2076]] the first [[G4413]] commandment [[G1785]] with [[G1722]] promise;) [[G1860]]

### 3
That [[G2443]] it may be [[G1096]] well [[G2095]] with thee, [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] thou mayest [[G2071]] live long [[G3118]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 4
And, [[G2532]] ye [[G3962]] fathers, [[G3962]] provoke to wrath: [[G3949]] not [[G3361]] your [[G5216]] children [[G5043]] but [[G235]] bring up [[G1625]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the nurture [[G3809]] and [[G2532]] admonition [[G3559]] of the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 5
Servants, [[G1401]] be obedient to [[G5219]] them that are [[G3588]] masters [[G2962]] according to [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] with [[G3326]] fear [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] trembling, [[G5156]] in [[G1722]] singleness [[G572]] of your [[G5216]] heart, [[G2588]] as [[G5613]] unto [[G5547]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 6
Not [[G3361]] with [[G2596]] eyeservice, [[G3787]] as [[G5613]] menpleasers; [[G441]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] the servants [[G1401]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] doing [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] from [[G1537]] the heart; [[G5590]]

### 7
With [[G3326]] good will [[G2133]] doing service, [[G1398]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] to men: [[G444]]

### 8
Knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] whatsoever [[G3739]] good thing [[G18]] any man [[G1538]] doeth, [[G4160]] the same [[G5124]] shall he receive [[G2865]] of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] whether [[G1535]] bond [[G1401]] or [[G1535]] free. [[G1658]]

### 9
And, [[G2532]] ye [[G4160]] masters, [[G2962]] do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] same things [[G846]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] forbearing [[G447]] threatening: [[G547]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] your [[G5216]] Master also [[G2962]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] heaven; [[G3772]] neither [[G3756]]  there [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] respect of persons [[G4382]] with [[G3844]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
Finally, [[G3063]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] be strong [[G1743]] in [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] power [[G2904]] of his [[G846]] might. [[G2479]]

### 11
Put on [[G1746]] the whole [[G3588]] armour [[G3833]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G3588]] ye [[G5209]] may be able [[G1410]] to stand [[G2476]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] wiles of [[G3180]] the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]]

### 12
For [[G3754]] we [[G2254]] wrestle [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] against [[G4314]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]] but [[G235]] against [[G4314]] principalities, [[G746]] against [[G4314]] powers, [[G1849]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G2888]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4655]] darkness [[G4655]] of this [[G5127]] world, [[G165]] against [[G4314]] spiritual [[G4152]] wickedness [[G4189]] in [[G1722]] high [[G2032]]

### 13
Wherefore [[G1223]] take unto you [[G353]] the whole [[G3588]] armour [[G3833]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] ye may be able [[G1410]] to withstand [[G436]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] having done [[G2716]] all, [[G537]] to stand. [[G2476]]

### 14
Stand [[G2476]] therefore, [[G3767]] your [[G5216]] loins [[G3751]] having girt about [[G4024]] with [[G1722]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] having on [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] breastplate [[G2382]] of [[G1343]] righteousness; [[G1343]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] your [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] shod [[G5265]] with [[G1722]] the preparation [[G2091]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G1515]] peace; [[G1515]]

### 16
Above [[G1909]] all, [[G3956]] taking [[G353]] the [[G3588]] shield [[G2375]] of [[G4102]] faith, [[G4102]] wherewith [[G1722]] ye shall be able [[G1410]] to quench [[G4570]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] fiery [[G4448]] darts of [[G956]] the [[G3588]] wicked. [[G4190]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] take [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] helmet of [[G4030]] salvation, [[G4992]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sword [[G3162]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit, [[G4151]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the word [[G4487]] of God: [[G2316]]

### 18
Praying [[G4336]] always [[G3956]] with [[G1223]] all [[G3956]] prayer [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] supplication [[G1162]] in [[G1722]] the Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] watching [[G69]] thereunto [[G1519]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] perseverance [[G4343]] and [[G2532]] supplication [[G1162]] for [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] saints; [[G40]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] for [[G5228]] me, [[G1700]] that [[G2443]] utterance [[G3056]] may be given [[G1325]] me, [[G3427]] unto [[G1722]] that I may [[G457]] open [[G457]] my [[G3450]] mouth [[G4750]] boldly, [[G3954]] to make known [[G1107]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel, [[G2098]]

### 20
For [[G5228]] which [[G3739]] I am an ambassador [[G4243]] in [[G1722]] bonds: [[G254]] that [[G2443]] therein [[G1722]] I may speak boldly, [[G3955]] as [[G5613]] I [[G3165]] ought [[G1163]] to speak. [[G2980]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] may know [[G1492]] my [[G1691]] affairs, [[G2596]] how [[G5101]] I do, [[G4238]] Tychicus, [[G5190]] a [[G3588]] beloved [[G27]] brother [[G80]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] minister [[G1249]] in [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] shall make known [[G1107]] to you [[G5213]] all things: [[G3956]]
