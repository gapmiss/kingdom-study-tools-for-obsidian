And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] gathered themselves together [[H622]] as one [[H259]] man [[H376]] into [[H413]] the street [[H7339]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the water [[H4325]] gate; [[H8179]] and they spake [[H559]] unto Ezra [[H5830]] the scribe [[H5608]] to bring [[H935]] the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] to [[H854]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
And Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] brought [[H935]] the law [[H8451]] before [[H6440]] the congregation [[H6951]] both of men [[H376]] and women, [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] that could hear [[H8085]] with understanding, [[H995]] upon the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month. [[H2320]]

### 3
And he read [[H7121]] therein before [[H6440]] the street [[H7339]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the water [[H4325]] gate [[H8179]] from [[H4480]] the morning [[H216]] until [[H5704]] midday, [[H4276]] before [[H5048]] the men [[H376]] and the women, [[H802]] and those that could understand; [[H995]] and the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] the book [[H5612]] of the law. [[H8451]]

### 4
And Ezra [[H5830]] the scribe [[H5608]] stood [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] a pulpit [[H4026]] of wood, [[H6086]] which [[H834]] they had made [[H6213]] for the purpose; [[H1697]] and beside [[H681]] him stood [[H5975]] Mattithiah, [[H4993]] and Shema, [[H8087]] and Anaiah, [[H6043]] and Urijah, [[H223]] and Hilkiah, [[H2518]] and Maaseiah, [[H4641]] on [[H5921]] his right hand; [[H3225]] and on his left hand, [[H8040]] Pedaiah, [[H6305]] and Mishael, [[H4332]] and Malchiah, [[H4441]] and Hashum, [[H2828]] and Hashbadana, [[H2806]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] Meshullam. [[H4918]]

### 5
And Ezra [[H5830]] opened [[H6605]] the book [[H5612]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people; [[H5971]] (for [[H3588]] he was [[H1961]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people;) [[H5971]] and when he opened [[H6605]] it, all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] stood up: [[H5975]]

### 6
And Ezra [[H5830]] blessed [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the great [[H1419]] God. [[H430]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] answered, [[H6030]] Amen, [[H543]] Amen, [[H543]] with lifting up [[H4607]] their hands: [[H3027]] and they bowed [[H6915]] their heads, and worshipped [[H7812]] the Lord [[H3068]] with faces [[H639]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 7
Also Jeshua, [[H3442]] and Bani, [[H1137]] and Sherebiah, [[H8274]] Jamin, [[H3226]] Akkub, [[H6126]] Shabbethai, [[H7678]] Hodijah, [[H1941]] Maaseiah, [[H4641]] Kelita, [[H7042]] Azariah, [[H5838]] Jozabad, [[H3107]] Hanan, [[H2605]] Pelaiah, [[H6411]] and the Levites, [[H3881]]  caused [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] to understand [[H995]] the law: [[H8451]] and the people [[H5971]] in [[H5921]] their place. [[H5977]]

### 8
So they read [[H7121]] in the book [[H5612]] in the law [[H8451]] of God [[H430]] distinctly, [[H6567]] and gave [[H7760]] the sense, [[H7922]] and caused to understand [[H995]] the reading. [[H4744]]

### 9
And Nehemiah, [[H5166]] which [[H1931]] the Tirshatha, [[H8660]] and Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and the Levites [[H3881]] that taught [[H995]] the people, [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] This [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] holy [[H6918]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] mourn [[H56]] not, [[H408]] nor [[H408]] weep. [[H1058]] For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] wept, [[H1058]] when they heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the law. [[H8451]]

### 10
Then he said [[H559]] unto them, Go your way, [[H3212]] eat [[H398]] the fat, [[H4924]] and drink [[H8354]] the sweet, [[H4477]] and send [[H7971]] portions [[H4490]] unto them for whom nothing [[H369]] is prepared: [[H3559]] for [[H3588]] day [[H3117]] holy [[H6918]] unto our Lord: [[H113]] neither [[H408]] be ye sorry; [[H6087]] for [[H3588]] the joy [[H2304]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is your strength. [[H4581]]

### 11
So the Levites [[H3881]] stilled [[H2814]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Hold your peace, [[H2013]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] holy; [[H6918]] neither [[H408]] be ye grieved. [[H6087]]

### 12
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] went their way [[H3212]] to eat, [[H398]] and to drink, [[H8354]] and to send [[H7971]] portions, [[H4490]] and to make [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] mirth, [[H8057]] because [[H3588]] they had understood [[H995]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] were declared [[H3045]] unto them. [[H3045]]

### 13
And on the second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] were gathered together [[H622]] the chief [[H7218]] of the fathers [[H1]] of all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] the priests, [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] unto [[H413]] Ezra [[H5830]] the scribe, [[H5608]] even to understand [[H7919]] the words [[H1697]] of the law. [[H8451]]

### 14
And they found [[H4672]] written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] by [[H3027]] Moses, [[H4872]] that [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] should dwell [[H3427]] in booths [[H5521]] in the feast [[H2282]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month: [[H2320]]

### 15
And that [[H834]] they should publish [[H8085]] and proclaim [[H5674]] in all [[H3605]] their cities, [[H5892]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] Go forth [[H3318]] unto the mount, [[H2022]] and fetch [[H935]] olive [[H2132]] branches, [[H5929]] and pine [[H8081]] branches, [[H6086]] and myrtle [[H1918]] branches, [[H5929]] and palm [[H8558]] branches, [[H5929]] and branches [[H5929]] of thick [[H5687]] trees, [[H6086]] to make [[H6213]] booths, [[H5521]] as written. [[H3789]]

### 16
So the people [[H5971]] went forth, [[H3318]] and brought [[H935]] and made [[H6213]] themselves booths, [[H5521]] every one [[H376]] upon [[H5921]] the roof of his house, [[H1406]] and in their courts, [[H2691]] and in the courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and in the street [[H7339]] of the water [[H4325]] gate, [[H8179]] and in the street [[H7339]] of the gate [[H8179]] of Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 17
And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of them that were come again [[H7725]] out of [[H4480]] the captivity [[H7628]] made [[H6213]] booths, [[H5521]] and sat [[H3427]] under the booths: [[H5521]] for [[H3588]] since the days [[H3117]] of Jeshua [[H3442]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] unto [[H5704]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] had not [[H3808]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] done so. [[H6213]] And there was [[H1961]] very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] gladness. [[H8057]]

### 18
Also day [[H3117]] by day, [[H3117]] from [[H4480]] the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] unto [[H5704]] the last [[H314]] day, [[H3117]] he read [[H7121]] in the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of God. [[H430]] And they kept [[H6213]] the feast [[H2282]] seven [[H7651]] days; [[H3117]] and on the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] a solemn assembly, [[H6116]] according unto the manner. [[H4941]]
