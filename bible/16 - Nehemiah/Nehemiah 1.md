### 1
The words [[H1697]] of Nehemiah [[H5166]] the son [[H1121]] of Hachaliah. [[H2446]] And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the month [[H2320]] Chisleu, [[H3691]] in the twentieth [[H6242]] year, [[H8141]] as I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] in Shushan [[H7800]] the palace, [[H1002]]

### 2
That Hanani, [[H2607]] one [[H259]] of my brethren, [[H251]] came, [[H935]] he [[H1931]] and men [[H376]] of Judah; [[H3063]] and I asked [[H7592]] them concerning [[H5921]] the Jews [[H3064]] that had escaped, [[H6413]] which [[H834]] were left [[H7604]] of [[H4480]] the captivity, [[H7628]] and concerning [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
And they said [[H559]] unto me, The remnant [[H7604]] that [[H834]] are left [[H7604]] of [[H4480]] the captivity [[H7628]] there [[H8033]] in the province [[H4082]] in great [[H1419]] affliction [[H7451]] and reproach: [[H2781]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] also broken down, [[H6555]] and the gates [[H8179]] thereof are burned [[H3341]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 4
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when I heard [[H8085]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] that I sat down [[H3427]] and wept, [[H1058]] and mourned [[H56]] days, [[H3117]] and fasted, [[H6684]] and prayed [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] the God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]]

### 5
And said, [[H559]] I beseech [[H577]] thee, O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] the great [[H1419]] and terrible [[H3372]] God, [[H410]] that keepeth [[H8104]] covenant [[H1285]] and mercy [[H2617]] for them that love [[H157]] him and observe [[H8104]] his commandments: [[H4687]]

### 6
Let thine ear [[H241]] now [[H4994]] be [[H1961]] attentive, [[H7183]] and thine eyes [[H5869]] open, [[H6605]] that thou mayest hear [[H8085]] the prayer [[H8605]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] pray [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] thee now, [[H3117]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] for [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] thy servants, [[H5650]] and confess [[H3034]] the sins [[H2403]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against thee: both I [[H589]] and my father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] have sinned. [[H2398]]

### 7
We have dealt very [[H2254]] corruptly [[H2254]] against thee, and have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the commandments, [[H4687]] nor the statutes, [[H2706]] nor the judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] thou commandedst [[H6680]] thy servant [[H5650]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 8
Remember, [[H2142]] I beseech [[H4994]]  thee, [[H853]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] thou commandedst [[H6680]] thy servant [[H5650]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]] ye [[H859]] transgress, [[H4603]] I [[H589]] will scatter you abroad [[H6327]] among the nations: [[H5971]]

### 9
But ye turn [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] me, and keep [[H8104]] my commandments, [[H4687]] and do [[H6213]] them; though [[H518]] there were [[H1961]] of you cast out [[H5080]] unto the uttermost part [[H7097]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] will I gather [[H6908]] them from thence, [[H8033]] and will bring [[H935]] them unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] that [[H834]] I have chosen [[H977]] to set [[H7931]] my name [[H8034]] there. [[H8033]]

### 10
Now these [[H1992]] thy servants [[H5650]] and thy people, [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] thou hast redeemed [[H6299]] by thy great [[H1419]] power, [[H3581]] and by thy strong [[H2389]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
O Lord, [[H136]] I beseech [[H577]] thee, let now [[H4994]] thine ear [[H241]] be [[H1961]] attentive [[H7183]] to [[H413]] the prayer [[H8605]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] and to [[H413]] the prayer [[H8605]] of thy servants, [[H5650]] who desire [[H2655]] to fear [[H3372]] thy name: [[H8034]] and prosper, [[H6743]] I pray [[H4994]] thee, thy servant [[H5650]] this day, [[H3117]] and grant [[H5414]] him mercy [[H7356]] in the sight [[H6440]] of this [[H2088]] man. [[H376]] For I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] the king's [[H4428]] cupbearer. [[H4945]]
