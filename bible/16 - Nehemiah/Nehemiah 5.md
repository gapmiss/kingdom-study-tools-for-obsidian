### 1
And there was [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] cry [[H6818]] of the people [[H5971]] and of their wives [[H802]] against [[H413]] their brethren [[H251]] the Jews. [[H3064]]

### 2
For there were [[H3426]] that [[H834]] said, [[H559]] We, [[H587]] our sons, [[H1121]] and our daughters, [[H1323]] many: [[H7227]] therefore we take up [[H3947]] corn [[H1715]] that we may eat, [[H398]] and live. [[H2421]]

### 3
also there were [[H3426]] that [[H834]] said, [[H559]] We [[H587]] have mortgaged [[H6148]] our lands, [[H7704]] vineyards, [[H3754]] and houses, [[H1004]] that we might buy [[H3947]] corn, [[H1715]] because of the dearth. [[H7458]]

### 4
There were [[H3426]] also that [[H834]] said, [[H559]] We have borrowed [[H3867]] money [[H3701]] for the king's [[H4428]] tribute, [[H4060]] our lands [[H7704]] and vineyards. [[H3754]]

### 5
Yet now [[H6258]] our flesh [[H1320]] as the flesh [[H1320]] of our brethren, [[H251]] our children [[H1121]] as their children: [[H1121]] and, lo, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] bring into bondage [[H3533]] our sons [[H1121]] and our daughters [[H1323]] to be servants, [[H5650]] and of our daughters [[H1323]] are [[H3426]] brought unto bondage [[H3533]] neither [[H369]] in our power [[H410]] for other men [[H312]] have our lands [[H7704]] and vineyards. [[H3754]]

### 6
And I was very [[H3966]] angry [[H2734]] when [[H834]] I heard [[H8085]] their cry [[H2201]] and these [[H428]] words. [[H1697]]

### 7
Then I consulted [[H4427]] with [[H5921]] myself, [[H3820]] and I rebuked [[H7378]] the nobles, [[H2715]] and the rulers, [[H5461]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Ye [[H859]] exact [[H5383]] usury, [[H4855]] every one [[H376]] of his brother. [[H251]] And I set [[H5414]] a great [[H1419]] assembly [[H6952]] against [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 8
And I said [[H559]] unto them, We [[H587]] after our ability [[H1767]] have redeemed [[H7069]] our brethren [[H251]] the Jews, [[H3064]] which were sold [[H4376]] unto the heathen; [[H1471]] and will ye [[H859]] even [[H1571]] sell [[H4376]] your brethren? [[H251]] or shall they be sold [[H4376]] unto us? Then held they their peace, [[H2790]] and found [[H4672]] nothing [[H3808]]

### 9
Also I said, [[H559]] It not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] that [[H1697]] ye [[H859]] do: [[H6213]] ought ye not [[H3808]] to walk [[H1980]] in the fear [[H3374]] of our God [[H430]] because of the reproach [[H2781]] of the heathen [[H1471]] our enemies? [[H341]]

### 10
I [[H589]] likewise, [[H1571]] my brethren, [[H251]] and my servants, [[H5288]] might exact [[H5383]] of them money [[H3701]] and corn: [[H1715]] I pray [[H4994]] you, let us leave off [[H5800]] this [[H2088]] usury. [[H4855]]

### 11
Restore, [[H7725]] I pray [[H4994]] you, to them, even this day, [[H3117]] their lands, [[H7704]] their vineyards, [[H3754]] their oliveyards, [[H2132]] and their houses, [[H1004]] also the hundredth [[H3967]] of the money, [[H3701]] and of the corn, [[H1715]] the wine, [[H8492]] and the oil, [[H3323]] that [[H834]] ye [[H859]] exact [[H5383]] of them. [[H5383]]

### 12
Then said [[H559]] they, We will restore [[H7725]] and will require [[H1245]] nothing [[H3808]] of them; so [[H3651]] will we do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] thou [[H859]] sayest. [[H559]] Then I called [[H7121]] the priests, [[H3548]] and took an oath [[H7650]] of them, that they should do [[H6213]] according to this [[H2088]] promise. [[H1697]]

### 13
Also [[H1571]] I shook [[H5287]] my lap, [[H2684]] and said, [[H559]] So [[H3602]] God [[H430]] shake out [[H5287]] every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] from his house, [[H1004]] and from his labour, [[H3018]] that [[H834]] performeth [[H6965]] not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] promise, [[H1697]] even thus [[H3602]] be [[H1961]] he shaken out, [[H5287]] and emptied. [[H7386]] And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] said, [[H559]] Amen, [[H543]] and praised [[H1984]] the Lord. [[H3068]] And the people [[H5971]] did [[H6213]] according to this [[H2088]] promise. [[H1697]]

### 14
Moreover [[H1571]] from the time [[H3117]] that [[H834]] I was appointed [[H6680]] to be [[H1961]] their governor [[H6346]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] from the twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] even unto [[H5704]] the two [[H8147]] and thirtieth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of Artaxerxes [[H783]] the king, [[H4428]] twelve [[H8147]] years, [[H8141]] I [[H589]] and my brethren [[H251]] have not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] the bread [[H3899]] of the governor. [[H6346]]

### 15
But the former [[H7223]] governors [[H6346]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] me were chargeable [[H3513]] unto [[H5921]] the people, [[H5971]] and had taken [[H3947]] of them bread [[H3899]] and wine, [[H3196]] beside [[H310]] forty [[H705]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver; [[H3701]] yea, even [[H1571]] their servants [[H5288]] bare rule [[H7980]] over [[H5921]] the people: [[H5971]] but so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] I, [[H589]] because [[H6440]] of the fear [[H3374]] of God. [[H430]]

### 16
Yea, also [[H1571]] I continued [[H2388]] in the work [[H4399]] of this [[H2063]] wall, [[H2346]] neither [[H3808]] bought [[H7069]] we any land: [[H7704]] and all [[H3605]] my servants [[H5288]] gathered [[H6908]] thither [[H8033]] unto [[H5921]] the work. [[H4399]]

### 17
Moreover at [[H5921]] my table [[H7979]] an hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] of the Jews [[H3064]] and rulers, [[H5461]] beside those that came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] us from among [[H4480]] the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] about us. [[H5439]]

### 18
Now which [[H834]] was [[H1961]] prepared [[H6213]] daily [[H3117]] one [[H259]] ox [[H7794]] six [[H8337]] choice [[H1305]] sheep; [[H6629]] also fowls [[H6833]] were prepared [[H6213]] for me, and once [[H996]] in ten [[H6235]] days [[H3117]] store [[H7235]] of all [[H3605]] sorts of wine: [[H3196]] yet for all [[H5973]] this [[H2088]] required [[H1245]] not [[H3808]] I the bread [[H3899]] of the governor, [[H6346]] because [[H3588]] the bondage [[H5656]] was heavy [[H3513]] upon [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]

### 19
Think [[H2142]] upon me, my God, [[H430]] for good, [[H2896]] to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] for [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]
