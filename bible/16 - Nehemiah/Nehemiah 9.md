### 1
Now in the twenty [[H6242]] and fourth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of this [[H2088]] month [[H2320]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were assembled [[H622]] with fasting, [[H6685]] and with sackclothes, [[H8242]] and earth [[H127]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 2
And the seed [[H2233]] of Israel [[H3478]] separated themselves [[H914]] from all [[H3605]] strangers, [[H1121]] and stood [[H5975]] and confessed [[H3034]] their sins, [[H2403]] and the iniquities [[H5771]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 3
And they stood up [[H6965]] in [[H5921]] their place, [[H5977]] and read [[H7121]] in the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] fourth part [[H7243]] of the day; [[H3117]] and fourth part [[H7243]] they confessed, [[H3034]] and worshipped [[H7812]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]]

### 4
Then stood up [[H6965]] upon [[H5921]] the stairs, [[H4608]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] Jeshua, [[H3442]] and Bani, [[H1137]] Kadmiel, [[H6934]] Shebaniah, [[H7645]] Bunni, [[H1138]] Sherebiah, [[H8274]] Bani, [[H1137]] Chenani, [[H3662]] and cried [[H2199]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]]

### 5
Then the Levites, [[H3881]] Jeshua, [[H3442]] and Kadmiel, [[H6934]] Bani, [[H1137]] Hashabniah, [[H2813]] Sherebiah, [[H8274]] Hodijah, [[H1941]] Shebaniah, [[H7645]] Pethahiah, [[H6611]] said, [[H559]] Stand up [[H6965]] bless [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] for ever [[H5769]] and [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]] and blessed [[H1288]] be thy glorious [[H3519]] name, [[H8034]] which is exalted [[H7311]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] blessing [[H1293]] and praise. [[H8416]]

### 6
Thou, [[H859]] thou, [[H1931]] Lord [[H3068]] alone; [[H905]] thou [[H853]] hast made [[H6213]] heaven, [[H8064]] the heaven [[H8064]] of heavens, [[H8064]] with all [[H3605]] their host, [[H6635]] the earth, [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein, [[H5921]] the seas, [[H3220]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein, and thou [[H859]] preservest [[H2421]] them all; [[H3605]] and the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] worshippeth [[H7812]] thee. [[H7812]]

### 7
Thou [[H859]] the Lord [[H3068]] the God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] didst choose [[H977]] Abram, [[H87]] and broughtest him forth [[H3318]] out of Ur [[H218]] of the Chaldees, [[H3778]] and gavest [[H7760]] him the name [[H8034]] of Abraham; [[H85]]

### 8
And foundest [[H4672]] his heart [[H3824]] faithful [[H539]] before [[H6440]] thee, and madest [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] him to give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] the Hittites, [[H2850]] the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] and the Jebusites, [[H2983]] and the Girgashites, [[H1622]] to give [[H5414]] to his seed, [[H2233]] and hast performed [[H6965]] thy words; [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] righteous: [[H6662]]

### 9
And didst see [[H7200]] the affliction [[H6040]] of our fathers [[H1]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and heardest [[H8085]] their cry [[H2201]] by [[H5921]] the Red [[H5488]] sea; [[H3220]]

### 10
And shewedst [[H5414]] signs [[H226]] and wonders [[H4159]] upon Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and on all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5650]] and on all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of his land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] thou knewest [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they dealt proudly [[H2102]] against [[H5921]] them. So didst thou get [[H6213]] thee a name, [[H8034]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 11
And thou didst divide [[H1234]] the sea [[H3220]] before [[H6440]] them, so that they went through [[H5674]] the midst [[H8432]] of the sea [[H3220]] on the dry land; [[H3004]] and their persecutors [[H7291]] thou threwest [[H7993]] into the deeps, [[H4688]] as [[H3644]] a stone [[H68]] into the mighty [[H5794]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 12
Moreover thou leddest [[H5148]] them in the day [[H3119]] by a cloudy [[H6051]] pillar; [[H5982]] and in the night [[H3915]] by a pillar [[H5982]] of fire, [[H784]] to give them light [[H215]]  in [[H853]] the way [[H1870]] wherein [[H834]] they should go. [[H1980]]

### 13
Thou camest down [[H3381]] also upon [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]] and spakest [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] them from heaven, [[H8064]] and gavest [[H5414]] them right [[H3477]] judgments, [[H4941]] and true [[H571]] laws, [[H8451]] good [[H2896]] statutes [[H2706]] and commandments: [[H4687]]

### 14
And madest known [[H3045]] unto them thy holy [[H6944]] sabbath, [[H7676]] and commandedst [[H6680]] them precepts, [[H4687]] statutes, [[H2706]] and laws, [[H8451]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses [[H4872]] thy servant: [[H5650]]

### 15
And gavest [[H5414]] them bread [[H3899]] from heaven [[H8064]] for their hunger, [[H7458]] and broughtest forth [[H3318]] water [[H4325]] for them out of the rock [[H5553]] for their thirst, [[H6772]] and promisedst [[H559]] them that they should go in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou hadst sworn [[H3027]] to give [[H5414]] them. [[H5414]]

### 16
But they [[H1992]] and our fathers [[H1]] dealt proudly, [[H2102]] and hardened [[H7185]] their necks, [[H6203]] and hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] to [[H413]] thy commandments, [[H4687]]

### 17
And refused [[H3985]] to obey, [[H8085]] neither [[H3808]] were mindful [[H2142]] of thy wonders [[H6381]] that [[H834]] thou didst [[H6213]] among [[H5973]] them; but hardened [[H7185]] their necks, [[H6203]] and in their rebellion [[H4805]] appointed [[H5414]] a captain [[H7218]] to return [[H7725]] to their bondage: [[H5659]] but thou [[H859]] a God [[H433]] ready to pardon, [[H5547]] gracious [[H2587]] and merciful, [[H7349]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] and of great [[H7227]] kindness, [[H2617]] and forsookest [[H5800]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 18
Yea, [[H637]] when [[H3588]] they had made [[H6213]] them a molten [[H4541]] calf, [[H5695]] and said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] thy God [[H430]] that [[H834]] brought thee up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and had wrought [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] provocations; [[H5007]]

### 19
Yet thou [[H859]] in thy manifold [[H7227]] mercies [[H7356]] forsookest [[H5800]] them not [[H3808]] in the wilderness: [[H4057]] the pillar [[H5982]] of the cloud [[H6051]] departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from [[H5921]] them by day, [[H3119]] to lead [[H5148]] them in the way; [[H1870]] neither the pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] by night, [[H3915]] to shew them light, [[H215]] and the way [[H1870]] wherein [[H834]] they should go. [[H1980]]

### 20
Thou gavest [[H5414]] also thy good [[H2896]] spirit [[H7307]] to instruct [[H7919]] them, and withheldest [[H4513]] not [[H3808]] thy manna [[H4478]] from their mouth, [[H6310]] and gavest [[H5414]] them water [[H4325]] for their thirst. [[H6772]]

### 21
Yea, forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] didst thou sustain [[H3557]] them in the wilderness, [[H4057]] they lacked [[H2637]] nothing; [[H3808]] their clothes [[H8008]] waxed not old, [[H1086]] and their feet [[H7272]] swelled [[H1216]] not. [[H3808]]

### 22
Moreover thou gavest [[H5414]] them kingdoms [[H4467]] and nations, [[H5971]] and didst divide [[H2505]] them into corners: [[H6285]] so they possessed [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] of Sihon, [[H5511]] and the land [[H776]] of the king [[H4428]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] and the land [[H776]] of Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 23
Their children [[H1121]] also multipliedst [[H7235]] thou as the stars [[H3556]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and broughtest [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land, [[H776]] concerning which [[H834]] thou hadst promised [[H559]] to their fathers, [[H1]] that they should go in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]]

### 24
So the children [[H1121]] went in [[H935]] and possessed [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] and thou subduedst [[H3665]] before [[H6440]]  them [[H853]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and gavest [[H5414]] them into their hands, [[H3027]] with their kings, [[H4428]] and the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] that they might do [[H6213]] with them as they would. [[H7522]]

### 25
And they took [[H3920]] strong [[H1219]] cities, [[H5892]] and a fat [[H8082]] land, [[H127]] and possessed [[H3423]] houses [[H1004]] full [[H4392]] of all [[H3605]] goods, [[H2898]] wells [[H953]] digged, [[H2672]] vineyards, [[H3754]] and oliveyards, [[H2132]] and fruit [[H3978]] trees [[H6086]] in abundance: [[H7230]] so they did eat, [[H398]] and were filled, [[H7646]] and became fat, [[H8080]] and delighted themselves [[H5727]] in thy great [[H1419]] goodness. [[H2898]]

### 26
Nevertheless they were disobedient, [[H4784]] and rebelled [[H4775]] against thee, and cast [[H7993]] thy law [[H8451]] behind [[H310]] their backs, [[H1458]] and slew [[H2026]] thy prophets [[H5030]] which [[H834]] testified [[H5749]] against them to turn [[H7725]] them to [[H413]] thee, and they wrought [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] provocations. [[H5007]]

### 27
Therefore thou deliveredst [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H6862]] who vexed [[H6887]] them: and in the time [[H6256]] of their trouble, [[H6869]] when they cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] thee, thou [[H859]] heardest [[H8085]] from heaven; [[H8064]] and according to thy manifold [[H7227]] mercies [[H7356]] thou gavest [[H5414]] them saviours, [[H3467]] who saved [[H3467]] them out of the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies. [[H6862]]

### 28
But after they had rest, [[H5117]] they did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] again [[H7725]] before [[H6440]] thee: therefore leftest [[H5800]] thou them in the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H341]] so that they had the dominion [[H7287]] over them: yet when they returned, [[H7725]] and cried [[H2199]] unto thee, thou [[H859]] heardest [[H8085]] from heaven; [[H8064]] and many [[H7227]] times [[H6256]] didst thou deliver [[H5337]] them according to thy mercies; [[H7356]]

### 29
And testifiedst [[H5749]] against them, that thou mightest bring them again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] thy law: [[H8451]] yet they [[H1992]] dealt proudly, [[H2102]] and hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto thy commandments, [[H4687]] but sinned [[H2398]] against thy judgments, [[H4941]] (which [[H834]] if a man [[H120]] do, [[H6213]] he shall live [[H2421]] in them;) and withdrew [[H5414]] the shoulder, [[H3802]] and hardened [[H7185]] their neck, [[H6203]] and would not [[H3808]] hear. [[H8085]]

### 30
Yet many [[H7227]] years [[H8141]] didst thou forbear [[H4900]] them, and testifiedst [[H5749]] against them by thy spirit [[H7307]] in [[H3027]] thy prophets: [[H5030]] yet would they not [[H3808]] give ear: [[H238]] therefore gavest [[H5414]] thou them into the hand [[H3027]] of the people [[H5971]] of the lands. [[H776]]

### 31
Nevertheless for thy great [[H7227]] mercies' [[H7356]] sake thou didst [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] utterly consume [[H3617]] them, nor [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] them; for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a gracious [[H2587]] and merciful [[H7349]] God. [[H410]]

### 32
Now [[H6258]] therefore, our God, [[H430]] the great, [[H1419]] the mighty, [[H1368]] and the terrible [[H3372]] God, [[H410]] who keepest [[H8104]] covenant [[H1285]] and mercy, [[H2617]] let not [[H408]] all [[H3605]] the trouble [[H8513]] seem little [[H4591]] before [[H6440]] thee, that [[H834]] hath come upon [[H4672]] us, on our kings, [[H4428]] on our princes, [[H8269]] and on our priests, [[H3548]] and on our prophets, [[H5030]] and on our fathers, [[H1]] and on all [[H3605]] thy people, [[H5971]] since the time [[H3117]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 33
Howbeit thou [[H859]] just [[H6662]] in [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that is brought [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us; for [[H3588]] thou hast done [[H6213]] right, [[H571]] but we [[H587]] have done wickedly: [[H7561]]

### 34
Neither have our kings, [[H4428]] our princes, [[H8269]] our priests, [[H3548]] nor [[H3808]] our fathers, [[H1]] kept [[H6213]] thy law, [[H8451]] nor [[H3808]] hearkened [[H7181]] unto [[H413]] thy commandments [[H4687]] and thy testimonies, [[H5715]] wherewith [[H834]] thou didst testify [[H5749]] against them. [[H5749]]

### 35
For they [[H1992]] have not [[H3808]] served [[H5647]] thee in their kingdom, [[H4438]] and in thy great [[H7227]] goodness [[H2898]] that [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] them, and in the large [[H7342]] and fat [[H8082]] land [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] them, neither [[H3808]] turned [[H7725]] they from their wicked [[H7451]] works. [[H4611]]

### 36
Behold, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] servants [[H5650]] this day, [[H3117]] and the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] unto our fathers [[H1]] to eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] thereof and the good [[H2898]] thereof, behold, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] servants [[H5650]] in [[H5921]] it: [[H5921]]

### 37
And it yieldeth much [[H7235]] increase [[H8393]] unto the kings [[H4428]] whom [[H834]] thou hast set [[H5414]] over [[H5921]] us because of our sins: [[H2403]] also they have dominion [[H4910]] over [[H5921]] our bodies, [[H1472]] and over our cattle, [[H929]] at their pleasure, [[H7522]] and we [[H587]] in great [[H1419]] distress. [[H6869]]

### 38
And because of all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] we [[H587]] make [[H3772]] a sure [[H548]] and write [[H3789]] and our princes, [[H8269]] Levites, [[H3881]] priests, [[H3548]] seal [[H2856]]
