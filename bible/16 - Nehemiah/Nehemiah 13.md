### 1
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they read [[H7121]] in the book [[H5612]] of Moses [[H4872]] in the audience [[H241]] of the people; [[H5971]] and therein was found [[H4672]] written, [[H3789]] that [[H834]] the Ammonite [[H5984]] and the Moabite [[H4125]] should not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] into the congregation [[H6951]] of God [[H430]] for [[H5704]] ever; [[H5769]]

### 2
Because [[H3588]] they met [[H6923]] not [[H3808]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] with bread [[H3899]] and with water, [[H4325]] but hired [[H7936]] Balaam [[H1109]] against [[H5921]] them, that he should curse [[H7043]] them: howbeit our God [[H430]] turned [[H2015]] the curse [[H7045]] into a blessing. [[H1293]]

### 3
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they had heard [[H8085]] the law, [[H8451]] that they separated [[H914]] from Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the mixed multitude. [[H6154]]

### 4
And before [[H6440]] this, [[H2088]] Eliashib [[H475]] the priest, [[H3548]] having the oversight [[H5414]] of the chamber [[H3957]] of the house [[H1004]] of our God, [[H430]] allied [[H7138]] unto Tobiah: [[H2900]]

### 5
And he had prepared [[H6213]] for him a great [[H1419]] chamber, [[H3957]] where [[H8033]] aforetime [[H6440]] they laid [[H5414]] the meat offerings, [[H4503]] the frankincense, [[H3828]] and the vessels, [[H3627]] and the tithes [[H4643]] of the corn, [[H1715]] the new wine, [[H8492]] and the oil, [[H3323]] which was commanded [[H4687]] to the Levites, [[H3881]] and the singers, [[H7891]] and the porters; [[H7778]] and the offerings [[H8641]] of the priests. [[H3548]]

### 6
But in all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] I at Jerusalem: [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] in the two [[H8147]] and thirtieth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of Artaxerxes [[H783]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] came [[H935]] I unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and after [[H7093]] certain days [[H3117]] obtained I leave [[H7592]] of [[H4480]] the king: [[H4428]]

### 7
And I came [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and understood [[H995]] of the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] Eliashib [[H475]] did [[H6213]] for Tobiah, [[H2900]] in preparing [[H6213]] him a chamber [[H5393]] in the courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

### 8
And it grieved [[H7489]] me sore: [[H3966]] therefore I cast forth [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] the household [[H1004]] stuff [[H3627]] of Tobiah [[H2900]] out of [[H2351]] the chamber. [[H3957]]

### 9
Then I commanded, [[H559]] and they cleansed [[H2891]] the chambers: [[H3957]] and thither [[H8033]] brought I again [[H7725]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] with [[H854]] the meat offering [[H4503]] and the frankincense. [[H3828]]

### 10
And I perceived [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the portions [[H4521]] of the Levites [[H3881]] had not [[H3808]] been given [[H5414]] for the Levites [[H3881]] and the singers, [[H7891]] that did [[H6213]] the work, [[H4399]] were fled [[H1272]] every one [[H376]] to his field. [[H7704]]

### 11
Then contended [[H7378]] I with [[H854]] the rulers, [[H5461]] and said, [[H559]] Why [[H4069]] is the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] forsaken? [[H5800]] And I gathered them together, [[H6908]] and set [[H5975]] them in [[H5921]] their place. [[H5977]]

### 12
Then brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] the tithe [[H4643]] of the corn [[H1715]] and the new wine [[H8492]] and the oil [[H3323]] unto the treasuries. [[H214]]

### 13
And I made treasurers [[H686]] over [[H5921]] the treasuries, [[H214]] Shelemiah [[H8018]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Zadok [[H6659]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and of [[H4480]] the Levites, [[H3881]] Pedaiah: [[H6305]] and next to [[H5921]] them [[H3027]] Hanan [[H2605]] the son [[H1121]] of Zaccur, [[H2139]] the son [[H1121]] of Mattaniah: [[H4983]] for [[H3588]] they were counted [[H2803]] faithful, [[H539]] and their office [[H5921]] to distribute [[H2505]] unto their brethren. [[H251]]

### 14
Remember [[H2142]] me, O my God, [[H430]] concerning [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] and wipe not out [[H4229]] my good deeds [[H2617]] that [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] for the house [[H1004]] of my God, [[H430]] and for the offices [[H4929]] thereof. [[H4929]]

### 15
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] saw [[H7200]] I in Judah [[H3063]] treading [[H1869]] wine presses [[H1660]] on the sabbath, [[H7676]] and bringing sheaves, [[H6194]] and lading [[H6006]] asses; [[H2543]] as also [[H637]] wine, [[H3196]] grapes, [[H6025]] and figs, [[H8384]] and all [[H3605]] burdens, [[H4853]] which they brought [[H935]] in into [[H935]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] day: [[H3117]] and I testified [[H5749]] in the day [[H3117]] wherein they sold [[H4376]] victuals. [[H6718]]

### 16
There dwelt [[H3427]] men of Tyre [[H6876]] also therein, which brought [[H935]] fish, [[H1709]] and all [[H3605]] manner of ware, [[H4377]] and sold [[H4376]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 17
Then I contended [[H7378]] with [[H854]] the nobles [[H2715]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and said [[H559]] unto them, What [[H4100]] evil [[H7451]] thing [[H1697]] this [[H2088]] that [[H834]] ye [[H859]] do, [[H6213]] and profane [[H2490]] the sabbath [[H7676]] day? [[H3117]]

### 18
Did [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] your fathers [[H1]] thus, [[H3541]] and did not our God [[H430]] bring [[H935]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] us, and upon [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city? [[H5892]] yet ye [[H859]] bring more [[H3254]] wrath [[H2740]] upon [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] by profaning [[H2490]] the sabbath. [[H7676]]

### 19
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that when [[H834]] the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] began to be dark [[H6751]] before [[H6440]] the sabbath, [[H7676]] I commanded [[H559]] that the gates [[H1817]] should be shut, [[H5462]] and charged [[H559]] that [[H834]] they should not [[H3808]] be opened [[H6605]] till [[H5704]] after [[H310]] the sabbath: [[H7676]] and of my servants [[H5288]] set [[H5975]] I at [[H5921]] the gates, [[H8179]] there should no [[H3808]] burden [[H4853]] be brought in [[H935]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]]

### 20
So the merchants [[H7402]] and sellers [[H4376]] of all [[H3605]] kind of ware [[H4465]] lodged [[H3885]] without [[H2351]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] once [[H6471]] or twice. [[H8147]]

### 21
Then I testified [[H5749]] against them, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Why [[H4069]] lodge [[H3885]] ye [[H859]] about [[H5048]] the wall? [[H2346]] if [[H518]] ye do again, [[H8138]] I will lay [[H7971]] hands [[H3027]] on you. From [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] forth came [[H935]] they no [[H3808]] on the sabbath. [[H7676]]

### 22
And I commanded [[H559]] the Levites [[H3881]] that [[H834]] they should [[H1961]] cleanse themselves, [[H2891]] and they should come [[H935]] keep [[H8104]] the gates, [[H8179]] to sanctify [[H6942]] the sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]] Remember [[H2142]] me, O my God, [[H430]] this [[H2063]] also, [[H1571]] and spare [[H2347]] me according to the greatness [[H7230]] of thy mercy. [[H2617]]

### 23
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] also [[H1571]] saw [[H7200]]  I [[H853]] Jews [[H3064]] had married [[H3427]] wives [[H802]] of Ashdod, [[H796]] of Ammon, [[H5984]] of Moab: [[H4125]]

### 24
And their children [[H1121]] spake [[H1696]] half [[H2677]] in the speech of Ashdod, [[H797]] and could [[H5234]] not [[H369]] speak [[H1696]] in the Jews' language, [[H3066]] but according to the language [[H3956]] of each [[H5971]] people. [[H5971]]

### 25
And I contended [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] them, and cursed [[H7043]] them, and smote [[H5221]] certain [[H376]] of them, and plucked off their hair, [[H4803]] and made them swear [[H7650]] by God, [[H430]] Ye shall not [[H518]] give [[H5414]] your daughters [[H1323]] unto their sons, [[H1121]] nor [[H518]] take [[H5375]] their daughters [[H1323]] unto your sons, [[H1121]] or for yourselves. [[H1121]]

### 26
Did not [[H3808]] Solomon [[H8010]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] sin [[H2398]] by [[H5921]] these things? [[H428]] yet among many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] was [[H1961]] there no [[H3808]] king [[H4428]] like him, [[H3644]] who was [[H1961]] beloved [[H157]] of his God, [[H430]] and God [[H430]] made [[H5414]] him king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]] nevertheless [[H1571]] even him did outlandish [[H5237]] women [[H802]] cause to sin. [[H2398]]

### 27
Shall we then hearken [[H8085]] unto you to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] evil, [[H7451]] to transgress [[H4603]] against our God [[H430]] in marrying [[H3427]] strange [[H5237]] wives? [[H802]]

### 28
And of the sons [[H1121]] of Joiada, [[H3111]] the son [[H1121]] of Eliashib [[H475]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] son in law [[H2860]] to Sanballat [[H5571]] the Horonite: [[H2772]] therefore I chased [[H1272]] him from [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 29
Remember [[H2142]] them, O my God, [[H430]] because [[H5921]] they have defiled [[H1352]] the priesthood, [[H3550]] and the covenant [[H1285]] of the priesthood, [[H3550]] and of the Levites. [[H3881]]

### 30
Thus cleansed [[H2891]] I them from all [[H3605]] strangers, [[H5236]] and appointed [[H5975]] the wards [[H4931]] of the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] every one [[H376]] in his business; [[H4399]]

### 31
And for the wood [[H6086]] offering, [[H7133]] at times [[H6256]] appointed, [[H2163]] and for the firstfruits. [[H1061]] Remember [[H2142]] me, O my God, [[H430]] for good. [[H2896]]
