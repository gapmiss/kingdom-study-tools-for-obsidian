### 1
But it came to pass, [[H1961]] that when [[H834]] Sanballat [[H5571]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] we [[H587]] builded [[H1129]] the wall, [[H2346]] he was wroth, [[H2734]] and took great [[H7235]] indignation, [[H3707]] and mocked [[H3932]] the Jews. [[H3064]]

### 2
And he spake [[H559]] before [[H6440]] his brethren [[H251]] and the army [[H2428]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] and said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] do [[H6213]] these feeble [[H537]] Jews? [[H3064]] will they fortify [[H5800]] themselves? will they sacrifice? [[H2076]] will they make an end [[H3615]] in a day? [[H3117]] will they revive [[H2421]] the stones [[H68]] out of the heaps [[H6194]] of the rubbish [[H6083]] which [[H1992]] are burned? [[H8313]]

### 3
Now Tobiah [[H2900]] the Ammonite [[H5984]] by him, [[H681]] and he said, [[H559]] Even [[H1571]] that which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] build, [[H1129]] if [[H518]] a fox [[H7776]] go up, [[H5927]] he shall even break down [[H6555]] their stone [[H68]] wall. [[H2346]]

### 4
Hear, [[H8085]] O our God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] we are [[H1961]] despised: [[H939]] and turn [[H7725]] their reproach [[H2781]] upon [[H413]] their own head, [[H7218]] and give [[H5414]] them for a prey [[H961]] in the land [[H776]] of captivity: [[H7633]]

### 5
And cover [[H3680]] not [[H408]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] and let not [[H408]] their sin [[H2403]] be blotted out [[H4229]] from before [[H6440]] thee: for [[H3588]] they have provoked to anger [[H3707]] before [[H5048]] the builders. [[H1129]]

### 6
So built [[H1129]]  we [[H853]] the wall; [[H2346]] and all [[H3605]] the wall [[H2346]] was joined together [[H7194]] unto [[H5704]] the half [[H2677]] thereof: for the people [[H5971]] had [[H1961]] a mind [[H3820]] to work. [[H6213]]

### 7
But it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Sanballat, [[H5571]] and Tobiah, [[H2900]] and the Arabians, [[H6163]] and the Ammonites, [[H5984]] and the Ashdodites, [[H796]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the walls [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] were made up, [[H724]] that [[H3588]] the breaches [[H6555]] began [[H2490]] to be stopped, [[H5640]] then they were very [[H3966]] wroth, [[H2734]]

### 8
And conspired [[H7194]] all [[H3605]] of them together [[H3162]] to come [[H935]] to fight [[H3898]] against Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and to hinder [[H6213]] it. [[H8442]]

### 9
Nevertheless we made our prayer [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] our God, [[H430]] and set [[H5975]] a watch [[H4929]] against [[H5921]] them day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] because [[H6440]] of them. [[H6440]]

### 10
And Judah [[H3063]] said, [[H559]] The strength [[H3581]] of the bearers of burdens [[H5449]] is decayed, [[H3782]] and much [[H7235]] rubbish; [[H6083]] so that we [[H587]] are not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to build [[H1129]] the wall. [[H2346]]

### 11
And our adversaries [[H6862]] said, [[H559]] They shall not [[H3808]] know, [[H3045]] neither [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] till [[H5704]] we come [[H935]] in [[H413]] the midst among [[H8432]] them, and slay [[H2026]]  them, and cause [[H853]] the work [[H4399]] to cease. [[H7673]]

### 12
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that when [[H834]] the Jews [[H3064]] which dwelt [[H3427]] by them [[H681]] came, [[H935]] they said [[H559]] unto us ten [[H6235]] times, [[H6471]] From all [[H3605]] places [[H4725]] whence [[H834]] ye shall return [[H7725]] unto [[H5921]] us [[H5921]]

### 13
Therefore set [[H5975]] I in the lower [[H8482]] places [[H4725]] behind [[H310]] the wall, [[H2346]] on the higher places, [[H6706]] I even set [[H5975]] the people [[H5971]] after their families [[H4940]] with [[H5973]] their swords, [[H2719]] their spears, [[H7420]] and their bows. [[H7198]]

### 14
And I looked, [[H7200]] and rose up, [[H6965]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the nobles, [[H2715]] and to [[H413]] the rulers, [[H5461]] and to [[H413]] the rest [[H3499]] of the people, [[H5971]] Be not [[H408]] ye afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] them: remember [[H2142]] the Lord, [[H136]] great [[H1419]] and terrible, [[H3372]] and fight [[H3898]] for [[H5921]] your brethren, [[H251]] your sons, [[H1121]] and your daughters, [[H1323]] your wives, [[H802]] and your houses. [[H1004]]

### 15
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] our enemies [[H341]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] it was known [[H3045]] unto us, and God [[H430]] had brought [[H6565]] their counsel [[H6098]]  to nought, [[H853]] that we returned [[H7725]] all [[H3605]] of us to [[H413]] the wall, [[H2346]] every one [[H376]] unto [[H413]] his work. [[H4399]]

### 16
And it came to pass [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] forth, the half [[H2677]] of my servants [[H5288]] wrought [[H6213]] in the work, [[H4399]] and the other half [[H2677]] of them held [[H2388]] both the spears, [[H7420]] the shields, [[H4043]] and the bows, [[H7198]] and the habergeons; [[H8302]] and the rulers [[H8269]] behind [[H310]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 17
They which builded [[H1129]] on the wall, [[H2346]] and they that bare [[H5375]] burdens, [[H5447]] with those that laded, [[H6006]] with one [[H259]] of his hands [[H3027]] wrought [[H6213]] in the work, [[H4399]] and with the other [[H259]] held [[H2388]] a weapon. [[H7973]]

### 18
For the builders, [[H1129]] every one [[H376]] had his sword [[H2719]] girded [[H631]] by [[H5921]] his side, [[H4975]] and builded. [[H1129]] And he that sounded [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] by me. [[H681]]

### 19
And I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the nobles, [[H2715]] and to [[H413]] the rulers, [[H5461]] and to [[H413]] the rest [[H3499]] of the people, [[H5971]] The work [[H4399]] great [[H7235]] and large, [[H7342]] and we [[H587]] are separated [[H6504]] upon [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] one [[H376]] far from [[H7350]] another. [[H251]]

### 20
In what [[H834]] place [[H4725]] ye hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] resort [[H6908]] ye thither [[H8033]] unto [[H413]] us: our God [[H430]] shall fight [[H3898]] for us. [[H3898]]

### 21
So we [[H587]] laboured [[H6213]] in the work: [[H4399]] and half [[H2677]] of them held [[H2388]] the spears [[H7420]] from the rising [[H5927]] of the morning [[H7837]] till [[H5704]] the stars [[H3556]] appeared. [[H3318]]

### 22
Likewise [[H1571]] at the same [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] said [[H559]] I unto the people, [[H5971]] Let every one [[H376]] with his servant [[H5288]] lodge [[H3885]] within [[H8432]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that in the night [[H3915]] they may be [[H1961]] a guard [[H4929]] to us, and labour [[H4399]] on the day. [[H3117]]

### 23
So neither [[H369]] I, [[H589]] nor my brethren, [[H251]] nor my servants, [[H5288]] nor the men [[H582]] of the guard [[H4929]] which [[H834]] followed [[H310]] me, none [[H369]] of us [[H587]] put off [[H6584]] our clothes, [[H899]] every one [[H376]] put them off [[H7973]] for washing. [[H4325]]
