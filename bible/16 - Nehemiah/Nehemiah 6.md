### 1
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Sanballat, [[H5571]] and Tobiah, [[H2900]] and Geshem [[H1654]] the Arabian, [[H6163]] and the rest [[H3499]] of our enemies, [[H341]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] I had builded [[H1129]] the wall, [[H2346]] and there was no [[H3808]] breach [[H6556]] left [[H3498]] therein; (though [[H1571]] at [[H5704]] that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I had not [[H3808]] set up [[H5975]] the doors [[H1817]] upon the gates;) [[H8179]]

### 2
That Sanballat [[H5571]] and Geshem [[H1654]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] Come, [[H1980]] let us meet [[H3259]] together [[H3162]] in the villages [[H3715]] in the plain [[H1237]] of Ono. [[H207]] But they [[H1992]] thought [[H2803]] to do [[H6213]] me mischief. [[H7451]]

### 3
And I sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H5921]] them, saying, [[H559]] I [[H589]] doing [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] work, [[H4399]] so that I cannot [[H3201]] come down: [[H3381]] why [[H4100]] should the work [[H4399]] cease, [[H7673]] whilst [[H834]] I leave [[H7503]] it, and come down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] you? [[H413]]

### 4
Yet they sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] me four [[H702]] times [[H6471]] after this [[H2088]] sort; [[H1697]] and I answered [[H7725]] them after the same [[H2088]] manner. [[H1697]]

### 5
Then sent [[H7971]] Sanballat [[H5571]] his servant [[H5288]] unto [[H413]] me in like [[H2088]] manner [[H1697]] the fifth [[H2549]] time [[H6471]] with an open [[H6605]] letter [[H107]] in his hand; [[H3027]]

### 6
Wherein written, [[H3789]] It is reported [[H8085]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] and Gashmu [[H1654]] saith [[H559]] thou [[H859]] and the Jews [[H3064]] think [[H2803]] to rebel: [[H4775]] for [[H5921]] which cause [[H3651]] thou [[H859]] buildest [[H1129]] the wall, [[H2346]] that thou [[H859]] mayest be [[H1933]] their king, [[H4428]] according to these [[H428]] words. [[H1697]]

### 7
And thou hast also [[H1571]] appointed [[H5975]] prophets [[H5030]] to preach [[H7121]] of [[H5921]] thee at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] a king [[H4428]] in Judah: [[H3063]] and now [[H6258]] shall it be reported [[H8085]] to the king [[H4428]] according to these [[H428]] words. [[H1697]] Come [[H1980]] now [[H6258]] therefore, and let us take counsel [[H3289]] together. [[H3162]]

### 8
Then I sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] There are no [[H3808]] such [[H428]] things [[H1697]] done [[H1961]] as [[H834]] thou [[H859]] sayest, [[H559]] but [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] feignest [[H908]] them out of thine own heart. [[H3820]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] they all [[H3605]] made us afraid, [[H3372]] saying, [[H559]] Their hands [[H3027]] shall be weakened [[H7503]] from [[H4480]] the work, [[H4399]] that it be not [[H3808]] done. [[H6213]] Now [[H6258]] therefore, strengthen [[H2388]] my hands. [[H3027]]

### 10
Afterward I [[H589]] came [[H935]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Shemaiah [[H8098]] the son [[H1121]] of Delaiah [[H1806]] the son [[H1121]] of Mehetabeel, [[H4105]] who [[H1931]] shut up; [[H6113]] and he said, [[H559]] Let us meet together [[H3259]] in [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] within [[H8432]] the temple, [[H1964]] and let us shut [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] of the temple: [[H1964]] for [[H3588]] they will come [[H935]] to slay [[H2026]] thee; yea, in the night [[H3915]] will they come [[H935]] to slay [[H2026]] thee. [[H2026]]

### 11
And I said, [[H559]] Should such as I [[H3644]] a man [[H376]] flee? [[H1272]] and who [[H4310]] that, [[H834]] as I [[H3644]] would go [[H935]] into [[H413]] the temple [[H1964]] to save his life? [[H2425]] I will not [[H3808]] go in. [[H935]]

### 12
And, lo, [[H2009]] I perceived [[H5234]] that God [[H430]] had not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] him; but [[H3588]] that he pronounced [[H1696]] this prophecy [[H5016]] against [[H5921]] me: for Tobiah [[H2900]] and Sanballat [[H5571]] had hired [[H7936]] him. [[H7936]]

### 13
Therefore [[H4616]] he [[H1931]] hired, [[H7936]] that [[H4616]] I should be afraid, [[H3372]] and do so, [[H6213]] and sin, [[H2398]] and they might have [[H1961]] for an evil [[H7451]] report, [[H8034]] that [[H4616]] they might reproach [[H2778]] me. [[H2778]]

### 14
My God, [[H430]] think [[H2142]] thou upon Tobiah [[H2900]] and Sanballat [[H5571]] according to these [[H428]] their works, [[H4639]] and [[H1571]] on the prophetess [[H5031]] Noadiah, [[H5129]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the prophets, [[H5030]] that [[H834]] would have [[H1961]] put me in fear. [[H3372]]

### 15
So the wall [[H2346]] was finished [[H7999]] in the twenty [[H6242]] and fifth [[H2568]] of Elul, [[H435]] in fifty [[H2572]] and two [[H8147]] days. [[H3117]]

### 16
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that when [[H834]] all [[H3605]] our enemies [[H341]] heard [[H8085]] and all [[H3605]] the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] about us [[H5439]] saw [[H7200]] they were much [[H3966]] cast down [[H5307]] in their own eyes: [[H5869]] for they perceived [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] work [[H4399]] was wrought [[H6213]] of [[H854]] our God. [[H430]]

### 17
Moreover [[H1571]] in those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the nobles [[H2715]] of Judah [[H3063]] sent [[H1980]] many [[H7235]] letters [[H107]] unto [[H5921]] Tobiah, [[H2900]] and of Tobiah [[H2900]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] in Judah [[H3063]] sworn [[H1167]] unto him, because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the son in law [[H2860]] of Shechaniah [[H7935]] the son [[H1121]] of Arah; [[H733]] and his son [[H1121]] Johanan [[H3076]] had taken [[H3947]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Meshullam [[H4918]] the son [[H1121]] of Berechiah. [[H1296]]

### 19
Also [[H1571]] they reported [[H559]] his good deeds [[H2896]] before [[H6440]] me, and uttered [[H3318]] my words [[H1697]] to him. Tobiah [[H2900]] sent [[H7971]] letters [[H107]] to put me in fear. [[H3372]]
