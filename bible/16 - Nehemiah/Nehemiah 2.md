### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the month [[H2320]] Nisan, [[H5212]] in the twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of Artaxerxes [[H783]] the king, [[H4428]] wine [[H3196]] before [[H6440]] him: and I took up [[H5375]] the wine, [[H3196]] and gave [[H5414]] unto the king. [[H4428]] Now I had not [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] sad [[H7451]] in his presence. [[H6440]]

### 2
Wherefore the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto me, Why [[H4069]] thy countenance [[H6440]] sad, [[H7451]] seeing thou [[H859]] not [[H369]] sick? [[H2470]] this [[H2088]] nothing [[H369]] but [[H3588]] sorrow [[H7455]] of heart. [[H3820]] Then I was very [[H3966]] sore [[H7235]] afraid, [[H3372]]

### 3
And said [[H559]] unto the king, [[H4428]] Let the king [[H4428]] live [[H2421]] for ever: [[H5769]] why [[H4069]] should not [[H3808]] my countenance [[H6440]] be sad, [[H7489]] when [[H834]] the city, [[H5892]] the place [[H1004]] of my fathers' [[H1]] sepulchres, [[H6913]] waste, [[H2720]] and the gates [[H8179]] thereof are consumed [[H398]] with fire? [[H784]]

### 4
Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto me, For [[H5921]] what [[H4100]] dost thou [[H859]] make request? [[H1245]] So I prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the God [[H430]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 5
And I said [[H559]] unto the king, [[H4428]] If [[H518]] it please [[H2895]] the king, [[H4428]] and if [[H518]] thy servant [[H5650]] have found favour [[H3190]] in thy sight, [[H6440]] that [[H834]] thou wouldest send [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] Judah, [[H3063]] unto [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of my fathers' [[H1]] sepulchres, [[H6913]] that I may build [[H1129]] it. [[H1129]]

### 6
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto me, (the queen [[H7694]] also sitting [[H3427]] by him,) [[H681]] For [[H5704]] how long [[H4970]] shall thy journey [[H4109]] be? [[H1961]] and when [[H4970]] wilt thou return? [[H7725]] So it pleased [[H3190]] the king [[H4428]] to send [[H7971]] me; and I set [[H5414]] him a time. [[H2165]]

### 7
Moreover I said [[H559]] unto the king, [[H4428]] If [[H518]] it please [[H2895]] the king, [[H4428]] let letters [[H107]] be given [[H5414]] me to [[H5921]] the governors [[H6346]] beyond [[H5676]] the river, [[H5104]] that [[H834]] they may convey me over [[H5674]] till [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] into [[H413]] Judah; [[H3063]]

### 8
And a letter [[H107]] unto [[H413]] Asaph [[H623]] the keeper [[H8104]] of the king's [[H4428]] forest, [[H6508]] that [[H834]] he may give [[H5414]] me timber [[H6086]] to make beams [[H7136]]  for [[H853]] the gates [[H8179]] of the palace [[H1002]] which [[H834]] to the house, [[H1004]] and for the wall [[H2346]] of the city, [[H5892]] and for the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] I shall enter into. [[H935]] And the king [[H4428]] granted [[H5414]] me, according to the good [[H2896]] hand [[H3027]] of my God [[H430]] upon [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 9
Then I came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the governors [[H6346]] beyond [[H5676]] the river, [[H5104]] and gave [[H5414]]  them [[H853]] the king's [[H4428]] letters. [[H107]] Now the king [[H4428]] had sent [[H7971]] captains [[H8269]] of the army [[H2428]] and horsemen [[H6571]] with [[H5973]] me. [[H5973]]

### 10
When Sanballat [[H5571]] the Horonite, [[H2772]] and Tobiah [[H2900]] the servant, [[H5650]] the Ammonite, [[H5984]] heard [[H8085]] it grieved [[H7489]] them exceedingly [[H7451]] that [[H834]] there was come [[H935]] a man [[H120]] to seek [[H1245]] the welfare [[H2896]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
So I came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]]

### 12
And I arose [[H6965]] in the night, [[H3915]] I [[H589]] and some few [[H4592]] men [[H376]] with [[H5973]] me; neither [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] I man [[H120]] what [[H4100]] my God [[H430]] had put [[H5414]] in [[H413]] my heart [[H3820]] to do [[H6213]] at Jerusalem: [[H3389]] neither [[H369]] beast [[H929]] with [[H5973]] me, save [[H3588]] the beast [[H929]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] rode upon. [[H7392]]

### 13
And I went out [[H3318]] by night [[H3915]] by the gate [[H8179]] of the valley, [[H1516]] even before [[H6440]] the dragon [[H8577]] well, [[H5869]] and to [[H413]] the dung [[H830]] port, [[H8179]] and viewed [[H7663]] the walls [[H2346]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] were broken down, [[H0]] and the gates [[H8179]] thereof were consumed [[H398]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 14
Then I went on [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] of the fountain, [[H5869]] and to [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] pool: [[H1295]] but no [[H369]] place [[H4725]] for the beast [[H929]] under [[H8478]] me to pass. [[H5674]]

### 15
Then went I up [[H5927]] in the night [[H3915]] by the brook, [[H5158]] and viewed [[H7663]] the wall, [[H2346]] and turned back, [[H7725]] and entered [[H935]] by the gate [[H8179]] of the valley, [[H1516]] and returned. [[H7725]]

### 16
And the rulers [[H5461]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] whither [[H575]] I went, [[H1980]] or what [[H4100]] I [[H589]] did; [[H6213]] neither [[H3808]] had I as [[H5704]] yet [[H3651]] told [[H5046]] to the Jews, [[H3064]] nor to the priests, [[H3548]] nor to the nobles, [[H2715]] nor to the rulers, [[H5461]] nor to the rest [[H3499]] that did [[H6213]] the work. [[H4399]]

### 17
Then said [[H559]] I unto [[H413]] them, Ye [[H859]] see [[H7200]] the distress [[H7451]] that [[H834]] we [[H587]] in, how [[H834]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] waste, [[H2720]] and the gates [[H8179]] thereof are burned [[H3341]] with fire: [[H784]] come, [[H1980]] and let us build up [[H1129]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that we be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] a reproach. [[H2781]]

### 18
Then I told [[H5046]]  them of [[H853]] the hand [[H3027]] of my God [[H430]] which [[H834]] was good [[H2896]] upon [[H5921]] me; as also [[H637]] the king's [[H4428]] words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he had spoken [[H559]] unto me. And they said, [[H559]] Let us rise up [[H6965]] and build. [[H1129]] So they strengthened [[H2388]] their hands [[H3027]] for good [[H2896]]

### 19
But when Sanballat [[H5571]] the Horonite, [[H2772]] and Tobiah [[H2900]] the servant, [[H5650]] the Ammonite, [[H5984]] and Geshem [[H1654]] the Arabian, [[H6163]] heard [[H8085]] they laughed us to scorn, [[H3932]] and despised [[H959]] us, and said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] ye [[H859]] do? [[H6213]] will ye [[H859]] rebel [[H4775]] against [[H5921]] the king? [[H4428]]

### 20
Then answered [[H7725]] I them, and said [[H559]] unto them, The God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] he [[H1931]] will prosper [[H6743]] us; therefore we [[H587]] his servants [[H5650]] will arise [[H6965]] and build: [[H1129]] but ye have no [[H369]] portion, [[H2506]] nor right, [[H6666]] nor memorial, [[H2146]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
