### 1
Then Joseph [[H3130]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] refrain himself [[H662]] before all [[H3605]] them that stood [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] him; and he cried, [[H7121]] Cause every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] to go out [[H3318]] from [[H5921]] me. And there stood [[H5975]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] with [[H854]] him, while Joseph [[H3130]] made himself known [[H3045]] unto [[H413]] his brethren. [[H251]]

### 2
And he wept [[H6963]] aloud: [[H5414]] and the Egyptians [[H4713]] and the house [[H1004]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] heard. [[H8085]]

### 3
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] I [[H589]] Joseph; [[H3130]] doth my father [[H1]] yet [[H5750]] live? [[H2416]] And his brethren [[H251]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] answer [[H6030]] him; for [[H3588]] they were troubled [[H926]] at his presence. [[H6440]]

### 4
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] Come near [[H5066]] to [[H413]] me, I pray you. [[H4994]] And they came near. [[H5066]] And he said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] Joseph [[H3130]] your brother, [[H251]] whom [[H834]] ye sold [[H4376]] into Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 5
Now [[H6258]] therefore be not [[H408]] grieved, [[H6087]] nor [[H408]] angry [[H2734]] with yourselves, [[H5869]] that [[H3588]] ye sold [[H4376]] me hither: [[H2008]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] did send [[H7971]] me before you [[H6440]] to preserve life. [[H4241]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] these [[H2088]] two years [[H8141]] the famine [[H7458]] in [[H7130]] the land: [[H776]] and yet [[H5750]] five [[H2568]] years, [[H8141]] in the which [[H834]] neither [[H369]] earing [[H2758]] nor harvest. [[H7105]]

### 7
And God [[H430]] sent [[H7971]] me before you [[H6440]] to preserve [[H7760]] you a posterity [[H7611]] in the earth, [[H776]] and to save your lives [[H2421]] by a great [[H1419]] deliverance. [[H6413]]

### 8
So now [[H6258]] not [[H3808]] you [[H859]] sent [[H7971]] me hither, [[H2008]] but [[H3588]] God: [[H430]] and he hath made [[H7760]] me a father [[H1]] to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] his house, [[H1004]] and a ruler [[H4910]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
Haste [[H4116]] ye, and go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] my father, [[H1]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] thy son [[H1121]] Joseph, [[H3130]] God [[H430]] hath made [[H7760]] me lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] Egypt: [[H4714]] come down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] me, tarry [[H5975]] not: [[H408]]

### 10
And thou shalt dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] and thou shalt be [[H1961]] near [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] me, thou, [[H859]] and thy children, [[H1121]] and thy children's [[H1121]] children, [[H1121]] and thy flocks, [[H6629]] and thy herds, [[H1241]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast: [[H834]]

### 11
And there [[H8033]] will I nourish [[H3557]] thee; for [[H3588]] yet [[H5750]] five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] of famine; [[H7458]] lest [[H6435]] thou, [[H859]] and thy household, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast, come to poverty. [[H3423]]

### 12
And, behold, [[H2009]] your eyes [[H5869]] see, [[H7200]] and the eyes [[H5869]] of my brother [[H251]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] that [[H3588]] my mouth [[H6310]] that speaketh [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 13
And ye shall tell [[H5046]] my father [[H1]]  of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] my glory [[H3519]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] ye have seen; [[H7200]] and ye shall haste [[H4116]] and bring down [[H3381]] my father [[H1]] hither. [[H2008]]

### 14
And he fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] his brother [[H251]] Benjamin's [[H1144]] neck, [[H6677]] and wept; [[H1058]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] wept [[H1058]] upon [[H5921]] his neck. [[H6677]]

### 15
Moreover he kissed [[H5401]] all [[H3605]] his brethren, [[H251]] and wept [[H1058]] upon [[H5921]] them: and after [[H310]] that [[H3651]] his brethren [[H251]] talked [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 16
And the fame [[H6963]] thereof was heard [[H8085]] in Pharaoh's [[H6547]] house, [[H1004]] saying, [[H559]] Joseph's [[H3130]] brethren [[H251]] are come: [[H935]] and it pleased [[H5869]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] well, [[H3190]] and [[H5869]] his servants. [[H5650]]

### 17
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thy brethren, [[H251]] This [[H2063]] do [[H6213]] ye; lade [[H2943]] your beasts, [[H1165]] and go, [[H1980]] get [[H935]] you unto the land [[H776]] of Canaan; [[H3667]]

### 18
And take [[H3947]] your father [[H1]] and your households, [[H1004]] and come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me: and I will give [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] the good [[H2898]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and ye shall eat [[H398]] the fat [[H2459]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 19
Now thou [[H859]] art commanded, [[H6680]] this [[H2063]] do [[H6213]] ye; take [[H3947]] you wagons [[H5699]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] for your little ones, [[H2945]] and for your wives, [[H802]] and bring [[H5375]] your father, [[H1]] and come. [[H935]]

### 20
Also [[H5869]] regard [[H2347]] not [[H408]] your stuff; [[H3627]] for [[H3588]] the good [[H2898]] of all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] yours. [[H4714]]

### 21
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] so: [[H3651]] and Joseph [[H3130]] gave [[H5414]] them wagons, [[H5699]] according to [[H5921]] the commandment [[H6310]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and gave [[H5414]] them provision [[H6720]] for the way. [[H1870]]

### 22
To all [[H3605]] of them he gave [[H5414]] each man [[H582]] changes [[H2487]] of raiment; [[H8071]] but to Benjamin [[H1144]] he gave [[H5414]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] of silver, [[H3701]] and five [[H2568]] changes [[H2487]] of raiment. [[H8071]]

### 23
And to his father [[H1]] he sent [[H7971]] after this [[H2063]] ten [[H6235]] asses [[H2543]] laden [[H5375]] with the good things [[H2898]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and ten [[H6235]] she asses [[H860]] laden [[H5375]] with corn [[H1250]] and bread [[H3899]] and meat [[H4202]] for his father [[H1]] by the way. [[H1870]]

### 24
So he sent [[H853]] his brethren [[H251]] away, [[H7971]] and they departed: [[H1980]] and he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, See that ye fall not out [[H7264]] by the way. [[H1870]]

### 25
And they went up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and came [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] unto [[H413]] Jacob [[H3290]] their father, [[H1]]

### 26
And told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] Joseph [[H3130]] yet [[H5750]] alive, [[H2416]] and he [[H1931]] governor [[H4910]] over all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] And Jacob's heart [[H3820]] fainted, [[H6313]] for [[H3588]] he believed [[H539]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 27
And they told [[H1696]]  him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] which [[H834]] he had said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them: and when he saw [[H7200]] the wagons [[H5699]] which [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had sent [[H7971]] to carry [[H5375]] him, the spirit [[H7307]] of Jacob [[H3290]] their father [[H1]] revived: [[H2421]]

### 28
And Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] enough; [[H7227]] Joseph [[H3130]] my son [[H1121]] yet [[H5750]] alive: [[H2416]] I will go [[H1980]] and see him [[H7200]] before [[H2962]] I die. [[H4191]]
