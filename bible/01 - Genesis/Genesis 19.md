### 1
And there came [[H935]] two [[H8147]] angels [[H4397]] to Sodom [[H5467]] at even; [[H6153]] and Lot [[H3876]] sat [[H3427]] in the gate [[H8179]] of Sodom: [[H5467]] and Lot [[H3876]] seeing [[H7200]] rose up [[H6965]] to meet [[H7125]] them; and he bowed [[H7812]] himself with his face [[H639]] toward the ground; [[H776]]

### 2
And he said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] my lords, [[H113]] turn in, [[H5493]] I pray you, [[H4994]] into [[H413]] your servant's [[H5650]] house, [[H1004]] and tarry all night, [[H3885]] and wash [[H7364]] your feet, [[H7272]] and ye shall rise up early, [[H7925]] and go [[H1980]] on your ways. [[H1870]] And they said, [[H559]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] we will abide all night. [[H3885]] in the street [[H7339]]

### 3
And he pressed [[H6484]] upon them greatly; [[H3966]] and they turned in [[H5493]] unto [[H413]] him, and entered [[H935]] into [[H413]] his house; [[H1004]] and he made [[H6213]] them a feast, [[H4960]] and did bake [[H644]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] and they did eat. [[H398]]

### 4
But before [[H2962]] they lay down, [[H7901]] the men [[H582]] of the city, [[H5892]] the men [[H582]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] compassed [[H5437]] the house [[H1004]] round, both old [[H2205]] and young, [[H5288]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] from every quarter: [[H7097]]

### 5
And they called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] Lot, [[H3876]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Where [[H346]] the men [[H376]] which [[H834]] came in [[H935]] to [[H413]] thee this night? [[H3915]] bring them out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] us, that we may know [[H3045]] them. [[H3045]]

### 6
And Lot [[H3876]] went out [[H3318]] at the door [[H6607]] unto [[H413]] them, and shut [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] after [[H310]] him, [[H310]]

### 7
And said, [[H559]] I pray you, [[H4994]] brethren, [[H251]] do not so wickedly. [[H7489]]

### 8
Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I have two [[H8147]] daughters [[H1323]] which [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] man; [[H376]] let me, I pray you, [[H4994]] bring them out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] you, and do [[H6213]] ye to them as good [[H2896]] in your eyes: [[H5869]] only [[H7535]] unto these [[H411]] men [[H376]] do [[H6213]] nothing; [[H408]] for [[H3588]] therefore [[H3651]] came [[H935]] they under the shadow [[H6738]] of my roof. [[H6982]]

### 9
And they said, [[H559]] Stand [[H5066]] back. [[H1973]] And they said [[H559]] This one [[H259]] came in [[H935]] to sojourn, [[H1481]] and he will needs [[H8199]] be a judge: [[H8199]] now [[H6258]] will we deal worse [[H7489]] with thee, than with them. And they pressed [[H6484]] sore [[H3966]] upon the man, [[H582]] Lot, [[H3876]] and came near [[H5066]] to break [[H7665]] the door. [[H1817]]

### 10
But the men [[H376]] put forth [[H7971]] their hand, [[H3027]] and pulled [[H935]] Lot [[H3876]] into the house [[H1004]] to [[H413]] them, and shut [[H5462]] to the door. [[H1817]]

### 11
And they smote [[H5221]] the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] at the door [[H6607]] of the house [[H1004]] with blindness, [[H5575]] both small [[H6996]] and great: [[H1419]] so that [[H5704]] they wearied themselves [[H3811]] to find [[H4672]] the door. [[H6607]]

### 12
And the men [[H376]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Lot, [[H3876]] Hast thou here [[H6311]] any [[H4310]] besides? [[H5750]] son in law, [[H2860]] and thy sons, [[H1121]] and thy daughters, [[H1323]] and whatsoever [[H834]] thou hast in the city, [[H5892]] bring out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] this place: [[H4725]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] we [[H587]] will destroy [[H7843]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] because [[H3588]] the cry of them [[H6818]] is waxen great [[H1431]] before [[H854]] the face [[H6440]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent us [[H7971]] to destroy it. [[H7843]]

### 14
And Lot [[H3876]] went out, [[H3318]] and spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] his sons in law, [[H2860]] which married [[H3947]] his daughters, [[H1323]] and said, [[H559]] Up, [[H6965]] get you out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place; [[H4725]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will destroy [[H7843]] this city. [[H5892]] But he seemed [[H1961]] as one that mocked [[H6711]] unto [[H5869]] his sons in law. [[H2860]]

### 15
And when [[H3644]] the morning [[H7837]] arose, [[H5927]] then the angels [[H4397]] hastened [[H213]] Lot, [[H3876]] saying, [[H559]] Arise, [[H6965]] take [[H3947]] thy wife, [[H802]] and thy two [[H8147]] daughters, [[H1323]] which are here; [[H4672]] lest [[H6435]] thou be consumed [[H5595]] in the iniquity [[H5771]] of the city. [[H5892]]

### 16
And while he lingered, [[H4102]] the men [[H376]] laid hold [[H2388]] upon his hand, [[H3027]] and upon the hand [[H3027]] of his wife, [[H802]] and upon the hand [[H3027]] of his two [[H8147]] daughters; [[H1323]] the Lord [[H3068]] being merciful [[H2551]] unto [[H5921]] him: and they brought him forth, [[H3318]] and set him [[H3240]] without [[H2351]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 17
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they had brought them forth [[H3318]] abroad, [[H2351]] that he said, [[H559]] Escape [[H4422]] for [[H5921]] thy life; [[H5315]] look [[H5027]] not [[H408]] behind thee, [[H310]] neither [[H408]] stay [[H5975]] thou in all [[H3605]] the plain; [[H3603]] escape [[H4422]] to the mountain, [[H2022]] lest [[H6435]] thou be consumed. [[H5595]]

### 18
And Lot [[H3876]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Oh, [[H4994]] not [[H408]] so, my Lord: [[H136]]

### 19
Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] thy servant [[H5650]] hath found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] and thou hast magnified [[H1431]] thy mercy, [[H2617]] which [[H834]] thou hast shewed [[H6213]] unto me [[H5978]] in saving [[H2421]] my life; [[H5315]] and I [[H595]] cannot [[H3201]] escape [[H4422]] to the mountain, [[H2022]] lest [[H6435]] some evil [[H7451]] take [[H1692]] me, and I die: [[H4191]]

### 20
Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] near [[H7138]] to flee [[H5127]] unto, [[H8033]] and it [[H1931]] a little one: [[H4705]] Oh, [[H4994]] let me escape [[H4422]] thither, [[H8033]] it [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] a little one?) [[H4705]] and my soul [[H5315]] shall live. [[H2421]]

### 21
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, See, [[H2009]] I have accepted [[H5375]] thee [[H6440]] concerning this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] also, [[H1571]] that I will not [[H1115]] overthrow [[H2015]] this city, [[H5892]] for the which [[H834]] thou hast spoken. [[H1696]]

### 22
Haste [[H4116]] thee, escape [[H4422]] thither; [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] I cannot [[H3201]] do [[H6213]] any thing [[H1697]] till [[H5704]] thou be come [[H935]] thither. [[H8033]] Therefore [[H3651]] the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] was called [[H7121]] Zoar. [[H6820]]

### 23
The sun [[H8121]] was risen [[H3318]] upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] when Lot [[H3876]] entered [[H935]] into Zoar. [[H6820]]

### 24
Then the Lord [[H3068]] rained [[H4305]] upon [[H5921]] Sodom [[H5467]] and upon [[H5921]] Gomorrah [[H6017]] brimstone [[H1614]] and fire [[H784]] from the Lord [[H3068]] out of [[H4480]] heaven; [[H8064]]

### 25
And he overthrew [[H2015]] those [[H411]] cities, [[H5892]] and all [[H3605]] the plain, [[H3603]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the cities, [[H5892]] and that which grew [[H6780]] upon the ground. [[H127]]

### 26
But his wife [[H802]] looked back [[H5027]] from behind [[H310]] him, and she became [[H1961]] a pillar [[H5333]] of salt. [[H4417]]

### 27
And Abraham [[H85]] gat up early [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H8033]] he stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 28
And he looked [[H8259]] toward [[H6440]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah, [[H6017]] and toward [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of the plain, [[H3603]] and beheld, [[H7200]] and, lo, [[H2009]] the smoke [[H7008]] of the country [[H776]] went up [[H5927]] as the smoke [[H7008]] of a furnace. [[H3536]]

### 29
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when God [[H430]] destroyed [[H7843]] the cities [[H5892]] of the plain, [[H3603]] that God [[H430]] remembered [[H2142]] Abraham, [[H85]] and sent [[H7971]] Lot [[H3876]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the overthrow, [[H2018]] when he overthrew [[H2015]] the cities [[H5892]] in the which [[H2004]] Lot [[H3876]] dwelt. [[H3427]]

### 30
And Lot [[H3876]] went up [[H5927]] out of Zoar, [[H6820]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in the mountain, [[H2022]] and his two [[H8147]] daughters [[H1323]] with [[H5973]] him; for [[H3588]] he feared [[H3372]] to dwell [[H3427]] in Zoar: [[H6820]] and he dwelt [[H3427]] in a cave, [[H4631]] he [[H1931]] and his two [[H8147]] daughters. [[H1323]]

### 31
And the firstborn [[H1067]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the younger, [[H6810]] Our father [[H1]] old, [[H2204]] and not [[H369]] a man [[H376]] in the earth [[H776]] to come in [[H935]] unto [[H5921]] us after the manner [[H1870]] of all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]]

### 32
Come, [[H1980]]  let us make [[H853]] our father [[H1]] drink [[H8248]] wine, [[H3196]] and we will lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] him, that we may preserve [[H2421]] seed [[H2233]] of our father. [[H1]]

### 33
And they made [[H853]] their father [[H1]] drink [[H8248]] wine [[H3196]] that [[H1931]] night: [[H3915]] and the firstborn [[H1067]] went in, [[H935]] and lay [[H7901]] with [[H854]] her father; [[H1]] and he perceived [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] when she lay down, [[H7901]] nor when she arose. [[H6965]]

### 34
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that the firstborn [[H1067]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the younger, [[H6810]] Behold, [[H2005]] I lay [[H7901]] yesternight [[H570]] with [[H854]] my father: [[H1]] let us make him drink [[H8248]] wine [[H3196]] this night [[H3915]] also; [[H1571]] and go thou in, [[H935]] lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] him, that we may preserve [[H2421]] seed [[H2233]] of our father. [[H1]]

### 35
And they made [[H853]] their father [[H1]] drink [[H8248]] wine [[H3196]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] also: [[H1571]] and the younger [[H6810]] arose, [[H6965]] and lay [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] him; and he perceived [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] when she lay down, [[H7901]] nor when she arose. [[H6965]]

### 36
Thus were both [[H8147]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Lot [[H3876]] with child [[H2029]] by their father. [[H1]]

### 37
And the firstborn [[H1067]] bare [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Moab: [[H4124]] the same [[H1931]] the father [[H1]] of the Moabites [[H4124]] unto [[H5704]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 38
And the younger, [[H6810]] she [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] bare [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Ben-ammi: [[H1151]] the same [[H1931]] the father [[H1]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] unto [[H5704]] this day. [[H3117]]
