### 1
And Jacob [[H3290]] dwelt [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] wherein his father [[H1]] was a stranger, [[H4033]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 2
These [[H428]] the generations [[H8435]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] Joseph, [[H3130]] seventeen [[H6240]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] was [[H1961]] feeding [[H7462]] the flock [[H6629]] with [[H854]] his brethren; [[H251]] and the lad [[H5288]] with [[H854]] the sons [[H1121]] of Bilhah, [[H1090]] and with [[H854]] the sons [[H1121]] of Zilpah, [[H2153]] his father's [[H1]] wives: [[H802]] and Joseph [[H3130]] brought [[H935]] unto [[H413]] his father [[H1]]  their [[H853]] evil [[H7451]] report. [[H1681]]

### 3
Now Israel [[H3478]] loved [[H157]] Joseph [[H3130]] more than all [[H3605]] his children, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the son [[H1121]] of his old age: [[H2208]] and he made [[H6213]] him a coat [[H3801]] of colours. [[H6446]]

### 4
And when his brethren [[H251]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] their father [[H1]] loved [[H157]] him more than all [[H3605]] his brethren, [[H251]] they hated [[H8130]] him, and could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] peaceably [[H7965]] unto him. [[H7965]]

### 5
And Joseph [[H3130]] dreamed [[H2492]] a dream, [[H2472]] and he told [[H5046]] his brethren: [[H251]] and they hated [[H8130]] him yet [[H5750]] the more. [[H3254]]

### 6
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Hear, [[H8085]] I pray you, [[H4994]] this [[H2088]] dream [[H2472]] which [[H834]] I have dreamed: [[H2492]]

### 7
For, behold, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] binding [[H481]] sheaves [[H485]] in [[H8432]] the field, [[H7704]] and, lo, [[H2009]] my sheaf [[H485]] arose, [[H6965]] and also [[H1571]] stood upright; [[H5324]] and, behold, [[H2009]] your sheaves [[H485]] stood round about, [[H5437]] and made obeisance [[H7812]] to my sheaf. [[H485]]

### 8
And his brethren [[H251]] said [[H559]] to him, Shalt thou indeed [[H4427]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] us? or [[H518]] shalt thou indeed [[H4910]] have dominion [[H4910]] over us? And they hated [[H8130]] him yet [[H5750]] the more [[H3254]] for [[H5921]] his dreams, [[H2472]] and for [[H5921]] his words. [[H1697]]

### 9
And he dreamed [[H2492]] yet [[H5750]] another [[H312]] dream, [[H2472]] and told [[H5608]] it his brethren, [[H251]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have dreamed [[H2492]] a dream [[H2472]] more; [[H5750]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the sun [[H8121]] and the moon [[H3394]] and the eleven [[H6240]] stars [[H3556]] made obeisance [[H7812]] to me. [[H7812]]

### 10
And he told [[H5608]] to [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] and to [[H413]] his brethren: [[H251]] and his father [[H1]] rebuked [[H1605]] him, and said [[H559]] unto him, What [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] dream [[H2472]] that [[H834]] thou hast dreamed? [[H2492]] Shall I [[H589]] and thy mother [[H517]] and thy brethren [[H251]] indeed [[H935]] come [[H935]] to bow down ourselves [[H7812]] to thee to the earth? [[H776]]

### 11
And his brethren [[H251]] envied [[H7065]] him; but his father [[H1]] observed [[H8104]] the saying. [[H1697]]

### 12
And his brethren [[H251]] went [[H1980]] to feed [[H7462]] their father's [[H1]] flock [[H6629]] in Shechem. [[H7927]]

### 13
And Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] Do not [[H3808]] thy brethren [[H251]] feed [[H7462]] in Shechem? [[H7927]] come, [[H1980]] and I will send thee [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] them. And he said [[H559]] to him, Here [[H2009]]

### 14
And he said [[H559]] to him, Go, [[H1980]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] see [[H7200]]  whether [[H853]] it be well [[H7965]] with thy brethren, [[H251]] and well [[H7965]] with the flocks; [[H6629]] and bring [[H7725]] me word [[H1697]] again. So he sent [[H7971]] him out of the vale [[H6010]] of Hebron, [[H2275]] and he came [[H935]] to Shechem. [[H7927]]

### 15
And a certain man [[H582]] found him, [[H4672]] and, behold, [[H2009]] wandering [[H8582]] in the field: [[H7704]] and the man [[H582]] asked him, [[H7592]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] seekest [[H1245]] thou? [[H1245]]

### 16
And he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] seek [[H1245]] my brethren: [[H251]] tell [[H5046]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] where [[H375]] they [[H1992]] feed [[H7462]]

### 17
And the man [[H376]] said, [[H559]] They are departed [[H5265]] hence; [[H2088]] for [[H3588]] I heard [[H8085]] them say, [[H559]] Let us go [[H1980]] to Dothan. [[H1886]] And Joseph [[H3130]] went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] his brethren, [[H251]] and found [[H4672]] them in Dothan. [[H1886]]

### 18
And when they saw [[H7200]] him afar off, [[H7350]] even before [[H2962]] he came near [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] them, they conspired [[H5230]] against him to slay [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 19
And they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H251]] Behold, [[H2009]] this [[H1976]] dreamer [[H1167]] cometh. [[H935]]

### 20
Come [[H1980]] now [[H6258]] therefore, and let us slay [[H2026]] him, and cast [[H7993]] him into some [[H259]] pit, [[H953]] and we will say, [[H559]] Some evil [[H7451]] beast [[H2416]] hath devoured [[H398]] him: and we shall see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] will become [[H1961]] of his dreams. [[H2472]]

### 21
And Reuben [[H7205]] heard [[H8085]] and he delivered [[H5337]] him out of their hands; [[H3027]] and said, [[H559]] Let us not [[H3808]] kill [[H5221]] him. [[H5315]]

### 22
And Reuben [[H7205]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Shed [[H8210]] no [[H3808]] blood, [[H1818]] cast [[H7993]] him into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] pit [[H953]] that [[H834]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and lay [[H7971]] no [[H3808]] hand [[H3027]] upon him; that [[H4616]] he might rid [[H5337]] him out of their hands, [[H3027]] to deliver [[H7725]] him to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] again. [[H1]]

### 23
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] was come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] that they stript [[H6584]] Joseph [[H3130]]  out of [[H853]] his coat, [[H3801]] coat [[H3801]] of colours [[H6446]] that [[H834]] on him; [[H5921]]

### 24
And they took [[H3947]] him, and cast [[H7993]] him into a pit: [[H953]] and the pit [[H953]] empty, [[H7386]] no [[H369]] water [[H4325]] in it. [[H4325]]

### 25
And they sat down [[H3427]] to eat [[H398]] bread: [[H3899]] and they lifted up [[H5375]] their eyes [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a company [[H736]] of Ishmeelites [[H3459]] came [[H935]] from Gilead [[H1568]] with their camels [[H1581]] bearing [[H5375]] spicery [[H5219]] and balm [[H6875]] and myrrh, [[H3910]] going [[H1980]] to carry down [[H3381]] to Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 26
And Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] What [[H4100]] profit [[H1215]] if [[H3588]] we slay [[H2026]] our brother, [[H251]] and conceal [[H3680]] his blood? [[H1818]]

### 27
Come, [[H1980]] and let us sell [[H4376]] him to the Ishmeelites, [[H3459]] and let not [[H408]] our hand [[H3027]] be [[H1961]] upon him; for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] our brother [[H251]] our flesh. [[H1320]] And his brethren [[H251]] were content. [[H8085]]

### 28
Then there passed by [[H5674]] Midianites [[H4084]] merchantmen; [[H5503]] and they drew [[H4900]] and lifted up [[H5927]] Joseph [[H3130]] out of [[H4480]] the pit, [[H953]] and sold [[H4376]] Joseph [[H3130]] to the Ishmeelites [[H3459]] for twenty [[H6242]] of silver: [[H3701]] and they brought [[H935]] Joseph [[H3130]] into Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 29
And Reuben [[H7205]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the pit; [[H953]] and, behold, [[H2009]] Joseph [[H3130]] not [[H369]] in the pit; [[H953]] and he rent [[H7167]] his clothes. [[H899]]

### 30
And he returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] and said, [[H559]] The child [[H3206]] not; [[H369]] and I, [[H589]] whither [[H575]] shall I [[H589]] go? [[H935]]

### 31
And they took [[H3947]] Joseph's [[H3130]] coat, [[H3801]] and killed [[H7819]] a kid [[H8163]] of the goats, [[H5795]] and dipped [[H2881]] the coat [[H3801]] in the blood; [[H1818]]

### 32
And they sent [[H7971]] the coat [[H3801]] of colours, [[H6446]] and they brought [[H935]] to [[H413]] their father; [[H1]] and said, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] have we found: [[H4672]] know [[H5234]] now [[H4994]] whether it [[H1931]] thy son's [[H1121]] coat [[H3801]] or [[H518]] no. [[H3808]]

### 33
And he knew it, [[H5234]] and said, [[H559]] my son's [[H1121]] coat; [[H3801]] an evil [[H7451]] beast [[H2416]] hath devoured [[H398]] him; Joseph [[H3130]] is without doubt [[H2963]] rent in pieces. [[H2963]]

### 34
And Jacob [[H3290]] rent [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H8071]] and put [[H7760]] sackcloth [[H8242]] upon his loins, [[H4975]] and mourned [[H56]] for [[H5921]] his son [[H1121]] many [[H7227]] days. [[H3117]]

### 35
And all [[H3605]] his sons [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] his daughters [[H1323]] rose up [[H6965]] to comfort [[H5162]] him; but he refused [[H3985]] to be comforted; [[H5162]] and he said, [[H559]] For [[H3588]] I will go down [[H3381]] into the grave [[H7585]] unto [[H413]] my son [[H1121]] mourning. [[H57]] Thus his father [[H1]] wept [[H1058]] for him. [[H1058]]

### 36
And the Midianites [[H4092]] sold [[H4376]] him into [[H413]] Egypt [[H4714]] unto Potiphar, [[H6318]] an officer [[H5631]] of Pharaoh's, [[H6547]] captain [[H8269]] of the guard. [[H2876]]
