### 1
And he heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of Laban's [[H3837]] sons, [[H1121]] saying, [[H559]] Jacob [[H3290]] hath taken away [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] our father's; [[H1]] and of which [[H834]] our father's [[H1]] hath he gotten [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] glory. [[H3519]]

### 2
And Jacob [[H3290]] beheld [[H7200]] the countenance [[H6440]] of Laban, [[H3837]] and, behold, [[H2009]] it not [[H369]] toward [[H5973]] him as [[H8543]] before. [[H8032]]

### 3
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] Return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of thy fathers, [[H1]] and to thy kindred; [[H4138]] and I will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 4
And Jacob [[H3290]] sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] Rachel [[H7354]] and Leah [[H3812]] to the field [[H7704]] unto [[H413]] his flock, [[H6629]]

### 5
And said [[H559]] unto them, I [[H595]] see [[H7200]] your father's [[H1]] countenance, [[H6440]] that [[H3588]] it not [[H369]] toward [[H413]] me as [[H8543]] before; [[H8032]] but the God [[H430]] of my father [[H1]] hath been [[H1961]] with me. [[H1961]]

### 6
And ye [[H859]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] with all [[H3605]] my power [[H3581]] I have served [[H5647]] your father. [[H1]]

### 7
And your father [[H1]] hath deceived [[H2048]] me, and changed [[H2498]] my wages [[H4909]] ten [[H6235]] times; [[H4489]] but God [[H430]] suffered him [[H5414]] not [[H3808]] to hurt [[H7489]] me. [[H5978]]

### 8
If [[H518]] he said [[H559]] thus, [[H3541]] The speckled [[H5348]] shall be [[H1961]] thy wages; [[H7939]] then all [[H3605]] the cattle [[H6629]] bare [[H3205]] speckled: [[H5348]] and if [[H518]] he said [[H559]] thus, [[H3541]] The ringstraked [[H6124]] shall be [[H1961]] thy hire; [[H7939]] then bare [[H3205]] all [[H3605]] the cattle [[H6629]] ringstraked. [[H6124]]

### 9
Thus God [[H430]] hath taken away [[H5337]] the cattle [[H4735]] of your father, [[H1]] and given [[H5414]] to me. [[H5414]]

### 10
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the time [[H6256]] that the cattle [[H6629]] conceived, [[H3179]] that I lifted up [[H5375]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] in a dream, [[H2472]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the rams [[H6260]] which leaped [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] the cattle [[H6629]] ringstraked, [[H6124]] speckled, [[H5348]] and grisled. [[H1261]]

### 11
And the angel [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me in a dream, [[H2472]] Jacob: [[H3290]] And I said, [[H559]] Here [[H2009]] I. [[H2009]]

### 12
And he said, [[H559]] Lift up [[H5375]] now [[H4994]] thine eyes, [[H5869]] and see, [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the rams [[H6260]] which leap [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] the cattle [[H6629]] ringstraked, [[H6124]] speckled, [[H5348]] and grisled: [[H1261]] for [[H3588]] I have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Laban [[H3837]] doeth [[H6213]] unto thee. [[H6213]]

### 13
I [[H595]] the God [[H410]] of Beth-el, [[H1008]] where [[H8033]] thou anointedst [[H4886]] the pillar, [[H4676]] where [[H8033]] thou vowedst [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] unto me: now [[H6258]] arise, [[H6965]] get thee out [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of thy kindred. [[H4138]]

### 14
And Rachel [[H7354]] and Leah [[H3812]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto him, yet [[H5750]] any portion [[H2506]] or inheritance [[H5159]] for us in our father's [[H1]] house? [[H1004]]

### 15
Are we not [[H3808]] counted [[H2803]] of him strangers? [[H5237]] for [[H3588]] he hath sold [[H4376]] us, and hath quite [[H398]] devoured [[H398]] also [[H1571]] our money. [[H3701]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the riches [[H6239]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] hath taken [[H5337]] from our father, [[H1]] that [[H1931]] ours, and our children's: [[H1121]] now [[H6258]] then, whatsoever [[H834]] God [[H430]] hath said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, do. [[H6213]]

### 17
Then Jacob [[H3290]] rose up, [[H6965]] and set [[H5375]] his sons [[H1121]] and his wives [[H802]] upon [[H5921]] camels; [[H1581]]

### 18
And he carried away [[H5090]] all [[H3605]] his cattle, [[H4735]] and all [[H3605]] his goods [[H7399]] which [[H834]] he had gotten, [[H7408]] the cattle [[H4735]] of his getting, [[H7075]] which [[H834]] he had gotten [[H7408]] in Padan-aram, [[H6307]] for to go [[H935]] to [[H413]] Isaac [[H3327]] his father [[H1]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 19
And Laban [[H3837]] went [[H1980]] to shear [[H1494]] his sheep: [[H6629]] and Rachel [[H7354]] had stolen [[H1589]] the images [[H8655]] that [[H834]] her father's. [[H1]]

### 20
And Jacob [[H3290]] stole away [[H1589]] unawares [[H3820]] to Laban [[H3837]] the Syrian, [[H761]] in that [[H5921]] he told [[H5046]] him not [[H1097]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] fled. [[H1272]]

### 21
So he [[H1931]] fled [[H1272]] with all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had; and he rose up, [[H6965]] and passed over [[H5674]] the river, [[H5104]] and set [[H7760]] his face [[H6440]] the mount [[H2022]] Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 22
And it was told [[H5046]] Laban [[H3837]] on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] Jacob [[H3290]] was fled. [[H1272]]

### 23
And he took [[H3947]] his brethren [[H251]] with [[H5973]] him, and pursued [[H7291]] after him [[H310]] seven [[H7651]] days' [[H3117]] journey; [[H1870]] and they overtook [[H1692]] him in the mount [[H2022]] Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 24
And God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Laban [[H3837]] the Syrian [[H761]] in a dream [[H2472]] by night, [[H3915]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Take heed [[H8104]] that [[H6435]] thou speak [[H1696]] not to [[H5973]] Jacob [[H3290]] either good [[H2896]] or [[H5704]] bad. [[H7451]]

### 25
Then Laban [[H3837]] overtook [[H5381]] Jacob. [[H3290]] Now Jacob [[H3290]] had pitched [[H8628]] his tent [[H168]] in the mount: [[H2022]] and Laban [[H3837]] with [[H854]] his brethren [[H251]] pitched [[H8628]] in the mount [[H2022]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 26
And Laban [[H3837]] said [[H559]] to Jacob, [[H3290]] What [[H4100]] hast thou done, [[H6213]] that thou hast stolen away [[H1589]] unawares [[H3824]] to me, and carried away [[H5090]] my daughters, [[H1323]] as captives [[H7617]] with the sword? [[H2719]]

### 27
Wherefore [[H4100]] didst thou flee away [[H1272]] secretly, [[H2244]] and steal away [[H1589]] from me; and didst not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] me, that I might have sent thee away [[H7971]] with mirth, [[H8057]] and with songs, [[H7892]] with tabret, [[H8596]] and with harp? [[H3658]]

### 28
And hast not [[H3808]] suffered [[H5203]] me to kiss [[H5401]] my sons [[H1121]] and my daughters? [[H1323]] thou hast now [[H6258]] done foolishly [[H5528]] in doing. [[H6213]]

### 29
It is [[H3426]] in the power [[H410]] of my hand [[H3027]] to do [[H6213]] you hurt: [[H7451]] but the God [[H430]] of your father [[H1]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me yesternight, [[H570]] saying, [[H559]] Take thou heed [[H8104]] that thou speak not [[H1696]] to [[H5973]] Jacob [[H3290]] either good [[H2896]] or [[H5704]] bad. [[H7451]]

### 30
And now, [[H6258]] thou wouldest needs [[H1980]] be gone, [[H1980]] because [[H3588]] thou sore [[H3700]] longedst [[H3700]] after thy father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] wherefore [[H4100]] hast thou stolen [[H1589]] my gods? [[H430]]

### 31
And Jacob [[H3290]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] to Laban, [[H3837]] Because [[H3588]] I was afraid: [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] I said, [[H559]] Peradventure [[H6435]] thou wouldest take by force [[H1497]] thy daughters [[H1323]] from [[H5973]] me. [[H5973]]

### 32
With [[H5973]] whomsoever [[H834]] thou findest [[H4672]] thy gods, [[H430]] let him not [[H3808]] live: [[H2421]] before [[H5048]] our brethren [[H251]] discern [[H5234]] thou what [[H4100]] thine with [[H5978]] me, and take [[H3947]] to thee. For Jacob [[H3290]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] Rachel [[H7354]] had stolen [[H1589]] them. [[H1589]]

### 33
And Laban [[H3837]] went [[H935]] into Jacob's [[H3290]] tent, [[H168]] and into Leah's [[H3812]] tent, [[H168]] and into the two [[H8147]] maidservants' [[H519]] tents; [[H168]] but he found [[H4672]] not. [[H3808]] Then went he out [[H3318]] of Leah's [[H3812]] tent, [[H168]] and entered [[H935]] into Rachel's [[H7354]] tent. [[H168]]

### 34
Now Rachel [[H7354]] had taken [[H3947]] the images, [[H8655]] and put [[H7760]] them in the camel's [[H1581]] furniture, [[H3733]] and sat [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] them. And Laban [[H3837]] searched [[H4959]] all [[H3605]] the tent, [[H168]] but found [[H4672]] not. [[H3808]]

### 35
And she said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her father, [[H1]] Let it not [[H408]] displease [[H2734]] my lord [[H113]] that [[H3588]] I cannot [[H3201]] rise up [[H6965]] before [[H6440]] thee; for [[H3588]] the custom [[H1870]] of women [[H802]] upon me. And he searched, [[H2664]] but found [[H4672]] not [[H3808]] the images. [[H8655]]

### 36
And Jacob [[H3290]] was wroth, [[H2734]] and chode [[H7378]] with Laban: [[H3837]] and Jacob [[H3290]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] to Laban, [[H3837]] What [[H4100]] my trespass? [[H6588]] what [[H4100]] my sin, [[H2403]] that [[H3588]] thou hast so hotly pursued [[H1814]] after me? [[H310]]

### 37
Whereas [[H3588]] thou hast searched [[H4959]] all [[H3605]] my stuff, [[H3627]] what [[H4100]] hast thou found [[H4672]] of all [[H3605]] thy household [[H1004]] stuff? [[H3627]] set [[H7760]] here [[H3541]] before [[H5048]] my brethren [[H251]] and thy brethren, [[H251]] that they may judge [[H3198]] betwixt [[H996]] us both. [[H8147]]

### 38
This [[H2088]] twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] I [[H595]] with [[H5973]] thee; thy ewes [[H7353]] and thy she goats [[H5795]] have not [[H3808]] cast their young, [[H7921]] and the rams [[H352]] of thy flock [[H6629]] have I not [[H3808]] eaten. [[H398]]

### 39
That which was torn [[H2966]] I brought [[H935]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] thee; I [[H595]] bare the loss [[H2398]] of it; of my hand [[H3027]] didst thou require [[H1245]] it, stolen [[H1589]] by day, [[H3117]] or stolen [[H1589]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 40
I was; [[H1961]] in the day [[H3117]] the drought [[H2721]] consumed [[H398]] me, and the frost [[H7140]] by night; [[H3915]] and my sleep [[H8142]] departed [[H5074]] from mine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 41
Thus [[H2088]] have I been twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] in thy house; [[H1004]] I served thee [[H5647]] fourteen [[H702]] years [[H8141]] for thy two [[H8147]] daughters, [[H1323]] and six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] for thy cattle: [[H6629]] and thou hast changed [[H2498]] my wages [[H4909]] ten [[H6235]] times. [[H4489]]

### 42
Except [[H3884]] the God [[H430]] of my father, [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] and the fear [[H6343]] of Isaac, [[H3327]] had been [[H1961]] with me, surely [[H3588]] thou hadst sent me away [[H7971]] now [[H6258]] empty. [[H7387]] God [[H430]] hath seen [[H7200]] mine affliction [[H6040]] and the labour [[H3018]] of my hands, [[H3709]] and rebuked [[H3198]] yesternight. [[H570]]

### 43
And Laban [[H3837]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] daughters [[H1323]] my daughters, [[H1323]] and children [[H1121]] my children, [[H1121]] and cattle [[H6629]] my cattle, [[H6629]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] seest [[H7200]] mine: and what [[H4100]] can I do [[H6213]] this day [[H3117]] unto these [[H428]] my daughters, [[H1323]] or [[H176]] unto their children [[H1121]] which [[H834]] they have born? [[H3205]]

### 44
Now [[H6258]] therefore come thou, [[H1980]] let us make [[H3772]] a covenant, [[H1285]] I [[H589]] and thou; [[H859]] and let it be [[H1961]] for a witness [[H5707]] between [[H996]] me and thee. [[H996]]

### 45
And Jacob [[H3290]] took [[H3947]] a stone, [[H68]] and set it up [[H7311]] a pillar. [[H4676]]

### 46
And Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] unto his brethren, [[H251]] Gather [[H3950]] stones; [[H68]] and they took [[H3947]] stones, [[H68]] and made [[H6213]] an heap: [[H1530]] and they did eat [[H398]] there [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] the heap. [[H1530]]

### 47
And Laban [[H3837]] called [[H7121]] it Jegar-sahadutha: [[H3026]] but Jacob [[H3290]] called [[H7121]] it Galeed. [[H1567]]

### 48
And Laban [[H3837]] said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] heap [[H1530]] a witness [[H5707]] between [[H996]] me and thee this day. [[H3117]] Therefore [[H3651]] was the name [[H8034]] of it called [[H7121]] Galeed; [[H1567]]

### 49
And Mizpah; [[H4709]] for [[H834]] he said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] watch [[H6822]] between [[H996]] me and thee, when [[H3588]] we are absent [[H5641]] one [[H582]] from another. [[H7453]]

### 50
If [[H518]] thou shalt afflict [[H6031]] my daughters, [[H1323]] or if [[H518]] thou shalt take [[H3947]] wives [[H802]] beside [[H5921]] my daughters, [[H1323]] no [[H369]] man [[H376]] with [[H5973]] us; see, [[H7200]] God [[H430]] witness [[H5707]] betwixt [[H996]] me and thee. [[H996]]

### 51
And Laban [[H3837]] said [[H559]] to Jacob, [[H3290]] Behold [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] heap, [[H1530]] and behold [[H2009]] pillar, [[H4676]] which [[H834]] I have cast [[H3384]] betwixt [[H996]] me and thee; [[H996]]

### 52
This [[H2088]] heap [[H1530]] witness, [[H5707]] and pillar [[H4676]] witness, [[H5713]] that [[H518]] I [[H589]] will not [[H3808]] pass over [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] heap [[H1530]] to [[H413]] thee, and that [[H518]] thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] pass over [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] heap [[H1530]] and this [[H2063]] pillar [[H4676]] unto [[H413]] me, for harm. [[H7451]]

### 53
The God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] and the God [[H430]] of Nahor, [[H5152]] the God [[H430]] of their father, [[H1]] judge [[H8199]] betwixt [[H996]] us. And Jacob [[H3290]] sware [[H7650]] by the fear [[H6343]] of his father [[H1]] Isaac. [[H3327]]

### 54
Then Jacob [[H3290]] offered [[H2076]] sacrifice [[H2077]] upon the mount, [[H2022]] and called [[H7121]] his brethren [[H251]] to eat [[H398]] bread: [[H3899]] and they did eat [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] and tarried all night [[H3885]] in the mount. [[H2022]]

### 55
And early up, [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] Laban [[H3837]] rose and kissed [[H5401]] his sons [[H1121]] and his daughters, [[H1323]] and blessed [[H1288]] them: and Laban [[H3837]] departed, [[H1980]] and returned [[H7725]] unto his place. [[H4725]]
