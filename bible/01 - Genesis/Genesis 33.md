And Jacob [[H3290]] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] Esau [[H6215]] came, [[H935]] and with [[H5973]] him four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men. [[H376]] And he divided [[H2673]] the children [[H3206]] unto [[H5921]] Leah, [[H3812]] and unto [[H5921]] Rachel, [[H7354]] and unto [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] handmaids. [[H8198]]

And he [[H1931]] passed over [[H5674]] before them, [[H6440]] and bowed himself [[H7812]] to the ground [[H776]] seven [[H7651]] times, [[H6471]] until [[H5704]] he came near [[H5066]] to [[H5704]] his brother. [[H251]]

### 4
And Esau [[H6215]] ran [[H7323]] to meet him, [[H7125]] and embraced [[H2263]] him, and fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] his neck, [[H6677]] and kissed him: [[H5401]] and they wept. [[H1058]]

### 5
And he lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] the women [[H802]] and the children; [[H3206]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] those [[H428]] with thee? And he said, [[H559]] The children [[H3206]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] hath graciously given [[H2603]] thy servant. [[H5650]]

### 6
Then the handmaidens [[H8198]] came near, [[H5066]] they [[H2007]] and their children, [[H3206]] and they bowed themselves. [[H7812]]

### 7
And Leah [[H3812]] also [[H1571]] with her children [[H3206]] came near, [[H5066]] and bowed themselves: [[H7812]] and after [[H310]] came Joseph [[H3130]] near [[H5066]] and Rachel, [[H7354]] and they bowed themselves. [[H7812]]

### 8
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4310]] thou by all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] drove [[H4264]] which [[H834]] I met? [[H6298]] And he said, [[H559]] to find [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of my lord. [[H113]]

### 9
And Esau [[H6215]] said, [[H559]] I have [[H3426]] enough, [[H7227]] my brother; [[H251]] keep [[H1961]] that [[H834]] thou hast unto thyself. [[H834]]

### 10
And Jacob [[H3290]] said, [[H559]] Nay, [[H408]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] if [[H518]] now [[H4994]] I have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] then receive [[H3947]] my present [[H4503]] at my hand: [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] therefore [[H3651]] I have seen [[H7200]] thy face, [[H6440]] as though I had seen [[H7200]] the face [[H6440]] of God, [[H430]] and thou wast pleased me. [[H7521]] with [[H7521]]

### 11
Take, [[H3947]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] my blessing [[H1293]] that [[H834]] is brought [[H935]] to thee; because [[H3588]] God [[H430]] hath dealt graciously me, [[H2603]] with and because [[H3588]] I have [[H3426]] enough. [[H3605]] And he urged [[H6484]] him, and he took [[H3947]]

### 12
And he said, [[H559]] Let us take our journey, [[H5265]] and let us go, [[H1980]] and I will go [[H1980]] before [[H5048]] thee. [[H5048]]

### 13
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, My lord [[H113]] knoweth [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the children [[H3206]] tender, [[H7390]] and the flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] with young [[H5763]] with [[H5921]] me: and if men should overdrive [[H1849]] them one [[H259]] day, [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] the flock [[H6629]] will die. [[H4191]]

### 14
Let my lord, [[H113]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] pass over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] his servant: [[H5650]] and I [[H589]] will lead on [[H5095]] softly, [[H328]] according as [[H7272]] the cattle [[H4399]] that [[H834]] goeth before me [[H6440]] and the children [[H3206]] be able to endure, [[H7272]] until [[H834]] I come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] unto Seir. [[H8165]]

### 15
And Esau [[H6215]] said, [[H559]] Let me now [[H4994]] leave [[H3322]] with [[H5973]] thee of [[H4480]] the folk [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] me. And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] needeth it? [[H2088]] let me find [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of my lord. [[H113]]

### 16
So Esau [[H6215]] returned [[H7725]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] on his way [[H1870]] unto Seir. [[H8165]]

### 17
And Jacob [[H3290]] journeyed [[H5265]] to Succoth, [[H5523]] and built [[H1129]] him an house, [[H1004]] and made [[H6213]] booths [[H5521]] for his cattle: [[H4735]] therefore [[H3651]] the name [[H8034]] of the place [[H4725]] is called [[H7121]] Succoth. [[H5523]]

### 18
And Jacob [[H3290]] came [[H935]] to Shalem, [[H8003]] a city [[H5892]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] which [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] when he came [[H935]] from Padan-aram; [[H6307]] and pitched his tent [[H2583]] before [[H6440]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 19
And he bought [[H7069]] a parcel [[H2513]] of a field, [[H7704]] where [[H8033]] he had spread [[H5186]] his tent, [[H168]] at the hand [[H3027]] of the children [[H1121]] of Hamor, [[H2544]] Shechem's [[H7928]] father, [[H1]] for an hundred [[H3967]] pieces of money. [[H7192]]
