### 1
Thus the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] were finished, [[H3615]] and all [[H3605]] the host of them. [[H6635]]

### 2
And on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] God [[H430]] ended [[H3615]] his work [[H4399]] which [[H834]] he had made; [[H6213]] and he rested [[H7673]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] from all [[H3605]] his work [[H4399]] which [[H834]] he had made. [[H6213]]

### 3
And God [[H430]] blessed [[H1288]] the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] and sanctified [[H6942]] it: because [[H3588]] that in it he had rested [[H7673]] from all [[H3605]] his work [[H4399]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] created [[H1254]] and made. [[H6213]]

### 4
These [[H428]] the generations [[H8435]] of the heavens [[H8064]] and of the earth [[H776]] when they were created, [[H1254]] in the day [[H3117]] that the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] made [[H6213]] the earth [[H776]] and the heavens, [[H8064]]

### 5
And every [[H3605]] plant [[H7880]] of the field [[H7704]] before [[H2962]] it was [[H1961]] in the earth, [[H776]] and every [[H3605]] herb [[H6212]] of the field [[H7704]] before [[H2962]] it grew: [[H6779]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] had not [[H3808]] caused it to rain [[H4305]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and not [[H369]] a man [[H120]] to till [[H5647]] the ground. [[H127]]

### 6
But there went up [[H5927]] a mist [[H108]] from [[H4480]] the earth, [[H776]] and watered [[H8248]] the whole [[H3605]] face [[H6440]] of the ground. [[H127]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] formed [[H3335]] man [[H120]] the dust [[H6083]] of [[H4480]] the ground, [[H127]] and breathed [[H5301]] into his nostrils [[H639]] the breath [[H5397]] of life; [[H2416]] and man [[H120]] became [[H1961]] a living [[H2416]] soul. [[H5315]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] planted [[H5193]] a garden [[H1588]] eastward [[H6924]] in Eden; [[H5731]] and there [[H8033]] he put [[H7760]] the man [[H120]] whom [[H834]] he had formed. [[H3335]]

### 9
And out of [[H4480]] the ground [[H127]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] made to grow [[H6779]] every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] that is pleasant [[H2530]] to the sight, [[H4758]] and good [[H2896]] for food; [[H3978]] the tree [[H6086]] of life [[H2416]] also in the midst [[H8432]] of the garden, [[H1588]] and the tree [[H6086]] of knowledge [[H1847]] of good [[H2896]] and evil. [[H7451]]

### 10
And a river [[H5104]] went out [[H3318]] of Eden [[H5731]] to water [[H8248]] the garden; [[H1588]] and from thence [[H8033]] it was parted, [[H6504]] and became [[H1961]] into four [[H702]] heads. [[H7218]]

### 11
The name [[H8034]] of the first [[H259]] Pison: [[H6376]] that it [[H1931]] which compasseth [[H5437]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] of Havilah, [[H2341]] where [[H834]] gold; [[H2091]]

### 12
And the gold [[H2091]] of that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] good: [[H2896]] there [[H8033]] bdellium [[H916]] and the onyx [[H7718]] stone. [[H68]]

### 13
And the name [[H8034]] of the second [[H8145]] river [[H5104]] Gihon: [[H1521]] the same [[H1931]] it that compasseth [[H5437]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] of Ethiopia. [[H3568]]

### 14
And the name [[H8034]] of the third [[H7992]] river [[H5104]] Hiddekel: [[H2313]] that it [[H1931]] which goeth toward [[H1980]] the east [[H6926]] of Assyria. [[H804]] And the fourth [[H7243]] river [[H5104]] Euphrates. [[H6578]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] took [[H3947]] the man, [[H120]] and put him [[H3240]] into the garden [[H1588]] of Eden [[H5731]] to dress [[H5647]] it and to keep [[H8104]] it. [[H8104]]

### 16
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] the man, [[H120]] saying, [[H559]] Of every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] of the garden [[H1588]] thou mayest freely [[H398]] eat: [[H398]]

### 17
But of the tree [[H6086]] of the knowledge [[H1847]] of good [[H2896]] and evil, [[H7451]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of [[H4480]] it: for [[H3588]] in the day [[H3117]] that thou eatest [[H398]] thereof [[H4480]] thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die. [[H4191]]

### 18
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] that the man [[H120]] should be [[H1961]] alone; [[H905]] I will make [[H6213]] him an help meet [[H5828]] for him. [[H5048]]

### 19
And out of [[H4480]] the ground [[H127]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] formed [[H3335]] every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] and every [[H3605]] fowl [[H5775]] of the air; [[H8064]] and brought [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Adam [[H120]] to see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] he would call [[H7121]] them: and whatsoever [[H3605]] Adam [[H120]] called [[H7121]] every living [[H2416]] creature, [[H5315]] that [[H1931]] the name [[H8034]] thereof. [[H8034]]

### 20
And Adam [[H120]] gave [[H7121]] names [[H8034]] to all [[H3605]] cattle, [[H929]] and to the fowl [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field; [[H7704]] but for Adam [[H120]] there was not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] an help meet [[H5828]] for him. [[H5048]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] caused a deep sleep [[H8639]] to fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] Adam, [[H120]] and he slept: [[H3462]] and he took [[H3947]] one [[H259]] of his ribs, [[H6763]] and closed up [[H5462]] the flesh [[H1320]] instead [[H8478]] thereof; [[H8478]]

### 22
And [[H853]] the rib, [[H6763]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] had taken [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] man, [[H120]] made [[H1129]] he a woman, [[H802]] and brought [[H935]] her unto [[H413]] the man. [[H120]]

### 23
And Adam [[H120]] said, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] now [[H6471]] bone [[H6106]] of my bones, [[H6106]] and flesh [[H1320]] of my flesh: [[H1320]] she [[H2063]] shall be called [[H7121]] Woman, [[H802]] because [[H3588]] she [[H2063]] was taken [[H3947]] out of Man. [[H376]]

### 24
Therefore [[H3651]] shall a man [[H376]] leave [[H5800]] his father [[H1]] and his mother, [[H517]] and shall cleave [[H1692]] unto his wife: [[H802]] and they shall be [[H1961]] one [[H259]] flesh. [[H1320]]

### 25
And they were [[H1961]] both [[H8147]] naked, [[H6174]] the man [[H120]] and his wife, [[H802]] and were not [[H3808]] ashamed. [[H954]]
