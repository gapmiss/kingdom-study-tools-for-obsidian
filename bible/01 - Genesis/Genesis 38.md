### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] that Judah [[H3063]] went down [[H3381]]  from [[H853]] his brethren, [[H251]] and turned in [[H5186]] to [[H5704]] a certain [[H376]] Adullamite, [[H5726]] whose name [[H8034]] Hirah. [[H2437]]

### 2
And Judah [[H3063]] saw [[H7200]] there [[H8033]] a daughter [[H1323]] of a certain [[H376]] Canaanite, [[H3669]] whose name [[H8034]] Shuah; [[H7770]] and he took her, [[H3947]] and went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her. [[H413]]

### 3
And she conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and he called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Er. [[H6147]]

### 4
And she conceived [[H2029]] again, [[H5750]] and bare [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Onan. [[H209]]

### 5
And she yet again [[H5750]] conceived, [[H3254]] and bare [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Shelah: [[H7956]] and he was [[H1961]] at Chezib, [[H3580]] when she bare [[H3205]] him. [[H3205]]

### 6
And Judah [[H3063]] took [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for Er [[H6147]] his firstborn, [[H1060]] whose name [[H8034]] Tamar. [[H8559]]

### 7
And Er, [[H6147]] Judah's [[H3063]] firstborn, [[H1060]] was [[H1961]] wicked [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] slew [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 8
And Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] unto Onan, [[H209]] Go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thy brother's [[H251]] wife, [[H802]] and marry [[H2992]] her, and raise up [[H6965]] seed [[H2233]] to thy brother. [[H251]]

### 9
And Onan [[H209]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the seed [[H2233]] should not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] his; and it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H518]] he went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] his brother's [[H251]] wife, [[H802]] that he spilled [[H7843]] on the ground, [[H776]] lest [[H1115]] that he should give [[H5414]] seed [[H2233]] to his brother. [[H251]]

### 10
And the thing which [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] displeased [[H7489]] the Lord: [[H3068]] wherefore he slew [[H4191]] him also. [[H1571]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] Judah [[H3063]] to Tamar [[H8559]] his daughter in law, [[H3618]] Remain [[H3427]] a widow [[H490]] at thy father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] till [[H5704]] Shelah [[H7956]] my son [[H1121]] be grown: [[H1431]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] Lest peradventure [[H6435]] he [[H1931]] die [[H4191]] also, [[H1571]] as his brethren [[H251]] And Tamar [[H8559]] went [[H1980]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in her father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 12
And in process [[H7235]] of time [[H3117]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Shuah [[H7770]] Judah's [[H3063]] wife [[H802]] died; [[H4191]] and Judah [[H3063]] was comforted, [[H5162]] and went up [[H5927]] unto [[H5921]] his sheepshearers [[H1494]] to Timnath, [[H8553]] he [[H1931]] and his friend [[H7453]] Hirah [[H2437]] the Adullamite. [[H5726]]

### 13
And it was told [[H5046]] Tamar, [[H8559]] saying, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] thy father in law [[H2524]] goeth up [[H5927]] to Timnath [[H8553]] to shear [[H1494]] his sheep. [[H6629]]

### 14
And she put [[H5493]] her widow's [[H491]] garments [[H899]] off from [[H5921]] her, and covered her [[H3680]] with a vail, [[H6809]] and wrapped herself, [[H5968]] and sat in [[H3427]] an open [[H5869]] place, [[H6607]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the way [[H1870]] to Timnath; [[H8553]] for [[H3588]] she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Shelah [[H7956]] was grown, [[H1431]] and she [[H1931]] was not [[H3808]] given [[H5414]] unto him to wife. [[H802]]

### 15
When Judah [[H3063]] saw her, [[H7200]] he thought [[H2803]] her an harlot; [[H2181]] because [[H3588]] she had covered [[H3680]] her face. [[H6440]]

### 16
And he turned [[H5186]] unto [[H413]] her by [[H413]] the way, [[H1870]] and said, [[H559]] Go to, [[H3051]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] let me come in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee; (for [[H3588]] he knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] his daughter in law.) [[H3618]] And she said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] wilt thou give [[H5414]] me, that [[H3588]] thou mayest come in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me? [[H413]]

### 17
And he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] will send [[H7971]] a kid [[H5795]] from [[H4480]] the flock. [[H6629]] And she said, [[H559]] Wilt thou give [[H5414]] a pledge, [[H6162]] till [[H5704]] thou send [[H7971]]

### 18
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] pledge [[H6162]] shall I give [[H5414]] thee? And she said, [[H559]] Thy signet, [[H2368]] and thy bracelets, [[H6616]] and thy staff [[H4294]] that [[H834]] in thine hand. [[H3027]] And he gave [[H5414]] her, and came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her, and she conceived [[H2029]] by him. [[H2029]]

### 19
And she arose, [[H6965]] and went away, [[H1980]] and laid by [[H5493]] her vail [[H6809]] from [[H5921]] her, and put on [[H3847]] the garments [[H899]] of her widowhood. [[H491]]

### 20
And Judah [[H3063]] sent [[H7971]] the kid [[H1423]] by the hand [[H3027]] of his friend [[H7453]] the Adullamite, [[H5726]] to receive [[H3947]] pledge [[H6162]] from the woman's [[H802]] hand: [[H3027]] but he found her [[H4672]] not. [[H3808]]

### 21
Then he asked [[H7592]] the men [[H582]] of that place, [[H4725]] saying, [[H559]] Where [[H346]] the harlot, [[H6948]] that [[H1931]] openly [[H5879]] by [[H5921]] the way side? [[H1870]] And they said, [[H559]] There was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] harlot [[H6948]] in this [[H2088]]

### 22
And he returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Judah, [[H3063]] and said, [[H559]] I cannot [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] her; and also [[H1571]] the men [[H376]] of the place [[H4725]] said, [[H559]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] harlot [[H6948]] in this [[H2088]]

### 23
And Judah [[H3063]] said, [[H559]] Let her take [[H3947]] to her, lest [[H6435]] we be [[H1961]] shamed: [[H937]] behold, [[H2009]] I sent [[H7971]] this [[H2088]] kid, [[H1423]] and thou [[H859]] hast not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] her. [[H4672]]

### 24
And it came to pass [[H1961]] about three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] after, that it was told [[H5046]] Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] Tamar [[H8559]] thy daughter in law [[H3618]] hath played the harlot; [[H2181]] and also, [[H1571]] behold, [[H2009]] she with child [[H2030]] by whoredom. [[H2183]] And Judah [[H3063]] said, [[H559]] Bring her forth, [[H3318]] and let her be burnt. [[H8313]]

### 25
When she [[H1931]] brought forth, [[H3318]] she [[H1931]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] her father in law, [[H2524]] saying, [[H559]] By the man, [[H582]] whose [[H834]] these [[H428]] I [[H595]] with child: [[H2030]] and she said, [[H559]] Discern, [[H5234]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] whose [[H4310]] these, [[H428]] the signet, [[H2858]] and bracelets, [[H6616]] and staff. [[H4294]]

### 26
And Judah [[H3063]] acknowledged [[H5234]] and said, [[H559]] She hath been more righteous [[H6663]] than [[H4480]] I; because [[H3588]] that [[H3651]] I gave [[H5414]] her not [[H3808]] to Shelah [[H7956]] my son. [[H1121]] And he knew her [[H3045]] again [[H3254]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]]

### 27
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the time [[H6256]] of her travail, [[H3205]] that, behold, [[H2009]] twins [[H8380]] in her womb. [[H990]]

### 28
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when she travailed, [[H3205]] that put out [[H5414]] hand: [[H3027]] and the midwife [[H3205]] took [[H3947]] and bound [[H7194]] upon [[H5921]] his hand [[H3027]] a scarlet thread, [[H8144]] saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] came out [[H3318]] first. [[H7223]]

### 29
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as he drew back [[H7725]] his hand, [[H3027]] that, behold, [[H2009]] his brother [[H251]] came out: [[H3318]] and she said, [[H559]] How [[H4100]] hast thou broken forth? [[H6555]] breach [[H6556]] upon [[H5921]] thee: therefore his name [[H8034]] was called [[H7121]] Pharez. [[H6557]]

### 30
And afterward [[H310]] came out [[H3318]] his brother, [[H251]] that [[H834]] had the scarlet thread [[H8144]] upon [[H5921]] his hand: [[H3027]] and his name [[H8034]] was called [[H7121]] Zarah. [[H2226]]
