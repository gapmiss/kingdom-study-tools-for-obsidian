### 1
Now when Jacob [[H3290]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] there was [[H3426]] corn [[H7668]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] unto his sons, [[H1121]] Why [[H4100]] do ye look [[H7200]] one upon another? [[H7200]]

### 2
And he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] corn [[H7668]] in Egypt: [[H4714]] get you down [[H3381]] thither, [[H8033]] and buy [[H7666]] for us from thence; [[H8033]] that we may live, [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 3
And Joseph's [[H3130]] ten [[H6235]] brethren [[H251]] went down [[H3381]] to buy [[H7666]] corn [[H1250]] in Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 4
But Benjamin, [[H1144]] Joseph's [[H3130]] brother, [[H251]] Jacob [[H3290]] sent [[H7971]] not [[H3808]] with [[H854]] his brethren; [[H251]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] Lest peradventure [[H6435]] mischief [[H611]] befall him. [[H7122]]

### 5
And the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to buy [[H7666]] among [[H8432]] those that came: [[H935]] for [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] was [[H1961]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 6
And Joseph [[H3130]] the governor [[H7989]] over [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]] he [[H1931]] that sold [[H7666]] to all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land: [[H776]] and Joseph's [[H3130]] brethren [[H251]] came, [[H935]] and bowed down themselves [[H7812]] before him their faces [[H639]] to the earth. [[H776]]

### 7
And Joseph [[H3130]] saw [[H7200]] his brethren, [[H251]] and he knew [[H5234]] them, but made himself strange [[H5234]] unto [[H413]] them, and spake [[H1696]] roughly [[H7186]] unto [[H854]] them; and he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Whence [[H370]] come [[H935]] ye? And they said, [[H559]] From the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] to buy [[H7666]] food. [[H400]]

### 8
And Joseph [[H3130]] knew [[H5234]] his brethren, [[H251]] but they [[H1992]] knew [[H5234]] not [[H3808]] him. [[H3808]]

### 9
And Joseph [[H3130]] remembered [[H2142]] the dreams [[H2472]] which [[H834]] he dreamed [[H2492]] of them, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Ye [[H859]] spies; [[H7270]] to see [[H7200]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of the land [[H776]] ye are come. [[H935]]

### 10
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Nay, [[H3808]] my lord, [[H113]] but to buy [[H7666]] food [[H400]] are thy servants [[H5650]] come. [[H935]]

### 11
We [[H5168]] all [[H3605]] one [[H259]] man's [[H376]] sons; [[H1121]] we [[H587]] true [[H3651]] thy servants [[H5650]] are [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] spies. [[H7270]]

### 12
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Nay, [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] to see [[H7200]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of the land [[H776]] ye are come. [[H935]]

### 13
And they said, [[H559]] Thy servants [[H5650]] twelve [[H8147]] brethren, [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of one [[H259]] man [[H376]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan; [[H3667]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the youngest [[H6996]] this day [[H3117]] with [[H854]] our father, [[H1]] and one [[H259]] not. [[H369]]

### 14
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, That [[H1931]] that [[H834]] I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you, saying, [[H559]] Ye [[H859]] spies: [[H7270]]

### 15
Hereby [[H2063]] ye shall be proved: [[H974]] By the life [[H2416]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] ye shall not go forth [[H3318]] hence, [[H2088]] except [[H518]] your youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] come [[H935]] hither. [[H2008]]

### 16
Send [[H7971]] one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] you, and let him fetch [[H3947]] your brother, [[H251]] and ye [[H859]] shall be kept in prison, [[H631]] that your words [[H1697]] may be proved, [[H974]] whether truth [[H571]] in [[H854]] you: or else [[H3808]] by the life [[H2416]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] surely [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] spies. [[H7270]]

### 17
And he put them all together [[H622]] into [[H413]] ward [[H4929]] three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]]

### 18
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] This [[H2063]] do, [[H6213]] and live; [[H2421]] I [[H589]] fear [[H3372]] God: [[H430]]

### 19
If [[H518]] ye [[H859]] true [[H3651]] let one [[H259]] of your brethren [[H251]] be bound [[H631]] in the house [[H1004]] of your prison: [[H4929]] go [[H1980]] ye, [[H859]] carry [[H935]] corn [[H7668]] for the famine [[H7459]] of your houses: [[H1004]]

### 20
But bring [[H935]] your youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] unto [[H413]] me; so shall your words [[H1697]] be verified, [[H539]] and ye shall not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] And they did [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]]

### 21
And they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H251]] We [[H587]] verily [[H61]] guilty [[H818]] concerning [[H5921]] our brother, [[H251]] in that [[H834]] we saw [[H7200]] the anguish [[H6869]] of his soul, [[H5315]] when he besought [[H2603]] us, and we would not [[H3808]] hear; [[H8085]] therefore [[H3651]] is this [[H2063]] distress [[H6869]] come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] us. [[H413]]

### 22
And Reuben [[H7205]] answered [[H6030]] them, saying, [[H559]] Spake I [[H559]] not [[H3808]] unto you, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] Do not [[H408]] sin [[H2398]] against the child; [[H3206]] and ye would not [[H3808]] hear? [[H8085]] therefore, behold, [[H2009]] also [[H1571]] his blood [[H1818]] is required. [[H1875]]

### 23
And they [[H1992]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] Joseph [[H3130]] understood [[H8085]] for [[H3588]] he spake unto [[H996]] them by an interpreter. [[H3887]]

### 24
And he turned himself about [[H5437]] from [[H5921]] them, and wept; [[H1058]] and returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] them again, and communed [[H1696]] with [[H413]] them, and took [[H3947]] from them [[H853]] Simeon, [[H8095]] and bound him before [[H631]] their eyes. [[H5869]]

### 25
Then Joseph [[H3130]] commanded [[H6680]] to fill [[H4390]] their sacks [[H3627]] with corn, [[H1250]] and to restore [[H7725]] every man's [[H376]] money [[H3701]] into [[H413]] his sack, [[H8242]] and to give [[H5414]] them provision [[H6720]] for the way: [[H1870]] and thus [[H3651]] did he unto them. [[H6213]]

### 26
And they laded [[H5375]] their asses [[H2543]]  with [[H853]] the corn, [[H7668]] and departed [[H1980]] thence. [[H8033]]

### 27
And as one [[H259]] of them opened [[H6605]] his sack [[H8242]] to give [[H5414]] his ass [[H2543]] provender [[H4554]] in the inn, [[H4411]] he espied [[H7200]] his money; [[H3701]] for, behold, [[H2009]] it [[H1931]] in his sack's [[H572]] mouth. [[H6310]]

### 28
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] My money [[H3701]] is restored; [[H7725]] and, lo, [[H2009]] even [[H1571]] in my sack: [[H572]] and their heart [[H3820]] failed [[H3318]] and they were afraid, [[H2729]] saying [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H251]] What [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] God [[H430]] hath done [[H6213]] unto us? [[H6213]]

### 29
And they came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Jacob [[H3290]] their father [[H1]] unto the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and told [[H5046]]  him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that befell [[H7136]] unto them; saying, [[H559]]

### 30
The man, [[H582]] the lord [[H113]] of the land, [[H776]] spake [[H1696]] roughly [[H7186]] to [[H854]] us, and took [[H5414]] us for spies [[H7270]]  of [[H853]] the country. [[H776]]

### 31
And we said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, We [[H587]] true [[H3651]] we are [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] spies: [[H7270]]

### 32
We [[H587]] twelve [[H6240]] brethren, [[H251]] sons [[H1121]] of our father; [[H1]] one [[H259]] not, [[H369]] and the youngest [[H6996]] this day [[H3117]] with [[H854]] our father [[H1]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 33
And the man, [[H376]] the lord [[H113]] of the country, [[H776]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] us, Hereby [[H2063]] shall I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] true [[H3651]] leave [[H3240]] one [[H259]] of your brethren [[H251]] with [[H854]] me, and take [[H3947]] the famine [[H7459]] of your households, [[H1004]] and be gone: [[H1980]]

### 34
And bring [[H935]] your youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] unto [[H413]] me: then shall I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] no [[H3808]] spies, [[H7270]] but [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] true [[H3651]] will I deliver [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] your brother, [[H251]] and ye shall traffick [[H5503]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 35
And it came to pass [[H1961]] as they [[H1992]] emptied [[H7324]] their sacks, [[H8242]] that, behold, [[H2009]] every man's [[H376]] bundle [[H6872]] of money [[H3701]] in his sack: [[H8242]] and when they [[H1992]] and their father [[H1]] saw [[H7200]] the bundles [[H6872]] of money, [[H3701]] they were afraid. [[H3372]]

### 36
And Jacob [[H3290]] their father [[H1]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Me have ye bereaved [[H7921]] Joseph [[H3130]] not, [[H369]] and Simeon [[H8095]] not, [[H369]] and ye will take [[H3947]] Benjamin [[H1144]] all [[H3605]] these things are [[H1961]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 37
And Reuben [[H7205]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] Slay [[H4191]] my two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] I bring [[H935]] him not [[H3808]] to [[H413]] thee: deliver [[H5414]] him into [[H5921]] my hand, [[H3027]] and I [[H589]] will bring [[H7725]] him to [[H413]] thee again. [[H413]]

### 38
And he said, [[H559]] My son [[H1121]] shall not [[H3808]] go down [[H3381]] with [[H5973]] you; for [[H3588]] his brother [[H251]] is dead, [[H4191]] and he [[H1931]] is left [[H7604]] alone: [[H905]] if mischief [[H611]] befall [[H7122]] him by the way [[H1870]] in the which [[H834]] ye go, [[H1980]] then shall ye bring down [[H3381]] my gray hairs [[H7872]] with sorrow [[H3015]] to the grave. [[H7585]]
