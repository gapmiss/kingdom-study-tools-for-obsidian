### 1
And Dinah [[H1783]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Leah, [[H3812]] which [[H834]] she bare [[H3205]] unto Jacob, [[H3290]] went out [[H3318]] to see [[H7200]] the daughters [[H1323]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 2
And when Shechem [[H7928]] the son [[H1121]] of Hamor [[H2544]] the Hivite, [[H2340]] prince [[H5387]] of the country, [[H776]] saw [[H7200]] her, he took [[H3947]] her, and lay [[H7901]] with her, and defiled her. [[H6031]]

### 3
And his soul [[H5315]] clave [[H1692]] unto Dinah [[H1783]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and he loved [[H157]] the damsel, [[H5291]] and spake [[H1696]] kindly [[H3820]] unto the damsel. [[H5291]]

### 4
And Shechem [[H7928]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his father [[H1]] Hamor, [[H2544]] saying, [[H559]] Get [[H3947]]  me [[H853]] this [[H2063]] damsel [[H3207]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 5
And Jacob [[H3290]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] he had defiled [[H2930]] Dinah [[H1783]] his daughter: [[H1323]] now his sons [[H1121]] were [[H1961]] with [[H854]] his cattle [[H4735]] in the field: [[H7704]] and Jacob [[H3290]] held his peace [[H2790]] until [[H5704]] they were come. [[H935]]

### 6
And Hamor [[H2544]] the father [[H1]] of Shechem [[H7928]] went out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] Jacob [[H3290]] to commune [[H1696]] with him. [[H854]]

### 7
And the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] came [[H935]] out of [[H4480]] the field [[H7704]] when they heard [[H8085]] and the men [[H376]] were grieved, [[H6087]] and they were very [[H3966]] wroth, [[H2734]] because [[H3588]] he had wrought [[H6213]] folly [[H5039]] in Israel [[H3478]] in lying [[H7901]]  with [[H854]] Jacob's [[H3290]] daughter; [[H1323]] which thing [[H3651]] ought not [[H3808]] to be done. [[H6213]]

### 8
And Hamor [[H2544]] communed [[H1696]] with [[H854]] them, saying, [[H559]] The soul [[H5315]] of my son [[H1121]] Shechem [[H7928]] longeth [[H2836]] for your daughter: [[H1323]] I pray you [[H4994]] give [[H5414]] her him to wife. [[H802]]

### 9
And make ye marriages [[H2859]] with [[H854]] us, give [[H5414]] your daughters [[H1323]] unto us, and take [[H3947]] our daughters [[H1323]] unto you. [[H1323]]

### 10
And ye shall dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] us: and the land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] before you; [[H6440]] dwell [[H3427]] and trade [[H5503]] ye therein, and get you possessions [[H270]] therein. [[H270]]

### 11
And Shechem [[H7928]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her father [[H1]] and unto [[H413]] her brethren, [[H251]] Let me find [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] and what [[H834]] ye shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me I will give. [[H5414]]

### 12
Ask [[H7235]] me never so much [[H3966]] dowry [[H4119]] and gift, [[H4976]] and I will give [[H5414]] according as [[H834]] ye shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me: but give [[H5414]]  me [[H853]] the damsel [[H5291]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 13
And the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] answered [[H6030]] Shechem [[H7928]] and Hamor [[H2544]] his father [[H1]] deceitfully, [[H4820]] and said, [[H1696]] because [[H834]] he had defiled [[H2930]] Dinah [[H1783]] their sister: [[H269]]

### 14
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, We cannot [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] to give [[H5414]] our sister [[H269]] to one [[H582]] that [[H834]] is uncircumcised; [[H6190]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] a reproach [[H2781]] unto us: [[H0]]

### 15
But [[H389]] in this [[H2063]] will we consent [[H225]] unto you: If [[H518]] ye will be [[H1961]] as we that every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] of you be circumcised; [[H4135]]

### 16
Then will we give [[H5414]] our daughters [[H1323]] unto you, and we will take [[H3947]] your daughters [[H1323]] to us, and we will dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] you, and we will become [[H1961]] one [[H259]] people. [[H5971]]

### 17
But if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] us, to be circumcised; [[H4135]] then will we take [[H3947]] our daughter, [[H1323]] and we will be gone. [[H1980]]

### 18
And their words [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] Hamor, [[H2544]] and Shechem [[H7928]] Hamor's [[H2544]] son. [[H1121]]

### 19
And the young man [[H5288]] deferred [[H309]] not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] the thing, [[H1697]] because [[H3588]] he had delight [[H2654]] in Jacob's [[H3290]] daughter: [[H1323]] and he [[H1931]] more honourable [[H3513]] than all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of his father. [[H1]]

### 20
And Hamor [[H2544]] and Shechem [[H7928]] his son [[H1121]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] of their city, [[H5892]] and communed [[H1696]] with [[H413]] the men [[H582]] of their city, [[H5892]] saying, [[H559]]

### 21
These [[H428]] men [[H376]] peaceable [[H8003]] with [[H854]] us; therefore let them dwell [[H3427]] in the land, [[H776]] and trade [[H5503]] therein; for the land, [[H776]] behold, [[H2009]] large [[H7342]] enough [[H3027]] for them; [[H6440]] let us take [[H3947]] their daughters [[H1323]] to us for wives, [[H802]] and let us give [[H5414]] them our daughters. [[H1323]]

### 22
Only [[H389]] herein [[H2063]] will the men [[H376]] consent [[H225]] unto us for to dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] us, to be [[H1961]] one [[H259]] people, [[H5971]] if every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] among us be circumcised, [[H4135]] as [[H834]] they [[H1992]] circumcised. [[H4135]]

### 23
not [[H3808]] their cattle [[H4735]] and their substance [[H7075]] and every [[H3605]] beast [[H929]] of theirs ours? only [[H389]] let us consent [[H225]] unto them, and they will dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] us. [[H854]]

### 24
And unto [[H413]] Hamor [[H2544]] and unto [[H413]] Shechem [[H7928]] his son [[H1121]] hearkened [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] that went out [[H3318]] of the gate [[H8179]] of his city; [[H5892]] and every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] was circumcised, [[H4135]] all [[H3605]] that went out [[H3318]] of the gate [[H8179]] of his city. [[H5892]]

### 25
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] when they were [[H1961]] sore, [[H3510]] that two [[H8147]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] Simeon [[H8095]] and Levi, [[H3878]] Dinah's [[H1783]] brethren, [[H251]] took [[H3947]] each man [[H376]] his sword, [[H2719]] and came [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] the city [[H5892]] boldly, [[H983]] and slew [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the males. [[H2145]]

### 26
And they slew [[H2026]] Hamor [[H2544]] and Shechem [[H7928]] his son [[H1121]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and took [[H3947]] Dinah [[H1783]] out of Shechem's [[H7928]] house, [[H1004]] and went out. [[H3318]]

### 27
The sons [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] came [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] the slain, [[H2491]] and spoiled [[H962]] the city, [[H5892]] because [[H834]] they had defiled [[H2930]] their sister. [[H269]]

### 28
They took [[H3947]] their sheep, [[H6629]] and their oxen, [[H1241]] and their asses, [[H2543]] and that which [[H834]] in the city, [[H5892]] and that which [[H834]] in the field, [[H7704]]

### 29
And all [[H3605]] their wealth, [[H2428]] and all [[H3605]] their little ones, [[H2945]] and their wives [[H802]] took they captive, [[H7617]] and spoiled [[H962]] even all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in the house. [[H1004]]

### 30
And Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Simeon [[H8095]] and Levi, [[H3878]] Ye have troubled [[H5916]] me to make me to stink [[H887]] among the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] among the Canaanites [[H3669]] and the Perizzites: [[H6522]] and I [[H589]] few [[H4962]] in number, [[H4557]] they shall gather themselves together [[H622]] against [[H5921]] me, and slay me; [[H5221]] and I shall be destroyed, [[H8045]] I [[H589]] and my house. [[H1004]]

### 31
And they said, [[H559]] Should he deal with [[H6213]] our sister [[H269]] as with an harlot? [[H2181]]
