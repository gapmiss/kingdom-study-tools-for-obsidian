### 3
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] What [[H4100]] your occupation? [[H4639]] And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Thy servants [[H5650]] shepherds, [[H7462]] both [[H1571]] we, [[H587]] also [[H1571]] our fathers. [[H1]]

They said [[H559]] moreover unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] For to sojourn [[H1481]] in the land [[H776]] are we come; [[H935]] for [[H834]] thy servants [[H5650]] have no [[H369]] pasture [[H4829]] for their flocks; [[H6629]] for [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] sore [[H3515]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan: [[H3667]] now [[H6258]] therefore, we pray thee, [[H4994]] let thy servants [[H5650]] dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen. [[H1657]]

The land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] before thee; [[H6440]] in the best [[H4315]] of the land [[H776]]  make [[H853]] thy father [[H1]] and brethren [[H251]] to dwell; [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen [[H1657]] let them dwell: [[H3427]] and if [[H518]] thou knowest [[H3045]] men [[H376]] of activity [[H2428]] among them, then make them [[H7760]] rulers [[H8269]] over my [[H834]] cattle. [[H4735]]

### 7
And Joseph [[H3130]] brought in [[H935]] Jacob [[H3290]] his father, [[H1]] and set him [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] and Jacob [[H3290]] blessed [[H1288]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 8
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] How [[H4100]] old [[H3117]] thou? [[H8141]]

### 9
And Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] The days [[H3117]] of the years [[H8141]] of my pilgrimage [[H4033]] an hundred [[H3967]] and thirty [[H7970]] years: [[H8141]] few [[H4592]] and evil [[H7451]] have the days [[H3117]] of the years [[H8141]] of my life [[H2416]] been, [[H1961]] and have not [[H3808]] attained unto [[H5381]] the days [[H3117]] of the years [[H8141]] of the life [[H2416]] of my fathers [[H1]] in the days [[H3117]] of their pilgrimage. [[H4033]]

### 10
And Jacob [[H3290]] blessed [[H1288]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and went out [[H3318]] from before [[H6440]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 11
And Joseph [[H3130]] placed [[H3427]] his father [[H1]] and his brethren, [[H251]] and gave them [[H5414]] a possession [[H272]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] in the best [[H4315]] of the land, [[H776]] in the land [[H776]] of Rameses, [[H7486]] as [[H834]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] had commanded. [[H6680]]

### 12
And Joseph [[H3130]] nourished [[H3557]] his father, [[H1]] and his brethren, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] his father's [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] with bread, [[H3899]] according to [[H6310]] families. [[H2945]]

### 13
And no [[H369]] bread [[H3899]] in all [[H3605]] the land; [[H776]] for [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] very [[H3966]] sore, [[H3515]] so that the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] fainted [[H3856]] by reason of [[H6440]] the famine. [[H7458]]

### 14
And Joseph [[H3130]] gathered up [[H3950]] all [[H3605]] the money [[H3701]] that was found [[H4672]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] for the corn [[H7668]] which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] bought: [[H7666]] and Joseph [[H3130]] brought [[H935]] the money [[H3701]] into Pharaoh's [[H6547]] house. [[H1004]]

### 15
And when money [[H3701]] failed [[H8552]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] all [[H3605]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and said, [[H559]] Give [[H3051]] us bread: [[H3899]] for why [[H4100]] should we die [[H4191]] in thy presence? [[H5048]] for [[H3588]] the money [[H3701]] faileth. [[H656]]

### 16
And Joseph [[H3130]] said, [[H559]] Give [[H3051]] your cattle; [[H4735]] and I will give [[H5414]] you for your cattle, [[H4735]] if [[H518]] money [[H3701]] fail. [[H656]]

### 17
And they brought [[H935]] their cattle [[H4735]] unto [[H413]] Joseph: [[H3130]] and Joseph [[H3130]] gave [[H5414]] them bread [[H3899]] for horses, [[H5483]] and for the flocks, [[H6629]] and for the cattle [[H4735]] of the herds, [[H1241]] and for the asses: [[H2543]] and he fed [[H5095]] them with bread [[H3899]] for all [[H3605]] their cattle [[H4735]] for that [[H1931]] year. [[H8141]]

### 18
When that [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] was ended, [[H8552]] they came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] him the second [[H8145]] year, [[H8141]] and said [[H559]] unto him, We will not [[H3808]] hide [[H3582]] from my lord, [[H113]] how that [[H518]] our money [[H3701]] is spent; [[H8552]] my lord [[H113]] also hath [[H413]] our herds [[H4735]] of cattle; [[H929]] there is not [[H3808]] ought left [[H7604]] in the sight [[H6440]] of my lord, [[H113]] but [[H518]] our bodies, [[H1472]] and our lands: [[H127]]

### 19
Wherefore [[H4100]] shall we die [[H4191]] before thine eyes, [[H5869]] both [[H1571]] we [[H587]] and [[H1571]] our land? [[H127]] buy [[H7069]] us and our land [[H127]] for bread, [[H3899]] and we [[H587]] and our land [[H127]] will be [[H1961]] servants [[H5650]] unto Pharaoh: [[H6547]] and give [[H5414]] seed, [[H2233]] that we may live, [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] that the land [[H127]] be not desolate. [[H3456]]

### 20
And Joseph [[H3130]] bought [[H7069]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H127]] of Egypt [[H4714]] for Pharaoh; [[H6547]] for [[H3588]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] sold [[H4376]] every man [[H582]] his field, [[H7704]] because [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] prevailed [[H2388]] over [[H5921]] them: so the land [[H776]] became [[H1961]] Pharaoh's. [[H6547]]

### 21
And as for the people, [[H5971]] he removed [[H5674]] them to cities [[H5892]] from end [[H7097]] of the borders [[H1366]] of Egypt [[H4714]] even to [[H5704]] the end [[H7097]] thereof. [[H7097]]

### 22
Only [[H7535]] the land [[H127]] of the priests [[H3548]] bought he [[H7069]] not; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] the priests [[H3548]] had a portion [[H2706]] of [[H853]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and did eat [[H398]] their portion [[H2706]] which [[H834]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] gave [[H5414]] them: wherefore [[H3651]] they sold [[H4376]] not [[H3808]] their lands. [[H127]]

### 23
Then Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Behold, [[H2005]] I have bought [[H7069]] you this day [[H3117]] and your land [[H127]] for Pharaoh: [[H6547]] lo, [[H1887]] seed [[H2233]] for you, and ye shall sow [[H2232]] the land. [[H127]]

### 24
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in the increase, [[H8393]] that ye shall give [[H5414]] the fifth [[H2549]] unto Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and four [[H702]] parts [[H3027]] shall be [[H1961]] your own, for seed [[H2233]] of the field, [[H7704]] and for your food, [[H400]] and for them [[H834]] of your households, [[H1004]] and for food [[H398]] for your little ones. [[H2945]]

### 25
And they said, [[H559]] Thou hast saved our lives: [[H2421]] let us find [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of my lord, [[H113]] and we will be [[H1961]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] servants. [[H5650]]

### 26
And Joseph [[H3130]] made [[H7760]] it a law [[H2706]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] should have the fifth [[H2569]] except [[H7535]] the land [[H127]] of the priests [[H3548]] only, [[H905]] became [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] Pharaoh's. [[H6547]]

### 27
And Israel [[H3478]] dwelt [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] in the country [[H776]] of Goshen; [[H1657]] and they had possessions [[H270]] therein, and grew, [[H6509]] and multiplied [[H7235]] exceedingly. [[H3966]]

### 28
And Jacob [[H3290]] lived [[H2421]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] seventeen [[H6240]] years: [[H8141]] so the whole age [[H3117]] of Jacob [[H3290]] was [[H1961]] an hundred [[H3967]] forty [[H705]] and seven [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]]

### 29
And the time [[H3117]] drew nigh [[H7126]] that Israel [[H3478]] must die: [[H4191]] and he called [[H7121]] his son [[H1121]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and said [[H559]] unto him, If [[H518]] now [[H4994]] I have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] put, [[H7760]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] thy hand [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] my thigh, [[H3409]] and deal [[H6213]] kindly [[H2617]] and truly [[H571]] with me; bury [[H6912]] me not, [[H408]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] in Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 30
But I will lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] my fathers, [[H1]] and thou shalt carry [[H5375]] me out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and bury [[H6912]] me in their buryingplace. [[H6900]] And he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] will do [[H6213]] as thou hast said. [[H1697]]

### 31
And he said, [[H559]] Swear [[H7650]] unto me. And he sware [[H7650]] unto him. And Israel [[H3478]] bowed himself [[H7812]] upon [[H5921]] the bed's [[H4296]] head. [[H7218]]
