### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] that God [[H430]] did tempt [[H5254]] Abraham, [[H85]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Abraham: [[H85]] and he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H2009]]

### 2
And he said, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] now [[H4994]] thy son, [[H1121]] thine only [[H3173]] Isaac, [[H3327]] whom [[H834]] thou lovest, [[H157]] and get thee [[H1980]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Moriah; [[H4179]] and offer him [[H5927]] there [[H8033]] for a burnt offering [[H5930]] upon [[H5921]] one [[H259]] of the mountains [[H2022]] which [[H834]] I will tell [[H559]] thee of. [[H413]]

### 3
And Abraham [[H85]] rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and saddled [[H2280]] his ass, [[H2543]] and took [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] of his young men [[H5288]] with [[H854]] him, and Isaac [[H3327]] his son, [[H1121]] and clave [[H1234]] the wood [[H6086]] for the burnt offering, [[H5930]] and rose up, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of which [[H834]] God [[H430]] had told [[H559]] him. [[H559]]

### 4
Then on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] Abraham [[H85]] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] the place [[H4725]] afar off. [[H7350]]

### 5
And Abraham [[H85]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his young men, [[H5288]] Abide [[H3427]] ye here [[H6311]] with [[H5973]] the ass; [[H2543]] and I [[H589]] and the lad [[H5288]] will go [[H1980]] yonder [[H3541]] and worship, [[H7812]] and come again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 6
And Abraham [[H85]] took [[H3947]] the wood [[H6086]] of the burnt offering, [[H5930]] and laid [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] Isaac [[H3327]] his son; [[H1121]] and he took [[H3947]] the fire [[H784]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and a knife; [[H3979]] and they went [[H1980]] both [[H8147]] of them together. [[H3162]]

### 7
And Isaac [[H3327]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abraham [[H85]] his father, [[H1]] and said, [[H559]] My father: [[H1]] and he said, [[H559]] Here [[H2009]] I, my son. [[H1121]] And he said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] the fire [[H784]] and the wood: [[H6086]] but where [[H346]] the lamb [[H7716]] for a burnt offering? [[H5930]]

### 8
And Abraham [[H85]] said, [[H559]] My son, [[H1121]] God [[H430]] will provide [[H7200]] himself a lamb [[H7716]] for a burnt offering: [[H5930]] so they went [[H1980]] both [[H8147]] of them together. [[H3162]]

### 9
And they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] had told [[H559]] him of; and Abraham [[H85]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] there, [[H8033]] and laid the wood [[H6086]] in order, [[H6186]] and bound [[H6123]] Isaac [[H3327]] his son, [[H1121]] and laid [[H7760]] him on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] upon [[H4605]] the wood. [[H6086]]

### 10
And Abraham [[H85]] stretched forth [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] and took [[H3947]] the knife [[H3979]] to slay [[H7819]] his son. [[H1121]]

### 11
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] him out of [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and said, [[H559]] Abraham, [[H85]] Abraham: [[H85]] and he said, [[H559]] Here [[H2009]] I. [[H2009]]

### 12
And he said, [[H559]] Lay [[H7971]] not [[H408]] thine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H413]] the lad, [[H5288]] neither [[H408]] do thou [[H6213]] any thing [[H3972]] unto him: for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] fearest [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] seeing thou hast not [[H3808]] withheld [[H2820]] thy son, [[H1121]] thine only [[H3173]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 13
And Abraham [[H85]] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] behind [[H310]] a ram [[H352]] caught [[H270]] in a thicket [[H5442]] by his horns: [[H7161]] and Abraham [[H85]] went [[H1980]] and took [[H3947]] the ram, [[H352]] and offered him up [[H5927]] for a burnt offering [[H5930]] in the stead of [[H8478]] his son. [[H1121]]

### 14
And Abraham [[H85]] called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Jehovah-jireh: [[H3068]] as [[H834]] it is said [[H559]] this day, [[H3117]] In the mount [[H2022]] of the Lord [[H3068]] it shall be seen. [[H7200]]

### 15
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] Abraham [[H85]] out of [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] the second time, [[H8145]]

### 16
And said, [[H559]] By myself have I sworn, [[H7650]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] because [[H3282]] thou hast done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] and hast not [[H3808]] withheld [[H2820]] thy son, [[H1121]] thine only [[H3173]]

### 17
That [[H3588]] in blessing [[H1288]] I will bless [[H1288]] thee, and in multiplying [[H7235]] I will multiply [[H7235]] thy seed [[H2233]] as the stars [[H3556]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] and as the sand [[H2344]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] shore; [[H8193]] and thy seed [[H2233]] shall possess [[H3423]] the gate [[H8179]] of his enemies; [[H341]]

### 18
And in thy seed [[H2233]] shall all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] be blessed; [[H1288]] because [[H834]] thou hast obeyed [[H8085]] my voice. [[H6963]]

### 19
So Abraham [[H85]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] his young men, [[H5288]] and they rose up [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] together [[H3162]] to [[H413]] Beer-sheba; [[H884]] and Abraham [[H85]] dwelt [[H3427]] at Beer-sheba. [[H884]]

### 20
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] that it was told [[H5046]] Abraham, [[H85]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] Milcah, [[H4435]] she [[H1931]] hath also [[H1571]] born [[H3205]] children [[H1121]] unto thy brother [[H251]] Nahor; [[H5152]]

### 21
Huz [[H5780]] his firstborn, [[H1060]] and Buz [[H938]] his brother, [[H251]] and Kemuel [[H7055]] the father [[H1]] of Aram, [[H758]]

### 22
And Chesed, [[H3777]] and Hazo, [[H2375]] and Pildash, [[H6394]] and Jidlaph, [[H3044]] and Bethuel. [[H1328]]

### 23
And Bethuel [[H1328]] begat [[H3205]] Rebekah: [[H7259]] these [[H428]] eight [[H8083]] Milcah [[H4435]] did bear [[H3205]] to Nahor, [[H5152]] Abraham's [[H85]] brother. [[H251]]

### 24
And his concubine, [[H6370]] whose name [[H8034]] Reumah, [[H7208]] she [[H1931]] bare [[H3205]] also [[H1571]] Tebah, [[H2875]] and Gaham, [[H1514]] and Thahash, [[H8477]] and Maachah. [[H4601]]
