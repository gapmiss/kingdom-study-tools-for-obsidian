### 1
And the famine [[H7458]] sore [[H3515]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 2
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] they had eaten up [[H3615]] the corn [[H7668]] which [[H834]] they had brought out [[H935]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] their father [[H1]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Go again, [[H7725]] buy [[H7666]] us a little [[H4592]] food. [[H400]]

### 3
And Judah [[H3063]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] The man [[H376]] did solemnly [[H5749]] protest [[H5749]] unto us, saying, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face, [[H6440]] except [[H1115]] your brother [[H251]] with [[H854]] you. [[H854]]

### 4
If [[H518]] thou wilt [[H3426]] send [[H7971]] our brother [[H251]] with [[H854]] us, we will go down [[H3381]] and buy [[H7666]] thee food: [[H400]]

### 5
But if [[H518]] thou wilt not [[H369]] send [[H7971]] we will not [[H3808]] go down: [[H3381]] for [[H3588]] the man [[H376]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] us, Ye shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face, [[H6440]] except [[H1115]] your brother [[H251]] with [[H854]] you. [[H854]]

### 6
And Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] dealt ye ill [[H7489]] with me, to tell [[H5046]] the man [[H376]] whether ye had yet [[H5750]] a brother? [[H251]]

### 7
And they said, [[H559]] The man [[H376]] asked [[H7592]] us straitly [[H7592]] of our state, and of our kindred, [[H4138]] saying, [[H559]] your father [[H1]] yet [[H5750]] alive? [[H2416]] have ye [[H3426]] brother? [[H251]] and we told [[H5046]] him according to [[H5921]] the tenor [[H6310]] of these [[H428]] words: [[H1697]] could we certainly [[H3045]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he would say, [[H559]] Bring your brother [[H251]] down? [[H3381]]

### 8
And Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Israel [[H3478]] his father, [[H1]] Send [[H7971]] the lad [[H5288]] with [[H854]] me, and we will arise [[H6965]] and go; [[H1980]] that we may live, [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] both [[H1571]] we, [[H587]] and [[H1571]] thou, [[H859]] also [[H1571]] our little ones. [[H2945]]

### 9
I [[H595]] will be surety [[H6148]] for him; of my hand [[H3027]] shalt thou require [[H1245]] him: if [[H518]] I bring [[H935]] him not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] thee, and set [[H3322]] him before thee, [[H6440]] then let me bear the blame [[H2398]] for ever: [[H3117]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] except [[H3884]] we had lingered, [[H4102]] surely [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] we had returned [[H7725]] this [[H2088]] second time. [[H6471]]

### 11
And their father [[H1]] Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, If [[H518]] so [[H3651]] now, [[H645]] do [[H6213]] this; [[H2063]] take [[H3947]] of the best fruits [[H2173]] in the land [[H776]] in your vessels, [[H3627]] and carry down [[H3381]] the man [[H582]] a present, [[H4503]] a little [[H4592]] balm, [[H6875]] and a little [[H4592]] honey, [[H1706]] spices, [[H5219]] and myrrh, [[H3910]] nuts, [[H992]] and almonds: [[H8247]]

### 12
And take [[H3947]] double [[H4932]] money [[H3701]] in your hand; [[H3027]] and the money [[H3701]] that was brought again [[H7725]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of your sacks, [[H572]] carry again [[H7725]] in your hand; [[H3027]] peradventure [[H194]] it [[H1931]] an oversight: [[H4870]]

### 13
Take [[H3947]] also your brother, [[H251]] and arise, [[H6965]] go again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the man: [[H376]]

### 14
And God [[H410]] Almighty [[H7706]] give [[H5414]] you mercy [[H7356]] before [[H6440]] the man, [[H376]] that he may send away [[H7971]] your other [[H312]] brother, [[H251]] and Benjamin. [[H1144]] If [[H834]] I [[H589]] be bereaved [[H7921]] I am bereaved. [[H7921]]

### 15
And the men [[H376]] took [[H3947]] that [[H2063]] present, [[H4503]] and they took [[H3947]] double [[H4932]] money [[H3701]] in their hand, [[H3027]] and Benjamin; [[H1144]] and rose up, [[H6965]] and went down [[H3381]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Joseph. [[H3130]]

### 16
And when Joseph [[H3130]] saw [[H7200]] Benjamin [[H1144]] with [[H854]] them, he said [[H559]] to the ruler of [[H5921]] his house, [[H1004]] Bring [[H935]] men [[H582]] home, [[H1004]] and slay, [[H2873]] and make ready; [[H3559]] for [[H3588]] men [[H582]] shall dine [[H398]] with [[H854]] me at noon. [[H6672]]

### 17
And the man [[H376]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] bade; [[H559]] and the man [[H376]] brought [[H935]] the men [[H376]] into Joseph's [[H3130]] house. [[H1004]]

### 18
And the men [[H376]] were afraid, [[H3372]] because [[H3588]] they were brought [[H935]] into Joseph's [[H3130]] house; [[H1004]] and they said, [[H559]] Because of [[H1697]] the money [[H3701]] that was returned [[H7725]] in our sacks [[H572]] at the first time [[H8462]] are we [[H587]] brought in; [[H935]] that he may seek occasion [[H1556]] against [[H5921]] us, and fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] us, and take [[H3947]] us for bondmen, [[H5650]] and our asses. [[H2543]]

### 19
And they came near [[H5066]] to [[H413]] the steward [[H376]] of Joseph's [[H3130]] house, [[H1004]] and they communed [[H1696]] with [[H413]] him at the door [[H6607]] of the house, [[H1004]]

### 20
And said, [[H559]] O [[H994]] sir, [[H113]] we came indeed [[H3381]] down [[H3381]] at the first time [[H8462]] to buy [[H7666]] food: [[H400]]

### 21
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] we came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the inn, [[H4411]] that we opened [[H6605]] our sacks, [[H572]] and, behold, [[H2009]] man's [[H376]] money [[H3701]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of his sack, [[H572]] our money [[H3701]] in full weight: [[H4948]] and we have brought it again [[H7725]] in our hand. [[H3027]]

### 22
And other [[H312]] money [[H3701]] have we brought down [[H3381]] in our hands [[H3027]] to buy [[H7666]] food: [[H400]] we cannot [[H3808]] tell [[H3045]] who [[H4310]] put [[H7760]] our money [[H3701]] in our sacks. [[H572]]

### 23
And he said, [[H559]] Peace [[H7965]] to you, fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] your God, [[H430]] and the God [[H430]] of your father, [[H1]] hath given [[H5414]] you treasure [[H4301]] in your sacks: [[H572]] I had [[H935]] your money. [[H3701]] And he brought [[H3318]] Simeon [[H8095]] out unto them. [[H413]]

### 24
And the man [[H376]] brought [[H935]] the men [[H376]] into Joseph's [[H3130]] house, [[H1004]] and gave [[H5414]] water, [[H4325]] and they washed [[H7364]] their feet; [[H7272]] and he gave [[H5414]] their asses [[H2543]] provender. [[H4554]]

### 25
And they made ready [[H3559]] the present [[H4503]] against [[H5704]] Joseph [[H3130]] came [[H935]] at noon: [[H6672]] for [[H3588]] they heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] they should eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] there. [[H8033]]

### 26
And when Joseph [[H3130]] came [[H935]] home, [[H1004]] they brought [[H935]]  him [[H853]] the present [[H4503]] which [[H834]] in their hand [[H3027]] into the house, [[H1004]] and bowed themselves [[H7812]] to him to the earth. [[H776]]

### 27
And he asked [[H7592]] them of welfare, [[H7965]] and said, [[H559]] your father [[H1]] well, [[H7965]] the old man [[H2205]] of whom [[H834]] ye spake? [[H559]] he yet [[H5750]] alive? [[H2416]]

### 28
And they answered, [[H559]] Thy servant [[H5650]] our father [[H1]] in good health, [[H7965]] he yet [[H5750]] alive. [[H2416]] And they bowed down their heads, [[H6915]] and made obeisance. [[H7812]]

### 29
And he lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] his brother [[H251]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] his mother's [[H517]] son, [[H1121]] and said, [[H559]] this [[H2088]] your younger [[H6996]] brother, [[H251]] of whom [[H834]] ye spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me? And he said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] be gracious [[H2603]] unto thee, my son. [[H1121]]

### 30
And Joseph [[H3130]] made haste; [[H4116]] for [[H3588]] his bowels [[H7356]] did yearn [[H3648]] upon [[H413]] his brother: [[H251]] and he sought [[H1245]] to weep; [[H1058]] and he entered into [[H935]] chamber, [[H2315]] and wept [[H1058]] there. [[H8033]]

### 31
And he washed [[H7364]] his face, [[H6440]] and went out, [[H3318]] and refrained himself, [[H662]] and said, [[H559]] Set on [[H7760]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 32
And they set on [[H7760]] for him by himself, [[H905]] and for them by themselves, [[H905]] and for the Egyptians, [[H4713]] which did eat [[H398]] with [[H854]] him, by themselves: [[H905]] because [[H3588]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] might [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] with the Hebrews; [[H5680]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] an abomination [[H8441]] unto the Egyptians. [[H4714]]

### 33
And they sat [[H3427]] before him, [[H6440]] the firstborn [[H1060]] according to his birthright, [[H1062]] and the youngest [[H6810]] according to his youth: [[H6812]] and the men [[H376]] marvelled [[H8539]] one [[H376]] at [[H413]] another. [[H7453]]

### 34
And he took [[H5375]] messes [[H4864]] unto [[H413]] them from before him: [[H6440]] but Benjamin's [[H1144]] mess [[H4864]] was five [[H2568]] times [[H3027]] so much as [[H7235]] any [[H3605]] of theirs. And they drank, [[H8354]] and were merry [[H7937]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]
