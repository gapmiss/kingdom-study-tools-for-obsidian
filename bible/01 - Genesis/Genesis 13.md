### 1
And Abram [[H87]] went up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] he, [[H1931]] and his wife, [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had, and Lot [[H3876]] with [[H5973]] him, into the south. [[H5045]]

### 2
And Abram [[H87]] very [[H3966]] rich [[H3513]] in cattle, [[H4735]] in silver, [[H3701]] and in gold. [[H2091]]

### 3
And he went [[H1980]] on his journeys [[H4550]] from the south [[H5045]] even to [[H5704]] Beth-el, [[H1008]] unto [[H5704]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H8033]] his tent [[H168]] had been [[H1961]] at the beginning, [[H8462]] between [[H996]] Beth-el [[H1008]] and Hai; [[H5857]]

### 4
Unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of the altar, [[H4196]] which [[H834]] he had made [[H6213]] there [[H8033]] at the first: [[H7223]] and there [[H8033]] Abram [[H87]] called [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
And Lot [[H3876]] also, [[H1571]] which went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Abram, [[H87]] had [[H1961]] flocks, [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] and tents. [[H168]]

### 6
And the land [[H776]] was not [[H3808]] able to bear [[H5375]] them, that they might dwell [[H3427]] together: [[H3162]] for [[H3588]] their substance [[H7399]] was [[H1961]] great, [[H7227]] so that they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] dwell [[H3427]] together. [[H3162]]

### 7
And there was [[H1961]] a strife [[H7379]] between [[H996]] the herdmen [[H7462]] of Abram's [[H87]] cattle [[H4735]] and the herdmen [[H7462]] of Lot's [[H3876]] cattle: [[H4735]] and the Canaanite [[H3669]] and the Perizzite [[H6522]] dwelled [[H3427]] then [[H227]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 8
And Abram [[H87]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Lot, [[H3876]] Let there be [[H1961]] no [[H408]] strife, [[H4808]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] between [[H996]] me and thee, and between [[H996]] my herdmen [[H7462]] and thy herdmen; [[H7462]] for [[H3588]] we [[H587]] brethren. [[H251]]

### 9
not [[H3808]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] before [[H6440]] thee? separate thyself, [[H6504]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] from [[H5921]] me: if [[H518]] the left hand, [[H8040]] then I will go to the right; [[H3231]] or if [[H518]] to the right hand, [[H3225]] then I will go to the left. [[H8041]]

### 10
And Lot [[H3876]] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and beheld [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the plain [[H3603]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] that [[H3588]] it well watered [[H4945]] every where, [[H3605]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] destroyed [[H7843]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah, [[H6017]] as the garden [[H1588]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] like the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] as thou comest [[H935]] unto Zoar. [[H6820]]

### 11
Then Lot [[H3876]] chose [[H977]]  him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the plain [[H3603]] of Jordan; [[H3383]] and Lot [[H3876]] journeyed [[H5265]] east: [[H6924]] and they separated themselves [[H6504]] the one [[H376]] from [[H5921]] the other. [[H251]]

### 12
Abram [[H87]] dwelled [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and Lot [[H3876]] dwelled [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the plain, [[H3603]] and pitched tent [[H167]] toward [[H5704]] Sodom. [[H5467]]

### 13
But the men [[H376]] of Sodom [[H5467]] wicked [[H7451]] and sinners [[H2400]] before the Lord [[H3068]] exceedingly. [[H3966]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] after [[H310]] that Lot [[H3876]] was separated [[H6504]] from [[H5973]] him, Lift up [[H5375]] now [[H4994]] thine eyes, [[H5869]] and look [[H7200]] from [[H4480]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H8033]] thou [[H859]] art northward, [[H6828]] and southward, [[H5045]] and eastward, [[H6924]] and westward: [[H3220]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou [[H859]] seest, [[H7200]] to thee will I give it, [[H5414]] and to thy seed [[H2233]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 16
And I will make [[H7760]] thy seed [[H2233]] as the dust [[H6083]] of the earth: [[H776]] so that [[H834]] if [[H518]] a man [[H582]] can [[H3201]] number [[H4487]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] shall thy seed [[H2233]] also [[H1571]] be numbered. [[H4487]]

### 17
Arise, [[H6965]] walk [[H1980]] through the land [[H776]] in the length [[H753]] of it and in the breadth [[H7341]] of it; for [[H3588]] I will give [[H5414]] it unto thee. [[H5414]]

### 18
Then Abram [[H87]] removed tent, [[H167]] and came [[H935]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in the plain [[H436]] of Mamre, [[H4471]] which [[H834]] in Hebron, [[H2275]] and built [[H1129]] there [[H8033]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]
