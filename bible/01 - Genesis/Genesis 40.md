### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] the butler [[H4945]] of the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and baker [[H644]] had offended [[H2398]] their lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 2
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] was wroth [[H7107]] against [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] his officers, [[H5631]] against [[H5921]] the chief [[H8269]] of the butlers, [[H4945]] and against [[H5921]] the chief [[H8269]] of the bakers. [[H644]]

### 3
And he put [[H5414]] them in ward [[H4929]] in the house [[H1004]] of the captain [[H8269]] of the guard, [[H2876]] into [[H413]] the prison, [[H1004]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H8033]] Joseph [[H3130]] bound. [[H631]]

### 4
And the captain [[H8269]] of the guard [[H2876]] charged [[H6485]] Joseph [[H3130]] with [[H854]] them, and he served [[H8334]] them: and they continued [[H1961]] a season [[H3117]] in ward. [[H4929]]

### 5
And they dreamed [[H2492]] a dream [[H2472]] both of them, [[H8147]] each man [[H582]] his dream [[H2472]] in one [[H259]] night, [[H3915]] each man [[H582]] according to the interpretation [[H6623]] of his dream, [[H2472]] the butler [[H4945]] and the baker [[H644]] of the king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] which [[H834]] bound [[H631]] in the prison. [[H1004]]

### 6
And Joseph [[H3130]] came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] them in the morning, [[H1242]] and looked upon [[H7200]] them, and, behold, [[H2005]] they sad. [[H2196]]

### 7
And he asked [[H7592]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] officers [[H5631]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him in the ward [[H4929]] of his lord's [[H113]] house, [[H1004]] saying, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4069]] look [[H6440]] ye sadly [[H7451]] to day? [[H3117]]

### 8
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, We have dreamed [[H2492]] a dream, [[H2472]] and no [[H369]] interpreter [[H6622]] of it. And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, not [[H3808]] interpretations [[H6623]] to God? [[H430]] tell me [[H5608]] I pray you. [[H4994]]

### 9
And the chief [[H8269]] butler [[H4945]] told [[H5608]] his dream [[H2472]] to Joseph, [[H3130]] and said [[H559]] to him, In my dream, [[H2472]] behold, [[H2009]] a vine [[H1612]] before me; [[H6440]]

### 10
And in the vine [[H1612]] three [[H7969]] branches: [[H8299]] and it as though it budded, [[H6524]] her [[H1931]] blossoms [[H5322]] shot forth; [[H5927]] and the clusters [[H811]] thereof brought forth ripe [[H1310]] grapes: [[H6025]]

### 11
And Pharaoh's [[H6547]] cup [[H3563]] in my hand: [[H3027]] and I took [[H3947]] the grapes, [[H6025]] and pressed [[H7818]] them into [[H413]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] cup, [[H3563]] and I gave [[H5414]] the cup [[H3563]] into [[H5921]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] hand. [[H3709]]

### 12
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto him, This [[H2088]] the interpretation [[H6623]] of it: The three [[H7969]] branches [[H8299]] three [[H7969]] days: [[H3117]]

### 13
Yet [[H5750]] within three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] shall Pharaoh [[H6547]] lift up [[H5375]] thine head, [[H7218]] and restore [[H7725]] thee unto [[H5921]] thy place: [[H3653]] and thou shalt deliver [[H5414]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] cup [[H3563]] into his hand, [[H3027]] after the former [[H7223]] manner [[H4941]] when [[H834]] thou wast [[H1961]] his butler. [[H4945]]

### 14
But [[H518]] think on [[H2142]] me when [[H834]] it shall be well [[H3190]] with thee, and shew [[H6213]] kindness, [[H2617]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] unto me, and make mention [[H2142]] of me unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and bring me out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] house: [[H1004]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] indeed I was stolen away [[H1589]] out of the land [[H776]] of the Hebrews: [[H5680]] and here [[H6311]] also [[H1571]] have I done [[H6213]] nothing [[H3972]] that [[H3588]] they should put [[H7760]] me into the dungeon. [[H953]]

### 16
When the chief [[H8269]] baker [[H644]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the interpretation [[H6622]] was good, [[H2896]] he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] I [[H589]] also [[H637]] in my dream, [[H2472]] and, behold, [[H2009]] three [[H7969]] white [[H2751]] baskets [[H5536]] on [[H5921]] my head: [[H7218]]

### 17
And in the uppermost [[H5945]] basket [[H5536]] of all manner [[H3605]] of bakemeats [[H4639]] for Pharaoh; [[H6547]] and the birds [[H5775]] did eat [[H398]] them out of [[H4480]] the basket [[H5536]] upon [[H5921]] my head. [[H7218]]

### 18
And Joseph [[H3130]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] the interpretation [[H6623]] thereof: The three [[H7969]] baskets [[H5536]] three [[H7969]] days: [[H3117]]

### 19
Yet [[H5750]] within three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] shall Pharaoh [[H6547]] lift up [[H5375]] thy head [[H7218]] from off [[H5921]] thee, and shall hang [[H8518]] thee on [[H5921]] a tree; [[H6086]] and the birds [[H5775]] shall eat [[H398]] thy flesh [[H1320]] from off [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 20
And it came to pass [[H1961]] the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] birthday, [[H3117]] that he made [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] unto all [[H3605]] his servants: [[H5650]] and he lifted up [[H5375]] the head [[H7218]] of the chief [[H8269]] butler [[H4945]] and of the chief [[H8269]] baker [[H644]] among [[H8432]] his servants. [[H5650]]

### 21
And he restored [[H7725]] the chief [[H8269]] butler [[H4945]] unto [[H5921]] his butlership [[H4945]] again; and he gave [[H5414]] the cup [[H3563]] into [[H5921]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] hand: [[H3709]]

### 22
But he hanged [[H8518]] the chief [[H8269]] baker: [[H644]] as [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had interpreted [[H6622]] to them. [[H6622]]

### 23
Yet did not [[H3808]] the chief [[H8269]] butler [[H4945]] remember [[H2142]] Joseph, [[H3130]] but forgat [[H7911]] him. [[H7911]]
