### 1
After [[H310]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Abram [[H87]] in a vision, [[H4236]] saying, [[H559]] Fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] Abram: [[H87]] I [[H595]] thy shield, [[H4043]] thy exceeding [[H3966]] great [[H7235]] reward. [[H7939]]

### 2
And Abram [[H87]] said, [[H559]] Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] what [[H4100]] wilt thou give [[H5414]] me, seeing I [[H595]] go [[H1980]] childless, [[H6185]] and the steward [[H1121]] of my house [[H1004]] this [[H1931]] Eliezer [[H461]] of Damascus? [[H1834]]

### 3
And Abram [[H87]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] to me thou hast given [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] seed: [[H2233]] and, lo, [[H2009]] one born [[H1121]] in my house [[H1004]] is mine heir. [[H3423]]

### 4
And, behold, [[H2009]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] shall not [[H3808]] be thine heir; [[H3423]] but [[H518]] he that [[H834]] shall come forth [[H3318]] out of thine own bowels [[H4578]] shall be thine heir. [[H3423]]

### 5
And he brought him forth [[H3318]] abroad, [[H2351]] and said, [[H559]] Look [[H5027]] now [[H4994]] toward heaven, [[H8064]] and tell [[H5608]] the stars, [[H3556]] if [[H518]] thou be able [[H3201]] to number [[H5608]] them: and he said [[H559]] unto him, So [[H3541]] shall thy seed [[H2233]] be. [[H1961]]

### 6
And he believed [[H539]] in the Lord; [[H3068]] and he counted [[H2803]] it to him for righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 7
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] brought thee out [[H3318]] of Ur [[H218]] of the Chaldees, [[H3778]] to give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to inherit [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 8
And he said, [[H559]] Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3068]] whereby [[H4100]] shall I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I shall inherit it? [[H3423]]

### 9
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Take [[H3947]] me an heifer [[H5697]] of three years old, [[H8027]] and a she goat [[H5795]] of three years old, [[H8027]] and a ram [[H352]] of three years old, [[H8027]] and a turtledove, [[H8449]] and a young pigeon. [[H1469]]

### 10
And he took [[H3947]]  unto him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] these, [[H428]] and divided [[H1334]] them in the midst, [[H8432]] and laid [[H5414]] each [[H376]] piece [[H1335]] one against [[H7125]] another: [[H7453]] but the birds [[H6833]] divided [[H1334]] he not. [[H3808]]

### 11
And when the fowls [[H5861]] came down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] the carcases, [[H6297]] Abram [[H87]] drove them away. [[H5380]]

### 12
And when the sun [[H8121]] was going down, [[H935]] a deep sleep [[H8639]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] Abram; [[H87]] and, lo, [[H2009]] an horror [[H367]] of great [[H1419]] darkness [[H2825]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 13
And he said [[H559]] unto Abram, [[H87]] Know [[H3045]] of a surety [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thy seed [[H2233]] shall be [[H1961]] a stranger [[H1616]] in a land [[H776]] not [[H3808]] theirs, and shall serve [[H5647]] them; and they shall afflict [[H6031]] them four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] years; [[H8141]]

### 14
And also [[H1571]] that nation, [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] they shall serve, [[H5647]] will I [[H595]] judge: [[H1777]] and afterward [[H310]] shall they come out [[H3318]] with great [[H1419]] substance. [[H7399]]

### 15
And thou [[H859]] shalt go [[H935]] to [[H413]] thy fathers [[H1]] in peace; [[H7965]] thou shalt be buried [[H6912]] in a good [[H2896]] old age. [[H7872]]

### 16
But in the fourth [[H7243]] generation [[H1755]] they shall come hither [[H2008]] again: [[H7725]] for [[H3588]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the Amorites [[H567]] not [[H3808]] yet [[H2008]] full. [[H8003]]

### 17
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that, when the sun [[H8121]] went down, [[H935]] and it was [[H1961]] dark, [[H5939]] behold [[H2009]] a smoking [[H6227]] furnace, [[H8574]] and a burning [[H784]] lamp [[H3940]] that [[H834]] passed [[H5674]] between [[H996]] those [[H428]] pieces. [[H1506]]

### 18
In the same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Abram, [[H87]] saying, [[H559]] Unto thy seed [[H2233]] have I given [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] from the river [[H5104]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] river, [[H5104]] the river [[H5104]] Euphrates: [[H6578]]

### 19
The Kenites, [[H7017]] and the Kenizzites, [[H7074]] and the Kadmonites, [[H6935]]

### 20
And the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] and the Rephaims, [[H7497]]

### 21
And the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Girgashites, [[H1622]] and the Jebusites. [[H2983]]
