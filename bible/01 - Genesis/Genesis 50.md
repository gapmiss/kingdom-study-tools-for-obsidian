And Joseph [[H3130]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] his father's [[H1]] face, [[H6440]] and wept [[H1058]] upon [[H5921]] him, and kissed [[H5401]] him. [[H5401]]

### 2
And Joseph [[H3130]] commanded [[H6680]] his servants [[H5650]] the physicians [[H7495]] to embalm [[H2590]] his father: [[H1]] and the physicians [[H7495]] embalmed [[H2590]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
And forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] were fulfilled [[H4390]] for him; for [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] are fulfilled [[H4390]] the days [[H3117]] of those which are embalmed: [[H2590]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] mourned [[H1058]] for him threescore and ten [[H7657]] days. [[H3117]]

### 4
And when the days [[H3117]] of his mourning [[H1068]] were past, [[H5674]] Joseph [[H3130]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] now [[H4994]] I have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] speak, [[H1696]] I pray you, [[H4994]] in the ears [[H241]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] saying, [[H559]]

### 5
My father [[H1]] made me swear, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] Lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] die: [[H4191]] in my grave [[H6913]] which [[H834]] I have digged [[H3738]] for me in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] there [[H8033]] shalt thou bury me. [[H6912]] Now [[H6258]] therefore let me go up, [[H5927]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and bury [[H6912]] my father, [[H1]] and I will come again. [[H7725]]

### 6
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said, [[H559]] Go up, [[H5927]] and bury [[H6912]] thy father, [[H1]] according as [[H834]] he made thee swear. [[H7650]]

### 7
And Joseph [[H3130]] went up [[H5927]] to bury [[H6912]] his father: [[H1]] and with [[H854]] him went up [[H5927]] all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] the elders [[H2205]] of his house, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]]

### 8
And all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] and his brethren, [[H251]] and his father's [[H1]] house: [[H1004]] only [[H7535]] their little ones, [[H2945]] and their flocks, [[H6629]] and their herds, [[H1241]] they left [[H5800]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen. [[H1657]]

### 9
And there went up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] him both [[H1571]] chariots [[H7393]] and [[H1571]] horsemen: [[H6571]] and it was [[H1961]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H3515]] company. [[H4264]]

### 10
And they came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the threshingfloor [[H1637]] of Atad, [[H329]] which [[H834]] beyond [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and there [[H8033]] they mourned [[H5594]] with a great [[H1419]] and very [[H3966]] sore [[H3515]] lamentation: [[H4553]] and he made [[H6213]] a mourning [[H60]] for his father [[H1]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]

### 11
And when the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] saw [[H7200]] the mourning [[H60]] in the floor [[H1637]] of Atad, [[H329]] they said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] a grievous [[H3515]] mourning [[H60]] to the Egyptians: [[H4713]] wherefore [[H3651]] the name [[H8034]] of it was called [[H7121]] Abel-mizraim, [[H67]] which [[H834]] beyond [[H5676]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 12
And his sons [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] unto him according as [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] them: [[H6680]]

### 13
For his sons [[H1121]] carried [[H5375]] him into the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and buried [[H6912]] him in the cave [[H4631]] of the field [[H7704]] of Machpelah, [[H4375]] which [[H834]] Abraham [[H85]] bought [[H7069]] with [[H853]] the field [[H7704]] for a possession [[H272]] of a buryingplace [[H6913]] of Ephron [[H6085]] the Hittite, [[H2850]] before [[H6440]] Mamre. [[H4471]]

### 14
And Joseph [[H3130]] returned [[H7725]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] he, [[H1931]] and his brethren, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] that went up [[H5927]] with [[H854]] him to bury [[H6912]] his father, [[H1]] after [[H310]] he had buried [[H6912]] his father. [[H1]]

### 15
And when Joseph's [[H3130]] brethren [[H251]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] their father [[H1]] was dead, [[H4191]] they said, [[H559]] Joseph [[H3130]] will peradventure [[H3863]] hate us, [[H7852]] and will certainly [[H7725]] requite [[H7725]]  us [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] which [[H834]] we did [[H1580]] unto him. [[H1580]]

### 16
And they sent a messenger [[H6680]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] saying, [[H559]] Thy father [[H1]] did command [[H6680]] before [[H6440]] he died, [[H4194]] saying, [[H559]]

### 17
So [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] unto Joseph, [[H3130]] Forgive, [[H5375]] I pray thee [[H577]] now, [[H4994]] the trespass [[H6588]] of thy brethren, [[H251]] and their sin; [[H2403]] for [[H3588]] they did [[H1580]] unto thee evil: [[H7451]] and now, [[H6258]] we pray thee, [[H4994]] forgive [[H5375]] the trespass [[H6588]] of the servants [[H5650]] of the God [[H430]] of thy father. [[H1]] And Joseph [[H3130]] wept [[H1058]] when they spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 18
And his brethren [[H251]] also [[H1571]] went [[H1980]] and fell down [[H5307]] before his face; [[H6440]] and they said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] we thy servants. [[H5650]]

### 19
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] in the place [[H8478]] of God? [[H430]]

### 20
But as for you, [[H859]] ye thought [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] me; God [[H430]] meant it [[H2803]] unto good, [[H2896]] to [[H4616]] bring to pass, [[H6213]] as this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] to save [[H2421]] much [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] alive. [[H5971]]

### 21
Now [[H6258]] therefore fear [[H3372]] ye not: [[H408]] I [[H595]] will nourish [[H3557]] you, and your little ones. [[H2945]] And he comforted [[H5162]] them, and spake [[H1696]] kindly [[H3820]] unto them. [[H5921]]

### 22
And Joseph [[H3130]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] he, [[H1931]] and his father's [[H1]] house: [[H1004]] and Joseph [[H3130]] lived [[H2421]] an hundred [[H3967]] and ten [[H6235]] years. [[H8141]]

### 23
And Joseph [[H3130]] saw [[H7200]] Ephraim's [[H669]] children [[H1121]] of the third [[H8029]] the children [[H1121]] also [[H1571]] of Machir [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] were brought up [[H3205]] upon [[H5921]] Joseph's [[H3130]] knees. [[H1290]]

### 24
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] I [[H595]] die: [[H4191]] and God [[H430]] will surely [[H6485]] visit [[H6485]] you, and bring out [[H5927]] you of [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] to Abraham, [[H85]] to Isaac, [[H3327]] and to Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 25
And Joseph [[H3130]] took an oath [[H7650]]  of [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] God [[H430]] will surely [[H6485]] visit [[H6485]] you, and ye shall carry up [[H5927]] my bones [[H6106]] from hence. [[H2088]]

### 26
So Joseph [[H3130]] died, [[H4191]] an hundred [[H3967]] and ten [[H6235]] years [[H8141]] old: [[H1121]] and they embalmed [[H2590]] him, and he was put [[H3455]] in a coffin [[H727]] in Egypt. [[H4714]]
