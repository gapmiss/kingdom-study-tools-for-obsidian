### 1
And there was [[H1961]] a famine [[H7458]] in the land, [[H776]] beside [[H905]] the first [[H7223]] famine [[H7458]] that [[H834]] was [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] of Abraham. [[H85]] And Isaac [[H3327]] went [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] Abimelech [[H40]] king [[H4428]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] unto Gerar. [[H1642]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him, and said, [[H559]] Go not down [[H3381]] into Egypt; [[H4714]] dwell [[H7931]] in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I shall tell [[H559]] thee of: [[H413]]

### 3
Sojourn [[H1481]] in this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and I will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee, and will bless [[H1288]] thee; for [[H3588]] unto thee, and unto thy seed, [[H2233]] I will give [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] these [[H411]] countries, [[H776]] and I will perform [[H6965]] the oath [[H7621]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto Abraham [[H85]] thy father; [[H1]]

### 4
And I will make [[H853]] thy seed [[H2233]] to multiply [[H7235]] as the stars [[H3556]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and will give [[H5414]] unto thy seed [[H2233]] all [[H3605]] these [[H411]] countries; [[H776]] and in thy seed [[H2233]] shall all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] be blessed; [[H1288]]

### 5
Because [[H6118]] that [[H834]] Abraham [[H85]] obeyed [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] and kept [[H8104]] my charge, [[H4931]] my commandments, [[H4687]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and my laws. [[H8451]]

### 6
And Isaac [[H3327]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Gerar: [[H1642]]

### 7
And the men [[H376]] of the place [[H4725]] asked [[H7592]] of his wife; [[H802]] and he said, [[H559]] She [[H1931]] my sister: [[H269]] for [[H3588]] he feared [[H3372]] to say, [[H559]] my wife; [[H802]] lest, [[H6435]] the men [[H376]] of the place [[H4725]] should kill [[H2026]] me for [[H5921]] Rebekah; [[H7259]] because [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] fair [[H2896]] to look upon. [[H4758]]

### 8
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] he had been there [[H8033]] a long [[H748]] time, [[H3117]] that Abimelech [[H40]] king [[H4428]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] looked out [[H8259]] at [[H1157]] a window, [[H2474]] and saw, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] Isaac [[H3327]] sporting [[H6711]]  with [[H853]] Rebekah [[H7259]] his wife. [[H802]]

### 9
And Abimelech [[H40]] called [[H7121]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] of a surety [[H389]] she [[H1931]] thy wife: [[H802]] and how [[H349]] saidst [[H559]] thou, She [[H1931]] my sister? [[H269]] And Isaac [[H3327]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Because [[H3588]] I said, [[H559]] Lest [[H6435]] I die [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] her. [[H5921]]

### 10
And Abimelech [[H40]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] thou hast done [[H6213]] unto us? one [[H259]] of the people [[H5971]] might lightly [[H4592]] have lien [[H7901]] with [[H854]] thy wife, [[H802]] and thou shouldest have brought [[H935]] guiltiness [[H817]] upon [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 11
And Abimelech [[H40]] charged [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] He that toucheth [[H5060]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] or his wife [[H802]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 12
Then Isaac [[H3327]] sowed [[H2232]] in that [[H1931]] land, [[H776]] and received [[H4672]] in the same [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] an hundredfold: [[H3967]] and the Lord [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] him. [[H1288]]

### 13
And the man [[H376]] waxed great, [[H1431]] and went [[H1980]] forward, [[H1980]] and grew until [[H3588]] he became [[H1431]] very [[H3966]] great: [[H1431]]

### 14
For he had [[H1961]] possession [[H4735]] of flocks, [[H6629]] and possession [[H4735]] of herds, [[H1241]] and great store [[H7227]] of servants: [[H5657]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] envied [[H7065]] him. [[H7065]]

### 15
For all [[H3605]] the wells [[H875]] which [[H834]] his father's [[H1]] servants [[H5650]] had digged [[H2658]] in the days [[H3117]] of Abraham [[H85]] his father, [[H1]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had stopped [[H5640]] them, and filled [[H4390]] them with earth. [[H6083]]

### 16
And Abimelech [[H40]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Isaac, [[H3327]] Go [[H1980]] from [[H5973]] us; for [[H3588]] thou art much [[H3966]] mightier [[H6105]] than [[H4480]] we. [[H4480]]

### 17
And Isaac [[H3327]] departed [[H1980]] thence, [[H8033]] and pitched his tent [[H2583]] in the valley [[H5158]] of Gerar, [[H1642]] and dwelt [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]]

### 18
And Isaac [[H3327]] digged [[H2658]] again [[H7725]] the wells [[H875]] of water, [[H4325]] which [[H834]] they had digged [[H2658]] in the days [[H3117]] of Abraham [[H85]] his father; [[H1]] for the Philistines [[H6430]] had stopped [[H5640]] them after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Abraham: [[H85]] and he called [[H7121]] their names [[H8034]] after the names [[H8034]] by which [[H834]] his father [[H1]] had called [[H7121]] them. [[H7121]]

### 19
And Isaac's [[H3327]] servants [[H5650]] digged [[H2658]] in the valley, [[H5158]] and found [[H4672]] there [[H8033]] a well [[H875]] of springing [[H2416]] water. [[H4325]]

### 20
And the herdmen [[H7462]] of Gerar [[H1642]] did strive [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] Isaac's [[H3327]] herdmen, [[H7462]] saying, [[H559]] The water [[H4325]] ours: and he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the well [[H875]] Esek; [[H6230]] because [[H3588]] they strove [[H6229]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 21
And they digged [[H2658]] another [[H312]] well, [[H875]] and strove [[H7378]] for [[H5921]] that also: [[H1571]] and he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of it Sitnah. [[H7856]]

### 22
And he removed [[H6275]] from thence, [[H8033]] and digged [[H2658]] another [[H312]] well; [[H875]] and for [[H5921]] that they strove [[H7378]] not: [[H3808]] and he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of it Rehoboth; [[H7344]] and he said, [[H559]] For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath made room [[H7337]] for us, and we shall be fruitful [[H6509]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 23
And he went up [[H5927]] from thence [[H8033]] to Beer-sheba. [[H884]]

### 24
And the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him the same [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham [[H85]] thy father: [[H1]] fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] with [[H854]] thee, and will bless [[H1288]] thee, and multiply [[H7235]] thy seed [[H2233]] for [[H5668]] my servant [[H5650]] Abraham's [[H85]] sake. [[H85]]

### 25
And he builded [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] there, [[H8033]] and called [[H7121]] upon the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and pitched [[H5186]] his tent [[H168]] there: [[H8033]] and there [[H8033]] Isaac's [[H3327]] servants [[H5650]] digged [[H3738]] a well. [[H875]]

### 26
Then Abimelech [[H40]] went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] him from Gerar, [[H1642]] and Ahuzzath [[H276]] one of his friends, [[H4828]] and Phichol [[H6369]] the chief captain [[H8269]] of his army. [[H6635]]

### 27
And Isaac [[H3327]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Wherefore [[H4069]] come [[H935]] ye to [[H413]] me, seeing ye [[H859]] hate [[H8130]] me, and have sent me away [[H7971]] from you? [[H7971]]

### 28
And they said, [[H559]] We saw [[H7200]] certainly [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee: and we said, [[H559]] Let there be [[H1961]] now [[H4994]] an oath [[H423]] betwixt [[H996]] us, betwixt [[H996]] us and thee, and let us make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] thee; [[H5973]]

### 29
That [[H518]] thou wilt do [[H6213]] us no hurt, [[H7451]] as [[H834]] we have not [[H3808]] touched [[H5060]] thee, and as [[H834]] we have done [[H6213]] unto [[H5973]] thee nothing but [[H7535]] good, [[H2896]] and have sent thee away [[H7971]] in peace: [[H7965]] thou [[H859]] now [[H6258]] the blessed [[H1288]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 30
And he made [[H6213]] them a feast, [[H4960]] and they did eat [[H398]] and drink. [[H8354]]

### 31
And they rose up betimes [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and sware [[H7650]] one [[H376]] to another: [[H251]] and Isaac [[H3327]] sent them away, [[H7971]] and they departed [[H1980]] from him in peace. [[H7965]]

### 32
And it came to pass [[H1961]] the same [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] that Isaac's [[H3327]] servants [[H5650]] came, [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] him concerning [[H182]] the well [[H875]] which [[H834]] they had digged, [[H2658]] and said [[H559]] unto him, We have found [[H4672]] water. [[H4325]]

### 33
And he called [[H7121]] it Shebah: [[H7656]] therefore [[H3651]] the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] Beer-sheba [[H884]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 34
And Esau [[H6215]] was [[H1961]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he took [[H3947]] to wife [[H802]] Judith [[H3067]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Beeri [[H882]] the Hittite, [[H2850]] and Bashemath [[H1315]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Elon [[H356]] the Hittite: [[H2850]]

### 35
Which were [[H1961]] a grief [[H4786]] of mind [[H7307]] unto Isaac [[H3327]] and to Rebekah. [[H7259]]
