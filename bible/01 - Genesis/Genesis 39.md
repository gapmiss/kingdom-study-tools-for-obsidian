### 1
And Joseph [[H3130]] was brought down [[H3381]] to Egypt; [[H4714]] and Potiphar, [[H6318]] an officer [[H5631]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] captain [[H8269]] of the guard, [[H2876]] an Egyptian, [[H4713]] bought [[H7069]] him of the hands [[H3027]] of the Ishmeelites, [[H3459]] which [[H834]] had brought him down [[H3381]] thither. [[H8033]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and he was [[H1961]] a prosperous [[H6743]] man; [[H582]] and he was [[H1961]] in the house [[H1004]] of his master [[H113]] the Egyptian. [[H4713]]

### 3
And his master [[H113]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H854]] him, and that the Lord [[H3068]] made all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he [[H1931]] did [[H6213]] to prosper [[H6743]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 4
And Joseph [[H3130]] found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in his sight, [[H5869]] and he served [[H8334]] him: and he made him overseer [[H6485]] over [[H5921]] his house, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] he had [[H3426]] he put [[H5414]] into his hand. [[H3027]]

### 5
And it came to pass [[H1961]] from the time [[H227]] he had made him overseer [[H6485]] in his house, [[H1004]] and over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had, [[H3426]] that the Lord [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] the Egyptian's [[H4713]] house [[H1004]] for Joseph's [[H3130]] sake; [[H1558]] and the blessing [[H1293]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had [[H3426]] in the house, [[H1004]] and in the field. [[H7704]]

### 6
And he left [[H5800]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had in Joseph's [[H3130]] hand; [[H3027]] and he knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] ought [[H3972]] he had, [[H854]] save [[H518]] the bread [[H3899]] which [[H834]] he [[H1931]] did eat. [[H398]] And Joseph [[H3130]] was [[H1961]] goodly [[H8389]] and well [[H3303]] favoured. [[H4758]]

### 7
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] that his master's [[H113]] wife [[H802]] cast [[H5375]] her eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H413]] Joseph; [[H3130]] and she said, [[H559]] Lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] me. [[H5973]]

### 8
But he refused, [[H3985]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his master's [[H113]] wife, [[H802]] Behold, [[H2005]] my master [[H113]] wotteth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] with [[H854]] me in the house, [[H1004]] and he hath committed [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath [[H3426]] to my hand; [[H3027]]

### 9
none [[H369]] greater [[H1419]] in this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] than [[H4480]] I; neither [[H3808]] hath he kept back [[H2820]] any thing [[H3972]] from [[H4480]] me but [[H518]] thee, because [[H834]] thou [[H859]] his wife: [[H802]] how [[H349]] then can I do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] wickedness, [[H7451]] and sin [[H2398]] against God? [[H430]]

### 10
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as she spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] day [[H3117]] by day, [[H3117]] that he hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] her, to lie [[H7901]] by her, [[H681]] to be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] her. [[H5973]]

### 11
And it came to pass [[H1961]] about this [[H2088]] time, [[H3117]] that went [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] to do [[H6213]] his business; [[H4399]] and none [[H376]] of the men [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] there [[H8033]] within. [[H1004]]

### 12
And she caught [[H8610]] him by his garment, [[H899]] saying, [[H559]] Lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] me: and he left [[H5800]] his garment [[H899]] in her hand, [[H3027]] and fled, [[H5127]] and got [[H3318]] him out. [[H2351]]

### 13
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he had left [[H5800]] his garment [[H899]] in her hand, [[H3027]] and was fled [[H5127]] forth, [[H2351]]

### 14
That she called [[H7121]] unto the men [[H376]] of her house, [[H1004]] and spake [[H559]] unto them, saying, [[H559]] See, [[H7200]] he hath brought in [[H935]] an Hebrew [[H376]] unto us to mock [[H6711]] us; he came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me to lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] me, and I cried [[H7121]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice: [[H6963]]

### 15
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] I lifted up [[H7311]] my voice [[H6963]] and cried, [[H7121]] that he left [[H5800]] his garment [[H899]] with me, [[H681]] and fled, [[H5127]] and got him [[H3318]] out. [[H2351]]

### 16
And she laid up [[H3240]] his garment [[H899]] by her, [[H681]] until [[H5704]] his lord [[H113]] came [[H935]] home. [[H1004]]

### 17
And she spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him according to these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] saying, [[H559]] The Hebrew [[H5680]] servant, [[H5650]] which [[H834]] thou hast brought [[H935]] unto us, came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me to mock [[H6711]] me: [[H6711]]

### 18
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as I lifted up [[H7311]] my voice [[H6963]] and cried, [[H7121]] that he left [[H5800]] his garment [[H899]] with me, [[H681]] and fled [[H5127]] out. [[H2351]]

### 19
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when his master [[H113]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of his wife, [[H802]] which [[H834]] she spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] After this [[H428]] manner [[H1697]] did [[H6213]] thy servant [[H5650]] to me; that his wrath [[H639]] was kindled. [[H2734]]

### 20
And Joseph's [[H3130]] master [[H113]] took [[H3947]] him, and put him [[H5414]] into [[H413]] the prison, [[H1004]] a place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the king's [[H4428]] prisoners [[H615]] bound: [[H631]] and he was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] in the prison. [[H1004]]

### 21
But the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and shewed [[H5186]] him mercy, [[H2617]] and gave [[H5414]] him favour [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the keeper [[H8269]] of the prison. [[H1004]]

### 22
And the keeper [[H8269]] of the prison [[H1004]] committed [[H5414]] to Joseph's [[H3130]] hand [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] the prisoners [[H615]] that [[H834]] in the prison; [[H1004]] and whatsoever [[H834]] they did [[H6213]] there, [[H8033]] he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] the doer [[H6213]]

### 23
The keeper [[H8269]] of the prison [[H1004]] looked [[H7200]] not [[H369]]  to [[H853]] any thing [[H3972]] under his hand; [[H3027]] because [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] was with [[H854]] him, and which [[H834]] he [[H1931]] did, [[H6213]] the Lord [[H3068]] made to prosper. [[H6743]]
