And when Abram [[H87]] was [[H1961]] ninety [[H8673]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] and nine, [[H8672]] the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I [[H589]] the Almighty [[H7706]] God; [[H410]] walk [[H1980]] before me, [[H6440]] and be [[H1961]] thou perfect. [[H8549]]

### 2
And I will make [[H5414]] my covenant [[H1285]] between [[H996]] me and thee, and will multiply [[H7235]] thee exceedingly. [[H3966]]

### 3
And Abram [[H87]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] his face: [[H6440]] and God [[H430]] talked [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him, saying, [[H559]]

### 4
As for me, [[H589]] behold, [[H2009]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] thee, and thou shalt be [[H1961]] a father [[H1]] of many [[H1995]] nations. [[H1471]]

### 5
Neither [[H3808]]  shall [[H853]] thy name [[H8034]] any more [[H5750]] be called [[H7121]] Abram, [[H87]] but thy name [[H8034]] shall be [[H1961]] Abraham; [[H85]] for [[H3588]] a father [[H1]] of many [[H1995]] nations [[H1471]] have I made thee. [[H5414]]

### 6
And I will make thee exceeding [[H3966]] fruitful, [[H6509]] and I will make [[H5414]] nations [[H1471]] of thee, and kings [[H4428]] shall come out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 7
And I will establish [[H6965]] my covenant [[H1285]] between [[H996]] me and thee and thy seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] thee in their generations [[H1755]] for an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant, [[H1285]] to be [[H1961]] a God [[H430]] unto thee, and to thy seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] thee. [[H310]]

### 8
And I will give [[H5414]] unto thee, and to thy seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]]  thee, [[H853]] the land [[H776]] wherein thou art a stranger, [[H4033]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] for an everlasting [[H5769]] possession; [[H272]] and I will be [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]]

### 9
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] Thou [[H859]] shalt keep [[H8104]] my covenant [[H1285]] therefore, thou, [[H859]] and thy seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] thee in their generations. [[H1755]]

### 10
This [[H2063]] my covenant, [[H1285]] which [[H834]] ye shall keep, [[H8104]] between [[H996]] me and you and thy seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] thee; Every [[H3605]] man child [[H2145]] among you shall be circumcised. [[H4135]]

### 11
And ye shall circumcise [[H5243]] the flesh [[H1320]] of your foreskin; [[H6190]] and it shall be [[H1961]] a token [[H226]] of the covenant [[H1285]] betwixt [[H996]] me and you. [[H996]]

### 12
And he that is eight [[H8083]] days [[H3117]] old [[H1121]] shall be circumcised [[H4135]] among you, every [[H3605]] man child [[H2145]] in your generations, [[H1755]] he that is born [[H3211]] in the house, [[H1004]] or bought [[H4736]] with money [[H3701]] of any [[H3605]] stranger, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] not [[H3808]] of thy seed. [[H2233]]

### 13
He that is born [[H3211]] in thy house, [[H1004]] and he that is bought [[H4736]] with thy money, [[H3701]] must needs [[H4135]] be circumcised: [[H4135]] and my covenant [[H1285]] shall be [[H1961]] in your flesh [[H1320]] for an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant. [[H1285]]

### 14
And the uncircumcised [[H6189]] man child [[H2145]] whose [[H834]] flesh [[H1320]] of his foreskin [[H6190]] is not [[H3808]] circumcised, [[H4135]] that [[H1931]] soul [[H5315]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from his people; [[H5971]] he hath broken [[H6565]] my covenant. [[H1285]]

### 15
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] As for Sarai [[H8297]] thy wife, [[H802]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] call [[H7121]] her name [[H8034]] Sarai, [[H8297]] but [[H3588]] Sarah [[H8283]] her name [[H8034]]

### 16
And I will bless [[H1288]] her, and give [[H5414]] thee a son [[H1121]] also [[H1571]] of [[H4480]] her: yea, I will bless [[H1288]] her, and she shall be [[H1961]] of nations; [[H1471]] kings [[H4428]] of people [[H5971]] shall be [[H1961]] of [[H4480]] her. [[H4480]]

### 17
Then Abraham [[H85]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] his face, [[H6440]] and laughed, [[H6711]] and said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] Shall be born [[H3205]] unto him that is an hundred [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] old? [[H1121]] and shall Sarah, [[H8283]] that is ninety [[H8673]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1323]] bear? [[H3205]]

### 18
And Abraham [[H85]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] O that [[H3863]] Ishmael [[H3458]] might live [[H2421]] before [[H6440]] thee! [[H6440]]

### 19
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] Sarah [[H8283]] thy wife [[H802]] shall bear [[H3205]] thee a son [[H1121]] indeed; [[H61]] and thou shalt call [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Isaac: [[H3327]] and I will establish [[H6965]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] him for an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant, [[H1285]] with his seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 20
And as for Ishmael, [[H3458]] I have heard thee: [[H8085]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have blessed [[H1288]] him, and will make him fruitful, [[H6509]] and will multiply [[H7235]] him exceedingly; [[H3966]] twelve [[H6240]] princes [[H5387]] shall he beget, [[H3205]] and I will make him [[H5414]] a great [[H1419]] nation. [[H1471]]

### 21
But my covenant [[H1285]] will I establish [[H6965]] with [[H854]] Isaac, [[H3327]] which [[H834]] Sarah [[H8283]] shall bear [[H3205]] unto thee at this [[H2088]] set time [[H4150]] in the next [[H312]] year. [[H8141]]

### 22
And he left off [[H3615]] talking [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him, and God [[H430]] went up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] Abraham. [[H85]]

### 23
And Abraham [[H85]] took [[H3947]] Ishmael [[H3458]] his son, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] that were born [[H3211]] in his house, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] that were bought [[H4736]] with his money, [[H3701]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] among the men [[H376]] of Abraham's [[H85]] house; [[H1004]] and circumcised [[H4135]] the flesh [[H1320]] of their foreskin [[H6190]] in the selfsame [[H6106]] day, [[H3117]] as [[H834]] God [[H430]] had said [[H1696]] unto [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 24
And Abraham [[H85]] ninety [[H8673]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] and nine, [[H8672]] when he was circumcised [[H4135]] in the flesh [[H1320]] of his foreskin. [[H6190]]

### 25
And Ishmael [[H3458]] his son [[H1121]] thirteen [[H6240]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] when he was circumcised [[H4135]] in the flesh [[H1320]] of his foreskin. [[H6190]]

### 26
In the selfsame [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] was Abraham [[H85]] circumcised, [[H4135]] and Ishmael [[H3458]] his son. [[H1121]]

### 27
And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of his house, [[H1004]] born [[H3211]] in the house, [[H1004]] and bought [[H4736]] with money [[H3701]] of the stranger, [[H1121]] were circumcised [[H4135]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]
