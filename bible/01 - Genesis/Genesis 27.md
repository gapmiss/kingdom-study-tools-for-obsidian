### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that [[H3588]] when Isaac [[H3327]] was old, [[H2204]] and his eyes [[H5869]] were dim, [[H3543]] so that he could not see, [[H7200]] he called [[H7121]] Esau [[H6215]] his eldest [[H1419]] son, [[H1121]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, My son: [[H1121]] and he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] I. [[H2009]]

### 2
And he said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I am old, [[H2204]] I know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the day [[H3117]] of my death: [[H4194]]

### 3
Now [[H6258]] therefore take, [[H5375]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] thy weapons, [[H3627]] thy quiver [[H8522]] and thy bow, [[H7198]] and go out [[H3318]] to the field, [[H7704]] and take [[H6679]] me venison; [[H6718]]

### 4
And make [[H6213]] me savoury meat, [[H4303]] such as [[H834]] I love, [[H157]] and bring [[H935]] to me, that I may eat; [[H398]] that [[H5668]] my soul [[H5315]] may bless [[H1288]] thee before [[H2962]] I die. [[H4191]]

### 5
And Rebekah [[H7259]] heard [[H8085]] when Isaac [[H3327]] spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Esau [[H6215]] his son. [[H1121]] And Esau [[H6215]] went [[H1980]] to the field [[H7704]] to hunt [[H6679]] venison, [[H6718]] to bring [[H935]]

### 6
And Rebekah [[H7259]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jacob [[H3290]] her son, [[H1121]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I heard [[H8085]] thy father [[H1]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Esau [[H6215]] thy brother, [[H251]] saying, [[H559]]

### 7
Bring [[H935]] me venison, [[H6718]] and make [[H6213]] me savoury meat, [[H4303]] that I may eat, [[H398]] and bless [[H1288]] thee before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] my death. [[H4194]]

### 8
Now [[H6258]] therefore, my son, [[H1121]] obey [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] according to that which [[H834]] I [[H589]] command [[H6680]] thee. [[H6680]]

### 9
Go [[H1980]] now [[H4994]] to [[H413]] the flock, [[H6629]] and fetch [[H3947]] me from thence [[H8033]] two [[H8147]] good [[H2896]] kids [[H1423]] of the goats; [[H5795]] and I will make [[H6213]] them savoury meat [[H4303]] for thy father, [[H1]] such as [[H834]] he loveth: [[H157]]

### 10
And thou shalt bring [[H935]] to thy father, [[H1]] that he may eat, [[H398]] and that [[H834]] he may bless [[H1288]] thee before [[H6440]] his death. [[H4194]]

### 11
And Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Rebekah [[H7259]] his mother, [[H517]] Behold, [[H2005]] Esau [[H6215]] my brother [[H251]] a hairy [[H8163]] man, [[H376]] and I [[H595]] a smooth [[H2509]] man: [[H376]]

### 12
My father [[H1]] peradventure [[H194]] will feel [[H4959]] me, and I shall seem [[H1961]] to him [[H5869]] as a deceiver; [[H8591]] and I shall bring [[H935]] a curse [[H7045]] upon [[H5921]] me, and not [[H3808]] a blessing. [[H1293]]

### 13
And his mother [[H517]] said [[H559]] unto him, Upon [[H5921]] me thy curse, [[H7045]] my son: [[H1121]] only [[H389]] obey [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] and go [[H1980]] fetch [[H3947]] me [[H3947]]

### 14
And he went, [[H1980]] and fetched, [[H3947]] and brought [[H935]] to his mother: [[H517]] and his mother [[H517]] made [[H6213]] savoury meat, [[H4303]] such as [[H834]] his father [[H1]] loved. [[H157]]

### 15
And Rebekah [[H7259]] took [[H3947]] goodly [[H2532]] raiment [[H899]] of her eldest [[H1419]] son [[H1121]] Esau, [[H6215]] which [[H834]] with [[H854]] her in the house, [[H1004]] and put them upon [[H3847]] Jacob [[H3290]] her younger [[H6996]] son: [[H1121]]

### 16
And she put [[H3847]] the skins [[H5785]] of the kids [[H1423]] of the goats [[H5795]] upon [[H5921]] his hands, [[H3027]] and upon [[H5921]] the smooth [[H2513]] of his neck: [[H6677]]

### 17
And she gave [[H5414]] the savoury meat [[H4303]] and the bread, [[H3899]] which [[H834]] she had prepared, [[H6213]] into the hand [[H3027]] of her son [[H1121]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 18
And he came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] and said, [[H559]] My father: [[H1]] and he said, [[H559]] Here [[H2009]] I; who [[H4310]] thou, [[H859]] my son? [[H1121]]

### 19
And Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] I [[H595]] Esau [[H6215]] thy firstborn; [[H1060]] I have done [[H6213]] according as [[H834]] thou badest [[H1696]] me: arise, [[H6965]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] sit [[H3427]] and eat [[H398]] of my venison, [[H6718]] that [[H5668]] thy soul [[H5315]] may bless [[H1288]] me. [[H1288]]

### 20
And Isaac [[H3327]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his son, [[H1121]] How [[H4100]] it [[H2088]] that thou hast found [[H4672]] so quickly, [[H4116]] my son? [[H1121]] And he said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] brought [[H7136]] to me. [[H6440]]

### 21
And Isaac [[H3327]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] Come near, [[H5066]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] that I may feel [[H4184]] thee, my son, [[H1121]] whether thou [[H859]] my very [[H2088]] son [[H1121]] Esau [[H6215]] or [[H518]] not. [[H3808]]

### 22
And Jacob [[H3290]] went near [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] Isaac [[H3327]] his father; [[H1]] and he felt [[H4959]] him, and said, [[H559]] The voice [[H6963]] Jacob's [[H3290]] voice, [[H6963]] but the hands [[H3027]] the hands [[H3027]] of Esau. [[H6215]]

### 23
And he discerned [[H5234]] him not, [[H3808]] because [[H3588]] his hands [[H3027]] were [[H1961]] hairy, [[H8163]] as his brother [[H251]] Esau's [[H6215]] hands: [[H3027]] so he blessed [[H1288]] him. [[H1288]]

### 24
And he said, [[H559]] thou [[H859]] my very [[H2088]] son [[H1121]] Esau? [[H6215]] And he said, [[H559]] I [[H589]]

### 25
And he said, [[H559]] Bring near [[H5066]] to me, and I will eat [[H398]] of my son's [[H1121]] venison, [[H6718]] that [[H4616]] my soul [[H5315]] may bless [[H1288]] thee. And he brought near [[H5066]] to him, and he did eat: [[H398]] and he brought [[H935]] him wine, [[H3196]] and he drank. [[H8354]]

### 26
And his father [[H1]] Isaac [[H3327]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Come near [[H5066]] now, [[H4994]] and kiss [[H5401]] me, my son. [[H1121]]

### 27
And he came near, [[H5066]] and kissed [[H5401]] him: and he smelled [[H7306]] the smell [[H7381]] of his raiment, [[H899]] and blessed [[H1288]] him, and said, [[H559]] See, [[H7200]] the smell [[H7381]] of my son [[H1121]] as the smell [[H7381]] of a field [[H7704]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath blessed: [[H1288]]

### 28
Therefore God [[H430]] give [[H5414]] thee of the dew [[H2919]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and the fatness [[H4924]] of the earth, [[H776]] and plenty [[H7230]] of corn [[H1715]] and wine: [[H8492]]

### 29
Let people [[H5971]] serve [[H5647]] thee, and nations [[H3816]] bow down [[H7812]] to thee: be [[H1933]] lord [[H1376]] over thy brethren, [[H251]] and let thy mother's [[H517]] sons [[H1121]] bow down [[H7812]] to thee: cursed [[H779]] every one that curseth [[H779]] thee, and blessed [[H1288]] he that blesseth [[H1288]] thee. [[H1288]]

### 30
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as soon as [[H834]] Isaac [[H3327]] had made an end [[H3615]] of blessing [[H1288]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and Jacob [[H3290]] was [[H1961]] yet [[H389]] scarce [[H3318]] gone out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of Isaac [[H3327]] his father, [[H1]] that Esau [[H6215]] his brother [[H251]] came in [[H935]] from his hunting. [[H6718]]

### 31
And he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] had made [[H6213]] savoury meat, [[H4303]] and brought it [[H935]] unto his father, [[H1]] and said [[H559]] unto his father, [[H1]] Let my father [[H1]] arise, [[H6965]] and eat [[H398]] of his son's [[H1121]] venison, [[H6718]] that [[H5668]] thy soul [[H5315]] may bless [[H1288]] me. [[H1288]]

### 32
And Isaac [[H3327]] his father [[H1]] said [[H559]] unto him, Who [[H4310]] thou? [[H859]] And he said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] thy son, [[H1121]] thy firstborn [[H1060]] Esau. [[H6215]]

### 33
And Isaac [[H3327]] trembled [[H2729]] very [[H1419]] exceedingly, [[H2731]] and said, [[H559]] Who? [[H4310]] where [[H645]] he [[H1931]] that hath taken [[H6679]] venison, [[H6718]] and brought [[H935]] me, and I have eaten [[H398]] of all [[H3605]] before [[H2962]] thou camest, [[H935]] and have blessed [[H1288]] him? yea, [[H1571]] he shall be [[H1961]] blessed. [[H1288]]

### 34
And when Esau [[H6215]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of his father, [[H1]] he cried [[H6817]] with a great [[H1419]] and [[H5704]] exceeding [[H3966]] bitter [[H4751]] cry, [[H6818]] and said [[H559]] unto his father, [[H1]] Bless [[H1288]] me, me [[H589]] also, [[H1571]] O my father. [[H1]]

### 35
And he said, [[H559]] Thy brother [[H251]] came [[H935]] with subtilty, [[H4820]] and hath taken away [[H3947]] thy blessing. [[H1293]]

### 36
And he said, [[H559]] Is not he rightly [[H3588]] named [[H7121]] Jacob? [[H3290]] for he hath supplanted me [[H6117]] these [[H2088]] two times: [[H6471]] he took away [[H3947]] my birthright; [[H1062]] and, behold, [[H2009]] now [[H6258]] he hath taken away [[H3947]] my blessing. [[H1293]] And he said, [[H559]] Hast thou not [[H3808]] reserved [[H680]] a blessing [[H1293]] for me? [[H1293]]

### 37
And Isaac [[H3327]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto Esau, [[H6215]] Behold, [[H2005]] I have made [[H7760]] him thy lord, [[H1376]] and all [[H3605]] his brethren [[H251]] have I given [[H5414]] to him for servants; [[H5650]] and with corn [[H1715]] and wine [[H8492]] have I sustained [[H5564]] him: and what [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] now [[H645]] unto thee, my son? [[H1121]]

### 38
And Esau [[H6215]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] Hast thou but one [[H259]] blessing, [[H1293]] my father? [[H1]] bless [[H1288]] me, me [[H589]] also, [[H1571]] O my father. [[H1]] And Esau [[H6215]] lifted up [[H5375]] his voice, [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 39
And Isaac [[H3327]] his father [[H1]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] thy dwelling [[H4186]] shall be [[H1961]] the fatness [[H4924]] of the earth, [[H776]] and of the dew [[H2919]] of heaven [[H8064]] from above; [[H5920]]

### 40
And by [[H5921]] thy sword [[H2719]] shalt thou live, [[H2421]] and shalt serve [[H5647]] thy brother; [[H251]] and it shall come to pass [[H1961]] when [[H834]] thou shalt have the dominion, [[H7300]] that thou shalt break [[H6561]] his yoke [[H5923]] from off [[H5921]] thy neck. [[H6677]]

### 41
And Esau [[H6215]] hated [[H7852]] Jacob [[H3290]] because of [[H5921]] the blessing [[H1293]] wherewith [[H834]] his father [[H1]] blessed him: [[H1288]] and Esau [[H6215]] said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] The days [[H3117]] of mourning [[H60]] for my father [[H1]] are at hand; [[H7126]] then will I slay [[H2026]] my brother [[H251]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 42
And [[H853]] these words [[H1697]] of Esau [[H6215]] her elder [[H1419]] son [[H1121]] were told [[H5046]] to Rebekah: [[H7259]] and she sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] Jacob [[H3290]] her younger [[H6996]] son, [[H1121]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] thy brother [[H251]] Esau, [[H6215]] as touching thee, doth comfort himself, [[H5162]] to kill [[H2026]] thee. [[H2026]]

### 43
Now [[H6258]] therefore, my son, [[H1121]] obey [[H8085]] my voice; [[H6963]] and arise, [[H6965]] flee [[H1272]] thou to [[H413]] Laban [[H3837]] my brother [[H251]] to Haran; [[H2771]]

### 44
And tarry [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] him a few [[H259]] days, [[H3117]] until [[H834]] thy brother's [[H251]] fury [[H2534]] turn away; [[H7725]]

### 45
Until [[H5704]] thy brother's [[H251]] anger [[H639]] turn away [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] thee, and he forget [[H7911]] which [[H834]] thou hast done [[H6213]] to him: then I will send, [[H7971]] and fetch [[H3947]] thee from thence: [[H8033]] why [[H4100]] should I be deprived [[H7921]] also [[H1571]] of you both [[H8147]] in one [[H259]] day? [[H3117]]

### 46
And Rebekah [[H7259]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Isaac, [[H3327]] I am weary [[H6973]] of my life [[H2416]] because [[H6440]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Heth: [[H2845]] if [[H518]] Jacob [[H3290]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Heth, [[H2845]] such as these [[H428]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of the land, [[H776]] what good [[H4100]] shall my life [[H2416]] do me? [[H2416]]
