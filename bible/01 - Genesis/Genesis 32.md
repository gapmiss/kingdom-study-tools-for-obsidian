### 1
And Jacob [[H3290]] went [[H1980]] on his way, [[H1870]] and the angels [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] met [[H6293]] him. [[H6293]]

### 2
when [[H834]] Jacob [[H3290]] saw them, [[H7200]] And he said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] God's [[H430]] host: [[H4264]] and he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Mahanaim. [[H4266]]

### 3
And Jacob [[H3290]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] before him [[H6440]] to [[H413]] Esau [[H6215]] his brother [[H251]] unto the land [[H776]] of Seir, [[H8165]] the country [[H7704]] of Edom. [[H123]]

### 4
And he commanded [[H6680]] them, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] shall ye speak [[H559]] unto my lord [[H113]] Esau; [[H6215]] Thy servant [[H5650]] Jacob [[H3290]] saith [[H559]] thus, [[H3541]] I have sojourned [[H1481]] with [[H5973]] Laban, [[H3837]] and stayed there [[H309]] until [[H5704]] now: [[H6258]]

### 5
And I have [[H1961]] oxen, [[H7794]] and asses, [[H2543]] flocks, [[H6629]] and menservants, [[H5650]] and womenservants: [[H8198]] and I have sent [[H7971]] to tell [[H5046]] my lord, [[H113]] that I may find [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight. [[H5869]]

### 6
And the messengers [[H4397]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] saying, [[H559]] We came [[H935]] to [[H413]] thy brother [[H251]] Esau, [[H6215]] and also [[H1571]] he cometh [[H1980]] to meet thee, [[H7125]] and four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 7
Then Jacob [[H3290]] was greatly [[H3966]] afraid [[H3372]] and distressed: [[H3334]] and he divided [[H2673]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, and the flocks, [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] and the camels, [[H1581]] into two [[H8147]] bands; [[H4264]]

### 8
And said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] Esau [[H6215]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the one [[H259]] company, [[H4264]] and smite it, [[H5221]] then the other company [[H4264]] which is left [[H7604]] shall escape. [[H6413]]

### 9
And Jacob [[H3290]] said, [[H559]] O God [[H430]] of my father [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] and God [[H430]] of my father [[H1]] Isaac, [[H3327]] the Lord [[H3068]] which saidst [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Return [[H7725]] unto thy country, [[H776]] and to thy kindred, [[H4138]] and I will deal well [[H3190]] with [[H5973]] thee: [[H5973]]

### 10
I am not worthy of the least [[H6994]] of all [[H3605]] the mercies, [[H2617]] and of all [[H3605]] the truth, [[H571]] which [[H834]] thou hast shewed [[H6213]]  unto [[H853]] thy servant; [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] with my staff [[H4731]] I passed over [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] Jordan; [[H3383]] and now [[H6258]] I am become [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] bands. [[H4264]]

### 11
Deliver me, [[H5337]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] from the hand [[H3027]] of my brother, [[H251]] from the hand [[H3027]] of Esau: [[H6215]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] fear [[H3373]] him, lest [[H6435]] he will come [[H935]] and smite me, [[H5221]] the mother [[H517]] with [[H5921]] the children. [[H1121]]

### 12
And thou [[H859]] saidst, [[H559]] I will surely [[H3190]] do thee good, [[H3190]] and make [[H7760]] thy seed [[H2233]] as the sand [[H2344]] of the sea, [[H3220]] which [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be numbered [[H5608]] for multitude. [[H7230]]

### 13
And he lodged [[H3885]] there [[H8033]] that same [[H1931]] night; [[H3915]] and took [[H3947]] of [[H4480]] that which came [[H935]] to his hand [[H3027]] a present [[H4503]] for Esau [[H6215]] his brother; [[H251]]

### 14
Two hundred [[H3967]] she goats, [[H5795]] and twenty [[H6242]] he goats, [[H8495]] two hundred [[H3967]] ewes, [[H7353]] and twenty [[H6242]] rams, [[H352]]

### 15
Thirty [[H7970]] milch [[H3243]] camels [[H1581]] with their colts, [[H1121]] forty [[H705]] kine, [[H6510]] and ten [[H6235]] bulls, [[H6499]] twenty [[H6242]] she asses, [[H860]] and ten [[H6235]] foals. [[H5895]]

### 16
And he delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of his servants, [[H5650]] every drove [[H5739]] by themselves; [[H905]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] Pass over [[H5674]] before me, [[H6440]] and put [[H7760]] a space [[H7305]] betwixt [[H996]] drove [[H5739]] and [[H996]] drove. [[H5739]]

### 17
And he commanded [[H6680]] the foremost, [[H7223]] saying, [[H559]] When [[H3588]] Esau [[H6215]] my brother [[H251]] meeteth thee, [[H6298]] and asketh thee, [[H7592]] saying, [[H559]] Whose [[H4310]] thou? [[H859]] and whither [[H575]] goest [[H1980]] thou? and whose [[H4310]] these [[H428]] before [[H6440]] thee? [[H6440]]

### 18
Then thou shalt say, [[H559]] thy servant [[H5650]] Jacob's; [[H3290]] it [[H1931]] a present [[H4503]] sent [[H7971]] unto my lord [[H113]] Esau: [[H6215]] and, behold, [[H2009]] also [[H1571]] he [[H1931]] behind us. [[H310]]

### 19
And so [[H1571]] commanded he [[H6680]] the second, [[H8145]] and [[H1571]] the third, [[H7992]] and [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] that followed [[H1980]] the droves, [[H5739]] saying, [[H559]] On this [[H2088]] manner [[H1697]] shall ye speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Esau, [[H6215]] when ye find [[H4672]] him. [[H4672]]

### 20
And say ye [[H559]] moreover, [[H1571]] Behold, [[H2009]] thy servant [[H5650]] Jacob [[H3290]] behind us. [[H310]] For [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] I will appease [[H3722]] him [[H6440]] with the present [[H4503]] that goeth [[H1980]] before me, [[H6440]] and afterward [[H310]] I will see [[H7200]] his face; [[H6440]] peradventure [[H194]] he will accept [[H5375]] of me. [[H6440]]

### 21
So went the present [[H4503]] over [[H5674]] before him: [[H6440]] and himself [[H1931]] lodged [[H3885]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] in the company. [[H4264]]

### 22
And he rose up [[H6965]] that [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] and took [[H3947]] his two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] and his two [[H8147]] womenservants, [[H8198]] and his eleven [[H6240]] sons, [[H3206]] and passed over [[H5674]] the ford [[H4569]] Jabbok. [[H2999]]

### 23
And he took them, [[H3947]] and sent them over [[H5674]] the brook, [[H5158]] and sent over [[H5674]] that he had. [[H834]]

### 24
And Jacob [[H3290]] was left [[H3498]] alone; [[H905]] and there wrestled [[H79]] a man [[H582]] with [[H5973]] him until [[H5704]] the breaking [[H5927]] of the day. [[H7837]]

### 25
And when he saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he prevailed [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] against him, he touched [[H5060]] the hollow [[H3709]] of his thigh; [[H3409]] and the hollow [[H3709]] of Jacob's [[H3290]] thigh [[H3409]] was out of joint, [[H3363]] as he wrestled [[H79]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 26
And he said, [[H559]] Let me go, [[H7971]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H7837]] breaketh. [[H5927]] And he said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] let thee go, [[H7971]] except [[H518]] thou bless [[H1288]] me. [[H1288]]

### 27
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] thy name? [[H8034]] And he said, [[H559]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 28
And he said, [[H559]] Thy name [[H8034]] shall be called [[H559]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] Jacob, [[H3290]] but [[H518]] Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] as a prince hast thou power [[H8280]] with [[H5973]] God [[H430]] and with [[H5973]] men, [[H376]] and hast prevailed. [[H3201]]

### 29
And Jacob [[H3290]] asked [[H7592]] and said, [[H559]] Tell [[H5046]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] thy name. [[H8034]] And he said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] it [[H2088]] thou dost ask [[H7592]] after my name? [[H8034]] And he blessed [[H1288]] him there. [[H8033]]

### 30
And Jacob [[H3290]] called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the place [[H4725]] Peniel: [[H6439]] for [[H3588]] I have seen [[H7200]] God [[H430]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face, [[H6440]] and my life [[H5315]] is preserved. [[H5337]]

### 31
And as [[H834]] he passed over [[H5674]] Penuel [[H6439]] the sun [[H8121]] rose [[H2224]] upon him, and he [[H1931]] halted [[H6760]] upon [[H5921]] his thigh. [[H3409]]

### 32
Therefore [[H3651]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] eat [[H398]] not [[H3808]] the sinew [[H1517]] which shrank, [[H5384]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the hollow [[H3709]] of the thigh, [[H3409]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day: [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] he touched [[H5060]] the hollow [[H3709]] of Jacob's [[H3290]] thigh [[H3409]] in the sinew [[H1517]] that shrank.
