### 1
And God [[H430]] remembered [[H2142]] Noah, [[H5146]] and every [[H3605]] living thing, [[H2416]] and all [[H3605]] the cattle [[H929]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him in the ark: [[H8392]] and God [[H430]] made a wind [[H7307]] to pass [[H5674]] over [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and the waters [[H4325]] asswaged; [[H7918]]

### 2
The fountains [[H4599]] also of the deep [[H8415]] and the windows [[H699]] of heaven [[H8064]] were stopped, [[H5534]] and the rain [[H1653]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] was restrained; [[H3607]]

### 3
And the waters [[H4325]] returned [[H7725]] from off [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] continually: [[H1980]] and after the end [[H7097]] of the hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] days [[H3117]] the waters [[H4325]] were abated. [[H2637]]

### 4
And the ark [[H8392]] rested [[H5117]] in the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] on the seventeenth [[H6240]] day [[H3117]] of the month, [[H2320]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Ararat. [[H780]]

### 5
And the waters [[H4325]] decreased [[H2637]] continually [[H1980]] until [[H5704]] the tenth [[H6224]] month: [[H2320]] in the tenth [[H6224]] on the first [[H259]] of the month, [[H2320]] were the tops [[H7218]] of the mountains [[H2022]] seen. [[H7200]]

### 6
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7093]] of forty [[H705]] days, [[H3117]] that Noah [[H5146]] opened [[H6605]] the window [[H2474]] of the ark [[H8392]] which [[H834]] he had made: [[H6213]]

### 7
And he sent forth [[H7971]] a raven, [[H6158]] which went forth [[H3318]] to [[H3318]] and fro, [[H7725]] until [[H5704]] the waters [[H4325]] were dried up [[H3001]] from off [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
Also he sent forth [[H7971]] a dove [[H3123]] from [[H854]] him, to see [[H7200]] if the waters [[H4325]] were abated [[H7043]] from off [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the ground; [[H127]]

### 9
But the dove [[H3123]] found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] rest [[H4494]] for the sole [[H3709]] of her foot, [[H7272]] and she returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] him into [[H413]] the ark, [[H8392]] for [[H3588]] the waters [[H4325]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth: [[H776]] then he put forth [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] and took her, [[H3947]] and pulled her in [[H935]] unto him [[H413]] into [[H413]] the ark. [[H8392]]

### 10
And he stayed [[H2342]] yet [[H5750]] other [[H312]] seven [[H7651]] days; [[H3117]] and again [[H3254]] he sent forth [[H7971]] the dove [[H3123]] out of [[H4480]] the ark; [[H8392]]

### 11
And the dove [[H3123]] came in [[H935]] to [[H413]] him in [[H6256]] the evening; [[H6153]] and, lo, [[H2009]] in her mouth [[H6310]] an olive [[H2132]] leaf [[H5929]] pluckt off: [[H2965]] so Noah [[H5146]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the waters [[H4325]] were abated [[H7043]] from off [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 12
And he stayed [[H3176]] yet [[H5750]] other [[H312]] seven [[H7651]] days; [[H3117]] and sent forth [[H7971]] the dove; [[H3123]] which returned [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] unto [[H413]] him any more. [[H5750]]

### 13
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the six [[H8337]] hundredth [[H3967]] and first [[H259]] year, [[H8141]] in the first [[H7223]] the first [[H259]] of the month, [[H2320]] the waters [[H4325]] were dried up [[H2717]] from off [[H5921]] the earth: [[H776]] and Noah [[H5146]] removed [[H5493]] the covering [[H4372]] of the ark, [[H8392]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the face [[H6440]] of the ground [[H127]] was dry. [[H2720]]

### 14
And in the second [[H8145]] month, [[H2320]] on the seven [[H7651]] and twentieth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the month, [[H2320]] was the earth [[H776]] dried. [[H3001]]

### 15
And God [[H430]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Noah, [[H5146]] saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Go forth [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the ark, [[H8392]] thou, [[H859]] and thy wife, [[H802]] and thy sons, [[H1121]] and thy sons' [[H1121]] wives [[H802]] with [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 17
Bring forth [[H3318]] with [[H854]] thee every [[H3605]] living thing [[H2416]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] thee, of all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] of fowl, [[H5775]] and of cattle, [[H929]] and of every [[H3605]] creeping thing [[H7431]] that creepeth [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the earth; [[H776]] that they may breed abundantly [[H8317]] in the earth, [[H776]] and be fruitful, [[H6509]] and multiply [[H7235]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 18
And Noah [[H5146]] went forth, [[H3318]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and his wife, [[H802]] and his sons' [[H1121]] wives [[H802]] with [[H854]] him: [[H854]]

### 19
Every [[H3605]] beast, [[H2416]] every [[H3605]] creeping thing, [[H7431]] and every [[H3605]] fowl, [[H5775]] whatsoever [[H3605]] creepeth [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] after their kinds, [[H4940]] went forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] the ark. [[H8392]]

### 20
And Noah [[H5146]] builded [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] and took [[H3947]] of every [[H3605]] clean [[H2889]] beast, [[H929]] and of every [[H3605]] clean [[H2889]] fowl, [[H5775]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] on the altar. [[H4196]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] smelled [[H7306]] a sweet [[H5207]] savour; [[H7381]] and the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] in [[H413]] his heart, [[H3820]] I will not [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] curse [[H7043]] the ground [[H127]] any more [[H5750]] for man's [[H120]] sake; [[H5668]] for [[H3588]] the imagination [[H3336]] of man's [[H120]] heart [[H3820]] evil [[H7451]] from his youth; [[H5271]] neither [[H3808]] will I again [[H3254]] smite [[H5221]] any more [[H5750]] every thing [[H3605]] living, [[H2416]] as [[H834]] I have done. [[H6213]]

### 22
While [[H5750]] the earth [[H776]] remaineth, [[H3117]] seedtime [[H2233]] and harvest, [[H7105]] and cold [[H7120]] and heat, [[H2527]] and summer [[H7019]] and winter, [[H2779]] and day [[H3117]] and night [[H3915]] shall not [[H3808]] cease. [[H7673]]
