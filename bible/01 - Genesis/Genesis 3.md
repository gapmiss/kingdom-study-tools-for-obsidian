Now the serpent [[H5175]] was [[H1961]] more subtil [[H6175]] than any [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] had made. [[H6213]] And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the woman, [[H802]] Yea, [[H637]] hath God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] of the garden? [[H1588]]

### 2
And the woman [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the serpent, [[H5175]] We may eat [[H398]] of the fruit [[H6529]] of the trees [[H6086]] of the garden: [[H1588]]

### 3
But of the fruit [[H6529]] of the tree [[H6086]] which [[H834]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the garden, [[H1588]] God [[H430]] hath said, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of [[H4480]] it, neither [[H3808]] shall ye touch [[H5060]] it, lest [[H6435]] ye die. [[H4191]]

### 4
And the serpent [[H5175]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the woman, [[H802]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] surely [[H4191]] die: [[H4191]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] doth know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] in the day [[H3117]] ye eat [[H398]] thereof, [[H4480]] then your eyes [[H5869]] shall be opened, [[H6491]] and ye shall be [[H1961]] as gods, [[H430]] knowing [[H3045]] good [[H2896]] and evil. [[H7451]]

### 6
when the woman [[H802]] And saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the tree [[H6086]] good [[H2896]] for food, [[H3978]] and that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] pleasant [[H8378]] to the eyes, [[H5869]] and a tree [[H6086]] to be desired [[H2530]] to make wise, [[H7919]] she took [[H3947]] of the fruit thereof, [[H6529]] and did eat, [[H398]] and gave [[H5414]] also [[H1571]] unto her husband [[H582]] with [[H5973]] her; and he did eat. [[H398]]

### 7
And the eyes [[H5869]] of them both [[H8147]] were opened, [[H6491]] and they [[H1992]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they naked; [[H5903]] and they sewed [[H8609]] fig [[H8384]] leaves [[H5929]] together, and made themselves [[H6213]] aprons. [[H2290]]

### 8
And they heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] walking [[H1980]] in the garden [[H1588]] in the cool [[H7307]] of the day: [[H3117]] and Adam [[H120]] and his wife [[H802]] hid themselves [[H2244]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] amongst [[H8432]] the trees [[H6086]] of the garden. [[H1588]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] Adam, [[H120]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Where thou? [[H335]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] I heard [[H8085]] thy voice [[H6963]] in the garden, [[H1588]] and I was afraid, [[H3372]] because [[H3588]] I [[H595]] naked; [[H5903]] and I hid myself. [[H2244]]

### 11
And he said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] told [[H5046]] thee that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] naked? [[H5903]] Hast thou eaten [[H398]] of [[H4480]] the tree, [[H6086]] whereof [[H834]] I commanded thee [[H6680]] that thou shouldest not [[H1115]] eat? [[H398]]

### 12
And the man [[H120]] said, [[H559]] The woman [[H802]] whom [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] with me, [[H5978]] she [[H1931]] gave [[H5414]] me of [[H4480]] the tree, [[H6086]] and I did eat. [[H398]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto the woman, [[H802]] What [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] thou hast done? [[H6213]] And the woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] The serpent [[H5175]] beguiled me, [[H5377]] and I did eat. [[H398]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the serpent, [[H5175]] Because [[H3588]] thou hast done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] thou [[H859]] cursed [[H779]] above all [[H3605]] cattle, [[H929]] and above every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field; [[H7704]] upon [[H5921]] thy belly [[H1512]] shalt thou go, [[H1980]] and dust [[H6083]] shalt thou eat [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of thy life: [[H2416]]

### 15
And I will put [[H7896]] enmity [[H342]] between [[H996]] thee and the woman, [[H802]] and between [[H996]] thy seed [[H2233]] and her seed; [[H2233]] it [[H1931]] shall bruise [[H7779]] thy head, [[H7218]] and thou [[H859]] shalt bruise [[H7779]] his heel. [[H6119]]

### 16
Unto [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] he said, [[H559]] I will greatly [[H7235]] multiply [[H7235]] thy sorrow [[H6093]] and thy conception; [[H2032]] in sorrow [[H6089]] thou shalt bring forth [[H3205]] children; [[H1121]] and thy desire [[H8669]] to [[H413]] thy husband, [[H376]] and he [[H1931]] shall rule [[H4910]] over thee. [[H0]]

### 17
And unto Adam [[H121]] he said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] thou hast hearkened [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of thy wife, [[H802]] and hast eaten [[H398]] of [[H4480]] the tree, [[H6086]] of which [[H834]] I commanded thee, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of [[H4480]] it: cursed [[H779]] the ground [[H127]] for thy sake; [[H5668]] in sorrow [[H6093]] shalt thou eat [[H398]] it all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of thy life; [[H2416]]

### 18
Thorns [[H6975]] also and thistles [[H1863]] shall it bring forth [[H6779]] to thee; and thou shalt eat [[H398]] the herb [[H6212]] of the field; [[H7704]]

### 19
In the sweat [[H2188]] of thy face [[H639]] shalt thou eat [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] till [[H5704]] thou return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the ground; [[H127]] for [[H3588]] out of [[H4480]] it wast thou taken: [[H3947]] for [[H3588]] dust [[H6083]] thou [[H859]] and unto [[H413]] dust [[H6083]] shalt thou return. [[H7725]]

### 20
And Adam [[H120]] called [[H7121]] his wife's [[H802]] name [[H8034]] Eve; [[H2332]] because [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] the mother [[H517]] of all [[H3605]] living. [[H2416]]

### 21
Unto Adam [[H120]] also and to his wife [[H802]] did the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] make [[H6213]] coats [[H3801]] of skins, [[H5785]] and clothed them. [[H3847]]

### 22
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] the man [[H120]] is become [[H1961]] as one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] us, to know [[H3045]] good [[H2896]] and evil: [[H7451]] and now, [[H6258]] lest [[H6435]] he put forth [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] and take [[H3947]] also [[H1571]] of the tree [[H6086]] of life, [[H2416]] and eat, [[H398]] and live [[H2425]] for ever: [[H5769]]

### 23
Therefore the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] sent him forth [[H7971]] from the garden [[H1588]] of Eden, [[H5731]] to till [[H5647]] the ground [[H127]] from whence [[H8033]] he was taken. [[H3947]]

### 24
So he drove out [[H1644]] the man; [[H120]] and he placed [[H7931]] at the east [[H6924]] of the garden [[H1588]] of Eden [[H5731]] Cherubims, [[H3742]] and a flaming [[H3858]] sword [[H2719]] which turned every way, [[H2015]] to keep [[H8104]] the way [[H1870]] of the tree [[H6086]] of life.
