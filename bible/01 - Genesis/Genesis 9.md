### 1
And God [[H430]] blessed [[H1288]] Noah [[H5146]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Be fruitful, [[H6509]] and multiply, [[H7235]] and replenish [[H4390]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 2
And the fear [[H4172]] of you and the dread [[H2844]] of you shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the earth, [[H776]] and upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] fowl [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] upon all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] moveth [[H7430]] the earth, [[H127]] and upon all [[H3605]] the fishes [[H1709]] of the sea; [[H3220]] into your hand [[H3027]] are they delivered. [[H5414]]

### 3
Every [[H3605]] moving thing [[H7431]] that [[H834]] liveth [[H2416]] shall be [[H1961]] meat [[H402]] for you; even as the green [[H3418]] herb [[H6212]] have I given [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] all things. [[H3605]]

### 4
But [[H389]] flesh [[H1320]] with the life [[H5315]] thereof, the blood [[H1818]] thereof, shall ye not [[H3808]] eat. [[H398]]

### 5
And surely [[H389]] your blood [[H1818]] of your lives [[H5315]] will I require; [[H1875]] at the hand [[H3027]] of every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] will I require it, [[H1875]] and at the hand [[H3027]] of man; [[H120]] at the hand [[H3027]] of every man's [[H376]] brother [[H251]] will I require [[H1875]] the life [[H5315]] of man. [[H120]]

### 6
Whoso sheddeth [[H8210]] man's [[H120]] blood, [[H1818]] by man [[H120]] shall his blood [[H1818]] be shed: [[H8210]] for [[H3588]] in the image [[H6754]] of God [[H430]] made [[H6213]]  he [[H853]] man. [[H120]]

### 7
And you, [[H859]] be ye fruitful, [[H6509]] and multiply; [[H7235]] bring forth abundantly [[H8317]] in the earth, [[H776]] and multiply [[H7235]] therein. [[H0]]

### 8
And God [[H430]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Noah, [[H5146]] and to [[H413]] his sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] him, saying, [[H559]]

### 9
And I, [[H589]] behold, [[H2005]] I establish [[H6965]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] you, and with [[H854]] your seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] you; [[H310]]

### 10
And with [[H854]] every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creature [[H5315]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] you, of the fowl, [[H5775]] of the cattle, [[H929]] and of every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the earth [[H776]] with [[H854]] you; from all [[H3605]] that go out [[H3318]] of the ark, [[H8392]] to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 11
And I will establish [[H6965]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] you; neither [[H3808]] shall all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] be cut off [[H3772]] any more [[H5750]] by the waters [[H4325]] of a flood; [[H3999]] neither [[H3808]] shall there any more [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] a flood [[H3999]] to destroy [[H7843]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 12
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] the token [[H226]] of the covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] make [[H5414]] between [[H996]] me and you and every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creature [[H5315]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] you, for perpetual [[H5769]] generations: [[H1755]]

### 13
I do set [[H5414]] my bow [[H7198]] in the cloud, [[H6051]] and it shall be [[H1961]] for a token [[H226]] of a covenant [[H1285]] between [[H996]] me and the earth. [[H776]]

### 14
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when I bring [[H6049]] a cloud [[H6051]] over [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] that the bow [[H7198]] shall be seen [[H7200]] in the cloud: [[H6051]]

### 15
And I will remember [[H2142]] my covenant, [[H1285]] which [[H834]] between [[H996]] me and you and every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creature [[H5315]] of all [[H3605]] flesh; [[H1320]] and the waters [[H4325]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] become [[H1961]] a flood [[H3999]] to destroy [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] flesh. [[H1320]]

### 16
And the bow [[H7198]] shall be [[H1961]] in the cloud; [[H6051]] and I will look upon it, [[H7200]] that I may remember [[H2142]] everlasting [[H5769]] the covenant [[H1285]] between [[H996]] God [[H430]] and [[H996]] every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creature [[H5315]] of all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Noah, [[H5146]] This [[H2063]] the token [[H226]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] which [[H834]] I have established [[H6965]] between [[H996]] me and all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 18
And the sons [[H1121]] of Noah, [[H5146]] that went forth [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the ark, [[H8392]] were [[H1961]] Shem, [[H8035]] and Ham, [[H2526]] and Japheth: [[H3315]] and Ham [[H2526]] the father [[H1]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 19
These [[H428]] the three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] of Noah: [[H5146]] and of them [[H428]] was the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] overspread. [[H5310]]

### 20
And Noah [[H5146]] began [[H2490]] an husbandman, [[H582]] and he planted [[H5193]] a vineyard: [[H3754]]

### 21
And he drank [[H8354]] of [[H4480]] the wine, [[H3196]] and was drunken; [[H7937]] and he was uncovered [[H1540]] within [[H8432]] his tent. [[H168]]

### 22
And Ham, [[H2526]] the father [[H1]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] saw [[H7200]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of his father, [[H1]] and told [[H5046]] his two [[H8147]] brethren [[H251]] without. [[H2351]]

### 23
And Shem [[H8035]] and Japheth [[H3315]] took [[H3947]] a garment, [[H8071]] and laid [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] both [[H8147]] their shoulders, [[H7926]] and went [[H1980]] backward, [[H322]] and covered [[H3680]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of their father; [[H1]] and their faces [[H6440]] backward, [[H322]] and they saw [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] their father's [[H1]] nakedness. [[H6172]]

### 24
And Noah [[H5146]] awoke [[H3364]] from his wine, [[H3196]] and knew [[H3045]] what [[H834]] his younger [[H6996]] son [[H1121]] had done [[H6213]] unto him. [[H6213]]

### 25
And he said, [[H559]] Cursed [[H779]] Canaan; [[H3667]] a servant [[H5650]] of servants [[H5650]] shall he be [[H1961]] unto his brethren. [[H251]]

### 26
And he said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Shem; [[H8035]] and Canaan [[H3667]] shall be [[H1961]] servant. [[H5650]] his [[H0]]

### 27
God [[H430]] shall enlarge [[H6601]] Japheth, [[H3315]] and he shall dwell [[H7931]] in the tents [[H168]] of Shem; [[H8035]] and Canaan [[H3667]] shall be [[H1961]] his servant. [[H5650]]

### 28
And Noah [[H5146]] lived [[H2421]] after [[H310]] the flood [[H3999]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] years. [[H8141]]

### 29
And all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Noah [[H5146]] were [[H1961]] nine [[H8672]] hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] years: [[H8141]] and he died. [[H4191]]
