### 1
And he commanded [[H6680]] the steward [[H5921]] of his house, [[H1004]] saying, [[H559]] Fill [[H4390]] the men's [[H376]] sacks [[H572]] food, [[H400]] as much as [[H834]] they can [[H3201]] carry, [[H5375]] and put [[H7760]] every man's [[H376]] money [[H3701]] in his sack's [[H572]] mouth. [[H6310]]

### 2
And put [[H7760]] my cup, [[H1375]] the silver [[H3701]] cup, [[H1375]] in the sack's [[H572]] mouth [[H6310]] of the youngest, [[H6996]] and his corn [[H7668]] money. [[H3701]] And he did [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had spoken. [[H1696]]

### 3
As soon as the morning [[H1242]] was light, [[H215]] the men [[H582]] were sent away, [[H7971]] they [[H1992]] and their asses. [[H2543]]

### 4
when they [[H1992]] were gone out of [[H3318]] the city, [[H5892]] not [[H3808]] far off, [[H7368]] Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto his steward, [[H1004]] Up, [[H6965]] follow [[H7291]] after [[H310]] the men; [[H376]] and when thou dost overtake [[H5381]] them, say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Wherefore [[H4100]] have ye rewarded [[H7999]] evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good? [[H2896]]

### 5
not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] in which [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] drinketh, [[H8354]] and whereby indeed [[H5172]] he divineth? [[H5172]] ye have done evil [[H7489]] in so [[H834]] doing. [[H6213]]

### 6
And he overtook [[H5381]] them, and he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]]  them [[H853]] these same [[H428]] words. [[H1697]]

### 7
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Wherefore [[H4100]] saith [[H1696]] my lord [[H113]] these [[H428]] words? [[H1697]] God forbid [[H2486]] that thy servants [[H5650]] should do [[H6213]] according to this [[H2088]] thing: [[H1697]]

### 8
Behold, [[H2005]] the money, [[H3701]] which [[H834]] we found [[H4672]] in our sacks' [[H572]] mouths, [[H6310]] we brought again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] thee out of the land [[H776]] of Canaan: [[H3667]] how [[H349]] then should we steal [[H1589]] out of thy lord's [[H113]] house [[H1004]] silver [[H3701]] or [[H176]] gold? [[H2091]]

### 9
With [[H854]] whomsoever [[H834]] of thy servants [[H5650]] it be found, [[H4672]] both let him die, [[H4191]] and we [[H587]] also [[H1571]] will be [[H1961]] my lord's [[H113]] bondmen. [[H5650]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] Now [[H6258]] also [[H3651]] it [[H1931]] according unto your words: [[H1697]] he with [[H854]] whom [[H834]] it is found [[H4672]] shall be [[H1961]] my servant; [[H5650]] and ye [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] blameless. [[H5355]]

### 11
Then they speedily [[H4116]] took down [[H3381]] every man [[H376]] his sack [[H572]] to the ground, [[H776]] and opened [[H6605]] every man [[H376]] his sack. [[H572]]

### 12
And he searched, [[H2664]] began [[H2490]] at the eldest, [[H1419]] and left [[H3615]] at the youngest: [[H6996]] and the cup [[H1375]] was found [[H4672]] in Benjamin's [[H1144]] sack. [[H572]]

### 13
Then they rent [[H7167]] their clothes, [[H8071]] and laded [[H6006]] every man [[H376]] his ass, [[H2543]] and returned [[H7725]] to the city. [[H5892]]

### 14
And Judah [[H3063]] and his brethren [[H251]] came [[H935]] to Joseph's [[H3130]] house; [[H1004]] for he [[H1931]] yet [[H5750]] there: [[H8033]] and they fell [[H5307]] before him [[H6440]] on the ground. [[H776]]

### 15
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto them, What [[H4100]] deed [[H4639]] this [[H2088]] that [[H834]] ye have done? [[H6213]] wot ye [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] such a man [[H376]] as I [[H3644]] can certainly [[H5172]] divine? [[H5172]]

### 16
And Judah [[H3063]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall we say [[H559]] unto my lord? [[H113]] what [[H4100]] shall we speak? [[H1696]] or how [[H4100]] shall we clear ourselves? [[H6663]] God [[H430]] hath found out [[H4672]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of thy servants: [[H5650]] behold, [[H2005]] we my lord's [[H113]] servants, [[H5650]] both [[H1571]] we, [[H587]] and also [[H1571]] with whom [[H834]] the cup [[H1375]] is found. [[H4672]]

### 17
And he said, [[H559]] God forbid [[H2486]] that I should do [[H6213]] so: [[H2063]] the man [[H376]] in whose [[H834]] hand [[H3027]] the cup [[H1375]] is found, [[H4672]] he [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] my servant; [[H5650]] and as for you, [[H859]] get you up [[H5927]] in peace [[H7965]] unto [[H413]] your father. [[H1]]

### 18
Then Judah [[H3063]] came near [[H5066]] unto him, [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] Oh [[H994]] my lord, [[H113]] let thy servant, [[H5650]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] speak [[H1696]] a word [[H1697]] in my lord's [[H113]] ears, [[H241]] and let not [[H408]] thine anger [[H639]] burn [[H2734]] against thy servant: [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] thou even as [[H3644]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 19
My lord [[H113]] asked [[H7592]] his servants, [[H5650]] saying, [[H559]] Have [[H3426]] ye a father, [[H1]] or [[H176]] a brother? [[H251]]

### 20
And we said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] my lord, [[H113]] We have [[H3426]] a father, [[H1]] an old man, [[H2205]] and a child [[H3206]] of his old age, [[H2208]] a little one; [[H6996]] and his brother [[H251]] is dead, [[H4191]] and he [[H1931]] alone [[H905]] is left [[H3498]] of his mother, [[H517]] and his father [[H1]] loveth [[H157]] him. [[H157]]

### 21
And thou saidst [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thy servants, [[H5650]] Bring him down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] me, that I may set [[H7760]] mine eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 22
And we said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] my lord, [[H113]] The lad [[H5288]] cannot [[H3201]] leave [[H5800]] his father: [[H1]] for he should leave [[H5800]] his father, [[H1]] would die. [[H4191]]

### 23
And thou saidst [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thy servants, [[H5650]] Except [[H3808]] your youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] come down [[H3381]] with [[H854]] you, ye shall see [[H7200]] my face [[H6440]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H3808]]

### 24
And it came to pass [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] we came up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] thy servant [[H5650]] my father, [[H1]] we told [[H5046]]  him [[H853]] the words [[H1697]] of my lord. [[H113]]

### 25
And our father [[H1]] said, [[H559]] Go again, [[H7725]] buy [[H7666]] us a little [[H4592]] food. [[H400]]

### 26
And we said, [[H559]] We cannot [[H3201]] go down: [[H3381]] if [[H518]] our youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] be [[H3426]] with [[H854]] us, then will we go down: [[H3381]] for [[H3588]] we may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] the man's [[H376]] face, [[H6440]] except [[H369]] our youngest [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] with [[H854]] us. [[H854]]

### 27
And thy servant [[H5650]] my father [[H1]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] us, Ye [[H859]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] my wife [[H802]] bare [[H3205]] me two [[H8147]]

### 28
And the one [[H259]] went out [[H3318]] from me, and I said, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] he is torn in pieces; [[H2963]] and I saw him [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] since: [[H2008]]

### 29
And if ye take [[H3947]] this [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] from [[H5973]] me, [[H6440]] and mischief [[H611]] befall him, [[H7136]] ye shall bring down [[H3381]] my gray hairs [[H7872]] with sorrow [[H7451]] to the grave. [[H7585]]

### 30
Now [[H6258]] therefore when I come [[H935]] to [[H413]] thy servant [[H5650]] my father, [[H1]] and the lad [[H5288]] not [[H369]] with [[H854]] us; seeing that his life [[H5315]] is bound up [[H7194]] in the lad's life; [[H5315]]

### 31
It shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when he seeth [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the lad [[H5288]] not [[H369]] that he will die: [[H4191]] and thy servants [[H5650]] shall bring down [[H3381]] the gray hairs [[H7872]] of thy servant [[H5650]] our father [[H1]] with sorrow [[H3015]] to the grave. [[H7585]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] became surety [[H6148]]  for [[H853]] the lad [[H5288]] unto [[H5973]] my father, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] I bring [[H935]] him not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] thee, then I shall bear the blame [[H2398]] to my father [[H1]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 33
Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] let thy servant [[H5650]] abide [[H3427]] instead of [[H8478]] the lad [[H5288]] a bondman [[H5650]] to my lord; [[H113]] and let the lad [[H5288]] go up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] his brethren. [[H251]]

### 34
For [[H3588]] how [[H349]] shall I go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] my father, [[H1]] and the lad [[H5288]] not [[H369]] with [[H854]] me? lest peradventure [[H6435]] I see [[H7200]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] shall come on [[H4672]] my father. [[H1]]
