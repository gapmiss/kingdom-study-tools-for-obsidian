### 1
And Abraham [[H85]] was old, [[H2204]] well stricken [[H935]] in age: [[H3117]] and the Lord [[H3068]] had blessed [[H1288]] Abraham [[H85]] in all things. [[H3605]]

### 2
And Abraham [[H85]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his eldest [[H2205]] servant [[H5650]] of his house, [[H1004]] that ruled over [[H4910]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had, Put, [[H7760]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] thy hand [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] my thigh: [[H3409]]

### 3
And I will make thee swear [[H7650]] by the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and the God [[H430]] of the earth, [[H776]] that [[H834]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] unto my son [[H1121]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] among [[H7130]] whom [[H834]] I [[H595]] dwell: [[H3427]]

### 4
But [[H3588]] thou shalt go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] my country, [[H776]] and to [[H413]] my kindred, [[H4138]] and take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] unto my son [[H1121]] Isaac. [[H3327]]

### 5
And the servant [[H5650]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Peradventure [[H194]] the woman [[H802]] will not [[H3808]] be willing [[H14]] to follow [[H310]] me unto [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land: [[H776]] must I needs bring [[H7725]] thy son [[H1121]] again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] from whence [[H834]] thou camest? [[H3318]]

### 6
And Abraham [[H85]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Beware [[H8104]] thou that [[H6435]] thou bring [[H7725]]  not [[H853]] my son [[H1121]] thither [[H8033]] again. [[H8033]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] which [[H834]] took me [[H3947]] from my father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] and from the land [[H776]] of my kindred, [[H4138]] and which [[H834]] spake [[H1696]] unto me, and that [[H834]] sware [[H7650]] unto me, saying, [[H559]] Unto thy seed [[H2233]] will I give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] land; [[H776]] he [[H1931]] shall send [[H7971]] his angel [[H4397]] before [[H6440]] thee, and thou shalt take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] unto my son [[H1121]] from thence. [[H8033]]

### 8
And if [[H518]] the woman [[H802]] will not [[H3808]] be willing [[H14]] to follow [[H310]] thee, then thou shalt be clear [[H5352]] from this my oath: [[H7621]] only [[H7535]] bring not [[H3808]] my son [[H1121]] thither [[H8033]] again. [[H7725]]

### 9
And the servant [[H5650]] put [[H7760]] his hand [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] the thigh [[H3409]] of Abraham [[H85]] his master, [[H113]] and sware [[H7650]] to him concerning [[H5921]] that [[H2088]] matter. [[H1697]]

### 10
And the servant [[H5650]] took [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] camels [[H1581]] of the camels [[H1581]] of his master, [[H113]] and departed; [[H1980]] for all [[H3605]] the goods [[H2898]] of his master [[H113]] in his hand: [[H3027]] and he arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Mesopotamia, [[H763]] unto [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of Nahor. [[H5152]]

### 11
his camels [[H1581]] And he made to kneel down [[H1288]] without [[H2351]] the city [[H5892]] by [[H413]] a well [[H875]] of water [[H4325]] at the time [[H6256]] of the evening, [[H6153]] the time [[H6256]] that women go out [[H3318]] to draw [[H7579]]

### 12
And he said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of my master [[H113]] Abraham, [[H85]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] send me [[H6440]] good speed [[H7136]] this day, [[H3117]] and shew [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] unto [[H5973]] my master [[H113]] Abraham. [[H85]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] stand [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] the well [[H5869]] of water; [[H4325]] and the daughters [[H1323]] of the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] come out [[H3318]] to draw [[H7579]] water: [[H4325]]

### 14
And let it come to pass, [[H1961]] that the damsel [[H5291]] to whom [[H834]] I shall say, [[H559]] Let down [[H5186]] thy pitcher, [[H3537]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] that I may drink; [[H8354]] and she shall say, [[H559]] Drink, [[H8354]] and I will give thy camels [[H1581]] drink [[H8248]] also: [[H1571]] she thou hast appointed [[H3198]] for thy servant [[H5650]] Isaac; [[H3327]] and thereby shall I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou hast shewed [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] unto [[H5973]] my master. [[H113]]

### 15
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] before [[H2962]] he [[H1931]] had done [[H3615]] speaking, [[H1696]] that, behold, [[H2009]] Rebekah [[H7259]] came out, [[H3318]] who [[H834]] was born [[H3205]] to Bethuel, [[H1328]] son [[H1121]] of Milcah, [[H4435]] the wife [[H802]] of Nahor, [[H5152]] Abraham's [[H85]] brother, [[H251]] with her pitcher [[H3537]] upon [[H5921]] her shoulder. [[H7926]]

### 16
And the damsel [[H5291]] very [[H3966]] fair [[H2896]] to look upon, [[H4758]] a virgin, [[H1330]] neither [[H3808]] had any man [[H376]] known [[H3045]] her: and she went down [[H3381]] to the well, [[H5869]] and filled [[H4390]] her pitcher, [[H3537]] and came up. [[H5927]]

### 17
And the servant [[H5650]] ran [[H7323]] to meet her, [[H7125]] and said, [[H559]] Let me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] drink [[H1572]] a little [[H4592]] water [[H4325]] of thy pitcher. [[H3537]]

### 18
And she said, [[H559]] Drink, [[H8354]] my lord: [[H113]] and she hasted, [[H4116]] and let down [[H3381]] her pitcher [[H3537]] upon [[H5921]] her hand, [[H3027]] and gave him drink. [[H8248]]

### 19
And when she had done [[H3615]] giving him drink, [[H8248]] she said, [[H559]] I will draw [[H7579]] for thy camels [[H1581]] also, [[H1571]] until [[H518]] they have done [[H3615]] drinking. [[H8354]]

### 20
And she hasted, [[H4116]] and emptied [[H6168]] her pitcher [[H3537]] into [[H413]] the trough, [[H8268]] and ran [[H7323]] again [[H5750]] unto [[H413]] the well [[H875]] to draw [[H7579]] and drew [[H7579]] for all [[H3605]] his camels. [[H1581]]

### 21
And the man [[H376]] wondering [[H7583]] at her held his peace, [[H2790]] to wit [[H3045]] whether the Lord [[H3068]] had made his journey [[H1870]] prosperous [[H6743]] or [[H518]] not. [[H3808]]

### 22
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as [[H834]] the camels [[H1581]] had done [[H3615]] drinking, [[H8354]] that the man [[H376]] took [[H3947]] a golden [[H2091]] earring [[H5141]] of half a shekel [[H1235]] weight, [[H4948]] and two [[H8147]] bracelets [[H6781]] for [[H5921]] her hands [[H3027]] of ten [[H6235]] weight [[H4948]] of gold; [[H2091]]

### 23
And said, [[H559]] Whose [[H4310]] daughter [[H1323]] thou? [[H859]] tell [[H5046]] me, I pray thee: [[H4994]] is there [[H3426]] room [[H4725]] thy father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] for us to lodge in? [[H3885]]

### 24
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I [[H595]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Bethuel [[H1328]] the son [[H1121]] of Milcah, [[H4435]] which [[H834]] she bare [[H3205]] unto Nahor. [[H5152]]

### 25
She said [[H559]] moreover unto [[H413]] him, We have both [[H1571]] straw [[H8401]] and [[H1571]] provender [[H4554]] enough, [[H7227]] and [[H1571]] room [[H4725]] to lodge in. [[H3885]]

### 26
And the man [[H376]] bowed down his head, [[H6915]] and worshipped [[H7812]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
And he said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of my master [[H113]] Abraham, [[H85]] who [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] left destitute [[H5800]] my master [[H113]] of his mercy [[H2617]] and his truth: [[H571]] I [[H595]] in the way, [[H1870]] the Lord [[H3068]] led me [[H5148]] to the house [[H1004]] of my master's [[H113]] brethren. [[H251]]

### 28
And the damsel [[H5291]] ran, [[H7323]] and told [[H5046]] her mother's [[H517]] house [[H1004]] these [[H428]] things. [[H1697]]

### 29
And Rebekah [[H7259]] had a brother, [[H251]] and his name [[H8034]] Laban: [[H3837]] and Laban [[H3837]] ran [[H7323]] out [[H2351]] unto [[H413]] the man, [[H376]] unto [[H413]] the well. [[H5869]]

### 30
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he saw [[H7200]] the earring [[H5141]] and bracelets [[H6781]] upon [[H5921]] his sister's [[H269]] hands, [[H3027]] and when he heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of Rebekah [[H7259]] his sister, [[H269]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] spake [[H1696]] the man [[H376]] unto [[H413]] me; that he came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the man; [[H376]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the camels [[H1581]] at [[H5921]] the well. [[H5869]]

### 31
And he said, [[H559]] Come in, [[H935]] thou blessed [[H1288]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] wherefore [[H4100]] standest [[H5975]] thou without? [[H2351]] for I [[H595]] have prepared [[H6437]] the house, [[H1004]] and room [[H4725]] for the camels. [[H1581]]

### 32
And the man [[H376]] came [[H935]] into the house: [[H1004]] and he ungirded [[H6605]] his camels, [[H1581]] and gave [[H5414]] straw [[H8401]] and provender [[H4554]] for the camels, [[H1581]] and water [[H4325]] to wash [[H7364]] his feet, [[H7272]] and the men's [[H582]] feet [[H7272]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 33
And there was set [[H3455]] before him [[H6440]] to eat: [[H398]] but he said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] eat, [[H398]] until [[H518]] I have told [[H1696]] mine errand. [[H1697]] And he said, [[H559]] Speak on. [[H1696]]

### 34
And he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] Abraham's [[H85]] servant. [[H5650]]

### 35
And the Lord [[H3068]] hath blessed [[H1288]] my master [[H113]] greatly; [[H3966]] and he is become great: [[H1431]] and he hath given [[H5414]] him flocks, [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] and silver, [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and menservants, [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H8198]] and camels, [[H1581]] and asses. [[H2543]]

### 36
And Sarah [[H8283]] my master's [[H113]] wife [[H802]] bare [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] to my master [[H113]] when [[H310]] she was old: [[H2209]] and unto him hath he given [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath. [[H834]]

### 37
And my master [[H113]] made me swear, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] to my son [[H1121]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] in whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] I [[H595]] dwell: [[H3427]]

### 38
But [[H518]] thou shalt go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] my father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] and to [[H413]] my kindred, [[H4940]] and take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] unto my son. [[H1121]]

### 39
And I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] my master, [[H113]] Peradventure [[H194]] the woman [[H802]] will not [[H3808]] follow me. [[H1980]]

### 40
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, The Lord, [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] I walk, [[H1980]] will send [[H7971]] his angel [[H4397]] with [[H854]] thee, and prosper [[H6743]] thy way; [[H1870]] and thou shalt take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for my son [[H1121]] of my kindred, [[H4940]] and of my father's [[H1]] house: [[H1004]]

### 41
Then [[H227]] shalt thou be clear [[H5352]] from my oath, [[H423]] when [[H3588]] thou comest [[H935]] to [[H413]] my kindred; [[H4940]] and if [[H518]] they give [[H5414]] not [[H3808]] thee thou shalt be [[H1961]] clear [[H5355]] from my oath. [[H423]]

### 42
And I came [[H935]] this day [[H3117]] unto [[H413]] the well, [[H5869]] and said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of my master [[H113]] Abraham, [[H85]] if [[H518]] now [[H4994]] thou do [[H3426]] prosper [[H6743]] my way [[H1870]] which [[H5921]] I [[H595]] go: [[H1980]]

### 43
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] stand [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] the well [[H5869]] of water; [[H4325]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] that when the virgin [[H5959]] cometh forth [[H3318]] to draw [[H7579]] and I say [[H559]] to [[H413]] her, Give me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] a little [[H4592]] water [[H4325]] of thy pitcher [[H3537]] to drink; [[H8248]]

### 44
And she say [[H559]] to [[H413]] me, Both [[H1571]] drink [[H8354]] thou, [[H859]] and I will also [[H1571]] draw [[H7579]] for thy camels: [[H1581]] the same [[H1931]] the woman [[H802]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath appointed out [[H3198]] for my master's [[H113]] son. [[H1121]]

### 45
And before [[H2962]] I [[H589]] had done [[H3615]] speaking [[H1696]] in [[H413]] mine heart, [[H3820]] behold, [[H2009]] Rebekah [[H7259]] came forth [[H3318]] with her pitcher [[H3537]] on [[H5921]] her shoulder; [[H7926]] and she went down [[H3381]] unto the well, [[H5869]] and drew [[H7579]] and I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Let me drink, [[H8248]] I pray thee. [[H4994]]

### 46
And she made haste, [[H4116]] and let down [[H3381]] her pitcher [[H3537]] from [[H5921]] her and said, [[H559]] Drink, [[H8354]] and I will give thy camels [[H1581]] drink [[H8248]] also: [[H1571]] so I drank, [[H8354]] and she made the camels [[H1581]] drink [[H8248]] also. [[H1571]]

### 47
And I asked [[H7592]] her, and said, [[H559]] Whose [[H4310]] daughter [[H1323]] thou? [[H859]] And she said, [[H559]] The daughter [[H1323]] of Bethuel, [[H1328]] Nahor's [[H5152]] son, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] Milcah [[H4435]] bare [[H3205]] unto him: and I put [[H7760]] the earring [[H5141]] upon [[H5921]] her face, [[H639]] and the bracelets [[H6781]] upon [[H5921]] her hands. [[H3027]]

### 48
And I bowed down my head, [[H6915]] and worshipped [[H7812]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of my master [[H113]] Abraham, [[H85]] which [[H834]] had led me [[H5148]] in the right [[H571]] way [[H1870]] to take [[H3947]] my master's [[H113]] brother's [[H251]] daughter [[H1323]] unto his son. [[H1121]]

### 49
And now [[H6258]] if [[H518]] ye will [[H3426]] deal [[H6213]] kindly [[H2617]] and truly [[H571]] with [[H854]] my master, [[H113]] tell [[H5046]] me: and if [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] me; that I may turn [[H6437]] to [[H5921]] the right hand, [[H3225]] or [[H176]] to [[H5921]] the left. [[H8040]]

### 50
Then Laban [[H3837]] and Bethuel [[H1328]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] The thing [[H1697]] proceedeth [[H3318]] from the Lord: [[H3068]] we cannot [[H3201]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee bad [[H7451]] or [[H176]] good. [[H2896]]

### 51
Behold, [[H2009]] Rebekah [[H7259]] before thee, [[H6440]] take [[H3947]] and go, [[H1980]] and let her be thy master's [[H113]] son's [[H1121]] wife, [[H802]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken. [[H1696]]

### 52
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that, when [[H834]] Abraham's [[H85]] servant [[H5650]] heard [[H8085]] their words, [[H1697]] he worshipped [[H7812]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to the earth. [[H776]]

### 53
And the servant [[H5650]] brought forth [[H3318]] jewels [[H3627]] of silver, [[H3701]] and jewels [[H3627]] of gold, [[H2091]] and raiment, [[H899]] and gave [[H5414]] to Rebekah: [[H7259]] he gave [[H5414]] also to her brother [[H251]] and to her mother [[H517]] precious things. [[H4030]]

### 54
And they did eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] he [[H1931]] and the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him, and tarried all night; [[H3885]] and they rose up [[H6965]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and he said, [[H559]] Send me away [[H7971]] unto my master. [[H113]]

### 55
And her brother [[H251]] and her mother [[H517]] said, [[H559]] Let the damsel [[H5291]] abide [[H3427]] with [[H854]] us days, [[H3117]] at the least [[H176]] ten; [[H6218]] after that [[H310]] she shall go. [[H1980]]

### 56
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Hinder me [[H309]] not, [[H408]] seeing the Lord [[H3068]] hath prospered [[H6743]] my way; [[H1870]] send me away [[H7971]] that I may go [[H1980]] to my master. [[H113]]

### 57
And they said, [[H559]] We will call [[H7121]] the damsel, [[H5291]] and inquire [[H7592]]  at [[H853]] her mouth. [[H6310]]

### 58
And they called [[H7121]] Rebekah, [[H7259]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Wilt thou go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] this [[H2088]] man? [[H376]] And she said, [[H559]] I will go. [[H1980]]

### 59
And they sent away [[H7971]] Rebekah [[H7259]] their sister, [[H269]] and her nurse, [[H3243]] and Abraham's [[H85]] servant, [[H5650]] and his men. [[H376]]

### 60
And they blessed [[H1288]] Rebekah, [[H7259]] and said [[H559]] unto her, Thou [[H859]] our sister, [[H269]] be thou [[H1961]] of thousands [[H505]] of millions, [[H7233]] and let thy seed [[H2233]] possess [[H3423]] the gate [[H8179]] of those which hate them. [[H8130]]

### 61
And Rebekah [[H7259]] arose, [[H6965]] and her damsels, [[H5291]] and they rode [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] the camels, [[H1581]] and followed [[H1980]] the man: [[H376]] and the servant [[H5650]] took [[H3947]] Rebekah, [[H7259]] and went his way. [[H1980]]

### 62
And Isaac [[H3327]] came [[H935]] from the way [[H935]] of the well Lahai-roi; [[H883]] for he [[H1931]] dwelt [[H3427]] in the south [[H5045]] country. [[H776]]

### 63
And Isaac [[H3327]] went out [[H3318]] to meditate [[H7742]] in the field [[H7704]] at [[H6437]] the eventide: [[H6153]] and he lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and saw, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the camels [[H1581]] coming. [[H935]]

### 64
