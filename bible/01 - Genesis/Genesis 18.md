### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him in the plains [[H436]] of Mamre: [[H4471]] and he [[H1931]] sat [[H3427]] in the tent [[H168]] door [[H6607]] in the heat [[H2527]] of the day; [[H3117]]

### 2
And he lift up [[H5375]] his eyes [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, lo, [[H2009]] three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] stood [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] him: and when he saw [[H7200]] he ran [[H7323]] to meet [[H7125]] them from the tent [[H168]] door, [[H6607]] and bowed [[H7812]] himself toward the ground, [[H776]]

### 3
And said, [[H559]] My Lord, [[H113]] if [[H518]] now [[H4994]] I have found [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] pass not away, [[H5674]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] from [[H5921]] thy servant: [[H5650]]

### 4
Let a little [[H4592]] water, [[H4325]] I pray you, [[H4994]] be fetched, [[H3947]] and wash [[H7364]] your feet, [[H7272]] and rest yourselves [[H8172]] under [[H8478]] the tree: [[H6086]]

### 5
And I will fetch [[H3947]] a morsel [[H6595]] of bread, [[H3899]] and comfort ye [[H5582]] your hearts; [[H3820]] after that [[H310]] ye shall pass on: [[H5674]] for [[H3588]] therefore [[H3651]] are ye come [[H5674]] to [[H5921]] your servant. [[H5650]] And they said, [[H559]] So [[H3651]] do, [[H6213]] as [[H834]] thou hast said. [[H1696]]

### 6
And Abraham [[H85]] hastened [[H4116]] into the tent [[H168]] unto [[H413]] Sarah, [[H8283]] and said, [[H559]] Make ready quickly [[H4116]] three [[H7969]] measures [[H5429]] of fine [[H5560]] meal, [[H7058]] knead [[H3888]] and make [[H6213]] cakes [[H5692]] upon the hearth. [[H5692]]

### 7
And Abraham [[H85]] ran [[H7323]] unto [[H413]] the herd, [[H1241]] and fetcht [[H3947]] a calf [[H1121]] tender [[H7390]] and good, [[H2896]] and gave [[H5414]] unto [[H413]] a young man; [[H5288]] and he hasted [[H4116]] to dress [[H6213]] it. [[H6213]]

### 8
And he took [[H3947]] butter, [[H2529]] and milk, [[H2461]] and the calf [[H1121]] which [[H834]] he had dressed, [[H6213]] and set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] them; and he [[H1931]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] them under [[H8478]] the tree, [[H6086]] and they did eat. [[H398]]

### 9
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Where [[H346]] Sarah [[H8283]] thy wife? [[H802]] And he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] in the tent. [[H168]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] I will certainly [[H7725]] return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] thee according to the time [[H6256]] of life; [[H2416]] and, lo, [[H2009]] Sarah [[H8283]] thy wife [[H802]] shall have a son. [[H1121]] And Sarah [[H8283]] heard [[H8085]] in the tent [[H168]] door, [[H6607]] which [[H1931]] behind [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 11
Now Abraham [[H85]] and Sarah [[H8283]] old [[H2205]] well stricken [[H935]] in age; [[H3117]] it ceased [[H2308]] to be [[H1961]] with Sarah [[H8283]] after the manner [[H734]] of women. [[H802]]

### 12
Therefore Sarah [[H8283]] laughed [[H6711]] within [[H7130]] herself, saying, [[H559]] After [[H310]] I am waxed old [[H1086]] shall I have [[H1961]] pleasure, [[H5730]] my lord [[H113]] being old also? [[H2204]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] Wherefore [[H4100]] did Sarah [[H8283]] laugh, [[H6711]] saying, [[H559]] Shall I of a surety [[H552]] bear a child, [[H3205]] which [[H589]] am old? [[H2204]]

### 14
Is any thing [[H1697]] too hard [[H6381]] for the Lord? [[H3068]] At the time appointed [[H4150]] I will return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] thee, according to the time [[H6256]] of life, [[H2416]] and Sarah [[H8283]] shall have a son. [[H1121]]

### 15
Then Sarah [[H8283]] denied, [[H3584]] saying, [[H559]] I laughed [[H6711]] not; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] she was afraid. [[H3372]] And he said, [[H559]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] thou didst laugh. [[H6711]]

### 16
And the men [[H582]] rose up [[H6965]] from thence, [[H8033]] and looked [[H8259]] toward [[H6440]] Sodom: [[H5467]] and Abraham [[H85]] went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] them to bring them on the way. [[H7971]]

### 17
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Shall I [[H589]] hide [[H3680]] from Abraham [[H85]] that thing which [[H834]] I [[H589]] do; [[H6213]]

### 18
Seeing that Abraham [[H85]] shall surely become [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] and mighty [[H6099]] nation, [[H1471]] and all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] shall be blessed [[H1288]] in him? [[H1288]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] him, that [[H834]] he will command [[H6680]] his children [[H1121]] and his household [[H1004]] after [[H310]] him, and they shall keep [[H8104]] the way [[H1870]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to do [[H6213]] justice [[H6666]] and judgment; [[H4941]] that [[H4616]] the Lord [[H3068]] may bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] Abraham [[H85]] that which [[H834]] he hath spoken [[H1696]] of [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] the cry [[H2201]] of Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] is great, [[H7227]] and because [[H3588]] their sin [[H2403]] is very [[H3966]] grievous; [[H3513]]

### 21
I will go down [[H3381]] now, [[H4994]] and see [[H7200]] whether they have done [[H6213]] altogether [[H3617]] according to the cry [[H6818]] of it, which is come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me; and if [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] I will know. [[H3045]]

### 22
And the men [[H376]] turned their faces [[H6437]] from thence, [[H8033]] and went [[H1980]] toward Sodom: [[H5467]] but Abraham [[H85]] stood [[H5975]] yet [[H5750]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
And Abraham [[H85]] drew near, [[H5066]] and said, [[H559]] Wilt thou also [[H637]] destroy [[H5595]] the righteous [[H6662]] with [[H5973]] the wicked? [[H7563]]

### 24
Peradventure [[H194]] there be [[H3426]] fifty [[H2572]] righteous [[H6662]] within [[H8432]] the city: [[H5892]] wilt thou also [[H637]] destroy [[H5595]] and not [[H3808]] spare [[H5375]] the place [[H4725]] for [[H4616]] the fifty [[H2572]] righteous [[H6662]] that [[H834]] therein? [[H7130]]

### 25
That be far [[H2486]] from thee to do [[H6213]] after this [[H2088]] manner, [[H1697]] to slay [[H4191]] the righteous [[H6662]] with [[H5973]] the wicked: [[H7563]] and that the righteous [[H6662]] should be [[H1961]] as the wicked, [[H7563]] that be far [[H2486]] from thee: Shall not [[H3808]] the Judge [[H8199]] of all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] do [[H6213]] right? [[H4941]]

### 26
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] I find [[H4672]] in Sodom [[H5467]] fifty [[H2572]] righteous [[H6662]] within [[H8432]] the city, [[H5892]] then I will spare [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] the place [[H4725]] for their sakes. [[H5668]]

### 27
And Abraham [[H85]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I have taken upon me [[H2974]] to speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H136]] which [[H595]] dust [[H6083]] and ashes: [[H665]]

### 28
Peradventure [[H194]] there shall lack [[H2637]] five [[H2568]] of the fifty [[H2572]] righteous: [[H6662]] wilt thou destroy [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] the city [[H5892]] for five? [[H2568]] And he said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] I find [[H4672]] there [[H8033]] forty [[H705]] and five, [[H2568]] I will not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]]

### 29
And he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him yet [[H5750]] again, [[H3254]] and said, [[H559]] Peradventure [[H194]] there shall be forty [[H705]] found [[H4672]] there. [[H8033]] And he said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] for forty's [[H705]]  sake. [[H5668]]

### 30
And he said [[H559]] Oh [[H4994]] let not [[H408]] the Lord [[H136]] be angry, [[H2734]] and I will speak: [[H1696]] Peradventure [[H194]] there shall thirty [[H7970]] be found [[H4672]] there. [[H8033]] And he said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] if [[H518]] I find [[H4672]] thirty [[H7970]] there. [[H8033]]

### 31
And he said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I have taken upon me [[H2974]] to speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the Lord: [[H136]] Peradventure [[H194]] there shall be twenty [[H6242]] found [[H4672]] there. [[H8033]] And he said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] for twenty's [[H6242]] sake. [[H5668]]

### 32
And he said, [[H559]] Oh [[H4994]] let not [[H408]] the Lord [[H136]] be angry, [[H2734]] and I will speak [[H1696]] yet [[H389]] but this once: [[H6471]] Peradventure [[H194]] ten [[H6235]] shall be found [[H4672]] there. [[H8033]] And he said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] for ten's [[H6235]]  sake. [[H5668]]

### 33
And the Lord [[H3068]] went his way, [[H1980]] as soon as [[H834]] he had left [[H3615]] communing [[H1696]] with [[H413]] Abraham: [[H85]] and Abraham [[H85]] returned [[H7725]] unto his place. [[H4725]]
