### 1
Then Jacob [[H3290]] went on [[H5375]] his journey, [[H7272]] and came [[H1980]] into the land [[H776]] of the people [[H1121]] of the east. [[H6924]]

### 2
And he looked, [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] a well [[H875]] in the field, [[H7704]] and, lo, [[H2009]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] flocks [[H5739]] of sheep [[H6629]] lying [[H7257]] by [[H5921]] it; for [[H3588]] out of [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] well [[H875]] they watered [[H8248]] the flocks: [[H5739]] and a great [[H1419]] stone [[H68]] upon [[H5921]] the well's [[H875]] mouth. [[H6310]]

### 3
And thither [[H8033]] were all [[H3605]] the flocks [[H5739]] gathered: [[H622]] and they rolled [[H1556]] the stone [[H68]] from [[H5921]] the well's [[H875]] mouth, [[H6310]] and watered [[H8248]] the sheep, [[H6629]] and put [[H7725]] the stone [[H68]] again upon [[H5921]] the well's [[H875]] mouth [[H6310]] in his place. [[H4725]]

### 4
And Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] unto them, My brethren, [[H251]] whence [[H370]] ye? [[H859]] And they said, [[H559]] Of Haran [[H2771]] we. [[H587]]

### 5
And he said [[H559]] unto them, Know [[H3045]]  ye [[H853]] Laban [[H3837]] the son [[H1121]] of Nahor? [[H5152]] And they said, [[H559]] We know [[H3045]]

### 6
And he said [[H559]] unto them, he well? [[H7965]] And they said, [[H559]] well: [[H7965]] and, behold, [[H2009]] Rachel [[H7354]] his daughter [[H1323]] cometh [[H935]] with [[H5973]] the sheep. [[H6629]]

### 7
And he said, [[H559]] Lo, [[H2005]] yet [[H5750]] high [[H1419]] day, [[H3117]] neither [[H3808]] time [[H6256]] that the cattle [[H4735]] should be gathered together: [[H622]] water [[H8248]] ye the sheep, [[H6629]] and go [[H1980]] feed [[H7462]]

### 8
And they said, [[H559]] We cannot, [[H3201]] until [[H834]] all [[H3605]] the flocks [[H5739]] be gathered together, [[H622]] and they roll [[H1556]] the stone [[H68]] from [[H5921]] the well's [[H875]] mouth; [[H6310]] then we water [[H8248]] the sheep. [[H6629]]

### 9
And while he yet [[H5750]] spake [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] them, Rachel [[H7354]] came [[H935]] with [[H5973]] her father's [[H1]] sheep: [[H6629]] for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] kept them. [[H7462]]

### 10
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Jacob [[H3290]] saw [[H7200]] Rachel [[H7354]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Laban [[H3837]] his mother's [[H517]] brother, [[H251]] and the sheep [[H6629]] of Laban [[H3837]] his mother's [[H517]] brother, [[H251]] that Jacob [[H3290]] went near, [[H5066]] and rolled [[H1556]] the stone [[H68]] from [[H5921]] the well's [[H875]] mouth, [[H6310]] and watered [[H8248]] the flock [[H6629]] of Laban [[H3837]] his mother's [[H517]] brother. [[H251]]

### 11
And Jacob [[H3290]] kissed [[H5401]] Rachel, [[H7354]] and lifted up [[H5375]] his voice, [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 12
And Jacob [[H3290]] told [[H5046]] Rachel [[H7354]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] her father's [[H1]] brother, [[H251]] and that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] Rebekah's [[H7259]] son: [[H1121]] and she ran [[H7323]] and told [[H5046]] her father. [[H1]]

### 13
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Laban [[H3837]] heard [[H8085]] the tidings [[H8088]] of Jacob [[H3290]] his sister's [[H269]] son, [[H1121]] that he ran [[H7323]] to meet [[H7125]] him, and embraced [[H2263]] him, and kissed [[H5401]] him, and brought [[H935]] him to [[H413]] his house. [[H1004]] And he told [[H5608]] Laban [[H3837]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things. [[H1697]]

### 14
And Laban [[H3837]] said [[H559]] to him, Surely [[H389]] thou [[H859]] my bone [[H6106]] and my flesh. [[H1320]] And he abode [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] him the space [[H3117]] of a month. [[H2320]]

### 15
And Laban [[H3837]] said [[H559]] unto Jacob, [[H3290]] Because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my brother, [[H251]] shouldest thou therefore serve [[H5647]] me for nought? [[H2600]] tell [[H5046]] me, what [[H4100]] thy wages [[H4909]]

### 16
And Laban [[H3837]] had two [[H8147]] daughters: [[H1323]] the name [[H8034]] of the elder [[H1419]] Leah, [[H3812]] and the name [[H8034]] of the younger [[H6996]] Rachel. [[H7354]]

### 17
Leah [[H3812]] tender [[H7390]] eyed; [[H5869]] but Rachel [[H7354]] was [[H1961]] beautiful [[H3303]] and well [[H3303]] favoured. [[H4758]]

### 18
And Jacob [[H3290]] loved [[H157]] Rachel; [[H7354]] and said, [[H559]] I will serve [[H5647]] thee seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] for Rachel [[H7354]] thy younger [[H6996]] daughter. [[H1323]]

### 19
And Laban [[H3837]] said, [[H559]] better [[H2896]] that I give [[H5414]] her to thee, than that I should give [[H5414]] her to another [[H312]] man: [[H582]] abide [[H3427]] with me. [[H3427]]

### 20
And Jacob [[H3290]] served [[H5647]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] for Rachel; [[H7354]] and they seemed [[H5869]] unto him a few [[H259]] days, [[H3117]] for the love [[H160]] he had to her. [[H853]]

### 21
And Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Laban, [[H3837]] Give [[H3051]] my wife, [[H802]] for [[H3588]] my days [[H3117]] are fulfilled, [[H4390]] that I may go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her. [[H413]]

### 22
And Laban [[H3837]] gathered together [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of the place, [[H4725]] and made [[H6213]] a feast. [[H4960]]

### 23
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the evening, [[H6153]] that he took [[H3947]] Leah [[H3812]] his daughter, [[H1323]] and brought [[H935]] her to [[H413]] him; and he went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her. [[H413]]

### 24
And Laban [[H3837]] gave [[H5414]] unto his daughter [[H1323]] Leah [[H3812]] Zilpah [[H2153]] his maid [[H8198]] an handmaid. [[H8198]]

### 25
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that in the morning, [[H1242]] behold, [[H2009]] it [[H1931]] Leah: [[H3812]] and he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Laban, [[H3837]] What [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] thou hast done [[H6213]] unto me? did not [[H3808]] I serve [[H5647]] with [[H5973]] thee for Rachel? [[H7354]] wherefore [[H4100]] then hast thou beguiled [[H7411]] me? [[H7411]]

### 26
And Laban [[H3837]] said, [[H559]] It must not [[H3808]] be so [[H3651]] done [[H6213]] in our country, [[H4725]] to give [[H5414]] the younger [[H6810]] before [[H6440]] the firstborn. [[H1067]]

### 27
Fulfil [[H4390]] her [[H2063]] week, [[H7620]] and we will give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] this [[H2063]] also [[H1571]] for the service [[H5656]] which [[H834]] thou shalt serve [[H5647]] with me yet [[H5750]] seven [[H7651]] other [[H312]] years. [[H8141]]

### 28
And Jacob [[H3290]] did [[H6213]] so, [[H3651]] and fulfilled [[H4390]] her [[H2063]] week: [[H7620]] and he gave [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] Rachel [[H7354]] his daughter [[H1323]] to wife [[H802]] also. [[H802]]

### 29
And Laban [[H3837]] gave [[H5414]] to Rachel [[H7354]] his daughter [[H1323]] Bilhah [[H1090]] his handmaid [[H8198]] to be her maid. [[H8198]]

### 30
And he went in [[H935]] also [[H1571]] unto [[H413]] Rachel, [[H7354]] and he loved [[H157]] also [[H1571]] Rachel [[H7354]] more than Leah, [[H3812]] and served [[H5647]] with [[H5973]] him yet [[H5750]] seven [[H7651]] other [[H312]] years. [[H8141]]

### 31
And when the Lord [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Leah [[H3812]] hated, [[H8130]] he opened [[H6605]] her womb: [[H7358]] but Rachel [[H7354]] barren. [[H6135]]

### 32
And Leah [[H3812]] conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Reuben: [[H7205]] for [[H3588]] she said, [[H559]] Surely [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath looked [[H7200]] upon my affliction; [[H6040]] now [[H6258]] therefore [[H3588]] my husband [[H376]] will love [[H157]] me. [[H157]]

### 33
And she conceived [[H2029]] again, [[H5750]] and bare [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] I [[H595]] hated, [[H8130]] he hath therefore given [[H5414]] me [[H853]] this [[H2088]] also: [[H1571]] and she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Simeon. [[H8095]]

### 34
And she conceived [[H2029]] again, [[H5750]] and bare [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and said, [[H559]] Now [[H6258]] this time [[H6471]] will my husband [[H376]] be joined [[H3867]] unto [[H413]] me, because [[H3588]] I have born [[H3205]] him three [[H7969]] sons: [[H1121]] therefore [[H3651]] was his name [[H8034]] called [[H7121]] Levi. [[H3878]]

### 35
And she conceived [[H2029]] again, [[H5750]] and bare [[H3205]] a son: [[H1121]] and she said, [[H559]] Now [[H6471]] will I praise [[H3034]] the Lord: [[H3068]] therefore [[H3651]] she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Judah; [[H3063]] and left [[H5975]] bearing. [[H3205]]
