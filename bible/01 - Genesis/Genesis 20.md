### 1
And Abraham [[H85]] journeyed [[H5265]] from thence [[H8033]] toward the south [[H5045]] country, [[H776]] and dwelled [[H3427]] between [[H996]] Kadesh [[H6946]] and Shur, [[H7793]] and sojourned [[H1481]] in Gerar. [[H1642]]

### 2
And Abraham [[H85]] said [[H559]] of [[H413]] Sarah [[H8283]] his wife, [[H802]] She [[H1931]] my sister: [[H269]] and Abimelech [[H40]] king [[H4428]] of Gerar [[H1642]] sent, [[H7971]] and took [[H3947]] Sarah. [[H8283]]

### 3
But God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Abimelech [[H40]] in a dream [[H2472]] by night, [[H3915]] and said [[H559]] to him, Behold, [[H2009]] thou a dead man, [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] the woman [[H802]] which [[H834]] thou hast taken; [[H3947]] for she [[H1931]] a man's [[H1167]] wife. [[H1166]]

### 4
But Abimelech [[H40]] had not [[H3808]] come near [[H7126]] her: and he said, [[H559]] Lord, [[H136]] wilt thou slay [[H2026]] also [[H1571]] a righteous [[H6662]] nation? [[H1471]]

### 5
Said [[H559]] he [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] unto me, She [[H1931]] my sister? [[H269]] and she, [[H1931]] even [[H1571]] she herself [[H1931]] said, [[H559]] He [[H1931]] my brother: [[H251]] in the integrity [[H8537]] of my heart [[H3824]] and innocency [[H5356]] of my hands [[H3709]] have I done [[H6213]] this. [[H2063]]

### 6
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him in a dream, [[H2472]] Yea, [[H1571]] I [[H595]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou didst [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] in the integrity [[H8537]] of thy heart; [[H3824]] for I [[H595]] also [[H1571]] withheld [[H2820]] thee from sinning [[H2398]] against me: therefore [[H3651]] suffered [[H5414]] I thee not [[H3808]] to touch [[H5060]] her. [[H413]]

### 7
Now [[H6258]] therefore restore [[H7725]] the man [[H376]] wife; [[H802]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] a prophet, [[H5030]] and he shall pray [[H6419]] for thee, [[H1157]] and thou shalt live: [[H2421]] and if [[H518]] thou restore [[H7725]] not, [[H369]] know [[H3045]] thou that [[H3588]] thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die, [[H4191]] thou, [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thine. [[H0]]

### 8
Therefore Abimelech [[H40]] rose early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and called [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5650]] and told [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] in their ears: [[H241]] and the men [[H376]] were sore [[H3966]] afraid. [[H3372]]

### 9
Then Abimelech [[H40]] called [[H7121]] Abraham, [[H85]] and said [[H559]] unto him, What [[H4100]] hast thou done [[H6213]] unto us? and what [[H4100]] have I offended [[H2398]] thee, that [[H3588]] thou hast brought [[H935]] on [[H5921]] me and on [[H5921]] my kingdom [[H4467]] a great [[H1419]] sin? [[H2401]] thou hast done [[H6213]] deeds [[H4639]] unto me that [[H834]] ought not [[H3808]] to be done. [[H6213]]

### 10
And Abimelech [[H40]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] What [[H4100]] sawest thou, [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] thou hast done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing? [[H1697]]

### 11
And Abraham [[H85]] said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] I thought, [[H559]] Surely [[H7535]] the fear [[H3374]] of God [[H430]] not [[H369]] in this [[H2088]] place; [[H4725]] and they will slay me [[H2026]] for [[H5921]] my wife's [[H802]] sake. [[H1697]]

### 12
And yet [[H1571]] indeed [[H546]] my sister; [[H269]] she [[H1931]] the daughter [[H1323]] of my father, [[H1]] but [[H389]] not [[H3808]] the daughter [[H1323]] of my mother; [[H517]] and she became [[H1961]] my wife. [[H802]]

### 13
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] God [[H430]] caused me to wander [[H8582]] from my father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] that I said [[H559]] unto her, This [[H2088]] thy kindness [[H2617]] which [[H834]] thou shalt shew [[H6213]] unto me; at [[H413]] every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] whither [[H8033]] we shall come, [[H935]] say [[H559]] of me, He [[H1931]] my brother. [[H251]]

### 14
And Abimelech [[H40]] took [[H3947]] sheep, [[H6629]] and oxen, [[H1241]] and menservants, [[H5650]] and womenservants, [[H8198]] and gave [[H5414]] unto Abraham, [[H85]] and restored [[H7725]]  him [[H853]] Sarah [[H8283]] his wife. [[H802]]

### 15
And Abimelech [[H40]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] my land [[H776]] before thee: [[H6440]] dwell [[H3427]] where it pleaseth [[H2896]] thee. [[H5869]]

### 16
And unto Sarah [[H8283]] he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have given [[H5414]] thy brother [[H251]] a thousand [[H505]] of silver: [[H3701]] behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] to thee a covering [[H3682]] of the eyes, [[H5869]] unto all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] thee, and with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] thus she was reproved. [[H3198]]

### 17
So Abraham [[H85]] prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] God: [[H430]] and God [[H430]] healed [[H7495]] Abimelech, [[H40]] and his wife, [[H802]] and his maidservants; [[H519]] and they bare [[H3205]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had fast [[H6113]] closed up [[H6113]] all [[H3605]] the wombs [[H7358]] of the house [[H1004]] of Abimelech, [[H40]] because [[H1697]] of Sarah [[H8283]] Abraham's [[H85]] wife. [[H802]]
