### 1
Now Sarai [[H8297]] Abram's [[H87]] wife [[H802]] bare [[H3205]] him no children: [[H3808]] and she had an handmaid, [[H8198]] an Egyptian, [[H4713]] whose name [[H8034]] Hagar. [[H1904]]

### 2
And Sarai [[H8297]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath restrained me [[H6113]] from bearing: [[H3205]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] my maid; [[H8198]] it may be that [[H194]] I may obtain children [[H1129]] by her. [[H4480]] And Abram [[H87]] hearkened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of Sarai. [[H8297]]

### 3
And Sarai [[H8297]] Abram's [[H87]] wife [[H802]] took [[H3947]] Hagar [[H1904]] her maid [[H8198]] the Egyptian, [[H4713]] after [[H7093]] Abram [[H87]] had dwelt [[H3427]] ten [[H6235]] years [[H8141]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and gave [[H5414]] her to her husband [[H582]] Abram [[H87]] to be his wife. [[H802]]

### 4
And he went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Hagar, [[H1904]] and she conceived: [[H2029]] and when she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she had conceived, [[H2029]] her mistress [[H1404]] was despised [[H7043]] in her eyes. [[H5869]]

### 5
And Sarai [[H8297]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] My wrong [[H2555]] upon [[H5921]] thee: I [[H595]] have given [[H5414]] my maid [[H8198]] into thy bosom; [[H2436]] and when she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she had conceived, [[H2029]] I was despised [[H7043]] in her eyes: [[H5869]] the Lord [[H3068]] judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] me and thee. [[H996]]

### 6
But Abram [[H87]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Sarai, [[H8297]] Behold, [[H2009]] thy maid [[H8198]] in thy hand; [[H3027]] do [[H6213]] to her as it pleaseth [[H5869]] thee. [[H2896]] And when Sarai [[H8297]] dealt hardly with her, [[H6031]] she fled [[H1272]] from her face. [[H6440]]

### 7
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] found her [[H4672]] by [[H5921]] a fountain [[H5869]] of water [[H4325]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] by [[H5921]] the fountain [[H5869]] in the way [[H1870]] to Shur. [[H7793]]

### 8
And he said, [[H559]] Hagar, [[H1904]] Sarai's [[H8297]] maid, [[H8198]] whence [[H335]] camest thou? [[H935]] and whither [[H575]] wilt thou go? [[H1980]] And she said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] flee [[H1272]] from the face [[H6440]] of my mistress [[H1404]] Sarai. [[H8297]]

### 9
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto her, Return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] thy mistress, [[H1404]] and submit thyself [[H6031]] under [[H8478]] her hands. [[H3027]]

### 10
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto her, I will multiply [[H7235]] thy seed [[H2233]] exceedingly, [[H7235]] that it shall not [[H3808]] be numbered [[H5608]] for multitude. [[H7230]]

### 11
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto her, Behold, [[H2009]] thou with child, [[H2030]] and shalt bear [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and shalt call [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Ishmael; [[H3458]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath heard [[H8085]] thy affliction. [[H6040]]

### 12
And he [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] a wild [[H6501]] man; [[H120]] his hand [[H3027]] against every man, [[H3605]] and every man's [[H3605]] hand [[H3027]] against him; and he shall dwell [[H7931]] in the presence [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] his brethren. [[H251]]

### 13
And she called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] her, Thou [[H859]] God [[H410]] seest [[H7210]] me: for [[H3588]] she said, [[H559]] Have I also [[H1571]] here [[H1988]] looked [[H7200]] after [[H310]] him that seeth [[H7200]] me? [[H7200]]

### 14
Wherefore [[H3651]] the well [[H875]] was called [[H7121]] Beer-lahai-roi; [[H883]] behold, [[H2009]] between [[H996]] Kadesh [[H6946]] and Bered. [[H1260]]

### 15
And Hagar [[H1904]] bare [[H3205]] Abram [[H87]] a son: [[H1121]] and Abram [[H87]] called [[H7121]] his son's [[H1121]] name, [[H8034]] which [[H834]] Hagar [[H1904]] bare, [[H3205]] Ishmael. [[H3458]]

### 16
And Abram [[H87]] fourscore [[H8084]] and six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] when Hagar [[H1904]] bare [[H3205]] Ishmael [[H3458]] to Abram. [[H87]]
