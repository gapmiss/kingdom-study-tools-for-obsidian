### 1
And Isaac [[H3327]] called [[H7121]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and blessed [[H1288]] him, and charged [[H6680]] him, and said [[H559]] unto him, Thou shalt not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 2
Arise, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] to Padan-aram, [[H6307]] to the house [[H1004]] of Bethuel [[H1328]] thy mother's [[H517]] father; [[H1]] and take [[H3947]] thee a wife [[H802]] from thence [[H8033]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Laban [[H3837]] thy mother's [[H517]] brother. [[H251]]

### 3
And God [[H410]] Almighty [[H7706]] bless [[H1288]] thee, and make thee fruitful, [[H6509]] and multiply [[H7235]] thee, that thou mayest be [[H1961]] a multitude [[H6951]] of people; [[H5971]]

### 4
And give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] the blessing [[H1293]] of Abraham, [[H85]] to thee, and to thy seed [[H2233]] with [[H854]] thee; that thou mayest inherit [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] wherein thou art a stranger, [[H4033]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] unto Abraham. [[H85]]

### 5
And Isaac [[H3327]] sent away [[H7971]] Jacob: [[H3290]] and he went [[H1980]] to Padan-aram [[H6307]] unto [[H413]] Laban, [[H3837]] son [[H1121]] of Bethuel [[H1328]] the Syrian, [[H761]] the brother [[H251]] of Rebekah, [[H7259]] Jacob's [[H3290]] and Esau's [[H6215]] mother. [[H517]]

### 6
When Esau [[H6215]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Isaac [[H3327]] had blessed [[H1288]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and sent him away [[H7971]] to Padan-aram, [[H6307]] to take [[H3947]] him a wife [[H802]] from thence; [[H8033]] and that as he blessed [[H1288]] him he gave him a charge, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Canaan; [[H3667]]

### 7
And that Jacob [[H3290]] obeyed [[H8085]] his father [[H1]] and his mother, [[H517]] and was gone [[H1980]] to Padan-aram; [[H6307]]

### 8
And Esau [[H6215]] seeing [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Canaan [[H3667]] pleased [[H5869]] not [[H7451]] Isaac [[H3327]] his father; [[H1]]

### 9
Then went [[H1980]] Esau [[H6215]] unto [[H413]] Ishmael, [[H3458]] and took [[H3947]] unto [[H5921]] the wives [[H802]]  which he had [[H853]] Mahalath [[H4258]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Ishmael [[H3458]] Abraham's [[H85]] son, [[H1121]] the sister [[H269]] of Nebajoth, [[H5032]] to be his wife. [[H802]]

### 10
And Jacob [[H3290]] went out [[H3318]] from Beer-sheba, [[H884]] and went [[H1980]] toward Haran. [[H2771]]

### 11
And he lighted [[H6293]] upon a certain place, [[H4725]] and tarried there all night, [[H3885]] because [[H3588]] the sun [[H8121]] was set; [[H935]] and he took [[H3947]] of the stones [[H68]] of that place, [[H4725]] and put [[H7760]] his pillows, [[H4763]] and lay down in that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] to sleep. [[H7901]]

### 12
And he dreamed, [[H2492]] and behold [[H2009]] a ladder [[H5551]] set up [[H5324]] on the earth, [[H776]] and the top [[H7218]] of it reached [[H5060]] to heaven: [[H8064]] and behold [[H2009]] the angels [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] ascending [[H5927]] and descending [[H3381]] on it. [[H3381]]

### 13
And, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] stood [[H5324]] above [[H5921]] it, and said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Abraham [[H85]] thy father, [[H1]] and the God [[H430]] of Isaac: [[H3327]] the land [[H776]] whereon [[H5921]] thou [[H859]] liest, [[H7901]] to thee will I give it, [[H5414]] and to thy seed; [[H2233]]

### 14
And thy seed [[H2233]] shall be [[H1961]] as the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] and thou shalt spread abroad [[H6555]] to the west, [[H3220]] and to the east, [[H6924]] and to the north, [[H6828]] and to the south: [[H5045]] and in thee and in thy seed [[H2233]] shall all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the earth [[H127]] be blessed. [[H1288]]

### 15
And, behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] with [[H5973]] thee, and will keep [[H8104]] thee in all [[H3605]] whither [[H834]] thou goest, [[H1980]] and will bring thee again [[H7725]] into [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land; [[H127]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] leave [[H5800]] thee, until [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] which [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] to thee of. [[H1696]]

### 16
And Jacob [[H3290]] awaked [[H3364]] out of his sleep, [[H8142]] and he said, [[H559]] Surely [[H403]] the Lord [[H3068]] is [[H3426]] in this [[H2088]] place; [[H4725]] and I [[H595]] knew [[H3045]] not. [[H3808]]

### 17
And he was afraid, [[H3372]] and said, [[H559]] How [[H4100]] dreadful [[H3372]] this [[H2088]] place! [[H4725]] this [[H2088]] none [[H369]] other but [[H518]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and this [[H2088]] the gate [[H8179]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 18
And Jacob [[H3290]] rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and took [[H3947]] the stone [[H68]] that [[H834]] he had put [[H7760]] his pillows, [[H4763]] and set it up [[H7760]] a pillar, [[H4676]] and poured [[H3332]] oil [[H8081]] upon [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of it. [[H7218]]

### 19
And he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Beth-el: [[H1008]] but [[H199]] the name [[H8034]] of that city [[H5892]] Luz [[H3870]] at the first. [[H7223]]

### 20
And Jacob [[H3290]] vowed [[H5087]] a vow, [[H5088]] saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] God [[H430]] will be [[H1961]] with me, and will keep me [[H8104]] in this [[H2088]] way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] go, [[H1980]] and will give [[H5414]] me bread [[H3899]] to eat, [[H398]] and raiment [[H899]] to put on, [[H3847]]

### 21
So that I come again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] my father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] in peace; [[H7965]] then shall the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] my God: [[H430]]

### 22
And this [[H2063]] stone, [[H68]] which [[H834]] I have set [[H7760]] a pillar, [[H4676]] shall be [[H1961]] God's [[H430]] house: [[H1004]] and of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou shalt give [[H5414]] me I will surely [[H6237]] give the tenth [[H6237]] unto thee. [[H6237]]
