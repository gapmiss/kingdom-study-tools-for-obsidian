### 1
And the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] was [[H1961]] of one [[H259]] language, [[H8193]] and of one [[H259]] speech. [[H1697]]

### 2
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as they journeyed [[H5265]] from the east, [[H6924]] that they found [[H4672]] a plain [[H1237]] in the land [[H776]] of Shinar; [[H8152]] and they dwelt [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]]

### 3
And they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H7453]] Go to, [[H3051]] let us make [[H3835]] brick, [[H3843]] and burn [[H8313]] them throughly. [[H8316]] And they had [[H1961]] brick [[H3843]] for stone, [[H68]] and slime [[H2564]] had [[H1961]] they for morter. [[H2563]]

### 4
And they said, [[H559]] Go to, [[H3051]] let us build [[H1129]] us a city [[H5892]] and a tower, [[H4026]] whose top [[H7218]] unto heaven; [[H8064]] and let us make [[H6213]] us a name, [[H8034]] lest [[H6435]] we be scattered abroad [[H6327]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] came down [[H3381]] to see [[H7200]] the city [[H5892]] and the tower, [[H4026]] which [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] builded. [[H1129]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] the people [[H5971]] one, [[H259]] and they have all [[H3605]] one [[H259]] language; [[H8193]] and this [[H2088]] they begin [[H2490]] to do: [[H6213]] and now [[H6258]] nothing [[H3808]] will be restrained [[H1219]] from which [[H834]] them, [[H2161]] they have imagined [[H2161]] to do. [[H6213]]

### 7
Go to, [[H3051]] let us go down, [[H3381]] and there [[H8033]] confound [[H1101]] their language, [[H8193]] that [[H834]] they may not [[H3808]] understand [[H8085]] one [[H582]] another's [[H7453]] speech. [[H8193]]

### 8
So the Lord [[H3068]] scattered them abroad [[H6327]] from thence [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] and they left off [[H2308]] to build [[H1129]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] is the name [[H8034]] of it called [[H7121]] Babel; [[H894]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] did there [[H8033]] confound [[H1101]] the language [[H8193]] of all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] and from thence [[H8033]] the Lord [[H3068]] did scatter them [[H6327]] abroad upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
These [[H428]] the generations [[H8435]] of Shem: [[H8035]] Shem [[H8035]] an hundred [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] and begat [[H3205]] Arphaxad [[H775]] two years [[H8141]] after [[H310]] the flood: [[H3999]]

### 11
And Shem [[H8035]] lived [[H2421]] after [[H310]] he begat [[H3205]] Arphaxad [[H775]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] years, [[H8141]] and begat [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

### 12
And Arphaxad [[H775]] lived [[H2421]] five [[H2568]] and thirty [[H7970]] years, [[H8141]] and begat [[H3205]] Salah: [[H7974]]

### 13
And Arphaxad [[H775]] lived [[H2421]] after [[H310]] he begat [[H3205]] Salah [[H7974]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] and begat [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

### 16

### 17
And Eber [[H5677]] lived [[H2421]] after [[H310]] he begat [[H3205]] Peleg [[H6389]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and thirty [[H7970]] years, [[H8141]] and begat [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

### 18

### 21
And Reu [[H7466]] lived [[H2421]] after [[H310]] he begat [[H3205]] Serug [[H8286]] two hundred [[H3967]] and seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]] and begat [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

### 22
And Serug [[H8286]] lived [[H2421]] thirty [[H7970]] years, [[H8141]] and begat [[H3205]] Nahor: [[H5152]]

### 23
And Serug [[H8286]] lived [[H2421]] after [[H310]] he begat [[H3205]] Nahor [[H5152]] two hundred [[H3967]] years, [[H8141]] and begat [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

### 24
