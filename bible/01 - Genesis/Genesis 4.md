### 1
And Adam [[H120]] knew [[H3045]] Eve [[H2332]] his wife; [[H802]] and she conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] Cain, [[H7014]] and said, [[H559]] I have gotten [[H7069]] a man [[H376]] from [[H854]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
And she again [[H3254]] bare [[H3205]] his brother [[H251]] Abel. [[H1893]] And Abel [[H1893]] was [[H1961]] a keeper [[H7462]] of sheep, [[H6629]] but Cain [[H7014]] was [[H1961]] a tiller [[H5647]] of the ground. [[H127]]

### 3
And in process [[H7093]] of time [[H3117]] it came to pass, [[H1961]] that Cain [[H7014]] brought [[H935]] of the fruit [[H6529]] of the ground [[H127]] an offering [[H4503]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
And Abel, [[H1893]] he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] brought [[H935]] of the firstlings [[H1062]] of his flock [[H6629]] and of the fat [[H2459]] thereof. And the Lord [[H3068]] had respect [[H8159]] unto [[H413]] Abel [[H1893]] and to [[H413]] his offering: [[H4503]]

### 5
But unto [[H413]] Cain [[H7014]] and to [[H413]] his offering [[H4503]] he had not respect. [[H8159]] And Cain [[H7014]] was very [[H3966]] wroth, [[H2734]] and his countenance [[H6440]] fell. [[H5307]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Cain, [[H7014]] Why [[H4100]] art thou wroth? [[H2734]] and why [[H4100]] is thy countenance [[H6440]] fallen? [[H5307]]

### 7
If [[H518]] thou doest well, [[H3190]] shalt thou not [[H3808]] be accepted? [[H7613]] and if [[H518]] thou doest not [[H3808]] well, [[H3190]] sin [[H2403]] lieth [[H7257]] at the door. [[H6607]] And unto thee [[H413]] his desire, [[H8669]] and thou [[H859]] shalt rule [[H4910]] over him. [[H0]]

### 8
And Cain [[H7014]] talked [[H559]] with [[H413]] Abel [[H1893]] his brother: [[H251]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they were [[H1961]] in the field, [[H7704]] that Cain [[H7014]] rose up [[H6965]] against [[H413]] Abel [[H1893]] his brother, [[H251]] and slew him. [[H2026]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Cain, [[H7014]] Where [[H335]] Abel [[H1893]] thy brother? [[H251]] And he said, [[H559]] I know [[H3045]] not: [[H3808]] I [[H595]] my brother's [[H251]] keeper? [[H8104]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] hast thou done? [[H6213]] the voice [[H6963]] of thy brother's [[H251]] blood [[H1818]] crieth [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] me from [[H4480]] the ground. [[H127]]

### 11
And now [[H6258]] thou [[H859]] cursed [[H779]] from [[H4480]] the earth, [[H127]] which [[H834]] hath opened [[H6475]] her mouth [[H6310]] to receive [[H3947]] thy brother's [[H251]] blood [[H1818]] from thy hand; [[H3027]]

### 12
When [[H3588]] thou tillest [[H5647]] the ground, [[H127]] it shall not [[H3808]] henceforth [[H3254]] yield [[H5414]] unto thee her strength; [[H3581]] a fugitive [[H5128]] and a vagabond [[H5110]] shalt thou be [[H1961]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 13
And Cain [[H7014]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] My punishment [[H5771]] greater [[H1419]] than I can bear. [[H5375]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2005]] thou hast driven me out [[H1644]] this day [[H3117]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth; [[H127]] and from thy face [[H6440]] shall I be hid; [[H5641]] and I shall be [[H1961]] a fugitive [[H5128]] and a vagabond [[H5110]] in the earth; [[H776]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] every one [[H3605]] that findeth me [[H4672]] shall slay me. [[H2026]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto him, Therefore [[H3651]] whosoever [[H3605]] slayeth [[H2026]] Cain, [[H7014]] vengeance shall be taken [[H5358]] on him sevenfold. [[H7659]] And the Lord [[H3068]] set [[H7760]] a mark [[H226]] upon Cain, [[H7014]] lest [[H1115]] any [[H3605]] finding [[H4672]] him should kill [[H5221]] him. [[H5221]]

### 16
And Cain [[H7014]] went out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Nod, [[H5113]] on the east [[H6926]] of Eden. [[H5731]]

### 17
And Cain [[H7014]] knew [[H3045]] his wife; [[H802]] and she conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] Enoch: [[H2585]] and he builded [[H1129]] a city, [[H5892]] and called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the city, [[H5892]] after the name [[H8034]] of his son, [[H1121]] Enoch. [[H2585]]

### 18
And unto Enoch [[H2585]] was born [[H3205]] Irad: [[H5897]] and Irad [[H5897]] begat [[H3205]] Mehujael: [[H4232]] and Mehujael [[H4232]] begat [[H3205]] Methusael: [[H4967]] and Methusael [[H4967]] begat [[H3205]] Lamech. [[H3929]]

### 19
And Lamech [[H3929]] took [[H3947]] unto him two [[H8147]] wives: [[H802]] the name [[H8034]] of the one [[H259]] Adah, [[H5711]] and the name [[H8034]] of the other [[H8145]] Zillah. [[H6741]]

### 20
And Adah [[H5711]] bare [[H3205]] Jabal: [[H2989]] he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] the father [[H1]] of such as dwell [[H3427]] in tents, [[H168]] and cattle. [[H4735]]

### 21
And his brother's [[H251]] name [[H8034]] Jubal: [[H3106]] he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] the father [[H1]] of all [[H3605]] such as handle [[H8610]] the harp [[H3658]] and organ. [[H5748]]

### 22
And Zillah, [[H6741]] she [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] bare [[H3205]] Tubal-cain, [[H8423]] an instructer [[H3913]] of every [[H3605]] artificer [[H2794]] in brass [[H5178]] and iron: [[H1270]] and the sister [[H269]] of Tubal-cain [[H8423]] Naamah. [[H5279]]

### 23
And Lamech [[H3929]] said [[H559]] unto his wives, [[H802]] Adah [[H5711]] and Zillah, [[H6741]] Hear [[H8085]] my voice; [[H6963]] ye wives [[H802]] of Lamech, [[H3929]] hearken [[H238]] unto my speech: [[H565]] for [[H3588]] I have slain [[H2026]] a man [[H582]] to my wounding, [[H6482]] and a young man [[H3206]] to my hurt. [[H2250]]

### 24
If [[H3588]] Cain [[H7014]] shall be avenged [[H5358]] sevenfold, [[H7659]] truly Lamech [[H3929]] seventy [[H7657]] and sevenfold. [[H7651]]

### 25
And Adam [[H121]] knew [[H3045]] his wife [[H802]] again; [[H5750]] and she bare [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and called [[H7121]]  his [[H853]] name [[H8034]] Seth: [[H8352]] For [[H3588]] God, [[H430]] hath appointed [[H7896]] me another [[H312]] seed [[H2233]] instead of [[H8478]] Abel, [[H1893]] whom [[H3588]] Cain [[H7014]] slew. [[H2026]]

### 26
And to Seth, [[H8352]] to him [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] there was born [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and he called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Enos: [[H583]] then [[H227]] began men [[H2490]] to call [[H7121]] upon the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
