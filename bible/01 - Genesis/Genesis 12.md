### 1
Now the Lord [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] Get thee out [[H1980]] of thy country, [[H776]] and from thy kindred, [[H4138]] and from thy father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] unto [[H413]] a land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I will shew [[H7200]] thee: [[H7200]]

### 2
And I will make thee [[H6213]] of a great [[H1419]] nation, [[H1471]] and I will bless [[H1288]] thee, and make thy name [[H8034]] great; [[H1431]] and thou shalt be [[H1961]] a blessing: [[H1293]]

### 3
And I will bless [[H1288]] them that bless [[H1288]] thee, and curse [[H779]] him that curseth [[H7043]] thee: and in thee shall all [[H3605]] families [[H4940]] of the earth [[H127]] be blessed. [[H1288]]

### 4
So Abram [[H87]] departed, [[H1980]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him; and Lot [[H3876]] went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] him: and Abram [[H87]] seventy [[H7657]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he departed [[H3318]] out of Haran. [[H2771]]

### 5
And Abram [[H87]] took [[H3947]] Sarai [[H8297]] his wife, [[H802]] and Lot [[H3876]] his brother's [[H251]] son, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] their substance [[H7399]] that [[H834]] they had gathered, [[H7408]] and the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] they had gotten [[H6213]] in Haran; [[H2771]] and they went forth [[H3318]] to go [[H1980]] into the land [[H776]] of Canaan; [[H3667]] and into the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] they came. [[H935]]

### 6
And Abram [[H87]] passed through [[H5674]] the land [[H776]] unto [[H5704]] the place [[H4725]] of Sichem, [[H7927]] unto [[H5704]] the plain [[H436]] of Moreh. [[H4176]] And the Canaanite [[H3669]] then [[H227]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] and said, [[H559]] Unto thy seed [[H2233]] will I give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] land: [[H776]] and there [[H8033]] builded [[H1129]] he an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] who appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 8
And he removed [[H6275]] from thence [[H8033]] unto a mountain [[H2022]] on the east [[H6924]] of Beth-el, [[H1008]] and pitched [[H5186]] his tent, [[H168]] Beth-el [[H1008]] on the west, [[H3220]] and Hai [[H5857]] on the east: [[H6924]] and there [[H8033]] he builded [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and called [[H7121]] upon the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And Abram [[H87]] journeyed, [[H5265]] going on [[H1980]] still [[H5265]] toward the south. [[H5045]]

### 10
And there was [[H1961]] a famine [[H7458]] in the land: [[H776]] and Abram [[H87]] went down [[H3381]] into Egypt [[H4714]] to sojourn [[H1481]] there; [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] grievous [[H3515]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] he was come near [[H7126]] to enter [[H935]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] that he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Sarai [[H8297]] his wife, [[H802]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a fair [[H3303]] woman [[H802]] to look upon: [[H4758]]

### 12
Therefore it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] shall see [[H7200]] thee, that they shall say, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] his wife: [[H802]] and they will kill [[H2026]] me, but they will save thee alive. [[H2421]]

### 13
Say, [[H559]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] thou [[H859]] my sister: [[H269]] that [[H4616]] it may be well [[H3190]] with me for thy sake; [[H5668]] and my soul [[H5315]] shall live [[H2421]] because of thee. [[H1558]]

### 14
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that, when Abram [[H87]] was come [[H935]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] beheld [[H7200]] the woman [[H802]] that [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] very [[H3966]] fair. [[H3303]]

### 15
The princes [[H8269]] also of Pharaoh [[H6547]] saw [[H7200]] her, and commended [[H1984]] her before [[H413]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] and the woman [[H802]] was taken [[H3947]] into Pharaoh's [[H6547]] house. [[H1004]]

### 16
And he entreated Abram [[H87]] well [[H3190]] for her sake: [[H5668]] and he had [[H1961]] sheep, [[H6629]] and oxen, [[H1241]] and he asses, [[H2543]] and menservants, [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H8198]] and she asses, [[H860]] and camels. [[H1581]]

### 17
And the Lord [[H3068]] plagued [[H5060]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his house [[H1004]] with great [[H1419]] plagues [[H5061]] because of [[H1697]] Sarai [[H8297]] Abram's [[H87]] wife. [[H802]]

### 18
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] called [[H7121]] Abram, [[H87]] and said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] thou hast done [[H6213]] unto me? why [[H4100]] didst thou not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] me that [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] thy wife? [[H802]]

### 19
Why [[H4100]] saidst thou, [[H559]] She [[H1931]] my sister? [[H269]] so I might have taken [[H3947]] her to me to wife: [[H802]] now therefore [[H6258]] behold [[H2009]] thy wife, [[H802]] take [[H3947]] and go thy way. [[H1980]]

### 20
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] commanded [[H6680]] men [[H376]] concerning [[H5921]] him: and they sent him away, [[H7971]] and his wife, [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had. [[H0]]
