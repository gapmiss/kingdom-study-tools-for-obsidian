And when Rachel [[H7354]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she bare [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] no children, [[H3808]] Rachel [[H7354]] envied [[H7065]] her sister; [[H269]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] Give [[H3051]] me children, [[H1121]] or [[H518]] else [[H369]] I [[H595]] die. [[H4191]]

### 2
And Jacob's [[H3290]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Rachel: [[H7354]] and he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] in God's [[H430]] stead, [[H8478]] who [[H834]] hath withheld [[H4513]] from [[H4480]] thee the fruit [[H6529]] of the womb? [[H990]]

### 3
And she said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] my maid [[H519]] Bilhah, [[H1090]] go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her; and she shall bear [[H3205]] upon [[H5921]] my knees, [[H1290]] that I [[H595]] may also [[H1571]] have children [[H1129]] by [[H4480]] her. [[H4480]]

### 4
And she gave [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] Bilhah [[H1090]] her handmaid [[H8198]] to wife: [[H802]] and Jacob [[H3290]] went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her. [[H413]]

### 5
And Bilhah [[H1090]] conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 6
And Rachel [[H7354]] said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] hath judged [[H1777]] me, and hath also [[H1571]] heard [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] and hath given [[H5414]] me a son: [[H1121]] therefore [[H3651]] called [[H7121]] she his name [[H8034]] Dan. [[H1835]]

### 7
And Bilhah [[H1090]] Rachel's [[H7354]] maid [[H8198]] conceived [[H2029]] again, [[H5750]] and bare [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] a second [[H8145]] son. [[H1121]]

### 8
And Rachel [[H7354]] said, [[H559]] With great [[H430]] wrestlings [[H5319]] have I wrestled [[H6617]] with [[H5973]] my sister, [[H269]] and [[H1571]] I have prevailed: [[H3201]] and she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Naphtali. [[H5321]]

### 9
When Leah [[H3812]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she had left [[H5975]] bearing, [[H3205]] she took [[H3947]] Zilpah [[H2153]] her maid, [[H8198]] and gave [[H5414]] her Jacob [[H3290]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 10
And Zilpah [[H2153]] Leah's [[H3812]] maid [[H8198]] bare [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 11
And Leah [[H3812]] said, [[H559]] A troop cometh: [[H1409]] and she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Gad. [[H1410]]

### 12
And Zilpah [[H2153]] Leah's [[H3812]] maid [[H8198]] bare [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] a second [[H8145]] son. [[H1121]]

### 13
And Leah [[H3812]] said, [[H559]] Happy [[H837]] am I, for [[H3588]] the daughters [[H1323]] will call me blessed: [[H833]] and she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Asher. [[H836]]

### 14
And Reuben [[H7205]] went in [[H1980]] the days [[H3117]] of wheat [[H2406]] harvest, [[H7105]] and found [[H4672]] mandrakes [[H1736]] in the field, [[H7704]] and brought [[H935]] them unto [[H413]] his mother [[H517]] Leah. [[H3812]] Then Rachel [[H7354]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Leah, [[H3812]] Give me, [[H5414]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] of thy son's [[H1121]] mandrakes. [[H1736]]

### 15
And she said [[H559]] unto her, a small matter [[H4592]] that thou hast taken [[H3947]] my husband? [[H582]] and wouldest thou take away [[H3947]] my son's [[H1121]] mandrakes [[H1736]] also? [[H1571]] And Rachel [[H7354]] said, [[H559]] Therefore [[H3651]] he shall lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] thee to night [[H3915]] for [[H8478]] thy son's [[H1121]] mandrakes. [[H1736]]

### 16
And Jacob [[H3290]] came [[H935]] out of [[H4480]] the field [[H7704]] in the evening, [[H6153]] and Leah [[H3812]] went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] him, and said, [[H559]] Thou must come in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me; for [[H3588]] surely [[H7936]] I have hired [[H7936]] thee with my son's [[H1121]] mandrakes. [[H1736]] And he lay [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] her that [[H1931]] night. [[H3915]]

### 17
And God [[H430]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] Leah, [[H3812]] and she conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] the fifth [[H2549]] son. [[H1121]]

### 18
And Leah [[H3812]] said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] me my hire, [[H7939]] because [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] my maiden [[H8198]] to my husband: [[H376]] and she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Issachar. [[H3485]]

### 19
And Leah [[H3812]] conceived [[H2029]] again, [[H5750]] and bare [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] the sixth [[H8345]] son. [[H1121]]

### 20
And Leah [[H3812]] said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] hath endued me [[H2064]] a good [[H2896]] dowry; [[H2065]] now [[H6471]] will my husband [[H376]] dwell with me, [[H2082]] because [[H3588]] I have born [[H3205]] him six [[H8337]] sons: [[H1121]] and she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Zebulun. [[H2074]]

### 21
And afterwards [[H310]] she bare [[H3205]] a daughter, [[H1323]] and called [[H7121]] her name [[H8034]] Dinah. [[H1783]]

### 22
And God [[H430]] remembered [[H2142]] Rachel, [[H7354]] and God [[H430]] hearkened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] her, and opened [[H6605]] her womb. [[H7358]]

### 23
And she conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] hath taken away [[H622]] my reproach: [[H2781]]

### 24
And she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Joseph; [[H3130]] and said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] shall add [[H3254]] to me another [[H312]] son. [[H1121]]

### 25
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Rachel [[H7354]] had born [[H3205]] Joseph, [[H3130]] that Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Laban, [[H3837]] Send me away, [[H7971]] that I may go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] mine own place, [[H4725]] and to my country. [[H776]]

### 26
Give [[H5414]] my wives [[H802]] and my children, [[H3206]] for whom [[H834]] I have served [[H5647]] thee, and let me go: [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] my service [[H5656]] which [[H834]] I have done [[H5647]] thee. [[H5647]]

### 27
And Laban [[H3837]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I pray thee, [[H4994]] if [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in thine eyes, [[H5869]] I have learned by experience [[H5172]] that the Lord [[H3068]] hath blessed [[H1288]] me for thy sake. [[H1558]]

### 28
And he said, [[H559]] Appoint [[H5344]] me thy wages, [[H7939]] and I will give [[H5414]]

### 29
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] how [[H834]] I have served [[H5647]] thee, and how [[H834]] thy cattle [[H4735]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] me. [[H854]]

### 30
For [[H3588]] little [[H4592]] which [[H834]] thou hadst [[H1961]] before I [[H6440]] and it is increased [[H6555]] unto a multitude; [[H7230]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath blessed [[H1288]] thee since my coming: [[H7272]] and now [[H6258]] when [[H4970]] shall I [[H595]] provide [[H6213]] for mine own house [[H1004]] also? [[H1571]]

### 31
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall I give thee? [[H5414]] And Jacob [[H3290]] said, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] me any thing: [[H3972]] if [[H518]] thou wilt do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] for me, I will again [[H7725]] feed [[H7462]] keep [[H8104]] thy flock: [[H6629]]

### 32
I will pass through [[H5674]] all [[H3605]] thy flock [[H6629]] to day, [[H3117]] removing [[H5493]] from thence [[H8033]] all [[H3605]] the speckled [[H5348]] and spotted [[H2921]] cattle, [[H7716]] and all [[H3605]] the brown [[H2345]] cattle [[H7716]] among the sheep, [[H3775]] and the spotted [[H2921]] and speckled [[H5348]] among the goats: [[H5795]] and shall be [[H1961]] my hire. [[H7939]]

### 33
So shall my righteousness [[H6666]] answer [[H6030]] for me in time [[H3117]] to come, [[H4279]] when [[H3588]] it shall come [[H935]] for [[H5921]] my hire [[H7939]] before thy face: [[H6440]] every one [[H3605]] that [[H834]] not [[H369]] speckled [[H5348]] and spotted [[H2921]] among the goats, [[H5795]] and brown [[H2345]] among the sheep, [[H3775]] that [[H1931]] shall be counted stolen [[H1589]] with [[H854]] me. [[H854]]

### 34
And Laban [[H3837]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I would [[H3863]] it might be [[H1961]] according to thy word. [[H1697]]

### 35
And he removed [[H5493]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the he goats [[H8495]] that were ringstraked [[H6124]] and spotted, [[H2921]] and all [[H3605]] the she goats [[H5795]] that were speckled [[H5348]] and spotted, [[H2921]] every one [[H3605]] that [[H834]] had white [[H3836]] in it, and all [[H3605]] the brown [[H2345]] among the sheep, [[H3775]] and gave [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of his sons. [[H1121]]

### 36
And he set [[H7760]] three [[H7969]] days' [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] betwixt [[H996]] himself and Jacob: [[H3290]] and Jacob [[H3290]] fed [[H7462]] the rest [[H3498]] of Laban's [[H3837]] flocks. [[H6629]]

### 37
And Jacob [[H3290]] took [[H3947]] him rods [[H4731]] of green [[H3892]] poplar, [[H3839]] and of the hazel [[H3869]] and chesnut tree; [[H6196]] and pilled [[H6478]] white [[H3836]] strakes [[H6479]] in them, [[H2004]] and made the white [[H3836]] appear [[H4286]] which [[H834]] in [[H5921]] the rods. [[H4731]]

### 38
And he set [[H3322]] the rods [[H4731]] which [[H834]] he had pilled [[H6478]] before [[H5227]] the flocks [[H6629]] in the gutters [[H7298]] in the watering [[H4325]] troughs [[H8268]] when [[H834]] the flocks [[H6629]] came [[H935]] to drink, [[H8354]] that they should conceive [[H3179]] when they came [[H935]] to drink. [[H8354]]

### 39
And the flocks [[H6629]] conceived [[H3179]] before [[H413]] the rods, [[H4731]] and brought forth [[H3205]] cattle [[H6629]] ringstraked, [[H6124]] speckled, [[H5348]] and spotted. [[H2921]]

### 40
And Jacob [[H3290]] did separate [[H6504]] the lambs, [[H3775]] and set [[H5414]] the faces [[H6440]] of the flocks [[H6629]] toward [[H413]] the ringstraked, [[H6124]] and all [[H3605]] the brown [[H2345]] in the flock [[H6629]] of Laban; [[H3837]] and he put [[H7896]] his own flocks [[H5739]] by themselves, [[H905]] and put [[H7896]] them not [[H3808]] unto [[H5921]] Laban's [[H3837]] cattle. [[H6629]]

### 41
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] whensoever [[H3605]] the stronger [[H7194]] cattle [[H6629]] did conceive, [[H3179]] that Jacob [[H3290]] laid [[H7760]] the rods [[H4731]] before the eyes [[H5869]] of the cattle [[H6629]] in the gutters, [[H7298]] that they might conceive [[H3179]] among the rods. [[H4731]]

### 42
But when the cattle [[H6629]] were feeble, [[H5848]] he put in: [[H7760]] not [[H3808]] so the feebler [[H5848]] were [[H1961]] Laban's, [[H3837]] and the stronger [[H7194]] Jacob's. [[H3290]]

### 43
And the man [[H376]] increased [[H6555]] exceedingly, [[H3966]] and had [[H1961]] much [[H7227]] cattle, [[H6629]] and maidservants, [[H8198]] and menservants, [[H5650]] and camels, [[H1581]] and asses. [[H2543]]
