### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] that told [[H559]] Joseph, [[H3130]] Behold, [[H2009]] thy father [[H1]] sick: [[H2470]] and he took [[H3947]] with [[H5973]]  him [[H853]] his two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] Manasseh [[H4519]] and Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 2
And told [[H5046]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] thy son [[H1121]] Joseph [[H3130]] cometh [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee: and Israel [[H3478]] strengthened himself, [[H2388]] and sat [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the bed. [[H4296]]

### 3
And Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] God [[H410]] Almighty [[H7706]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] me at Luz [[H3870]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and blessed [[H1288]] me, [[H1288]]

### 4
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Behold, [[H2005]] I will make thee fruitful, [[H6509]] and multiply [[H7235]] thee, and I will make [[H5414]] of thee a multitude [[H6951]] of people; [[H5971]] and will give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to thy seed [[H2233]] after thee [[H310]] an everlasting [[H5769]] possession. [[H272]]

### 5
And now [[H6258]] thy two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] which were born [[H3205]] unto thee in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] before [[H5704]] I came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee into Egypt, [[H4714]] mine; as Reuben [[H7205]] and Simeon, [[H8095]] they shall be [[H1961]] mine. [[H1961]]

### 6
And thy issue, [[H4138]] which [[H834]] thou begettest [[H3205]] after [[H310]] them, shall be [[H1961]] thine, shall be called [[H7121]] after [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of their brethren [[H251]] in their inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 7
And as for me, [[H589]] when I came [[H935]] from Padan, [[H6307]] Rachel [[H7354]] died [[H4191]] by [[H5921]] me in the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] in the way, [[H1870]] when yet [[H5750]] but a little [[H3530]] way [[H776]] to come [[H935]] unto Ephrath: [[H672]] and I buried her [[H6912]] there [[H8033]] in the way [[H1870]] of Ephrath; [[H672]] the same [[H1931]] Bethlehem. [[H1035]]

### 8
And Israel [[H3478]] beheld [[H7200]] Joseph's [[H3130]] sons, [[H1121]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] these? [[H428]]

### 9
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] They [[H1992]] my sons, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] me in this [[H2088]] And he said, [[H559]] Bring them, [[H3947]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] unto [[H413]] me, and I will bless [[H1288]] them. [[H1288]]

### 10
Now the eyes [[H5869]] of Israel [[H3478]] were dim [[H3513]] for age, [[H2207]] he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] see. [[H7200]] And he brought them near [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] him; and he kissed [[H5401]] them, and embraced [[H2263]] them. [[H2263]]

### 11
And Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] I had not [[H3808]] thought [[H6419]] to see [[H7200]] thy face: [[H6440]] and, lo, [[H2009]] God [[H430]] hath shewed [[H7200]] me also [[H1571]] thy seed. [[H2233]]

### 12
And Joseph [[H3130]] brought them out [[H3318]] from between [[H5973]] his knees, [[H1290]] and he bowed himself [[H7812]] with his face [[H639]] to the earth. [[H776]]

### 13
And Joseph [[H3130]] took [[H3947]] them both, [[H8147]] Ephraim [[H669]] in his right hand [[H3225]] toward Israel's [[H3478]] left hand, [[H8040]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] in his left hand [[H8040]] toward Israel's [[H3478]] right hand, [[H3225]] and brought near [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 14
And Israel [[H3478]] stretched out [[H7971]] his right hand, [[H3225]] and laid [[H7896]] upon [[H5921]] Ephraim's [[H669]] head, [[H7218]] who [[H1931]] the younger, [[H6810]] and his left hand [[H8040]] upon [[H5921]] Manasseh's [[H4519]] head, [[H7218]] guiding his hands [[H3027]] wittingly; [[H7919]] for [[H3588]] Manasseh [[H4519]] the firstborn. [[H1060]]

### 15
And he blessed [[H1288]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and said, [[H559]] God, [[H430]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] my fathers [[H1]] Abraham [[H85]] and Isaac [[H3327]] did walk, [[H1980]] the God [[H430]] which fed [[H7462]] me all my life long [[H5750]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]]

### 16
The Angel [[H4397]] which redeemed [[H1350]] me from all [[H3605]] evil, [[H7451]] bless [[H1288]] the lads; [[H5288]] and let my name [[H8034]] be named [[H7121]] on them, and the name [[H8034]] of my fathers [[H1]] Abraham [[H85]] and Isaac; [[H3327]] and let them grow [[H1711]] into a multitude [[H7230]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
And when Joseph [[H3130]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his father [[H1]] laid [[H7896]] his right [[H3225]] hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] it displeased [[H3415]] him: and he held up [[H8551]] his father's [[H1]] hand, [[H3027]] to remove [[H5493]] it from [[H5921]] Ephraim's [[H669]] head [[H7218]] unto [[H5921]] Manasseh's [[H4519]] head. [[H7218]]

### 18
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] Not [[H3808]] so, [[H3651]] my father: [[H1]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] the firstborn; [[H1060]] put [[H7760]] thy right hand [[H3225]] upon [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]]

### 19
And his father [[H1]] refused, [[H3985]] and said, [[H559]] I know [[H3045]] my son, [[H1121]] I know [[H3045]] he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] shall become [[H1961]] a people, [[H5971]] and he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] shall be great: [[H1431]] but truly [[H199]] his younger [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] shall be greater [[H1431]] than [[H4480]] he, and his seed [[H2233]] shall become [[H1961]] a multitude [[H4393]] of nations. [[H1471]]

### 20
And he blessed [[H1288]] them that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saying, [[H559]] In thee shall Israel [[H3478]] bless, [[H1288]] saying, [[H559]] God [[H430]] make [[H7760]] thee as Ephraim [[H669]] and as Manasseh: [[H4519]] and he set [[H7760]] Ephraim [[H669]] before [[H6440]] Manasseh. [[H4519]]

### 21
And Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] die: [[H4191]] but God [[H430]] shall be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] you, and bring you again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of your fathers. [[H1]]

### 22
Moreover I [[H589]] have given [[H5414]] to thee one [[H259]] portion [[H7926]] above [[H5921]] thy brethren, [[H251]] which [[H834]] I took [[H3947]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Amorite [[H567]] with my sword [[H2719]] and with my bow. [[H7198]]
