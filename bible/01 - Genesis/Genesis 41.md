### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7093]] of two full [[H3117]] years, [[H8141]] that Pharaoh [[H6547]] dreamed: [[H2492]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the river. [[H2975]]

### 2
And, behold, [[H2009]] there came up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the river [[H2975]] seven [[H7651]] well [[H3303]] favoured [[H4758]] kine [[H6510]] and fatfleshed; [[H1277]] and they fed [[H7462]] in a meadow. [[H260]]

### 3
And, behold, [[H2009]] seven [[H7651]] other [[H312]] kine [[H6510]] came up [[H5927]] after them [[H310]] out of [[H4480]] the river, [[H2975]] ill [[H7451]] favoured [[H4758]] and leanfleshed; [[H1851]] and stood [[H5975]] by [[H681]] the kine [[H6510]] upon [[H5921]] the brink [[H8193]] of the river. [[H2975]]

### 4
And the ill [[H7451]] favoured [[H4758]] and leanfleshed [[H1851]] kine [[H6510]] did eat up [[H398]] the seven [[H7651]] well [[H3303]] favoured [[H4758]] and fat [[H1277]] kine. [[H6510]] So Pharaoh [[H6547]] awoke. [[H3364]]

### 5
And he slept [[H3462]] and dreamed [[H2492]] the second time: [[H8145]] and, behold, [[H2009]] seven [[H7651]] ears of corn [[H7641]] came up [[H5927]] upon one [[H259]] stalk, [[H7070]] rank [[H1277]] and good. [[H2896]]

### 6
And, behold, [[H2009]] seven [[H7651]] thin [[H1851]] ears [[H7641]] and blasted [[H7710]] with the east wind [[H6921]] sprung up [[H6779]] after them. [[H310]]

### 7
And the seven thin [[H1851]] ears [[H7641]] devoured [[H1104]] the seven [[H7651]] rank [[H1277]] and full [[H4392]] ears. [[H7641]] And Pharaoh [[H6547]] awoke, [[H3364]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a dream. [[H2472]]

### 8
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the morning [[H1242]] that his spirit [[H7307]] was troubled; [[H6470]] and he sent [[H7971]] and called for [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the magicians [[H2748]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and all [[H3605]] the wise men [[H2450]] thereof: and Pharaoh [[H6547]] told [[H5608]]  them [[H853]] his dream; [[H2472]] but none [[H369]] that could interpret [[H6622]] them unto Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 9
Then spake [[H1696]] the chief [[H8269]] butler [[H4945]] unto [[H854]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] saying, [[H559]] I [[H589]] do remember [[H2142]] my faults [[H2399]] this day: [[H3117]]

### 10
Pharaoh [[H6547]] was wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] his servants, [[H5650]] and put [[H5414]] me in ward [[H4929]] in the captain [[H8269]] of the guard's [[H2876]] house, [[H1004]] me and the chief [[H8269]] baker: [[H644]]

### 11
And we dreamed [[H2492]] a dream [[H2472]] in one [[H259]] night, [[H3915]] I [[H589]] and he; [[H1931]] we dreamed [[H2492]] each man [[H376]] according to the interpretation [[H6623]] of his dream. [[H2472]]

### 12
And there [[H8033]] with [[H854]] us a young man, [[H5288]] an Hebrew, [[H5680]] servant [[H5650]] to the captain [[H8269]] of the guard; [[H2876]] and we told [[H5608]] him, and he interpreted [[H6622]]  to us [[H853]] our dreams; [[H2472]] to each man [[H582]] according to his dream [[H2472]] he did interpret. [[H6622]]

### 13
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as [[H834]] he interpreted [[H6622]] to us, so [[H3651]] it was; [[H1961]] me he restored [[H7725]] unto [[H5921]] mine office, [[H3653]] and him he hanged. [[H8518]]

### 14
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and they brought him hastily [[H7323]] out of [[H4480]] the dungeon: [[H953]] and he shaved [[H1548]] and changed [[H2498]] his raiment, [[H8071]] and came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 15
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] I have dreamed [[H2492]] a dream, [[H2472]] and none [[H369]] that can interpret [[H6622]] it: and I [[H589]] have heard [[H8085]] say [[H559]] of [[H5921]] thee, thou canst understand [[H8085]] a dream [[H2472]] to interpret [[H6622]] it. [[H6622]]

### 16
And Joseph [[H3130]] answered [[H6030]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] saying, [[H559]] not in me: [[H1107]] God [[H430]] shall give Pharaoh [[H6547]] an answer [[H6030]]  of [[H853]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 17
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] In my dream, [[H2472]] behold, [[H2005]] I stood [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] of the river: [[H2975]]

### 18
And, behold, [[H2009]] there came up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the river [[H2975]] seven [[H7651]] kine, [[H6510]] fatfleshed [[H1277]] and well [[H3303]] favoured; [[H8389]] and they fed [[H7462]] in a meadow: [[H260]]

### 19
And, behold, [[H2009]] seven [[H7651]] other [[H312]] kine [[H6510]] came up [[H5927]] after them, [[H310]] poor [[H1803]] and very [[H3966]] ill [[H7451]] favoured [[H8389]] and leanfleshed, [[H7534]] such [[H2007]] as I never [[H3808]] saw [[H7200]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] for badness: [[H7455]]

### 20
And the lean [[H7534]] and the ill favoured [[H7451]] kine [[H6510]] did eat up [[H398]] the first [[H7223]] seven [[H7651]] fat [[H1277]] kine: [[H6510]]

### 21
And when they had eaten them up, [[H935]] it could not [[H3808]] be known [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they had eaten [[H413]] them; [[H935]] but they still [[H4758]] ill favoured, [[H7451]] as [[H834]] at the beginning. [[H8462]] So I awoke. [[H3364]]

### 22
And I saw [[H7200]] in my dream, [[H2472]] and, behold, [[H2009]] seven [[H7651]] ears [[H7641]] came up [[H5927]] in one [[H259]] stalk, [[H7070]] full [[H4392]] and good: [[H2896]]

### 23
And, behold, [[H2009]] seven [[H7651]] ears, [[H7641]] withered, [[H6798]] thin, [[H1851]] blasted [[H7710]] with the east wind, [[H6921]] sprung up [[H6779]] after them: [[H310]]

### 24
And the thin [[H1851]] ears [[H7641]] devoured [[H1104]] the seven [[H7651]] good [[H2896]] ears: [[H7641]] and I told [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the magicians; [[H2748]] but none [[H369]] that could declare [[H5046]] to me. [[H5046]]

### 25
And Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] The dream [[H2472]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] one: [[H259]] God [[H430]] hath shewed [[H5046]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] what [[H834]] he about to do. [[H6213]]

### 26
The seven [[H7651]] good [[H2896]] kine [[H6510]] seven [[H7651]] years; [[H8141]] and the seven [[H7651]] good [[H2896]] ears [[H7641]] seven [[H7651]] years: [[H8141]] the dream [[H2472]] one. [[H259]]

### 27
And the seven [[H7651]] thin [[H7534]] and ill favoured [[H7451]] kine [[H6510]] that came up [[H5927]] after them [[H310]] seven [[H7651]] years; [[H8141]] and the seven [[H7651]] empty [[H7386]] ears [[H7641]] blasted [[H7710]] with the east wind [[H6921]] shall be [[H1961]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine. [[H7458]]

### 28
This [[H1931]] the thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] What [[H834]] God [[H430]] about to do [[H6213]] he sheweth [[H7200]] unto Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 29
Behold, [[H2009]] there come [[H935]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of great [[H1419]] plenty [[H7647]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 30
And there shall arise [[H6965]] after them [[H310]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine; [[H7458]] and all [[H3605]] the plenty [[H7647]] shall be forgotten [[H7911]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] and the famine [[H7458]] shall consume [[H3615]] the land; [[H776]]

### 31
And the plenty [[H7647]] shall not [[H3808]] be known [[H3045]] in the land [[H776]] by reason of [[H6440]] that [[H1931]] famine [[H7458]] following; [[H310]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] very [[H3966]] grievous. [[H3515]]

### 32
And for [[H5921]] that the dream [[H2472]] was doubled [[H8138]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] twice; [[H6471]] because [[H3588]] the thing [[H1697]] established [[H3559]] by [[H5973]] God, [[H430]] and God [[H430]] will shortly [[H4116]] bring it to pass. [[H6213]]

### 33
Now [[H6258]] therefore let Pharaoh [[H6547]] look out [[H7200]] a man [[H376]] discreet [[H995]] and wise, [[H2450]] and set [[H7896]] him over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 34
Let Pharaoh [[H6547]] do [[H6213]] and let him appoint [[H6485]] officers [[H6496]] over [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]] and take up the fifth part [[H2567]]  of [[H853]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] in the seven [[H7651]] plenteous [[H7647]] years. [[H8141]]

### 35
And let them gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the food [[H400]] of those [[H428]] good [[H2896]] years [[H8141]] that come, [[H935]] and lay up [[H6651]] corn [[H1250]] under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and let them keep [[H8104]] food [[H400]] in the cities. [[H5892]]

### 36
And that food [[H400]] shall be [[H1961]] for store [[H6487]] to the land [[H776]] against the seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine, [[H7458]] which [[H834]] shall be [[H1961]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] that the land [[H776]] perish [[H3772]] not [[H3808]] through the famine. [[H7458]]

### 37
And the thing [[H1697]] was good [[H3190]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and in the eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] his servants. [[H5650]]

### 38
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] Can we find [[H4672]] as this [[H2088]] a man [[H376]] in whom [[H834]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]]

### 39
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] Forasmuch [[H310]] as God [[H430]] hath shewed [[H3045]]  thee [[H853]] all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] none [[H369]] so discreet [[H995]] and wise [[H2450]] as thou [[H3644]]

### 40
Thou [[H859]] shalt be [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] my house, [[H1004]] and according unto [[H5921]] thy word [[H6310]] shall all [[H3605]] my people [[H5971]] be ruled: [[H5401]] only [[H7535]] in the throne [[H3678]] will I be greater [[H1431]] than [[H4480]] thou. [[H4480]]

### 41
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] See, [[H7200]] I have set [[H5414]] thee over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 42
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] took off [[H5493]] his ring [[H2885]] from [[H5921]] his hand, [[H3027]] and put [[H5414]] it upon [[H5921]] Joseph's [[H3130]] hand, [[H3027]] and arrayed [[H3847]] him in vestures [[H899]] of fine linen, [[H8336]] and put [[H7760]] a gold [[H2091]] chain [[H7242]] about [[H5921]] his neck; [[H6677]]

### 43
And he made him to ride [[H7392]] in the second [[H4932]] chariot [[H4818]] which [[H834]] he had; and they cried [[H7121]] before him, [[H6440]] Bow the knee: [[H86]] and he made [[H5414]] him over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 44
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] I [[H589]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and without [[H1107]] thee shall no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] lift up [[H7311]] his hand [[H3027]] or foot [[H7272]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 45
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] called [[H7121]] Joseph's [[H3130]] name [[H8034]] Zaphnath-paaneah; [[H6847]] and he gave [[H5414]] him to wife [[H802]] Asenath [[H621]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Poti-pherah [[H6319]] priest [[H3548]] of On. [[H204]] And Joseph [[H3130]] went out [[H3318]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 46
And Joseph [[H3130]] thirty [[H7970]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] And Joseph [[H3130]] went out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and went throughout [[H5674]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 47
And in the seven [[H7651]] plenteous [[H7647]] years [[H8141]] the earth [[H776]] brought forth [[H6213]] by handfuls. [[H7062]]

### 48
And he gathered up [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the food [[H400]] of the seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]] which [[H834]] were [[H1961]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and laid up [[H5414]] the food [[H400]] in the cities: [[H5892]] the food [[H400]] of the field, [[H7704]] which [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] every city, [[H5892]] laid he up [[H5414]] in the same. [[H8432]]

### 49
And Joseph [[H3130]] gathered [[H6651]] corn [[H1250]] as the sand [[H2344]] of the sea, [[H3220]] very [[H3966]] much, [[H7235]] until [[H5704]] he left [[H2308]] numbering; [[H5608]] for [[H3588]] without [[H369]] number. [[H4557]]

### 50
And unto Joseph [[H3130]] were born [[H3205]] two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] before [[H2962]] the years [[H8141]] of famine [[H7458]] came, [[H935]] which [[H834]] Asenath [[H621]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Poti-pherah [[H6319]] priest [[H3548]] of On [[H204]] bare [[H3205]] unto him. [[H3205]]

### 51
And Joseph [[H3130]] called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the firstborn [[H1060]] Manasseh: [[H4519]] For [[H3588]] God, [[H430]] hath made me forget [[H5382]] all [[H3605]] my toil, [[H5999]] and all [[H3605]] my father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 52
And the name [[H8034]] of the second [[H8145]] called [[H7121]] he Ephraim: [[H669]] For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] hath caused me to be fruitful [[H6509]] in the land [[H776]] of my affliction. [[H6040]]

### 53
And the seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of plenteousness, [[H7647]] that [[H834]] was [[H1961]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] were ended. [[H3615]]

### 54
And the seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of dearth [[H7458]] began [[H2490]] to come, [[H935]] according as [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had said: [[H559]] and the dearth [[H7458]] was [[H1961]] in all [[H3605]] lands; [[H776]] but in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] there was [[H1961]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 55
And when all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] was famished, [[H7456]] the people [[H5971]] cried [[H6817]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] for bread: [[H3899]] and Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto all [[H3605]] the Egyptians, [[H4714]] Go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] Joseph; [[H3130]] what [[H834]] he saith [[H559]] to you, do. [[H6213]]

### 56
And the famine [[H7458]] was [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth: [[H776]] And Joseph [[H3130]] opened [[H6605]] all [[H3605]] the storehouses, [[H834]] and sold [[H7666]] unto the Egyptians; [[H4713]] and the famine [[H7458]] waxed sore [[H2388]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 57
And all [[H3605]] countries [[H776]] came [[H935]] into Egypt [[H4714]] to [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] for to buy [[H7666]] because [[H3588]] that the famine [[H7458]] was sore [[H2388]] in all [[H3605]] lands. [[H776]]
