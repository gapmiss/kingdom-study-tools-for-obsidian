### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] visited [[H6485]] Sarah [[H8283]] as [[H834]] he had said, [[H559]] and the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] unto Sarah [[H8283]] as [[H834]] he had spoken. [[H1696]]

### 2
For Sarah [[H8283]] conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] Abraham [[H85]] a son [[H1121]] in his old age, [[H2208]] at the set time [[H4150]] of which [[H834]] God [[H430]] had spoken [[H1696]] to him. [[H1696]]

### 3
And Abraham [[H85]] called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of his son [[H1121]] that was born [[H3205]] unto him, whom [[H834]] Sarah [[H8283]] bare [[H3205]] to him, Isaac. [[H3327]]

### 4
And Abraham [[H85]] circumcised [[H4135]] his son [[H1121]] Isaac [[H3327]] being eight [[H8083]] days [[H3117]] old, [[H1121]] as [[H834]] God [[H430]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H6680]]

### 5
And Abraham [[H85]] was an hundred [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]]  when [[H853]] his son [[H1121]] Isaac [[H3327]] was born [[H3205]] unto him. [[H3205]]

### 6
And Sarah [[H8283]] said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] hath made [[H6213]] me to laugh, [[H6712]] all [[H3605]] that hear [[H8085]] will laugh [[H6711]] with me. [[H6711]]

### 7
And she said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] would have said [[H4448]] unto Abraham, [[H85]] that Sarah [[H8283]] should have given children [[H1121]] suck? [[H3243]] for [[H3588]] I have born [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] in his old age. [[H2208]]

### 8
And the child [[H3206]] grew, [[H1431]] and was weaned: [[H1580]] and Abraham [[H85]] made [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] feast [[H4960]] the day [[H3117]]  that [[H853]] Isaac [[H3327]] was weaned. [[H1580]]

### 9
And Sarah [[H8283]] saw [[H7200]] the son [[H1121]] of Hagar [[H1904]] the Egyptian, [[H4713]] which [[H834]] she had born [[H3205]] unto Abraham, [[H85]] mocking. [[H6711]]

### 10
Wherefore she said [[H559]] unto Abraham, [[H85]] Cast out [[H1644]] this [[H2063]] bondwoman [[H519]] and her son: [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] the son [[H1121]] of this [[H2063]] bondwoman [[H519]] shall not [[H3808]] be heir [[H3423]] with [[H5973]] my son, [[H1121]] with [[H5973]] Isaac. [[H3327]]

### 11
And the thing [[H1697]] was very grievous [[H3966]] in Abraham's [[H85]] sight [[H5869]] because [[H182]] of his son. [[H1121]]

### 12
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] Let it not [[H408]] be grievous [[H7489]] in thy sight [[H5869]] because of [[H5921]] the lad, [[H5288]] and because of [[H5921]] thy bondwoman; [[H519]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Sarah [[H8283]] hath said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, hearken [[H8085]] unto her voice; [[H6963]] for [[H3588]] in Isaac [[H3327]] shall thy seed [[H2233]] be called. [[H7121]]

### 13
And also [[H1571]] of the son [[H1121]] of the bondwoman [[H519]] will I make [[H7760]] a nation, [[H1471]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] thy seed. [[H2233]]

### 14
And Abraham [[H85]] rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and took [[H3947]] bread, [[H3899]] and a bottle [[H2573]] of water, [[H4325]] and gave [[H5414]] unto [[H413]] Hagar, [[H1904]] putting [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] her shoulder, [[H7926]] and the child, [[H3206]] and sent her away: [[H7971]] and she departed, [[H1980]] and wandered [[H8582]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Beer-sheba. [[H884]]

### 15
And the water [[H4325]] was spent [[H3615]] in [[H4480]] the bottle, [[H2573]] and she cast [[H7993]] the child [[H3206]] under [[H8478]] one [[H259]] of the shrubs. [[H7880]]

### 16
And she went, [[H1980]] and sat her down [[H3427]] over against [[H5048]] a good way off, [[H7368]] as it were a bowshot: [[H2909]] for [[H3588]] she said, [[H559]] Let me not [[H408]] see [[H7200]] the death [[H4194]] of the child. [[H3206]] And she sat [[H3427]] over against [[H5048]] and lift up [[H5375]] her voice, [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 17
And God [[H430]] heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the lad; [[H5288]] and the angel [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Hagar [[H1904]] out of [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and said [[H559]] unto her, What [[H4100]] aileth thee, Hagar? [[H1904]] fear [[H3372]] not; [[H408]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] hath heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the lad [[H5288]] where [[H8033]] he [[H1931]]

### 18
Arise, [[H6965]] lift up [[H5375]] the lad, [[H5288]] and hold [[H2388]] him in [[H854]] thine hand; [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] I will make [[H7760]] him a great [[H1419]] nation. [[H1471]]

### 19
And God [[H430]] opened [[H6491]] her eyes, [[H5869]] and she saw [[H7200]] a well [[H875]] of water; [[H4325]] and she went, [[H1980]] and filled [[H4390]] the bottle [[H2573]] with water, [[H4325]]  and gave [[H853]] the lad [[H5288]] drink. [[H8248]]

### 20
And God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] the lad; [[H5288]] and he grew, [[H1431]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and became [[H1961]] an [[H7232]] archer. [[H7198]]

### 21
And he dwelt [[H3427]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran: [[H6290]] and his mother [[H517]] took [[H3947]] him a wife [[H802]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 22
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] that Abimelech [[H40]] and Phichol [[H6369]] the chief captain [[H8269]] of his host [[H6635]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] saying, [[H559]] God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] thee in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] doest: [[H6213]]

### 23
Now [[H6258]] therefore swear [[H7650]] unto me here [[H2008]] by God [[H430]] that thou wilt not deal falsely [[H8266]] with me, nor with my son, [[H5209]] nor with my son's son: [[H5220]] according to the kindness [[H2617]] that [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] unto [[H5973]] thee, thou shalt do [[H6213]] unto [[H5978]] me, and to [[H5973]] the land [[H776]] wherein [[H834]] thou hast sojourned. [[H1481]]

### 24
And Abraham [[H85]] said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] will swear. [[H7650]]

### 25
And Abraham [[H85]] reproved [[H3198]] Abimelech [[H40]] because of [[H182]] a well [[H875]] of water, [[H4325]] which [[H834]] Abimelech's [[H40]] servants [[H5650]] had violently taken away. [[H1497]]

### 26
And Abimelech [[H40]] said, [[H559]] I wot [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] who [[H4310]] hath done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing: [[H1697]] neither [[H3808]] didst thou [[H859]] tell [[H5046]] me, neither [[H3808]] yet [[H1571]] heard [[H8085]] I [[H595]] but [[H1115]] to day. [[H3117]]

### 27
And Abraham [[H85]] took [[H3947]] sheep [[H6629]] and oxen, [[H1241]] and gave [[H5414]] them unto Abimelech; [[H40]] and both [[H8147]] of them made [[H3772]] a covenant. [[H1285]]

### 28
And Abraham [[H85]] set [[H5324]] seven [[H7651]] ewe lambs [[H3535]] of the flock [[H6629]] by themselves. [[H905]]

### 29
And Abimelech [[H40]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] What [[H4100]] these [[H428]] seven [[H7651]] ewe lambs [[H3535]] which [[H834]] thou hast set [[H5324]] by themselves? [[H905]]

### 30
And he said, [[H559]] For [[H3588]] seven [[H7651]] ewe lambs [[H3535]] shalt thou take [[H3947]] of my hand, [[H3027]] that [[H5668]] they may be [[H1961]] a witness [[H5713]] unto me, that [[H3588]] I have digged [[H2658]] this [[H2088]] well. [[H875]]

### 31
Wherefore [[H3651]] he called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Beer-sheba; [[H884]] because [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] they sware [[H7650]] both [[H8147]] of them. [[H8147]]

### 32
Thus they made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] at Beer-sheba: [[H884]] then Abimelech [[H40]] rose up, [[H6965]] and Phichol [[H6369]] the chief captain [[H8269]] of his host, [[H6635]] and they returned [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 33
And planted [[H5193]] a grove [[H815]] in Beer-sheba, [[H884]] and called [[H7121]] there [[H8033]] on the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the everlasting [[H5769]] God. [[H410]]

### 34
And Abraham [[H85]] sojourned [[H1481]] in the Philistines' [[H6430]] land [[H776]] many [[H7227]] days. [[H3117]]
