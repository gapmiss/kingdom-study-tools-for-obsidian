### 1
When [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken [[G2036]] these words, [[G5023]] he went forth [[G1831]] with [[G4862]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] over [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] brook [[G5493]] Cedron, [[G2748]] where [[G3699]] was [[G2258]] a garden, [[G2779]] into [[G1519]] the which [[G3739]] he [[G846]] entered, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] Judas [[G2455]] also, [[G2532]] which [[G3588]] betrayed [[G3860]] him, [[G846]] knew [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] place: [[G5117]] for [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] ofttimes [[G4178]] resorted [[G4863]] thither [[G1563]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 3
Judas [[G2455]] then, [[G3767]] having received [[G2983]] a [[G4686]] band [[G4686]] and [[G2532]] officers [[G5257]] from [[G1537]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] cometh [[G2064]] thither [[G1563]] with [[G3326]] lanterns [[G5322]] and [[G2532]] torches [[G2985]] and [[G2532]] weapons. [[G3696]]

### 4
Jesus [[G2424]] therefore, [[G3767]] knowing [[G1492]] all things [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] should come [[G2064]] upon [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] went forth, [[G1831]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Whom [[G5101]] seek ye? [[G2212]]

### 5
They answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3480]] Nazareth. [[G3480]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] And [[G1161]] Judas [[G2455]] also, [[G2532]] which [[G3588]] betrayed [[G3860]] him, [[G846]] stood [[G2476]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]]

### 6
As soon [[G5613]] then [[G3767]] as he had said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] they went [[G565]] backward, [[G3694]] and [[G2532]] fell [[G4098]] to the ground. [[G5476]]

### 7
Then [[G3767]] asked he [[G1905]] them [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] Whom [[G5101]] seek ye? [[G2212]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3480]] Nazareth. [[G3480]]

### 8
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] I have told [[G2036]] you [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] if [[G1487]] therefore [[G3767]] ye seek [[G2212]] me, [[G1691]] let [[G863]] these [[G5128]] go their way: [[G5217]]

### 9
That [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] might be fulfilled, [[G4137]] which [[G3739]] he spake, [[G2036]] Of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] which [[G3739]] thou gavest [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] have [[G3756]] I lost [[G622]] none. [[G3762]]

### 10
Then [[G3767]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] having [[G2192]] a sword [[G3162]] drew [[G1670]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] smote [[G3817]] the [[G3588]] high priest's [[G749]] servant, [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] cut off [[G609]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] ear. [[G5621]] The [[G3588]] servant's [[G1401]] name [[G3686]] was [[G2258]] Malchus. [[G3124]]

### 11
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto [[G4074]] Peter, [[G4074]] Put up [[G906]] thy [[G4675]] sword [[G3162]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sheath: [[G2336]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] which [[G3739]] my [[G3962]] Father [[G3962]] hath given [[G1325]] me, [[G3427]] not [[G3756]] shall I [[G846]] drink [[G4095]] it? [[G846]]

### 12
the [[G3588]] Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] band [[G4686]] and [[G2532]] captain [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] officers [[G5257]] of [[G2453]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] took [[G4815]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] bound [[G1210]] him, [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] led [[G520]] him [[G846]] away [[G520]] to [[G4314]] Annas [[G452]] first; [[G4412]] for [[G1063]] he was [[G2258]] father in law [[G3995]] to Caiaphas, [[G2533]] which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] the high priest [[G749]] that same [[G1565]] year. [[G1763]]

### 14
Now [[G1161]] Caiaphas [[G2533]] was he, [[G2258]] which [[G3588]] gave counsel [[G4823]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2453]] Jews, [[G2453]] that [[G3754]] it was expedient that [[G4851]] one [[G1520]] man [[G444]] should die [[G622]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] followed [[G190]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] disciple: [[G3101]] that [[G1565]] disciple [[G3101]] was [[G2258]] known [[G1110]] the [[G3588]] unto high [[G749]] priest, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] went in with [[G4897]] Jesus [[G2424]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] palace [[G833]] the [[G3588]] of high [[G749]] priest. [[G749]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] stood [[G2476]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] without. [[G1854]] Then [[G3767]] went out [[G1831]] that [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciple, [[G3101]] which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] known [[G1110]] the [[G3588]] unto high [[G749]] priest, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] spake [[G2036]] unto her that kept the door, [[G2377]] and [[G2532]] brought in [[G1521]] Peter. [[G4074]]

### 17
Then [[G3767]] saith [[G3004]] the kept the [[G3588]] damsel [[G3814]] that [[G1565]] door [[G2377]] unto Peter, [[G4074]] Art [[G1488]] not [[G3361]] thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] man's [[G444]] disciples? [[G3101]] He saith, [[G3004]] I am [[G1510]] not. [[G3756]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] servants [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] officers [[G5257]] stood there, [[G2476]] who had made [[G4160]] a fire of coals; [[G439]] for [[G3754]] it was [[G2258]] cold: [[G5592]] and [[G2532]] they warmed themselves: [[G2328]] and [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] stood [[G2476]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] warmed himself. [[G2328]]

### 19
The [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] then [[G3767]] asked [[G2065]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G4012]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] of [[G4012]] his [[G846]] doctrine. [[G1322]]

### 20
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] spake [[G2980]] openly [[G3954]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2889]] world; [[G2889]] I [[G1473]] ever [[G3842]] taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] whither [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] always [[G3842]] resort; [[G4905]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] secret [[G2927]] have I said [[G2980]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 21
Why [[G5101]] askest thou [[G1905]] me? [[G3165]] ask [[G1905]] them which [[G3588]] heard me, [[G191]] what [[G5101]] I have said [[G2980]] unto them: [[G846]] behold, [[G1492]] they [[G3778]] know [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] said. [[G2036]]

### 22
And when [[G1161]] he [[G846]] thus [[G5023]] had [[G2036]] spoken, [[G2036]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5257]] officers [[G5257]] which stood by [[G3936]] struck [[G1325]] Jesus [[G2424]] with the palm of his hand, [[G4475]] saying, [[G2036]] Answerest thou [[G611]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] so? [[G3779]]

### 23
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] I have spoken [[G2980]] evil, [[G2560]] bear witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] evil: [[G2556]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] well, [[G2573]] why [[G5101]] smitest thou [[G1194]] me? [[G3165]]

### 24
Now [[G3588]] Annas [[G452]] had sent [[G649]] him [[G846]] bound [[G1210]] unto [[G4314]] Caiaphas [[G2533]] the [[G3588]] high priest. [[G749]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] stood [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] warmed himself. [[G2328]] They said [[G2036]] therefore [[G3767]] unto him, [[G846]] Art [[G1488]] not [[G3361]] thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] disciples? [[G3101]] He [[G1565]] denied [[G720]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] I am [[G1510]] not. [[G3756]]

### 26
One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] servants [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] of high [[G749]] priest, [[G749]] being [[G5607]] kinsman [[G4773]] whose [[G3739]] ear [[G5621]] Peter [[G4074]] cut off, [[G609]] saith, [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] Did [[G1492]] I [[G1473]] see [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] garden [[G2779]] with [[G3326]] him? [[G846]]

### 27
Peter [[G4074]] then [[G3767]] denied [[G720]] again: [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] the cock [[G220]] crew. [[G5455]]

### 28
Then [[G3767]] led they [[G71]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G575]] Caiaphas [[G2533]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] hall of judgment: [[G4232]] and [[G1161]] it was [[G2258]] early; [[G4405]] and [[G2532]] themselves [[G846]] they [[G1525]] went [[G1525]] not [[G3756]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] judgment hall, [[G4232]] lest [[G2443]] they should be defiled; [[G3392]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] they might eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] passover. [[G3957]]

### 29
Pilate [[G4091]] then [[G3767]] went out [[G1831]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] accusation [[G2724]] bring ye [[G5342]] against [[G2596]] this [[G5127]] man? [[G444]]

### 30
They answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] he [[G3778]] were [[G2258]] not [[G3361]] a malefactor, [[G2555]] not [[G3756]] we would have delivered [[G3860]] him [[G846]] up unto thee. [[G4671]]

### 31
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Pilate [[G4091]] unto them, [[G846]] Take [[G2983]] ye [[G5210]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] judge [[G2919]] him [[G846]] according to [[G2596]] your [[G5216]] law. [[G3551]] The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] therefore [[G3767]] said unto [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] It is [[G1832]] lawful [[G1832]] for us [[G2254]] to put to [[G615]] any man [[G3762]] death: [[G615]]

### 32
That [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] might be fulfilled, [[G4137]] which [[G3739]] he spake, [[G2036]] signifying [[G4591]] what [[G4169]] death [[G2288]] he should [[G3195]] die. [[G599]]

### 33
Then [[G3767]] Pilate [[G4091]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the judgment [[G3588]] hall [[G4232]] again, [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] called [[G5455]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King of [[G935]] the [[G3588]] Jews? [[G2453]]

### 34
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] Sayest [[G3004]] thou [[G4771]] this thing [[G5124]] of [[G575]] thyself, [[G1438]] or [[G2228]] did others [[G243]] tell it [[G2036]] thee [[G4671]] of [[G4012]] me? [[G1700]]

### 35
Pilate [[G4091]] answered, [[G611]] Am [[G1510]] I [[G1473]] a Jew? [[G2453]] Thine own [[G4674]] nation [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] have delivered [[G3860]] thee [[G4571]] unto me: [[G1698]] what [[G5101]] hast thou done? [[G4160]]

### 36
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] My [[G1699]] kingdom [[G932]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] world: [[G2889]] if [[G1487]] my [[G1699]] kingdom [[G932]] were [[G2258]] of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] world, [[G2889]] then would [[G302]] my [[G1698]] servants [[G5257]] fight, [[G75]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] I should be [[G3860]] delivered [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2453]] Jews: [[G2453]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] is [[G2076]] my [[G1699]] kingdom [[G932]] not [[G3756]] from hence. [[G1782]]

### 37
Pilate [[G4091]] therefore [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] a king [[G935]] then? [[G3766]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] Thou [[G4771]] sayest [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] a king. [[G935]] To [[G1519]] this end [[G5124]] I [[G1473]] was [[G1080]] born, [[G1080]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] this cause [[G5124]] came I [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] that [[G2443]] I should bear witness [[G3140]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G225]] truth. [[G225]] Every one [[G3956]] that is [[G5607]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] heareth [[G191]] my [[G3450]] voice. [[G5456]]

### 38
Pilate [[G4091]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] truth? [[G225]] And [[G2532]] when he had said [[G2036]] this, [[G5124]] he went out [[G1831]] again [[G3825]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] find [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] no [[G3762]] fault [[G156]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5213]] have [[G2076]] a custom, [[G4914]] that [[G2443]] I should release [[G630]] unto you [[G5213]] one [[G1520]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] passover: [[G3957]] will ye [[G1014]] therefore [[G3767]] that I release [[G630]] unto you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] King of [[G935]] the [[G3588]] Jews? [[G2453]]

### 40
Then [[G3767]] cried they [[G2905]] all [[G3956]] again, [[G3825]] saying, [[G3004]] Not [[G3361]] this man, [[G5126]] but [[G235]] Barabbas. [[G912]] Now [[G1161]] Barabbas [[G912]] was [[G2258]] a robber. [[G3027]]
