### 1
Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G4198]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]]  of [[G3588]] Olives. [[G1636]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] early in the morning [[G3722]] he came [[G3854]] again [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he sat down, [[G2523]] and taught [[G1321]] them. [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] brought [[G71]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] a woman [[G1135]] taken [[G2638]] in [[G1722]] adultery; [[G3430]] and [[G2532]] when they had set [[G2476]] her [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the midst, [[G3319]]

### 4
They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] this [[G3778]] woman [[G1135]] was taken [[G2638]] in adultery, [[G3431]] in the very act. [[G1888]]

### 5
Now [[G1161]] Moses [[G3475]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] commanded [[G1781]] us, [[G2254]] that [[G3588]] such [[G5108]] should be stoned: [[G3036]] but [[G3767]] what [[G5101]] sayest [[G3004]] thou? [[G4771]]

### 6
This [[G5124]] they said, [[G3004]] tempting [[G3985]] him, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they might have [[G2192]] to accuse [[G2723]] him. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] stooped [[G2955]] down, [[G2736]]  and with [[G3588]] finger [[G1147]] wrote [[G1125]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground, [[G1093]]

### 7
So [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] they continued [[G1961]] asking [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] he lifted up himself, [[G352]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] He [[G3588]] that is without sin [[G361]] among you, [[G5216]] first [[G4413]] let him [[G906]] cast [[G906]]  a [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] at [[G1909]] her. [[G846]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he stooped [[G2955]] down, [[G2736]] and wrote [[G1125]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]]

### 9
they which [[G3588]] And [[G1161]] heard [[G191]] being convicted [[G1651]] by [[G5259]] conscience, [[G4893]] went out [[G1831]] one [[G1520]] by [[G2596]] one, [[G1520]] beginning [[G756]] at [[G575]] the [[G3588]] eldest, [[G4245]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] last: [[G2078]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] was left [[G2641]] alone, [[G3441]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the midst. [[G3319]]

### 10
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] had lifted up himself, [[G352]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2300]] none [[G3367]] but [[G4133]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] he said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Woman, [[G1135]] where [[G4226]] are [[G1526]] those [[G1565]] thine [[G4675]] accusers? [[G2725]] no man [[G3762]] hath [[G2632]] condemned [[G2632]] thee? [[G4571]]

### 11
She [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] No man, [[G3762]] Lord. [[G2962]] And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Neither [[G3761]] I [[G1473]] do [[G2632]] condemn [[G2632]] thee: [[G4571]] go, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] sin [[G264]] no more. [[G3371]]

### 12
Then [[G3767]] spake [[G2980]] Jesus [[G2424]] again [[G3825]] unto them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of the [[G3588]] world: [[G2889]] he [[G3588]] that followeth [[G190]] me [[G1698]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G4043]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] darkness, [[G4653]] but [[G235]] shall have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]]  of [[G3588]] life. [[G2222]]

### 13
The [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] therefore [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou [[G4771]] bearest record [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] thyself; [[G4572]] thy [[G4675]] record [[G3141]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] true. [[G227]]

### 14
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Though [[G2579]] I [[G1473]] bear record [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] myself, [[G1683]] my [[G3450]] record [[G3141]] is [[G2076]] true: [[G227]] for [[G3754]] I know [[G1492]] whence [[G4159]] I came, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] whither [[G4226]] I go; [[G5217]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] cannot [[G3756]] tell [[G1492]] whence [[G4159]] I come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] whither [[G4226]] I go. [[G5217]]

### 15
Ye [[G5210]] judge [[G2919]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] flesh; [[G4561]] I [[G1473]] judge [[G2919]] no [[G3756]] man. [[G3762]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] yet [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] I [[G1473]] judge, [[G2919]] my [[G1699]] judgment [[G2920]] is [[G2076]] true: [[G227]] for [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] alone, [[G3441]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] that sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 17
also [[G1161]] It is [[G1125]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5212]] law, [[G3551]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of two [[G1417]] men [[G444]] is [[G2076]] true. [[G227]]

### 18
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] one that bear witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] myself, [[G1683]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] that [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] me [[G3165]] beareth witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] me. [[G1700]]

### 19
Then [[G3767]] said they [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Where [[G4226]] is [[G2076]] thy [[G4675]] Father? [[G3962]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] neither [[G3777]] Ye [[G1492]] know [[G1492]] me, [[G1691]] nor [[G3777]] my [[G3450]] Father: [[G3962]] if [[G1487]] ye had known [[G1492]] me, [[G1691]] ye should have known [[G1492]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] also. [[G2532]]

### 20
These [[G5023]] words [[G4487]] spake [[G2980]] Jesus [[G2424]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] treasury, [[G1049]] as he taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple: [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] laid hands [[G4084]] on [[G846]] him; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] his [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] not yet [[G3768]] was [[G2064]] come. [[G2064]]

### 21
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] again [[G3825]] unto them, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] go my way, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] ye shall seek [[G2212]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] shall die [[G599]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] sins: [[G266]] whither [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] go, [[G5217]] ye [[G5210]] cannot [[G3756]] come. [[G2064]]

### 22
Then [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] Will [[G3385]] he kill [[G615]] himself? [[G1438]] because [[G3754]] he saith, [[G3004]] Whither [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] go, [[G5217]] ye [[G5210]] cannot [[G3756]] come. [[G2064]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] from [[G1537]] beneath; [[G2736]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] above: [[G507]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] world; [[G2889]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] world. [[G2889]]

### 24
I said [[G2036]] therefore [[G3767]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] ye shall die [[G599]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] sins: [[G266]] for [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] ye believe [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] ye shall die [[G599]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] sins. [[G266]]

### 25
Then [[G3767]] said they [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Who [[G5101]] art [[G1488]] thou? [[G4771]] And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Even [[G2532]] that [[G3739]] I said [[G2980]] unto you [[G5213]] from the [[G3588]] beginning. [[G746]]

### 26
I have [[G2192]] many things [[G4183]] to say [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] to judge [[G2919]] of [[G4012]] you: [[G5216]] but [[G235]] he [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me [[G3165]] is [[G2076]] true; [[G227]] and I [[G2504]] speak [[G3004]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] those things [[G5023]] which [[G3739]] I have heard [[G191]] of [[G3844]] him. [[G846]]

### 27
They understood [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] he spake [[G3004]] to them [[G846]] of the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 28
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto them, [[G846]] When [[G3752]] ye have lifted up [[G5312]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man, [[G444]] then [[G5119]] shall ye know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] I do [[G4160]] nothing [[G3762]] of [[G575]] myself; [[G1683]] but [[G235]] as [[G2531]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] hath taught [[G1321]] me, [[G3165]] I speak [[G2980]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me [[G3165]] is [[G2076]] with [[G3326]] me: [[G1700]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G863]] left [[G863]] me [[G3165]] alone; [[G3441]] for [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] do [[G4160]] always [[G3842]] those things that please [[G701]] him. [[G846]]

### 30
he [[G846]] As [[G2980]] spake [[G2980]] these words, [[G5023]] many [[G4183]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 31
Then [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] to [[G4314]] those which [[G4100]] Jews [[G2453]] believed [[G4100]] on him, [[G846]] If [[G1437]] ye [[G5210]] continue [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1699]] word, [[G3056]] are ye [[G2075]] my [[G3450]] disciples [[G3101]] indeed; [[G230]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] ye shall know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] shall make free. [[G1659]] you [[G5209]]

### 33
They answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] We be [[G2070]] Abraham's [[G11]] seed, [[G4690]] and [[G2532]] were in [[G1398]] never [[G4455]] bondage [[G1398]] to any man: [[G3762]] how [[G4459]] sayest [[G3004]] thou, [[G4771]] Ye shall be made [[G1096]] free? [[G1658]]

### 34
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Whosoever [[G3956]] committeth [[G4160]] sin [[G266]] is [[G2076]] the servant [[G1401]]  of [[G3588]] sin. [[G266]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] abideth [[G3306]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] for [[G1519]] ever: [[G165]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] abideth [[G3306]] ever. [[G165]]

### 36
If [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] therefore [[G3767]] shall make free, [[G1659]] you [[G5209]] ye shall be [[G2071]] free [[G1658]] indeed. [[G3689]]

### 37
I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] Abraham's [[G11]] seed; [[G4690]] but [[G235]] ye seek [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] me, [[G3165]] because [[G3754]] my [[G1699]] word hath [[G5562]] no [[G3756]] place [[G5562]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 38
I [[G1473]] speak [[G2980]] which [[G3739]] that I have [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] with [[G3844]] my [[G3450]] Father: [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] do [[G4160]] that which [[G3739]] ye have seen [[G3708]] with [[G3844]] your [[G5216]] father. [[G3962]]

### 39
They answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Abraham [[G11]] is [[G2076]] our [[G2257]] father. [[G3962]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] ye were [[G2258]] Abraham's [[G11]] children, [[G5043]] ye would do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G11]] Abraham. [[G11]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] ye seek [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] me, [[G3165]] a man [[G444]] that [[G3739]] hath told [[G2980]] you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] which [[G3739]] I have heard [[G191]] of [[G3844]] God: [[G2316]] this [[G5124]] did [[G4160]] not [[G3756]] Abraham. [[G11]]

### 41
Ye [[G5210]] do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] deeds [[G2041]] of your [[G5216]] father. [[G3962]] Then [[G3767]] said they [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] We [[G2249]] not [[G3756]] be [[G1080]] born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] fornication; [[G4202]] we have [[G2192]] one [[G1520]] Father, [[G3962]] God. [[G2316]]

### 42
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] were ye would [[G2258]] your [[G5216]] Father, [[G3962]] love [[G25]] me: [[G1691]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] proceeded [[G2316]] forth [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2240]] from [[G1537]] God; [[G2316]] neither [[G3761]] came [[G2064]] of [[G575]] I [[G1683]] myself, [[G1683]] but [[G235]] he [[G1565]] sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 43
Why [[G1302]] not [[G3756]] do ye [[G1097]] understand [[G1097]] my [[G1699]] speech? [[G2981]] because [[G3754]] cannot [[G3756]] ye [[G191]] hear [[G191]] my [[G1699]] word. [[G3056]]

### 44
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] of [[G1537]] father [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lusts [[G1939]] of [[G3962]] your [[G5216]] father [[G3962]] ye will [[G2309]] do. [[G4160]] He [[G1565]] was [[G2258]] a murderer [[G443]] from [[G575]] the beginning, [[G746]] and [[G2532]] abode [[G2476]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] because [[G3754]] is [[G2076]] there [[G225]] no [[G3756]] truth [[G225]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]] When [[G3752]] he speaketh [[G2980]] a [[G5579]] lie, [[G5579]] he speaketh [[G2980]] of [[G1537]] his [[G2398]] own: [[G2398]] for [[G3754]] is a [[G2076]] he [[G2532]] liar, [[G5583]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] of it. [[G846]]

### 45
And [[G1161]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] ye believe [[G4100]] me [[G3427]] not. [[G3756]]

### 46
Which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] convinceth [[G1651]] me [[G3165]] of [[G4012]] sin? [[G266]] And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I say [[G3004]] the truth, [[G225]] why [[G1302]] ye [[G5210]] do [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] believe [[G4100]] me? [[G3427]]

### 47
He [[G3588]] that is [[G5607]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] heareth [[G191]] God's [[G2316]] words: [[G4487]] ye [[G5210]] therefore [[G1223]] hear [[G191]] not, [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]]

### 48
Then [[G3767]] answered [[G611]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Say [[G3004]] we [[G2249]] not [[G3756]] well [[G2573]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] a Samaritan, [[G4541]] and [[G2532]] hast [[G2192]] a devil? [[G1140]]

### 49
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] I [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] a devil; [[G1140]] but [[G235]] I honour [[G5091]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] do dishonour [[G818]] me. [[G3165]]

### 50
And [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] seek [[G2212]] not [[G3756]] mine own [[G3450]] glory: [[G1391]] there is [[G2076]] one that seeketh [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] judgeth. [[G2919]]

### 51
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] If [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] keep [[G5083]] my [[G1699]] saying, [[G3056]] never [[G3756]] he shall [[G2334]] see [[G2334]] death. [[G2288]]

### 52
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] unto him, [[G846]] Now [[G3568]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] thou hast [[G2192]] a devil. [[G1140]] Abraham [[G11]] is dead, [[G599]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets; [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] thou [[G4771]] sayest, [[G3004]] If [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] keep [[G5083]] my [[G3450]] saying, [[G3056]] never [[G3756]] he shall [[G1089]] taste [[G1089]] of death. [[G2288]]

### 53
Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] greater than [[G3187]] our [[G2257]] father [[G3962]] Abraham, [[G11]] which [[G3748]] is dead? [[G599]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] are dead: [[G599]] whom [[G5101]] makest [[G4160]] thou [[G4771]] thyself? [[G4572]]

### 54
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] If [[G1437]] I [[G1473]] honour [[G1392]] myself, [[G1683]] my [[G3450]] honour [[G1391]] is [[G2076]] nothing: [[G3762]] it is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] that [[G1392]] honoureth [[G1392]] me; [[G3165]] of whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] say, [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] your [[G5216]] God: [[G2316]]

### 55
Yet [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] him; [[G846]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] I should say, [[G2036]] I know [[G1492]] him [[G846]] not, [[G3756]] I shall be [[G2071]] a liar [[G5583]] like [[G3664]] unto [[G5216]] you: [[G5216]] but [[G235]] I know [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G5083]] his [[G846]] saying. [[G3056]]

### 56
Your [[G5216]] father [[G3962]] Abraham [[G11]] rejoiced [[G21]] to [[G2443]] see [[G1492]] my [[G1699]] day: [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] he saw [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] was glad. [[G5463]]

### 57
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Thou art [[G2192]] not yet [[G3768]] fifty [[G4004]] years old, [[G2094]] and [[G2532]] hast thou seen [[G3708]] Abraham? [[G11]]

### 58
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Before [[G4250]] Abraham [[G11]] was, [[G1096]] I [[G1473]] am. [[G1510]]

### 59
Then [[G3767]] took they up [[G142]] stones [[G3037]] to [[G2443]] cast [[G906]] at [[G1909]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] hid himself, [[G2928]] and [[G2532]] went out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] going [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] the midst [[G3319]] of them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] passed by.
