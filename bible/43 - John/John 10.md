### 1
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] He that [[G3588]] entereth [[G1525]] not [[G3361]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sheepfold, [[G833]] but [[G235]] climbeth up [[G305]] some other way, [[G237]] the same [[G1565]] is [[G2076]] a thief [[G2812]] and [[G2532]] a robber. [[G3027]]

### 2
But [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] entereth in [[G1525]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] is [[G2076]] the shepherd [[G4166]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4263]] sheep. [[G4263]]

### 3
To him [[G5129]] the [[G3588]] porter [[G2377]] openeth; [[G455]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] hear [[G191]] his [[G846]] voice: [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] he calleth [[G2564]] his own [[G2398]] sheep [[G4263]] by [[G2596]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] leadeth out. [[G1806]] them [[G846]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] he putteth forth [[G1544]] his [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] sheep, [[G4263]] he [[G846]] goeth [[G4198]] before them, [[G1715]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] follow [[G190]] him: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] they know [[G1492]] his [[G846]] voice. [[G5456]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] a stranger [[G245]] not [[G3756]] will they [[G190]] follow, [[G190]] but [[G235]] will flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] him: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] they know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] of strangers. [[G245]]

### 6
This [[G3778]] parable [[G3942]] spake [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto them: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] they [[G1565]] understood [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] what things [[G5101]] they were [[G2258]] which [[G3739]] he spake [[G2980]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 7
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto them [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] of the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]]

### 8
All that [[G3956]] ever [[G3745]] came [[G2064]] before [[G4253]] me [[G1700]] are [[G1526]] thieves [[G2812]] and [[G2532]] robbers: [[G3027]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] not [[G3756]] did [[G191]] hear [[G191]] them. [[G846]]

### 9
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] door: [[G2374]] by [[G1223]] me [[G1700]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] enter in, [[G1525]] he shall be saved, [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] shall go in [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] out, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] pasture. [[G3542]]

### 10
The [[G3588]] thief [[G2812]] cometh [[G2064]] not, [[G3756]] but [[G1487]] for to [[G2443]] steal, [[G2813]] and [[G2532]] to kill, [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] to destroy: [[G622]] I [[G1473]] am come [[G2064]] that [[G2443]] they might have [[G2192]] life, [[G2222]] and that [[G2532]] they might have [[G2192]] more abundantly. [[G4053]]

### 11
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] shepherd: [[G4166]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] shepherd [[G4166]] giveth [[G5087]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that is an hireling, [[G3411]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]]  the [[G5607]] shepherd, [[G4166]] whose [[G3739]] own [[G2398]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] are [[G1526]] not, [[G3756]] seeth [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] wolf [[G3074]] coming, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] leaveth [[G863]] the [[G3588]] sheep, [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] fleeth: [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wolf [[G3074]] catcheth [[G726]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] scattereth [[G4650]] the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]]

### 13
The [[G3588]] hireling [[G3411]] fleeth, [[G5343]] because [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] an hireling, [[G3411]] and [[G2532]] careth [[G3199]] not [[G3756]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]]

### 14
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] shepherd, [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] know [[G1097]] my [[G1699]] and [[G2532]] am known [[G1097]] of [[G5259]] mine. [[G1699]]

### 15
As [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] knoweth [[G1097]] me, [[G3165]] even so [[G2504]] know I [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Father: [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] I lay down [[G5087]] my [[G3450]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] sheep. [[G4263]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] other [[G243]] sheep [[G4263]] I have, [[G2192]] which [[G3739]] are [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] fold: [[G833]] them also [[G2548]] I [[G3165]] must [[G1163]] bring, [[G71]] and [[G2532]] they shall hear [[G191]] my [[G3450]] voice; [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] there shall be [[G1096]] one [[G1520]] fold, [[G4167]] one [[G1520]] shepherd. [[G4166]]

### 17
Therefore [[G1223]]  my [[G3588]] doth [[G25]] Father [[G3962]] love [[G25]] me, [[G3165]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] lay down [[G5087]] my [[G3450]] life, [[G5590]] that [[G2443]] I might take [[G2983]] it [[G846]] again. [[G3825]]

### 18
No man [[G3762]] taketh [[G142]] it [[G846]] from [[G575]] me, [[G1700]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] lay down [[G5087]] it [[G846]] of [[G575]] myself. [[G1683]] I have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to lay down, [[G5087]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] I have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to take [[G2983]] it [[G846]] again. [[G3825]] This [[G3778]] commandment [[G1785]] have I received [[G2983]] of [[G3844]] my [[G3450]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 19
There was [[G1096]] a division [[G4978]] therefore [[G3767]] again [[G3825]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] for [[G1223]] these [[G5128]] sayings. [[G3056]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] said, [[G3004]] He hath [[G2192]] a devil, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] is mad; [[G3105]] why [[G5101]] hear ye [[G191]] him? [[G846]]

### 21
Others [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] These [[G5023]] are [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] of him that hath a devil. [[G1139]] Can [[G1410]] a [[G3361]] devil [[G1140]] open [[G455]] the eyes [[G3788]] of the blind? [[G5185]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] it was [[G1096]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] the feast of the [[G3588]] dedication, [[G1456]] and [[G2532]] it was [[G2258]] winter. [[G5494]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] walked [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] in [[G1722]] Solomon's [[G4672]] porch. [[G4745]]

### 24
Then [[G3767]] came round about [[G2944]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] How [[G4219]] long [[G2193]] dost thou make to doubt? [[G142]]  us [[G2257]] If [[G1487]] thou [[G4771]] be [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] tell [[G2036]] us [[G2254]] plainly. [[G3954]]

### 25
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] I told [[G2036]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] ye believed [[G4100]] not: [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] do [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] Father's [[G3962]] name, [[G3686]] they [[G5023]] bear witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] me. [[G1700]]

### 26
But [[G235]] ye [[G5210]] believe [[G4100]] not, [[G3756]] because [[G1063]] ye are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] my [[G1699]] sheep, [[G4263]] as [[G2531]] I said [[G2036]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 27
My [[G1699]] sheep [[G4263]] hear [[G191]] my [[G3450]] voice, [[G5456]] and I [[G2504]] know [[G1097]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they follow [[G190]] me: [[G3427]]

### 28
And I [[G2504]] give [[G1325]] unto them [[G846]] eternal [[G166]] life; [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] never [[G3756]] they shall [[G622]] perish, [[G622]] neither [[G2532]] shall [[G726]] any [[G5100]] pluck [[G726]] them [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 29
My [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] which [[G3739]] gave [[G1325]] me, [[G3427]] is [[G2076]] greater than [[G3187]] all; [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3762]] is able to [[G1410]] pluck [[G726]] out of [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] Father's [[G3962]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 30
I [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] are [[G2070]] one. [[G1520]]

### 31
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] took up [[G941]] stones [[G3037]] again [[G3825]] to [[G2443]] stone [[G3034]] him. [[G846]]

### 32
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] Many [[G4183]] good [[G2570]] works [[G2041]] have I shewed [[G1166]] you [[G5213]] from [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] Father; [[G3962]] for [[G1223]] which [[G4169]] of those [[G846]] works [[G2041]] do ye stone [[G3034]] me? [[G3165]]

### 33
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] For [[G4012]] good [[G2570]] a [[G2041]] work [[G2041]] we stone [[G3034]] thee [[G4571]] not; [[G3756]] but [[G235]] for [[G4012]] blasphemy; [[G988]] and [[G2532]] because that [[G3754]] thou, [[G4771]] being [[G5607]] a man, [[G444]] makest [[G4160]] thyself [[G4572]] God. [[G2316]]

### 34
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] Is it [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] law, [[G3551]] I [[G1473]] said, [[G2036]] Ye are [[G2075]] gods? [[G2316]]

### 35
If [[G1487]] he called [[G2036]] them [[G1565]] gods, [[G2316]] unto [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] came, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] cannot [[G1410]] be broken; [[G3089]]

### 36
Say of [[G3004]] ye [[G5210]] him, whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] hath sanctified, [[G37]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] Thou blasphemest; [[G987]] because [[G3754]] I said, [[G2036]] I am [[G1510]] the Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] God? [[G2316]]

### 37
If [[G1487]] I do [[G4160]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G3962]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] believe [[G4100]] me [[G3427]] not. [[G3361]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I do, [[G4160]] though [[G2579]] ye believe [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] me, [[G1698]] believe [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] works: [[G2041]] that [[G2443]] ye may know, [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] believe, [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 39
Therefore [[G3767]] they sought [[G2212]] again [[G3825]] to take [[G4084]] him: [[G846]] but [[G2532]] he escaped [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] went away [[G565]] again [[G3825]] beyond [[G4008]] Jordan [[G2446]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] John [[G2491]] at [[G4413]] first [[G4413]] baptized; [[G907]] and [[G2532]] there [[G1563]] he abode. [[G3306]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] resorted [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] John [[G2491]] did [[G4160]] no [[G3762]] miracle: [[G4592]] but [[G1161]] all things [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] John [[G2491]] spake [[G2036]] of [[G4012]] this man [[G5127]] were [[G2258]] true. [[G227]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him [[G846]] there. [[G1563]]
