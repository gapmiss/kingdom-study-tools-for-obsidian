### 1
After [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] Jesus [[G2424]] walked [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] Galilee: [[G1056]] for [[G1063]] he would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] Jewry, [[G2449]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] sought [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] him. [[G846]]

### 2
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jews' [[G2453]] feast of [[G3588]] tabernacles [[G2258]] was [[G2258]] at hand. [[G1451]]

### 3
His [[G846]] brethren [[G80]] therefore [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Depart [[G3327]] hence, [[G1782]] and [[G2532]] go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] Judaea, [[G2449]] that [[G2443]] thy [[G4675]] disciples [[G3101]] also [[G2532]] may see [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] that [[G3739]] thou [[G4675]] doest. [[G4160]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] no man [[G3762]] doeth [[G4160]] any thing [[G5100]] in [[G1722]] secret, [[G2927]] and [[G2532]] he himself [[G846]] seeketh [[G2212]] to be known [[G1511]] openly. [[G1722]] If [[G1487]] thou do [[G4160]] these things, [[G5023]] shew [[G5319]] thyself [[G4572]] to the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] neither [[G3761]] his [[G846]] did [[G4100]] brethren [[G80]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 6
Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] My [[G1699]] time is [[G3918]] not yet [[G3768]] come: [[G3918]] but [[G1161]] your [[G5212]] time [[G2540]] is [[G2076]] alway [[G3842]] ready. [[G2092]]

### 7
The [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] cannot [[G1410]] hate [[G3404]] you; [[G5209]] but [[G1161]] me [[G1691]] it hateth, [[G3404]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] testify [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] it, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] thereof [[G846]] are [[G2076]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 8
Go up [[G305]] ye [[G5210]] unto [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] feast: [[G1859]] I [[G1473]] go up [[G305]] not yet [[G3768]] unto [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] feast; [[G1859]] for [[G3754]] my [[G1699]] time [[G2540]] not yet [[G3768]] is full [[G4137]] come. [[G4137]]

### 9
When [[G1161]] he had said [[G2036]] these words [[G5023]] unto them, [[G846]] he abode [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] his [[G846]] brethren [[G80]] were gone up, [[G305]] then [[G5119]] went up [[G305]] he [[G846]] also [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] not [[G3756]] openly, [[G5320]] but [[G235]] as it were [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] secret. [[G2927]]

### 11
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] sought [[G2212]] him [[G846]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] Where [[G4226]] is [[G2076]] he? [[G1565]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] there was [[G2258]] much [[G4183]] murmuring [[G1112]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] concerning [[G4012]] him: [[G846]] for some [[G3588]] said, [[G3004]] He is [[G2076]] a good man: [[G18]] others [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] Nay; [[G3756]] but [[G235]] he deceiveth [[G4105]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G3793]]

### 13
Howbeit [[G3305]] no man [[G3762]] spake [[G2980]] openly [[G3954]] of [[G4012]] him [[G846]] for [[G1223]] fear of [[G2453]] the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 14
Now [[G2235]] about the midst [[G3322]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1859]] feast [[G1859]] Jesus [[G2424]] went up [[G305]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] taught. [[G1321]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] marvelled, [[G2296]] saying, [[G3004]] How [[G4459]] knoweth [[G1492]] this man [[G3778]] letters, [[G1121]] never [[G3361]] having [[G3129]] learned? [[G3129]]

### 16
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] My [[G1699]] doctrine [[G1322]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] mine, [[G1699]] but [[G235]] his that sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 17
If [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] will [[G2309]] do [[G4160]] his [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] he shall know [[G1097]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] doctrine, [[G1322]] whether [[G4220]] it be [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] or [[G2228]] I [[G1473]] speak [[G2980]] of [[G575]] myself. [[G1683]]

### 18
He [[G3588]] that speaketh [[G2980]] of [[G575]] himself [[G1438]] seeketh [[G2212]] his own [[G2398]] glory: [[G1391]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that seeketh [[G2212]] his [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] that sent [[G3992]] him, [[G846]] the same [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] true, [[G227]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] unrighteousness [[G93]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 19
not [[G3756]] Did [[G1325]] Moses [[G3475]] give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] none [[G3762]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] keepeth [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] law? [[G3551]] Why [[G5101]] go ye about [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] me? [[G3165]]

### 20
The [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Thou hast [[G2192]] a devil: [[G1140]] who [[G5101]] goeth about [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] thee? [[G4571]]

### 21
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I have done [[G4160]] one [[G1520]] work, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] ye [[G2296]] marvel. [[G2296]]

### 22
Moses [[G3475]] therefore [[G1223]] gave [[G1325]] unto you [[G5213]] circumcision; [[G4061]] (not [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] Moses, [[G3475]] but [[G235]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fathers;) [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1722]] ye [[G4059]] the sabbath day [[G4521]] circumcise [[G4059]] a man. [[G444]]

### 23
If [[G1487]] a man [[G444]] on [[G1722]] the sabbath day [[G4521]] receive [[G2983]] circumcision, [[G4061]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of Moses [[G3475]] not [[G3361]] should be [[G3089]] broken; [[G3089]] are ye angry [[G5520]] at me, [[G1698]] because [[G3754]] I have made [[G4160]] a man [[G444]] every whit [[G3650]] whole [[G5199]] on [[G1722]] the sabbath day? [[G4521]]

### 24
Judge [[G2919]] not [[G3361]] according to [[G2596]] the appearance, [[G3799]] but [[G235]] judge [[G2919]] righteous [[G1342]] judgment. [[G2920]]

### 25
Then [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G3588]] of Jerusalem, [[G2415]] Is he, [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] whom [[G3739]] they seek [[G2212]] to kill? [[G615]]

### 26
But, [[G2532]] lo, [[G1492]] he speaketh [[G2980]] boldly, [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] they say [[G3004]] nothing [[G3762]] unto him. [[G846]] Do [[G3379]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] know [[G1097]] indeed [[G230]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] very [[G230]] Christ? [[G5547]]

### 27
Howbeit [[G235]] we know [[G1492]] this man [[G5126]] whence [[G4159]] he is: [[G2076]] but [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] Christ [[G5547]] cometh, [[G2064]] no man [[G3762]] knoweth [[G1097]] whence [[G4159]] he is. [[G2076]]

### 28
Then [[G3767]] cried [[G2896]] Jesus [[G2424]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] as he taught, [[G1321]] saying, [[G3004]] both me, [[G2504]] Ye [[G1492]] know [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] ye know [[G1492]] whence [[G4159]] I am: [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] I am [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] of [[G575]] myself, [[G1683]] but [[G235]] he [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me [[G3165]] is [[G2076]] true, [[G228]] whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] know [[G1492]] not. [[G3756]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] him: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] from [[G3844]] him, [[G846]] and he [[G2548]] hath sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 30
Then [[G3767]] they sought [[G2212]] to take [[G4084]] him: [[G846]] but [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] laid [[G1911]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] his [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] not yet [[G3768]] was [[G2064]] come. [[G2064]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] When [[G3752]] Christ [[G5547]] cometh, [[G2064]] will he do [[G4160]] more [[G4119]] miracles [[G4592]] than these [[G5130]] which [[G3739]] this [[G3778]] hath done? [[G4160]]

### 32
The [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] that [[G1111]] people [[G3793]] murmured [[G1111]] such things [[G5023]] concerning [[G4012]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] sent [[G649]] officers [[G5257]] to [[G2443]] take [[G4084]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto them, [[G846]] Yet [[G2089]] a little [[G3398]] while [[G5550]] am I [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] I go [[G5217]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 34
Ye shall seek [[G2212]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2147]] find [[G2147]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am, [[G1510]] ye [[G5210]] cannot [[G3756]] come. [[G2064]]

### 35
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] Whither [[G4226]] will [[G3195]] he [[G3778]] go, [[G4198]] that [[G3754]] we [[G2249]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2147]] find [[G2147]] him? [[G846]] will he [[G3195]] go [[G4198]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] dispersed [[G1290]] among the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1672]] and [[G2532]] teach [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles? [[G1672]]

### 36
What [[G5101]] saying [[G3056]] is [[G2076]] this [[G3778]] that [[G3739]] he said, [[G2036]] Ye shall seek [[G2212]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2147]] find [[G2147]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am, [[G1510]] ye [[G5210]] cannot [[G3756]] come? [[G2064]]

### 37
In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day, [[G2250]] that [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] of the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] cried, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] thirst, [[G1372]] let him come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] drink. [[G4095]]

### 38
He [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] me, [[G1691]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] hath said, [[G2036]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] belly [[G2836]] shall flow [[G4482]] rivers [[G4215]] of [[G5204]] living [[G2198]] water. [[G5204]]

### 39
(But [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] spake he [[G2036]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] which [[G3739]] they that believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him [[G846]] should [[G3195]] receive: [[G2983]] for [[G1063]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] was [[G2258]] not yet [[G3768]] because that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] not yet [[G3764]] was [[G1392]] glorified.) [[G1392]]

### 40
Many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] this [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] therefore, [[G3767]] when they heard [[G191]] saying, [[G3056]] said, [[G3004]] Of a truth [[G230]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Prophet. [[G4396]]

### 41
Others [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]] But [[G1161]] some [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] Shall [[G2064]] Christ [[G5547]] come [[G2064]] out of [[G1537]] Galilee? [[G1056]]

### 42
not [[G3780]] Hath [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] said, [[G2036]] That [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] cometh [[G2064]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] seed [[G4690]] of David, [[G1138]] and [[G2532]] out [[G575]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2968]] town [[G2968]] of Bethlehem, [[G965]] where [[G3699]] David [[G1138]] was? [[G2258]]

### 43
So [[G3767]] there was [[G1096]] a division [[G4978]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] because [[G1223]] of him. [[G846]]

### 44
And [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] would have [[G2309]] taken [[G4084]] him; [[G846]] but [[G235]] no man [[G3762]] laid [[G1911]] hands [[G1909]] on [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 45
Then [[G3767]] came [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] to [[G4314]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees; [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] they [[G1565]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G1302]] not [[G3756]] have ye [[G71]] brought [[G71]] him? [[G846]]

### 46
The [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] answered, [[G611]] Never [[G3763]] man [[G444]] spake [[G2980]] like [[G5613]] this [[G3778]] man. [[G444]]

### 47
Then [[G3767]] answered [[G611]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] ye [[G5210]] Are [[G4105]] also [[G2532]] deceived? [[G4105]]

### 48
Have [[G4100]] any [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] or [[G2228]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him? [[G846]]

### 49
But [[G235]] this [[G3778]] people [[G3793]] who knoweth [[G1097]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] are [[G1526]] cursed. [[G1944]]

### 50
Nicodemus [[G3530]] saith [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] (he that came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus [[G846]] by night, [[G3571]] being [[G5607]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them,) [[G846]]

### 51
Doth [[G2919]] our [[G2257]] law [[G3551]] judge [[G2919]] man, [[G444]] before [[G4386]] it hear [[G191]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] know [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] he doeth? [[G4160]]

### 52
They answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] Galilee? [[G1056]] Search, [[G2045]] and [[G2532]] look: [[G1492]] for [[G3754]] out of [[G1537]] Galilee [[G1056]] ariseth [[G1453]] no [[G3756]] prophet. [[G4396]]

### 53
And [[G2532]] every man [[G1538]] went [[G4198]] unto [[G1519]] his own [[G846]] house. [[G3624]]
