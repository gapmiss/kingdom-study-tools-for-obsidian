### 1
The [[G3588]] first [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4521]] week [[G4521]] cometh [[G2064]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] early, [[G4404]] when it was [[G5607]] yet [[G2089]] dark, [[G4653]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] seeth [[G991]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] taken away [[G142]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre. [[G3419]]

### 2
Then [[G3767]] she runneth, [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] cometh [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciple, [[G3101]] whom [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved, [[G5368]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] They have taken away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] we know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] where [[G4226]] they have laid [[G5087]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
Peter [[G4074]] therefore [[G3767]] went forth, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciple, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre. [[G3419]]

### 4
So [[G1161]] they ran [[G5143]] both [[G1417]] together: [[G3674]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciple [[G3101]] did outrun [[G4390]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] first [[G4413]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre. [[G3419]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] he stooping down, [[G3879]] saw [[G991]] the linen [[G3588]] clothes [[G3608]] lying; [[G2749]] yet [[G3305]] went he in. [[G1525]] not [[G3756]]

### 6
Then [[G3767]] cometh [[G2064]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] following [[G190]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] seeth [[G2334]] the linen [[G3588]] clothes [[G3608]] lie, [[G2749]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] napkin, [[G4676]] that [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] about [[G1909]] his [[G846]] head, [[G2776]] not [[G3756]] lying [[G2749]] with [[G3326]] the linen [[G3588]] clothes, [[G3608]] but [[G235]] wrapped together [[G1794]] in [[G1519]] a [[G1520]] place [[G5117]] by itself. [[G5565]]

### 8
Then [[G5119]] went in [[G1525]] also [[G2532]] that other [[G243]] disciple, [[G3101]] which [[G3588]] came [[G2064]] first [[G4413]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] he saw, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] believed. [[G4100]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] as yet not [[G3764]] they knew [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] scripture, [[G1124]] that [[G3754]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] rise again [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 10
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] disciples went [[G3101]] away [[G565]] again [[G3825]] unto [[G4314]] their own home. [[G1438]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] stood [[G2476]] without [[G1854]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre [[G3419]] weeping: [[G2799]] and [[G3767]] as [[G5613]] she wept, [[G2799]] she stooped down, [[G3879]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] seeth [[G2334]] two [[G1417]] angels [[G32]] in [[G1722]] white [[G3022]] sitting, [[G2516]] the one [[G1520]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] head, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] the other [[G1520]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] feet, [[G4228]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of had [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] lain. [[G2749]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] they [[G1565]] say [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Woman, [[G1135]] why [[G5101]] weepest thou? [[G2799]] She saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Because [[G3754]] they have taken away [[G142]] my [[G3450]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] I know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] where [[G4226]] they have laid [[G5087]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] thus [[G5023]] when she had [[G2036]] said, [[G2036]] she turned herself [[G4762]] back, [[G3694]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2334]] Jesus [[G2424]] standing, [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] knew [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G2076]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 15
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Woman, [[G1135]] why [[G5101]] weepest thou? [[G2799]] whom [[G5101]] seekest thou? [[G2212]] She, [[G1565]] supposing [[G1380]] him [[G3754]] to be [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] gardener, [[G2780]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Sir, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] thou [[G4771]] have borne hence, [[G941]] him [[G846]] tell [[G2036]] me [[G3427]] where [[G4226]] thou hast laid [[G5087]] him, [[G846]] and I [[G2504]] will take away. [[G142]] him [[G846]]

### 16
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Mary. [[G3137]] She turned herself, [[G4762]] and saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Rabboni; [[G4462]] which [[G3739]] is to say, [[G3004]] Master. [[G1320]]

### 17
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Touch [[G680]] me [[G3450]] not; [[G3361]] for [[G1063]] not yet [[G3768]] I am [[G305]] ascended [[G305]] to [[G4314]] my [[G3450]] Father: [[G3962]] but [[G1161]] go [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] say [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I ascend [[G305]] unto [[G4314]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] Father; [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] God. [[G2316]]

### 18
Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] came [[G2064]] and told [[G518]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] that [[G3754]] she had seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] he had spoken [[G2036]] these things [[G5023]] unto her. [[G846]]

### 19
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] the [[G3588]] day at [[G2250]] evening, [[G3798]] being [[G5607]] the [[G3588]] first [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3588]] week, [[G4521]] when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] doors [[G2374]] were shut [[G2808]] where [[G3699]] disciples [[G3101]] were [[G2258]] assembled [[G4863]] for [[G1223]] fear of [[G5401]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] came [[G2064]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] stood [[G2476]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] midst, [[G3319]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Peace [[G1515]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] so [[G5124]] when he had [[G2036]] said, [[G2036]] he shewed [[G1166]] unto them [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] side. [[G4125]] Then [[G3767]] were [[G5463]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] glad, [[G5463]] when they saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 21
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] to them [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] Peace [[G1515]] unto you: [[G5213]] as [[G2531]] Father [[G3962]] hath sent [[G649]] me, [[G3165]] even so [[G2504]] send I [[G3992]] you. [[G5209]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] when he had said [[G2036]] this, [[G5124]] he breathed on [[G1720]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Receive ye [[G2983]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost: [[G4151]]

### 23
Whose [[G5100]] soever [[G302]] sins [[G266]] ye remit, [[G863]] they are remitted [[G863]] unto them; [[G846]] whose [[G5100]] soever [[G302]] ye retain, [[G2902]] they are retained. [[G2902]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] Thomas, [[G2381]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] twelve, [[G1427]] called [[G3004]] Didymus, [[G1324]] was [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] with [[G3326]] them [[G846]] when [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] came. [[G2064]]

### 25
The [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciples [[G3101]] therefore [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] We have seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] he [[G3588]] But [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Except [[G1437]] I shall see [[G1492]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] the [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] of the [[G3588]] print [[G5179]] nails, [[G2247]] and [[G2532]] put [[G906]] my [[G3450]] finger [[G1147]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] print [[G5179]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2247]] nails, [[G2247]] and [[G2532]] thrust [[G906]] my [[G3450]] hand [[G5495]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] side, [[G4125]] not [[G3756]] I will [[G4100]] believe. [[G4100]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] eight [[G3638]] days [[G2250]] again [[G3825]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were [[G2258]] within, [[G2080]] and [[G2532]] Thomas [[G2381]] with [[G3326]] them: [[G846]] came [[G2064]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] doors [[G2374]] being shut, [[G2808]] and [[G2532]] stood [[G2476]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] midst, [[G3319]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Peace [[G1515]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 27
Then [[G1534]] saith he [[G3004]] to [[G2381]] Thomas, [[G2381]] Reach [[G5342]] hither [[G5602]] thy [[G4675]] finger, [[G1147]] and [[G2532]] behold [[G1492]] my [[G3450]] hands; [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] reach hither [[G5342]] thy [[G4675]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] thrust [[G906]] into [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] side: [[G4125]] and [[G2532]] be [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] faithless, [[G571]] but [[G235]] believing. [[G4103]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] Thomas [[G2381]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] My [[G3450]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] God. [[G2316]]

### 29
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Thomas, [[G2381]] because [[G3754]] thou hast seen [[G3708]] me, [[G3165]] thou hast believed: [[G4100]] blessed [[G3107]] they that [[G3588]] not [[G3361]] have [[G1492]] seen, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] have believed. [[G4100]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] other [[G243]] signs [[G4592]] truly [[G3303]] did [[G4160]] Jesus [[G2424]] in the presence of [[G1799]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] which [[G3739]] are [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] book: [[G975]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] these [[G5023]] are written, [[G1125]] that [[G2443]] ye might believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] believing [[G4100]] ye might have [[G2192]] life [[G2222]] through [[G1722]] his [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]
