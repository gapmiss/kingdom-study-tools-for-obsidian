### 1
After [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] Jesus [[G2424]] shewed [[G5319]] himself [[G1438]] again [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3101]] disciples [[G3101]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] of [[G5085]] Tiberias; [[G5085]] and [[G1161]] on this wise [[G3779]] shewed he [[G5319]]

### 2
There were [[G2258]] together [[G3674]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] Thomas [[G2381]] called [[G3004]] Didymus, [[G1324]] and [[G2532]] Nathanael [[G3482]] of [[G575]] Cana [[G2580]]  in [[G3588]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2199]] Zebedee, [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] other [[G243]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 3
Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] I go [[G5217]] a fishing. [[G232]] They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] We [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] go [[G2064]] with [[G4862]] thee. [[G4671]] They went forth, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] entered [[G305]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] immediately; [[G2117]] and [[G2532]] that [[G1565]] night [[G3571]] they caught [[G4084]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 4
But when [[G1161]] the morning [[G4405]] was now [[G2235]] come, [[G1096]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] shore: [[G123]] but [[G3305]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] knew [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G2076]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 5
Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Children, [[G3813]] have ye [[G2192]] any [[G5100]] meat? [[G4371]] They [[G611]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] No. [[G3756]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Cast [[G906]] the [[G3588]] net [[G1350]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] right [[G1188]] side [[G3313]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4143]] ship, [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] ye shall find. [[G2147]] They [[G906]] cast [[G906]] therefore, [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] now [[G2089]] not [[G3756]] they were [[G2480]] able [[G2480]] to draw [[G1670]] it [[G846]] for [[G575]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G4128]] of [[G2486]] fishes. [[G2486]]

### 7
Therefore [[G3767]] that [[G1565]] disciple [[G3101]] whom [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved [[G25]] saith [[G3004]] unto [[G4074]] Peter, [[G4074]] It is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] Now when [[G3767]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] he girt [[G1241]] fisher's coat [[G1903]] (for [[G1063]] he was [[G2258]] naked,) [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] did cast [[G906]] himself [[G1438]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] disciples [[G3101]] came in [[G2064]]  a little [[G3588]] ship; [[G4142]] (for [[G1063]] they were [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] far [[G3112]] from [[G575]] land, [[G1093]] but [[G235]] as it were [[G5613]] two hundred [[G1250]] cubits,) [[G4083]] dragging [[G4951]] the [[G3588]] net [[G1350]]  with [[G3588]] fishes. [[G2486]]

### 9
As soon [[G5613]] then [[G3767]] as they were come [[G576]] to [[G1519]] land, [[G1093]] they saw [[G991]] a fire of coals [[G439]] there, [[G2749]] and [[G2532]] fish [[G3795]] laid thereon, [[G1945]] and [[G2532]] bread. [[G740]]

### 10
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Bring [[G5342]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fish [[G3795]] which [[G3739]] ye have [[G4084]] now [[G3568]] caught. [[G4084]]

### 11
Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] went up, [[G305]] and [[G2532]] drew [[G1670]] the [[G3588]] net [[G1350]] to [[G1909]] land [[G1093]] full [[G3324]] of great [[G3173]] fishes, [[G2486]] an hundred [[G1540]] and fifty [[G4004]] and three: [[G5140]] and [[G2532]] for all there were [[G5607]] so many, [[G5118]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] net [[G1350]] yet was broken. [[G4977]]

### 12
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Come [[G1205]] dine. [[G709]] And [[G1161]] none [[G3762]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples [[G3101]] durst [[G5111]] ask [[G1833]] him, [[G846]] Who [[G5101]] art [[G1488]] thou? [[G4771]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 13
Jesus [[G2424]] then [[G3767]] cometh, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] taketh [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] giveth [[G1325]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] fish [[G3795]] likewise. [[G3668]]

### 14
This [[G5124]] is now [[G2235]] the third time [[G5154]] that [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] shewed himself [[G5319]] to his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] after that he was risen [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 15
So [[G3767]] when [[G3753]] they had dined, [[G709]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] to [[G4613]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter, [[G4074]] Simon, [[G4613]] of Jonas, [[G2495]] lovest thou [[G25]] me [[G3165]] more than [[G4119]] these? [[G5130]] He [[G3004]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Yea, [[G3483]] Lord; [[G2962]] thou [[G4771]] knowest [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I love [[G5368]] thee. [[G4571]] He saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Feed [[G1006]] my [[G3450]] lambs. [[G721]]

### 16
He saith [[G3004]] to him [[G846]] again [[G3825]] the second time, [[G1208]] Simon, [[G4613]] of Jonas, [[G2495]] lovest thou [[G25]] me? [[G3165]] He [[G3004]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Yea, [[G3483]] Lord; [[G2962]] thou [[G4771]] knowest [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I love [[G5368]] thee. [[G4571]] He saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Feed [[G4165]] my [[G3450]] sheep. [[G4263]]

### 17
He saith [[G3004]] unto him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] third time, [[G5154]] Simon, [[G4613]] of Jonas, [[G2495]] lovest thou [[G5368]] me? [[G3165]] Peter [[G4074]] was grieved [[G3076]] because [[G3754]] he said [[G2036]] unto him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] third time, [[G5154]] Lovest thou [[G5368]] me? [[G3165]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] thou [[G4771]] knowest [[G1492]] all things; [[G3956]] thou [[G4771]] knowest [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I love [[G5368]] thee. [[G4571]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Feed [[G1006]] my [[G3450]] sheep. [[G4263]]

### 18
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] When [[G3753]] thou wast [[G2258]] young, [[G3501]] thou girdedst [[G2224]] thyself, [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] walkedst [[G4043]] whither [[G3699]] thou wouldest: [[G2309]] but [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] thou shalt be old, [[G1095]] thou shalt stretch forth [[G1614]] thy [[G4675]] hands, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] shall gird [[G2224]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] carry [[G5342]] whither [[G3699]] thou wouldest [[G2309]] not. [[G3756]]

### 19
This [[G5124]] spake he, [[G2036]] signifying [[G4591]] by what [[G4169]] death [[G2288]] he should glorify [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]] And [[G2532]] when he had spoken [[G2036]] this, [[G5124]] he saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 20
Then [[G1161]] Peter, [[G4074]] turning about, [[G1994]] seeth [[G991]] the [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] whom [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved [[G25]] following; [[G190]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] leaned [[G377]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] breast [[G4738]] at [[G1722]] supper, [[G1173]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] which [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] he that [[G3588]] betrayeth [[G3860]] thee? [[G4571]]

### 21
Peter [[G4074]] seeing [[G1492]] him [[G5126]] saith [[G3004]] to [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G1161]] what [[G5101]] this man [[G3778]]

### 22
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1437]] I will that [[G2309]] he [[G846]] tarry [[G3306]] till [[G2193]] I come, [[G2064]] what [[G5101]] to [[G4314]] thee? [[G4571]] follow [[G190]] thou [[G4771]] me. [[G3427]]

### 23
Then [[G3767]] went abroad [[G1831]] this [[G3778]] saying [[G3056]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] that [[G1565]] disciple [[G3101]] not [[G3756]] should die: [[G599]] yet [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] unto him, [[G846]] He shall [[G599]] not [[G3756]] die; [[G599]] but, [[G235]] If [[G1437]] I will that [[G2309]] he [[G846]] tarry [[G3306]] till [[G2193]] I come, [[G2064]] what [[G5101]] to [[G4314]] thee? [[G4571]]

### 24
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] which [[G3588]] testifieth [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] these things, [[G5130]] and [[G2532]] wrote [[G1125]] these things: [[G5023]] and [[G2532]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] testimony [[G3141]] is [[G2076]] true. [[G227]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] there are [[G2076]] also [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] other things [[G243]] which [[G3745]] Jesus [[G2424]] did, [[G4160]] the which, [[G3748]] if [[G1437]] they should be written [[G1125]] every [[G2596]] one, [[G1520]] I suppose that [[G3633]] even the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] itself [[G846]] not [[G3761]] could [[G5562]] contain [[G5562]] the [[G3588]] books [[G975]] that should be written. [[G1125]] Amen. [[G281]]
