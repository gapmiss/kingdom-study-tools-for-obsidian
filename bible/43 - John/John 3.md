### 1
There [[G1161]] was [[G2258]] a man [[G444]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] named [[G3686]] Nicodemus, [[G3530]] a ruler [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews: [[G2453]]

### 2
The same [[G3778]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus [[G2424]] by night, [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Rabbi, [[G4461]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] thou art [[G2064]] a teacher [[G1320]] come [[G2064]] from [[G575]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] no man [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] these [[G5023]] miracles [[G4592]] that [[G3739]] thou [[G4771]] doest, [[G4160]] except [[G3361]] God [[G2316]] be [[G5600]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Except [[G3361]] a man [[G5100]] be born [[G1080]] again, [[G509]] he cannot [[G1410]] see [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 4
Nicodemus [[G3530]] saith [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] a man [[G444]] be born [[G1080]] when he is [[G5607]] old? [[G1088]] can he [[G1410]] enter [[G1525]] the second time [[G1208]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] mother's [[G3384]] womb, [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] be born? [[G1080]]

### 5
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Except [[G3361]] a man [[G5100]] be born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] the Spirit, [[G4151]] he cannot [[G1410]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 6
That [[G3588]] which is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] is [[G2076]] flesh; [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3588]] which is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] is [[G2076]] spirit. [[G4151]]

### 7
Marvel [[G2296]] not [[G3361]] that [[G3754]] I said [[G2036]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Ye [[G5209]] must [[G1163]] be born [[G1080]] again. [[G509]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] wind [[G4151]] bloweth [[G4154]] where [[G3699]] it listeth, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] thou hearest [[G191]] the [[G3588]] sound [[G5456]] thereof, [[G846]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] canst [[G1492]] tell [[G1492]] whence [[G4159]] it cometh, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] whither [[G4226]] it goeth: [[G5217]] so [[G3779]] is [[G2076]] every [[G3956]] one [[G3588]] that is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 9
Nicodemus [[G3530]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] these things [[G5023]] be? [[G1096]]

### 10
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] a [[G3588]] master [[G1320]] of [[G2474]] Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] knowest [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] these things? [[G5023]]

### 11
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] We speak [[G2980]] that [[G3739]] we do know, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] testify [[G3140]] that [[G3739]] we have seen; [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] ye receive [[G2983]] not [[G3756]] our [[G2257]] witness. [[G3141]]

### 12
If [[G1487]] I have told [[G2036]] you [[G5213]] earthly [[G1919]] things, [[G1919]] and [[G2532]] ye believe [[G4100]] not, [[G3756]] how [[G4459]] shall ye believe, [[G4100]] if [[G1437]] I tell [[G2036]] you [[G5213]] heavenly [[G2032]] things? [[G2032]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] hath ascended up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] but [[G3361]] he that [[G3588]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] which [[G3588]] is [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] Moses [[G3475]] lifted up [[G5312]] the [[G3588]] serpent [[G3789]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] even so [[G3779]] must [[G1163]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] be lifted up: [[G5312]]

### 15
That [[G2443]] whosoever [[G3956]] believeth [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] him [[G846]] not [[G3361]] should [[G622]] perish, [[G622]] but [[G235]] have [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] so [[G3779]] loved [[G25]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] that [[G5620]] he gave [[G1325]] his [[G846]] only [[G3439]] begotten [[G3439]] Son, [[G5207]] that [[G2443]] whosoever [[G3956]] believeth [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] him [[G846]] not [[G3361]] should [[G622]] perish, [[G622]] but [[G235]] have [[G2192]] everlasting [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] sent [[G649]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] to [[G2443]] condemn [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world; [[G2889]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] through [[G1223]] him [[G846]] might be saved. [[G4982]]

### 18
He [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him [[G846]] not [[G3756]] is [[G2919]] condemned: [[G2919]] but [[G1161]] he that believeth [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] is condemned [[G2919]] already, [[G2235]] because [[G3754]] not [[G3361]] he hath [[G4100]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of only [[G3439]] begotten [[G3439]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] condemnation, [[G2920]] that [[G3754]] light [[G5457]] is come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] men [[G444]] loved [[G25]] darkness [[G4655]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] light, [[G5457]] because [[G1063]] their [[G846]] deeds [[G2041]] were [[G2258]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] every one that [[G3956]] doeth [[G4238]] evil [[G5337]] hateth [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] neither [[G2532]] cometh [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] lest [[G3361]] his [[G846]] deeds [[G2041]] should be reproved. [[G1651]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] he that doeth [[G4160]] truth [[G225]] cometh [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] that [[G2443]] his [[G846]] deeds [[G2041]] may be made manifest, [[G5319]] that [[G3754]] they are [[G2076]] wrought [[G2038]] in [[G1722]] God. [[G2316]]

### 22
After [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] came [[G2064]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] into [[G1519]] the land [[G1093]] of [[G2453]] Judaea; [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] there [[G1563]] he tarried [[G1304]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] baptized. [[G907]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] also [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] baptizing [[G907]] in [[G1722]] Aenon [[G137]] near [[G1451]] to [[G4530]] Salim, [[G4530]] because [[G3754]] there was [[G2258]] much [[G4183]] water [[G5204]] there: [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] they came, [[G3854]] and [[G2532]] were baptized. [[G907]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] was [[G2258]] not yet [[G3768]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison. [[G5438]]

### 25
Then [[G3767]] there arose [[G1096]] a question [[G2214]] between and [[G3326]] of [[G1537]] John's [[G2491]] disciples [[G3101]] the Jews [[G2453]] about [[G4012]] purifying. [[G2512]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Rabbi, [[G4461]] he that [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] thee [[G4675]] beyond [[G4008]] Jordan, [[G2446]] to whom [[G3739]] thou [[G4771]] barest witness, [[G3140]] behold, [[G1492]] the same [[G3778]] baptizeth, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] him. [[G846]]

### 27
John [[G2491]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] A man [[G444]] can [[G1410]] receive [[G2983]] nothing, [[G3762]] except [[G3361]] it be [[G5600]] given [[G1325]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 28
Ye [[G5210]] yourselves [[G846]] me [[G3427]] bear [[G3140]] witness, [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] I said, [[G2036]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] but [[G235]] that [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] sent [[G649]] before [[G1715]] him. [[G1565]]

### 29
He [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] bride [[G3565]] is [[G2076]] the bridegroom: [[G3566]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] friend [[G5384]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3566]] bridegroom, [[G3566]] which [[G3588]] standeth [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] heareth [[G191]] him, [[G846]] rejoiceth [[G5463]] greatly [[G5479]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3566]] bridegroom's [[G3566]] voice: [[G5456]] this [[G3778]] my [[G1699]] joy [[G5479]] therefore [[G3767]] is fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 30
He [[G1565]] must [[G1163]] increase, [[G837]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1691]] decrease. [[G1642]]

### 31
He that cometh [[G2064]] from [[G509]] above [[G509]] is [[G2076]] above [[G1883]] all: [[G3956]] he [[G3588]] that is [[G5607]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] is [[G2076]] earthly, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] speaketh [[G2980]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] he that cometh [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G2076]] above [[G1883]] all. [[G3956]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] he hath seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] heard, [[G191]] that [[G5124]] he testifieth; [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] receiveth [[G2983]] his [[G846]] testimony. [[G3141]]

### 33
He [[G3588]] that hath received [[G2983]] his [[G846]] testimony [[G3141]] hath set to his seal [[G4972]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] true. [[G227]]

### 34
For [[G1063]] he whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath sent [[G649]] speaketh [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] giveth [[G1325]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] by [[G1537]] measure [[G3358]]

### 35
The [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] loveth [[G25]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] hath given [[G1325]] all things [[G3956]] into [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 36
He [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] hath [[G2192]] everlasting [[G166]] life: [[G2222]] and [[G1161]] he that believeth not [[G544]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G3700]] see [[G3700]] life; [[G2222]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] abideth [[G3306]] on [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]
