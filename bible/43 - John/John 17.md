### 1
These words [[G5023]] spake [[G2980]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] lifted up [[G1869]] his [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Father, [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] is come; [[G2064]] glorify [[G1392]] thy [[G4675]] Son, [[G5207]] that [[G2443]] thy [[G4675]] Son [[G5207]] also [[G2532]] may glorify [[G1392]] thee: [[G4571]]

### 2
As [[G2531]] thou hast given [[G1325]] him [[G846]] power over [[G1849]] all [[G3956]] flesh, [[G4561]] that [[G2443]] he should give [[G1325]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]]  to [[G846]] as many [[G3956]] as [[G3739]] thou hast given [[G1325]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] life [[G2222]] eternal, [[G166]] that [[G2443]] they might know [[G1097]] thee [[G4571]] the [[G3588]] only [[G3441]] true [[G228]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] whom [[G3739]] thou hast sent. [[G649]]

### 4
I [[G1473]] have glorified [[G1392]] thee [[G4571]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] I have finished [[G5048]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] thou gavest [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] to [[G2443]] do. [[G4160]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] O Father, [[G3962]] glorify [[G1392]] thou [[G4771]] me [[G3165]] with [[G3844]] thine own self [[G4572]]  with the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] which [[G3739]] I had [[G2192]] with [[G3844]] thee [[G4671]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] was. [[G1511]]

### 6
I have manifested [[G5319]] thy [[G4675]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G444]] men [[G444]] which [[G3739]] thou gavest [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world: [[G2889]] thine [[G4674]] they were, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] thou gavest [[G1325]] them [[G846]] me; [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] they have kept [[G5083]] thy [[G4675]] word. [[G3056]]

### 7
Now [[G3568]] they have known [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] all things [[G3956]] whatsoever [[G3745]] thou hast given [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] are [[G2076]] of [[G3844]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 8
For [[G3754]] I have given [[G1325]] unto them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] which [[G3739]] thou gavest [[G1325]] me; [[G3427]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] have received [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] have known [[G1097]] surely [[G230]] that [[G3754]] I came out [[G1831]] from [[G3844]] thee, [[G4675]] and [[G2532]] they have believed [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] didst send [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 9
I [[G1473]] pray [[G2065]] for [[G4012]] them: [[G846]] I pray [[G2065]] not [[G3756]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] for [[G4012]] them which [[G3739]] thou hast given [[G1325]] me; [[G3427]] for [[G3754]] they are [[G1526]] thine. [[G4671]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] mine [[G1699]] are [[G2076]] thine, [[G4674]] and [[G2532]] thine [[G4674]] are mine; [[G1699]] and [[G2532]] I am glorified [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] them. [[G846]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] now I am [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] more [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] thee. [[G4571]] Holy [[G40]] Father, [[G3962]] keep [[G5083]] through [[G1722]] thine own [[G4675]] name [[G3686]] those [[G846]] whom [[G3739]] thou hast given [[G1325]] me, [[G3427]] that [[G2443]] they may be [[G5600]] one, [[G1520]] as [[G2531]] we [[G2249]]

### 12
While [[G3753]] I was [[G2252]] with [[G3326]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] I [[G1473]] kept [[G5083]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] name: [[G3686]] those that [[G3739]] thou gavest [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] I have kept, [[G5442]] and [[G2532]] none [[G3762]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] is lost, [[G622]] but [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of [[G684]] perdition; [[G684]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] might be fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] come I [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] thee; [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] these things [[G5023]] I speak [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] that [[G2443]] they might have [[G2192]] my [[G1699]] joy [[G5479]] fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] themselves. [[G846]]

### 14
I [[G1473]] have given [[G1325]] them [[G846]] thy [[G4675]] word; [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] hath hated [[G3404]] them, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1526]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] even as [[G2531]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 15
I pray [[G2065]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] thou shouldest take [[G142]] them [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] thou shouldest keep [[G5083]] them [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 16
They are [[G1526]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] even as [[G2531]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 17
Sanctify [[G37]] them [[G846]] through [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] truth: [[G225]] thy [[G4674]] word [[G3056]] is [[G2076]] truth. [[G225]]

### 18
As [[G2531]] thou hast sent [[G649]] me [[G1691]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] even so have I also [[G2504]] sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] for [[G5228]] their sakes [[G846]] I [[G1473]] sanctify [[G37]] myself, [[G1683]] that [[G2443]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] might be [[G5600]] sanctified [[G37]] through [[G1722]] the truth. [[G225]]

### 20
Neither [[G3756]] pray I [[G2065]] for [[G4012]] these [[G5130]] alone, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] for [[G4012]] them [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] which shall believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] me [[G1691]] through [[G1223]] their [[G846]] word; [[G3056]]

### 21
That [[G2443]] they all [[G3956]] may be [[G5600]] one; [[G1520]] as [[G2531]] thou, [[G4771]] Father, [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] thee, [[G4671]] that [[G2443]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] may be [[G5600]] one [[G1520]] in [[G1722]] us: [[G2254]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] may believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] hast sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] which [[G3739]] thou gavest [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] I [[G1473]] have given [[G1325]] them; [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they may be [[G5600]] one, [[G1520]] even as [[G2531]] we [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] one: [[G1520]]

### 23
I [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] thou [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] that [[G2443]] they may be [[G5600]] made perfect [[G5048]] in [[G1519]] one; [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] may know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] hast sent [[G649]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] hast loved [[G25]] them, [[G846]] as [[G2531]] thou hast loved [[G25]] me. [[G1691]]

### 24
Father, [[G3962]] I will [[G2309]] that [[G2443]] they also, [[G2548]] whom [[G3739]] thou hast given [[G1325]] me, [[G3427]] be [[G5600]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am; [[G1510]] that [[G2443]] they may behold [[G2334]] my [[G1699]] glory, [[G1391]] which [[G3739]] thou hast given [[G1325]] me: [[G3427]] for [[G3754]] thou lovedst [[G25]] me [[G3165]] before [[G4253]] the foundation [[G2602]] of the world. [[G2889]]

### 25
O righteous [[G1342]] Father, [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] thee: [[G4571]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] have known [[G1097]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] have known [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] hast sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] I have declared [[G1107]] unto them [[G846]] thy [[G4675]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] will declare [[G1107]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] wherewith [[G3739]] thou hast loved [[G25]] me [[G3165]] may be [[G5600]] in [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] them.
