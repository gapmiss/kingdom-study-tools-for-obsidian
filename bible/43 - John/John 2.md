And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] there was [[G1096]] a marriage [[G1062]] in [[G1722]] Cana [[G2580]] of [[G1056]] Galilee; [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] was [[G2258]] there: [[G1563]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] both [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] was called, [[G2564]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] marriage. [[G1062]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] when they wanted [[G5302]] wine, [[G3631]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] They have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] wine. [[G3631]]

### 4
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Woman, [[G1135]] what [[G5101]] I [[G1698]] have to do [[G2532]] with [[G2532]] thee? [[G4671]] mine [[G3450]] hour [[G5610]] not yet [[G3768]] is [[G2240]] come. [[G2240]]

### 5
His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1249]] servants, [[G1249]] Whatsoever [[G3739]] he saith [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] do [[G4160]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] set [[G2749]] there [[G1563]] six [[G1803]] waterpots [[G5201]] of stone, [[G3035]] after the manner of [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] purifying [[G2512]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews, [[G2453]] containing [[G5562]] two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] firkins [[G3355]] apiece. [[G303]]

### 7
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Fill [[G1072]] the [[G3588]] waterpots [[G5201]] with water. [[G5204]] And [[G2532]] they filled [[G1072]] them [[G846]] up to [[G2193]] the brim. [[G507]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Draw out [[G501]] now, [[G3568]] and [[G2532]] bear [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] unto governor of the [[G755]] feast. [[G755]] And [[G2532]] they bare [[G5342]]

### 9
When [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] ruler of the feast [[G755]] had tasted [[G1089]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] that was made [[G1096]] wine, [[G3631]] and [[G2532]] knew [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] whence [[G4159]] it was: [[G2076]] (but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] servants [[G1249]] which [[G3588]] drew [[G501]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] knew;) [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] governor of the feast [[G755]] called [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom, [[G3566]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Every [[G3956]] man [[G444]] at the beginning [[G4412]] doth set forth [[G5087]] good [[G2570]] wine; [[G3631]] and [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] men have well drunk, [[G3184]] then [[G5119]] that [[G3588]] which is worse: [[G1640]] thou [[G4771]] hast kept [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] wine [[G3631]] until [[G2193]] now. [[G737]]

### 11
This [[G3778]] beginning [[G746]] of [[G4592]] miracles [[G4592]] did [[G4160]] Jesus [[G2424]] in [[G1722]] Cana [[G2580]] of [[G1056]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] manifested forth [[G5319]] his [[G846]] glory; [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 12
After [[G3326]] this [[G5124]] he went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] he, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples: [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] they continued [[G3306]] there [[G1563]] not [[G3756]] many [[G4183]] days. [[G2250]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Jews' [[G2453]] passover [[G3957]] was [[G2258]] at hand, [[G1451]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] those [[G3588]] that sold [[G4453]] oxen [[G1016]] and [[G2532]] sheep [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] doves, [[G4058]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] changers of money [[G2773]] sitting: [[G2521]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] when he had made [[G4160]] a scourge [[G5416]] of [[G1537]] small cords, [[G4979]] he drove [[G1544]] them all [[G3956]] out [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2411]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] sheep, [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] oxen; [[G1016]] and [[G2532]] poured out [[G1632]] the [[G3588]] changers' [[G2855]] money, [[G2772]] and [[G2532]] overthrew [[G390]] the [[G3588]] tables; [[G5132]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them that sold [[G4453]] doves, [[G4058]] Take [[G142]] these things [[G5023]] hence; [[G1782]] make [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] my [[G3450]] Father's [[G3962]] house [[G3624]] an house [[G3624]] of merchandise. [[G1712]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] remembered [[G3415]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G2076]] written, [[G1125]] The [[G3588]] zeal [[G2205]] of [[G3624]] thine [[G4675]] house [[G3624]] hath eaten up. [[G2719]] me [[G3165]]

### 18
Then [[G3767]] answered [[G611]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] sign [[G4592]] shewest thou [[G1166]] unto us, [[G2254]] seeing that [[G3754]] thou doest [[G4160]] these things? [[G5023]]

### 19
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Destroy [[G3089]] this [[G5126]] temple, [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] I will raise up. [[G1453]] it [[G846]]

### 20
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] Forty [[G5062]] and [[G2532]] six [[G1803]] years [[G2094]] was in [[G3618]] this [[G3778]] temple [[G3485]] building, [[G3618]] and [[G2532]] thou [[G4771]] wilt up [[G1453]] rear [[G1453]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] three [[G5140]] days? [[G2250]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] he [[G1565]] spake [[G3004]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of [[G4983]] his [[G846]] body. [[G4983]]

### 22
When [[G3753]] therefore [[G3767]] he was risen [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] remembered [[G3415]] that [[G3754]] he had said [[G3004]] this [[G5124]] unto them; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they believed [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] scripture, [[G1124]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] which [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] had said. [[G2036]]

### 23
Now [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] he was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] passover, [[G3957]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] many [[G4183]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] his [[G846]] name, [[G3686]] when they saw [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] miracles [[G4592]] which [[G3739]] he [[G846]] did. [[G4160]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] not [[G3756]] did [[G4100]] commit [[G4100]] himself [[G1438]] unto them, [[G846]] because [[G1223]] he [[G846]] knew [[G1097]] all [[G3956]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] needed [[G5532]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] any [[G5100]] should testify [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] man: [[G444]] for [[G1063]] he [[G846]] knew [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] man. [[G444]]
