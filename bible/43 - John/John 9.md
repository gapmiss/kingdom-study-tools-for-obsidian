### 1
And [[G2532]] as passed by, [[G3855]] he saw [[G1492]] a man [[G444]] which was blind [[G5185]] from [[G1537]] birth. [[G1079]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G4461]] who [[G5101]] did sin, [[G264]] this man, [[G3778]] or [[G2228]] his [[G846]] parents, [[G1118]] that [[G2443]] he was born [[G1080]] blind? [[G5185]]

### 3
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] Neither [[G3777]] this man [[G3778]] hath [[G264]] sinned, [[G264]] nor [[G3777]] his [[G846]] parents: [[G1118]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] should be made manifest [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
I [[G1691]] must [[G1163]] work [[G2038]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of him that sent [[G3992]] me, [[G3165]] while [[G2193]] it is [[G2076]] day: [[G2250]] the night [[G3571]] cometh, [[G2064]] when [[G3753]] no man [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] work. [[G2038]]

### 5
As long as [[G3752]] I am [[G5600]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] I am [[G1510]] the light [[G5457]] of the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 6
thus [[G5023]] When he had [[G2036]] spoken, [[G2036]] he spat [[G4429]] on the ground, [[G5476]] and [[G2532]] made [[G4160]] clay [[G4081]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] spittle, [[G4427]] and [[G2532]] he anointed [[G2025]] the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] the [[G3588]] of blind [[G5185]] man [[G5185]] with the [[G3588]] clay, [[G4081]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Go, [[G5217]] wash [[G3538]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pool [[G2861]] of Siloam, [[G4611]] (which [[G3739]] is by interpretation, [[G2059]] Sent.) [[G649]] He went his way [[G565]] therefore, [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] washed, [[G3538]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] seeing. [[G991]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] neighbours [[G1069]] therefore, [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] they which had [[G2334]] before [[G4386]] seen [[G2334]] him [[G846]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2258]] blind, [[G5185]] said, [[G3004]] Is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] he [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] and [[G2532]] begged? [[G4319]]

### 9
Some [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is he: [[G2076]] others [[G243]] He is [[G2076]] like [[G3664]] him: [[G846]] he [[G1565]] said, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]]

### 10
Therefore [[G3767]] said they [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] How [[G4459]] were eyes [[G455]] thine [[G4675]] opened? [[G455]]

### 11
He [[G1565]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] A man [[G444]] that is called [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] made [[G4160]] clay, [[G4081]] and [[G2532]] anointed [[G2025]] mine [[G3450]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto me, [[G3427]] Go [[G5217]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pool [[G2861]] of Siloam, [[G4611]] and [[G2532]] wash: [[G3538]] and [[G1161]] I went [[G565]] and [[G2532]] washed, [[G3538]] and I received sight. [[G308]]

### 12
Then [[G3767]] said they [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Where [[G4226]] is [[G2076]] he? [[G1565]] He said, [[G3004]] I know [[G1492]] not. [[G3756]]

### 13
They brought [[G71]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] him [[G846]] that was [[G5185]] aforetime [[G4218]] blind. [[G5185]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] it was [[G2258]] the sabbath day [[G4521]] when [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] clay, [[G4081]] and [[G2532]] opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]]

### 15
Then [[G3767]] again [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] also [[G2532]] asked [[G2065]] him [[G846]] how [[G4459]] he had received his sight. [[G308]] He [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] He put [[G2007]] clay [[G4081]] upon [[G1909]] mine [[G3450]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] I washed, [[G3538]] and [[G2532]] do see. [[G991]]

### 16
Therefore [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] because [[G3754]] he keepeth [[G5083]] not [[G3756]] the sabbath day. [[G3588]] Others [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] a man [[G444]] that is a sinner [[G268]] do [[G4160]] such [[G5108]] miracles? [[G4592]] And [[G2532]] there was [[G2258]] a division [[G4978]] among [[G1722]] them. [[G846]]

### 17
They say [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto blind [[G5185]] man [[G5185]] again, [[G3825]] What [[G5101]] sayest [[G3004]] thou [[G4771]] of [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] he hath opened [[G455]] thine [[G4675]] eyes? [[G3788]] He [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] He is [[G2076]] a prophet. [[G4396]]

### 18
But [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] not [[G3756]] did [[G4100]] believe [[G4100]] concerning [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] he had been [[G2258]] blind, [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] received his sight, [[G308]] until [[G2193]] they called [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] parents [[G1118]] of him [[G846]] that had received his sight. [[G308]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] they asked [[G2065]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Is [[G2076]] this [[G3778]] your [[G5216]] son, [[G5207]] who [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] say [[G3004]] was born [[G1080]] blind? [[G5185]] how [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] now [[G737]] doth he [[G991]] see? [[G991]]

### 20
His [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] answered [[G611]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] our [[G2257]] son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] he was born [[G1080]] blind: [[G5185]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] by what means [[G4459]] now [[G3568]] he [[G991]] seeth, [[G991]] we know [[G1492]] not; [[G3756]] or [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] hath opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] we [[G2249]] know [[G1492]] not: [[G3756]] he [[G846]] is of [[G2192]] age; [[G2244]] ask [[G2065]] him: [[G846]] he [[G846]] shall speak [[G2980]] for [[G4012]] himself. [[G846]]

### 22
These [[G5023]] spake [[G2036]] his [[G846]] parents, [[G1118]] because [[G3754]] they feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] Jews: [[G2453]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] had agreed [[G4934]] already, [[G2235]] that [[G2443]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] did confess [[G3670]] that he was [[G846]] Christ, [[G5547]] he should be put [[G1096]] out of the synagogue. [[G656]]

### 23
Therefore [[G1223]] said [[G2036]] his [[G846]] parents, [[G1118]] He is [[G2192]] of age; [[G2244]] ask [[G2065]] him. [[G846]]

### 24
Then [[G3767]] again [[G1537]] called they [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] that [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] blind, [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Give [[G1325]] God [[G2316]] the praise: [[G1391]] we [[G2249]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is [[G2076]] a sinner. [[G268]]

### 25
He [[G1565]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Whether [[G1487]] he be [[G2076]] a sinner [[G268]] I know [[G1492]] not: [[G3756]] one thing [[G1520]] I know, [[G1492]] that, [[G3754]] whereas I was [[G5607]] blind, [[G5185]] now [[G737]] I see. [[G991]]

### 26
Then [[G1161]] said they [[G2036]] to him [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] What [[G5101]] did he [[G4160]] to thee? [[G4671]] how [[G4459]] opened he [[G455]] thine [[G4675]] eyes? [[G3788]]

### 27
He answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] I have told [[G2036]] you [[G5213]] already, [[G2235]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye did [[G191]] hear: [[G191]] wherefore [[G5101]] would ye [[G2309]] hear [[G191]] again? [[G3825]] will [[G2309]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] be [[G1096]] his [[G846]] disciples? [[G3101]]

### 28
Then [[G3767]] they reviled [[G3058]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] his [[G1565]] disciple; [[G3101]] but [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] Moses' [[G3475]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 29
We [[G2249]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2980]] spake [[G2980]] unto Moses: [[G3475]] this [[G5126]] we know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] from whence [[G4159]] he is. [[G2076]]

### 30
The [[G3588]] man [[G444]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G1063]] herein [[G5129]] is [[G2076]] a marvellous thing, [[G2298]] that [[G3754]] ye [[G5210]] know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] from whence [[G4159]] he is, [[G2076]] and [[G2532]] he hath opened [[G455]] mine [[G3450]] eyes. [[G3788]]

### 31
Now [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] heareth [[G191]] not [[G3756]] sinners: [[G268]] but [[G235]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] be [[G5600]] a worshipper of God, [[G2318]] and [[G2532]] doeth [[G4160]] his [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] him [[G5127]] he heareth. [[G191]]

### 32
Since [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world began [[G165]] not [[G3756]] was it [[G191]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] any man [[G5100]] opened [[G455]] the eyes [[G3788]] of one that was born [[G1080]] blind. [[G5185]]

### 33
If [[G1487]] this man [[G3778]] were [[G2258]] not [[G3361]] of [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] he could [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] nothing. [[G3756]]

### 34
They answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou [[G4771]] wast [[G1080]] altogether [[G3650]] born [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] sins, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] thou [[G4771]] dost [[G1321]] teach [[G1321]] us? [[G2248]] And [[G2532]] they cast [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out. [[G1854]]

### 35
Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] they had cast [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out; [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] when he had found [[G2147]] him, [[G846]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] thou [[G4771]] Dost [[G4100]] believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] God? [[G2316]]

### 36
He [[G1565]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Who [[G5101]] is he, [[G2076]] Lord, [[G2962]] that [[G2443]] I might believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him? [[G846]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] both [[G2532]] Thou hast [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] it is [[G2076]] he [[G1565]] that talketh [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G5346]] Lord, [[G2962]] I believe. [[G4100]] And [[G2532]] he worshipped [[G4352]] him. [[G846]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] For [[G1519]] judgment [[G2917]] I [[G1473]] am come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] this [[G5126]] world, [[G2889]] that [[G2443]] they which see [[G991]] not [[G3361]] might see; [[G991]] and [[G2532]] that they which see might [[G991]] be made [[G1096]] blind. [[G5185]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] which were [[G5607]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] heard [[G191]] these words, [[G5023]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Are [[G2070]] we [[G2249]] blind [[G5185]] also? [[G2532]]

### 41
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] ye were [[G2258]] blind, [[G5185]] ye should have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] sin: [[G266]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] ye say, [[G3004]] We see; [[G991]] therefore [[G3767]] your [[G5216]] sin [[G266]] remaineth. [[G3306]]
