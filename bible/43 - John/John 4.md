### 1
When [[G5613]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] knew [[G1097]] how [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] had heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] made [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] baptized [[G907]] more [[G4119]] disciples [[G3101]] than [[G2228]] John, [[G2491]]

### 2
(Though [[G2544]] Jesus [[G2424]] himself [[G846]] baptized [[G907]] not, [[G3756]] but [[G235]] his [[G846]] disciples,) [[G3101]]

### 3
He left [[G863]] Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] departed [[G565]] again [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] he [[G846]] must needs [[G1163]] go [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] Samaria. [[G4540]]

### 5
Then [[G3767]] cometh he [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] a city [[G4172]] of [[G4540]] Samaria, [[G4540]] which is called [[G3004]] Sychar, [[G4965]] near [[G4139]] the [[G3588]] to parcel of [[G5564]] ground [[G5564]] that [[G3739]] Jacob [[G2384]] gave [[G1325]] to [[G5207]] his [[G846]] son [[G5207]] Joseph. [[G2501]]

### 6
Now [[G1161]] Jacob's [[G2384]] well [[G4077]] was [[G2258]] there. [[G1563]] Jesus [[G2424]] therefore, [[G3767]] being wearied [[G2872]] with [[G1537]] journey, [[G3597]] sat [[G2516]] thus [[G3779]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] well: [[G4077]] it was [[G2258]] about [[G5616]] the [[G5610]] sixth [[G1623]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 7
There cometh [[G2064]] a woman [[G1135]] of [[G1537]] Samaria [[G4540]] to draw [[G501]] water: [[G5204]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Give [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] to drink. [[G4095]]

### 8
(For [[G1063]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were gone away [[G565]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] to [[G2443]] buy [[G59]] meat.) [[G5160]]

### 9
Then [[G3767]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] of [[G4542]] Samaria [[G4542]] unto him, [[G846]] How is it that [[G4459]] thou, [[G4771]] being [[G5607]] a Jew, [[G2453]] askest [[G154]] drink [[G4095]] of [[G3844]] me, [[G1700]] which am [[G5607]] a woman [[G1135]] of Samaria? [[G4542]] for [[G1063]] the Jews [[G2453]] no [[G3756]] have [[G4798]] dealings [[G4798]] with the Samaritans. [[G4541]]

### 10
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] thou knewest [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] it is [[G2076]] that [[G3588]] saith [[G3004]] to thee, [[G4671]] Give [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] to drink; [[G4095]] thou [[G4771]] wouldest have asked [[G154]] of him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he would have given [[G1325]] thee [[G4671]] living [[G2198]] water. [[G5204]]

### 11
The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Sir, [[G2962]] thou hast [[G2192]] nothing [[G3777]] to draw with, [[G502]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] well [[G5421]] is [[G2076]] deep: [[G901]] from whence [[G4159]] then [[G3767]] hast thou [[G2192]] that [[G5204]] living [[G2198]] water? [[G5204]]

### 12
Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] greater than [[G3187]] our [[G2257]] father [[G3962]] Jacob, [[G2384]] which [[G3739]] gave [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] well, [[G5421]] and [[G2532]] drank [[G4095]] thereof [[G1537]] himself, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] children, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] cattle? [[G2353]]

### 13
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Whosoever [[G3956]] drinketh [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] water [[G5204]] shall thirst [[G1372]] again: [[G3825]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] drinketh [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] shall give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] shall [[G1372]] never [[G165]] thirst; [[G1372]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] that [[G3739]] I shall give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] shall be [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] a well [[G4077]] of water [[G5204]] springing up [[G242]] into [[G1519]] everlasting [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 15
The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] saith [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Sir, [[G2962]] give [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] this [[G5124]] water, [[G5204]] that [[G2443]] I thirst [[G1372]] not, [[G3361]] neither [[G3366]] come [[G2064]] hither [[G1759]] to draw. [[G501]]

### 16
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Go, [[G5217]] call [[G5455]] thy [[G4675]] husband, [[G435]] and [[G2532]] come [[G2064]] hither. [[G1759]]

### 17
The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] husband. [[G435]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] well [[G2573]] Thou hast [[G2036]] said, [[G2036]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] husband: [[G435]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] thou hast had [[G2192]] five [[G4002]] husbands; [[G435]] and [[G2532]] he whom [[G3739]] now [[G3568]] thou [[G2192]] hast [[G2192]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] thy [[G4675]] husband: [[G435]] in that [[G5124]] saidst thou [[G2046]] truly. [[G227]]

### 19
The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Sir, [[G2962]] I perceive [[G2334]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] a prophet. [[G4396]]

### 20
Our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] worshipped [[G4352]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] mountain; [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] say, [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] men ought [[G1163]] to worship. [[G4352]]

### 21
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Woman, [[G1135]] believe [[G4100]] me, [[G3427]] the hour [[G5610]] cometh, [[G2064]] when [[G3753]] neither [[G3777]] ye shall [[G4352]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] mountain, [[G3735]] nor yet [[G3777]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 22
Ye [[G5210]] worship [[G4352]] ye know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what: [[G3739]] we [[G2249]] know [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] we worship: [[G4352]] for [[G3754]] salvation [[G4991]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 23
But [[G235]] the hour [[G5610]] cometh, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] is, [[G2076]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] true [[G228]] worshippers [[G4353]] shall worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] in truth: [[G225]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] seeketh [[G2212]] such [[G5108]] to [[G4352]] worship [[G4352]] him. [[G846]]

### 24
God [[G2316]] a Spirit: [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that worship [[G4352]] him [[G846]] must [[G1163]] worship [[G4352]] in [[G1722]] spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] in truth. [[G225]]

### 25
The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] Messias [[G3323]] cometh, [[G2064]] which [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] Christ: [[G5547]] when [[G3752]] he [[G1565]] is come, [[G2064]] he will tell [[G312]] us [[G2254]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 26
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] that [[G3588]] speak [[G2980]] unto thee [[G4671]] am [[G1510]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] this [[G5129]] came [[G2064]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] marvelled [[G2296]] that [[G3754]] he talked [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] the woman: [[G1135]] yet [[G3305]] no man [[G3762]] said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] seekest thou? [[G2212]] or, [[G2228]] Why [[G5101]] talkest thou [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] her? [[G846]]

### 28
The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] then [[G3767]] left [[G863]] her [[G846]] waterpot, [[G5201]] and [[G2532]] went her way [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to [[G444]] men, [[G444]]

### 29
Come, [[G1205]] see [[G1492]] a man, [[G444]] which [[G3739]] told [[G2036]] me [[G3427]] all things [[G3956]] that ever [[G3745]] I did: [[G4160]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3385]] this [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] Christ? [[G5547]]

### 30
Then [[G3767]] they went out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him. [[G846]]

### 31
In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mean while [[G3342]] his [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] prayed [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G4461]] eat. [[G5315]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] meat [[G1035]] to eat [[G5315]] that [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] know of. [[G1492]] not [[G3756]]

### 33
Therefore [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G4314]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] any [[G3361]] Hath [[G5342]] man [[G5100]] brought [[G5342]] him [[G846]] to eat? [[G5315]]

### 34
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] My [[G1699]] meat [[G1033]] is [[G2076]] to [[G2443]] do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] him [[G3588]] of that [[G3992]] sent [[G3992]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] to finish [[G5048]] his [[G846]] work. [[G2041]]

### 35
Say [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] ye, [[G5210]] There are [[G2076]] yet [[G2089]] four months, [[G5072]] and [[G2532]] cometh [[G2064]] harvest? [[G2326]] behold, [[G2400]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Lift up [[G1869]] your [[G5216]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] look on [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] fields; [[G5561]] for [[G3754]] they are [[G1526]] white [[G3022]] already [[G2235]] to [[G4314]] harvest. [[G2326]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that reapeth [[G2325]] receiveth [[G2983]] wages, [[G3408]] and [[G2532]] gathereth [[G4863]] fruit [[G2590]] unto [[G1519]] life [[G2222]] eternal: [[G166]] that [[G2443]] both [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that soweth [[G4687]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that reapeth [[G2325]] may rejoice [[G5463]] together. [[G3674]]

### 37
And [[G1063]] herein [[G1722]] is [[G2076]] that [[G5129]] saying [[G3056]] true, [[G228]] One [[G243]] soweth, [[G4687]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] reapeth. [[G2325]]

### 38
I [[G1473]] sent [[G649]] you [[G5209]] to reap [[G2325]] that whereon [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] no [[G3756]] bestowed [[G2872]] labour: [[G2872]] other men [[G243]] laboured, [[G2872]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] are entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] their [[G846]] labours. [[G2873]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Samaritans [[G4541]] of that [[G1565]] city [[G4172]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him [[G846]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1135]] woman, [[G1135]] which testified, [[G3140]] He told [[G2036]] me [[G3427]] all [[G3956]] that ever [[G3745]] I did. [[G4160]]

### 40
So [[G3767]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Samaritans [[G4541]] were come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] they besought [[G2065]] him [[G846]] that he would tarry [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he abode [[G3306]] there [[G1563]] two [[G1417]] days. [[G2250]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] more [[G4119]] believed [[G4100]] because [[G1223]] of [[G3056]] his own [[G846]] word; [[G3056]]

### 42
And [[G5037]] said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1135]] woman, [[G1135]] Now not [[G3765]] we believe, [[G4100]] because [[G1223]] of [[G2981]] thy [[G4674]] saying: [[G2981]] for [[G1063]] we have heard [[G191]] ourselves, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] indeed [[G230]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Saviour [[G4990]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world. [[G2889]]

### 43
Now [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] two [[G1417]] days [[G2250]] he departed [[G1831]] thence, [[G1564]] and [[G2532]] went [[G565]] into [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 44
For [[G1063]] Jesus [[G2424]] himself [[G846]] testified, [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] a prophet [[G4396]] hath [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] honour [[G5092]] in [[G1722]] his [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] country. [[G3968]]

### 45
Then [[G3767]] when [[G3753]] he was come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] the [[G3588]] Galilaeans [[G1057]] received [[G1209]] him, [[G846]] having seen [[G3708]] all the things [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] he did [[G4160]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast: [[G1859]] for [[G1063]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] went [[G2064]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast. [[G1859]]

### 46
So [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] again [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] Cana [[G2580]] of [[G1056]] Galilee, [[G1056]] where [[G3699]] he made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] wine. [[G3631]] And [[G2532]] there was [[G2258]] a certain [[G5100]] nobleman, [[G937]] whose [[G3739]] son [[G5207]] was sick [[G770]] at [[G1722]] Capernaum. [[G2584]]

### 47
he [[G3778]] When [[G191]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] was come [[G2240]] out of [[G1537]] Judaea [[G2449]] into [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] he went [[G565]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] besought [[G2065]] him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he would come down, [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] heal [[G2390]] his [[G846]] son: [[G5207]] for [[G1063]] he was at the point of [[G3195]] death. [[G599]]

### 48
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Except [[G3361]] ye see [[G1492]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders, [[G5059]] ye will [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] believe. [[G4100]]

### 49
The [[G3588]] nobleman [[G937]] saith [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Sir, [[G2962]] come down [[G2597]] ere [[G4250]] my [[G3450]] child [[G3813]] die. [[G599]]

### 50
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Go thy way; [[G4198]] thy [[G4675]] son [[G5207]] liveth. [[G2198]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] believed [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he went his way. [[G4198]]

### 51
And [[G1161]] as [[G2235]] he [[G846]] now [[G2235]] was going [[G2597]] down, [[G2597]] his [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] met [[G528]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] told [[G518]] saying, [[G3004]] Thy [[G4675]] son [[G3816]] liveth. [[G2198]]

### 52
Then [[G3767]] inquired he [[G4441]] of [[G3844]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] when [[G1722]] he to [[G3739]] began [[G2192]] amend. [[G2866]] And [[G2532]] they said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Yesterday [[G5504]] at the [[G5610]] seventh [[G1442]] hour [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] fever [[G4446]] left [[G863]] him. [[G846]]

### 53
So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] knew [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] at [[G1722]] the same [[G1565]] hour, [[G5610]] in [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thy [[G4675]] son [[G5207]] liveth: [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] himself [[G846]] believed, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] whole [[G3650]] house. [[G3614]]

### 54
This [[G5124]] again [[G3825]] second [[G1208]] the [[G4592]] miracle [[G4592]] Jesus [[G2424]] did, [[G4160]] when he was come [[G2064]] out of [[G1537]] Judaea [[G2449]] into [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]]
