### 1
Then [[G5119]] Pilate [[G4091]] therefore [[G3767]] took [[G2983]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] scourged [[G3146]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] platted [[G4120]] a crown [[G4735]] of [[G1537]] thorns, [[G173]] and put on [[G2007]] his [[G846]] head, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] they put on [[G4016]] him [[G846]] a purple [[G4210]] robe, [[G2440]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] Hail, [[G5463]] King of [[G935]] the [[G3588]] Jews! [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] they smote [[G1325]] him [[G846]] with their hands. [[G4475]]

### 4
Pilate [[G4091]] therefore [[G3767]] went [[G1831]] forth [[G1854]] again, [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Behold, [[G1492]] I bring [[G71]] him [[G846]] forth [[G1854]] to you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] ye may know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I find [[G2147]] no [[G3762]] fault [[G156]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 5
Then [[G3767]] came [[G1831]] Jesus [[G2424]] forth, [[G1854]] wearing [[G5409]] the [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of thorns, [[G174]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] purple [[G4210]] robe. [[G2440]] And [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Behold [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] man! [[G444]]

### 6
When [[G3753]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] therefore [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] officers [[G5257]] saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] they cried out, [[G2905]] saying, [[G3004]] Crucify [[G4717]] crucify [[G4717]] Pilate [[G4091]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Take [[G2983]] ye [[G5210]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] crucify [[G4717]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] find [[G2147]] no [[G3756]] fault [[G156]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 7
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] We [[G2249]] have [[G2192]] a law, [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] by [[G2596]] our [[G2257]] law he [[G3551]] ought [[G3784]] to die, [[G599]] because [[G3754]] he made [[G4160]] himself [[G1438]] the Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 8
When [[G3753]] Pilate [[G4091]] therefore [[G3767]] heard [[G191]] that [[G5126]] saying, [[G3056]] the more [[G3123]] he was [[G5399]] afraid; [[G5399]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] went [[G1525]] again [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] judgment hall, [[G4232]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Whence [[G4159]] art [[G1488]] thou? [[G4771]] But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] no [[G3756]] answer. [[G612]]

### 10
Then [[G3767]] saith [[G3004]] Pilate [[G4091]] unto him, [[G846]] Speakest thou [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] unto me? [[G1698]] knowest thou [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] I have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to crucify [[G4717]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to release [[G630]] thee? [[G4571]]

### 11
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] Thou [[G3756]] couldest have [[G2192]] no [[G3762]] power [[G1849]] against [[G2596]] me, [[G1700]] except [[G1487]] it were [[G2258]] given [[G1325]] thee [[G4671]] from above: [[G509]] therefore [[G1223]] he that [[G3588]] delivered [[G3860]] me [[G3165]] unto thee [[G4671]] hath [[G2192]] the greater [[G3173]] sin. [[G266]]

### 12
And from [[G1537]] thenceforth [[G5127]] Pilate [[G4091]] sought to [[G2212]] release [[G630]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] cried out, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1437]] this man [[G5126]] thou let [[G630]] go, [[G630]] thou art [[G1488]] not [[G3756]] Caesar's [[G2541]] friend: [[G5384]] whosoever [[G3956]] maketh [[G4160]] himself [[G846]] a [[G3588]] king [[G935]] speaketh against [[G483]] Caesar. [[G2541]]

### 13
When Pilate [[G4091]] therefore [[G3767]] heard [[G191]] that [[G5126]] saying, [[G3056]] he brought [[G71]] Jesus [[G2424]] forth, [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] sat down [[G2523]] in [[G1909]] the judgment [[G3588]] seat [[G968]] in [[G1519]] a place [[G5117]] that is called [[G3004]] the Pavement, [[G3038]] but [[G1161]] in the Hebrew, [[G1447]] Gabbatha. [[G1042]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] it was [[G2258]] the preparation [[G3904]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3957]] passover, [[G3957]] and [[G1161]] about [[G5616]] the sixth [[G1623]] hour: [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2453]] Jews, [[G2453]] Behold [[G1492]] your [[G5216]] King! [[G935]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] they cried [[G3588]] out, [[G2905]] Away with [[G142]] away with [[G142]] crucify [[G4717]] him. [[G846]] Pilate [[G4091]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Shall I crucify [[G4717]] your [[G5216]] King? [[G935]] The chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] answered, [[G611]] We have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] king [[G935]] but [[G1487]] Caesar. [[G2541]]

### 16
Then [[G5119]] delivered he [[G3860]] him [[G846]] therefore [[G3767]] unto them [[G846]] to [[G2443]] be crucified. [[G4717]] And [[G1161]] they took [[G3880]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] led away. [[G520]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he bearing [[G941]] his [[G846]] cross went [[G4716]] forth [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] a place [[G5117]] called [[G3004]] of a skull, [[G2898]] which [[G3739]] is called [[G3004]] in the Hebrew [[G1447]] Golgotha: [[G1115]]

### 18
Where [[G3699]] they crucified [[G4717]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] other [[G243]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] on either [[G1782]] side one, [[G1782]] and [[G1161]] Jesus in the [[G2424]] midst. [[G3319]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] wrote [[G1125]] a title, [[G5102]] and [[G2532]] put [[G5087]] on [[G1909]] the OF [[G3588]] cross. [[G4716]] And [[G1161]] the writing [[G1125]] was, [[G2258]] JESUS [[G2424]] NAZARETH [[G3480]] THE [[G3588]] KING OF [[G935]] THE [[G3588]] JEWS. [[G2453]]

### 20
This [[G5126]] title [[G5102]] then [[G3767]] read [[G314]] many [[G4183]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews: [[G2453]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] Jesus [[G2424]] was [[G2258]] crucified was [[G4717]] nigh [[G1451]] to [[G4172]] the [[G3588]] city: [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] it was [[G2258]] written [[G1125]] in Hebrew, [[G1447]] Greek, [[G1676]] Latin. [[G4515]]

### 21
Then [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] the chief [[G3588]] priests of [[G749]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] to [[G4091]] Pilate, [[G4091]] Write [[G1125]] not, [[G3361]] The [[G3588]] King of [[G935]] the [[G3588]] Jews; [[G2453]] but [[G235]] that [[G3754]] he [[G1565]] said, [[G2036]] I [[G1510]] am [[G1510]] King [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 22
Pilate [[G4091]] answered, [[G611]] What [[G3739]] I have written [[G1125]] I have written. [[G1125]]

### 23
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] soldiers, [[G4757]] when [[G3753]] they had crucified [[G4717]] Jesus, [[G2424]] took [[G2983]] his [[G846]] garments, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] made [[G4160]] four [[G5064]] parts, [[G3313]] to every [[G1538]] soldier [[G4757]] a part; [[G3313]] and also [[G2532]] coat: [[G5509]] now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] coat [[G5509]] was [[G2258]] without seam, [[G729]] woven [[G5307]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] top [[G509]] throughout. [[G1223]]

### 24
They said [[G2036]] therefore [[G3767]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] not [[G3361]] Let us [[G4977]] rend [[G4977]] it, [[G846]] but [[G235]] cast lots [[G2975]] for [[G4012]] it, [[G846]] whose [[G5101]] it shall be: [[G2071]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] might be fulfilled, [[G4137]] which saith, [[G3004]] They parted [[G1266]] my [[G3450]] raiment among [[G2440]] them, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] vesture they did [[G2441]] cast [[G906]] lots. [[G2819]] These things [[G5023]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] did. [[G4160]]

### 25
Now [[G1161]] there stood [[G2476]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother's [[G3384]] sister, [[G79]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] of Cleophas, [[G2832]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene. [[G3094]]

### 26
When Jesus [[G2424]] therefore [[G3767]] saw [[G1492]]  his [[G3588]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] standing by, [[G3936]] whom [[G3739]] he loved, [[G25]] he saith [[G3004]] unto his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] Woman, [[G1135]] behold [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] son! [[G5207]]

### 27
Then [[G1534]] saith he [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3101]] disciple, [[G3101]] Behold [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] mother! [[G3384]] And [[G2532]] from [[G575]] that [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]]  that [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] took [[G2983]] her [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] his own [[G2398]]

### 28
After [[G3326]] this, [[G5124]] Jesus [[G2424]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] all things [[G3956]] were now [[G2235]] accomplished, [[G5055]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] might be fulfilled, [[G5048]] saith, [[G3004]] I thirst. [[G1372]]

### 29
Now [[G3767]] there was set [[G2749]] a vessel [[G4632]] full [[G3324]] of vinegar: [[G3690]] and [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] filled [[G4130]] a spunge [[G4699]] with vinegar, [[G3690]] and [[G2532]] put [[G4060]] upon hyssop, [[G5301]] and put [[G4374]] to his [[G846]] mouth. [[G4750]]

### 30
When [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] therefore [[G3767]] had received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] vinegar, [[G3690]] he said, [[G2036]] It is finished: [[G5055]] and [[G2532]] he bowed [[G2827]]  his [[G3588]] head, [[G2776]] and gave up [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] ghost. [[G4151]]

### 31
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] therefore, [[G3767]] because [[G1893]] it was [[G2258]] the preparation, [[G3904]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] bodies [[G4983]] not [[G3361]] should [[G3306]] remain [[G3306]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath day, [[G4521]] (for [[G1063]] that [[G1565]] sabbath [[G4521]] day [[G2250]] was [[G2258]] an high [[G3173]] day,) [[G2065]] besought [[G2065]] Pilate [[G4091]] that [[G2443]] their [[G846]] legs [[G4628]] might be broken, [[G2608]] and [[G2532]] they might be taken away. [[G142]]

### 32
Then [[G3767]] came [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] soldiers, [[G4757]] and [[G2532]] brake [[G2608]] the [[G3588]] legs [[G4628]] of the [[G3588]] first, [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G243]] other [[G243]] which [[G3588]] was crucified [[G4957]] with [[G846]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and saw that [[G1492]] he [[G846]] was dead [[G2348]] already, [[G2235]] they brake [[G2608]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] legs: [[G4628]]

### 34
But [[G235]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4757]] soldiers [[G4757]] with a spear [[G3057]] pierced [[G3572]] his [[G846]] side, [[G4125]] and [[G2532]] forthwith [[G2117]] came there out [[G1831]] blood [[G129]] and [[G2532]] water. [[G5204]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that saw [[G3708]] bare record, [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] record [[G3141]] is [[G2076]] true: [[G228]] and he [[G2548]] knoweth [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he saith [[G3004]] true, [[G227]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] might believe. [[G4100]]

### 36
For [[G1063]] these things [[G5023]] were done, [[G1096]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] should be fulfilled, [[G4137]] A bone [[G3747]] of him [[G846]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G4937]] broken. [[G4937]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] another [[G2087]] scripture [[G1124]] saith, [[G3004]] They shall look [[G3700]] on [[G1519]] him whom [[G3739]] they pierced. [[G1574]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] this [[G5023]] Joseph [[G2501]] of [[G575]] Arimathaea, [[G707]] being [[G5607]] a disciple [[G3101]] of [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] but [[G1161]] secretly [[G2928]] for [[G1223]] fear [[G5401]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews, [[G2453]] besought [[G2065]] Pilate [[G4091]] that [[G2443]] he might take away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of [[G2424]] Jesus: [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] Pilate [[G4091]] gave leave. [[G2010]] He came [[G2064]] therefore, [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] took [[G142]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of [[G2424]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] there came [[G2064]] also [[G2532]] Nicodemus, [[G3530]] which [[G3588]] at the first [[G4413]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus [[G2424]] by night, [[G3571]] and brought [[G5342]] a mixture [[G3395]] of myrrh [[G4666]] and [[G2532]] aloes, [[G250]] about [[G5616]] an hundred [[G1540]] pound [[G3046]]

### 40
Then [[G3767]] took they [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] wound [[G1210]] it [[G846]] in linen clothes [[G3608]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] spices, [[G759]] as [[G2531]] the manner [[G1485]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] is [[G2076]] to bury. [[G1779]]

### 41
Now [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] he was crucified [[G4717]] there was [[G2258]] a garden; [[G2779]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] garden [[G2779]] a new [[G2537]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] wherein [[G1722]]  was [[G3739]] never man [[G3762]] yet [[G3764]] laid. [[G5087]]

### 42
There [[G1563]] laid they [[G5087]] Jesus [[G2424]] therefore [[G3767]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews' [[G2453]] preparation [[G3904]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre [[G3419]] was [[G2258]] nigh at hand. [[G1451]]
