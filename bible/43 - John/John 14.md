not [[G3361]] Let be [[G5015]] your [[G5216]] heart [[G2588]] troubled: [[G5015]] ye believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] God, [[G2316]] believe [[G4100]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1519]] me. [[G1691]]

### 2
In [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] Father's [[G3962]] house [[G3614]] are [[G1526]] many [[G4183]] mansions: [[G3438]] if [[G1487]] not [[G3361]] I would have told [[G2036]] you. [[G5213]] I go [[G4198]] to prepare [[G2090]] a place [[G5117]] for you. [[G5213]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] I go [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] prepare [[G2090]] a place [[G5117]] for you, [[G5213]] I will come [[G2064]] again, [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] receive [[G3880]] you [[G5209]] unto [[G4314]] myself; [[G1683]] that [[G2443]] where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am, [[G1510]] ye [[G5210]] may be [[G5600]] also. [[G2532]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] whither [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] go [[G5217]] ye know, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] ye know. [[G1492]]

### 5
Thomas [[G2381]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] we know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] whither [[G4226]] thou goest; [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] can we [[G1410]] know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] way? [[G3598]]

### 6
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] life: [[G2222]] no man [[G3762]] cometh [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] but [[G3361]] by [[G1223]] me. [[G1700]]

### 7
If [[G1487]] ye had known [[G1097]] me, [[G3165]] ye should have known [[G1097]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] also: [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] henceforth [[G737]] ye know [[G1097]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] have seen [[G3708]] him. [[G846]]

### 8
Philip [[G5376]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] shew [[G1166]] us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] it sufficeth [[G714]] us. [[G2254]]

### 9
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Have I been [[G1510]] so long [[G5118]] time [[G5550]] with [[G3326]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] yet hast thou [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] me, [[G3165]] Philip? [[G5376]] he that [[G3588]] hath seen [[G3708]] me [[G1691]] hath seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Father; [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] sayest [[G3004]] thou [[G4771]] Shew [[G1166]] us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] Father? [[G3962]]

### 10
Believest thou [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] me? [[G1698]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] speak [[G2980]] unto you [[G5213]] I speak [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] of [[G575]] myself: [[G1683]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] that [[G3588]] dwelleth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] he [[G846]] doeth [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] works. [[G2041]]

### 11
Believe [[G4100]] me [[G3427]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] me: [[G1698]] or [[G1161]] else [[G1487]] believe [[G4100]] me [[G3427]] for [[G1223]] very [[G2041]] the [[G3588]] works' [[G2041]] sake. [[G846]]

### 12
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3588]] He [[G4100]] believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] me, [[G1691]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] do [[G4160]] shall he do [[G4160]] also; [[G2548]] and [[G2532]] greater [[G3173]] than these [[G5130]] shall he do; [[G4160]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] go [[G4198]] unto [[G4314]] my [[G3450]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G302]] ye shall ask [[G154]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] that [[G5124]] will I do, [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] may be glorified [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Son. [[G5207]]

### 14
If [[G1437]] ye shall ask [[G154]] any thing [[G5100]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] I [[G1473]] will do [[G4160]]

### 15
If [[G1437]] ye love [[G25]] me, [[G3165]] keep [[G5083]] my [[G1699]] commandments. [[G1785]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] will pray [[G2065]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] he shall give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] another [[G243]] Comforter, [[G3875]] that [[G2443]] he may abide [[G3306]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] for [[G1519]] ever; [[G165]]

### 17
the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G225]] truth; [[G225]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] cannot [[G1410]] receive, [[G2983]] because [[G3754]] it seeth [[G2334]] him [[G846]] not, [[G3756]] neither [[G3761]] knoweth [[G1097]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] know [[G1097]] him; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] he dwelleth [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] shall be [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 18
not [[G3756]] I will [[G863]] leave [[G863]] you [[G5209]] comfortless: [[G3737]] I will come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 19
Yet [[G2089]] a little while, [[G3397]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] seeth [[G2334]] me [[G3165]] no [[G3756]] more; [[G2089]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] see [[G2334]] me: [[G3165]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] live, [[G2198]] ye [[G5210]] shall live [[G2198]] also. [[G2532]]

### 20
At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] ye [[G5210]] shall know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 21
He that [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] my [[G3450]] commandments, [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] keepeth [[G5083]] them, [[G846]] he [[G1565]] it is [[G2076]] that [[G3588]] loveth [[G25]] me: [[G3165]] and [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] loveth [[G25]] me [[G3165]] shall be loved [[G25]] of [[G5259]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] will love [[G25]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] will manifest [[G1718]] myself [[G1683]] to him. [[G846]]

### 22
Judas [[G2455]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G5101]] is it [[G1096]] that [[G3754]] thou wilt [[G3195]] manifest [[G1718]] thyself [[G4572]] unto us, [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3780]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2889]] world? [[G2889]]

### 23
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] love [[G25]] me, [[G3165]] he will keep [[G5083]] my [[G3450]] words: [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] will love [[G25]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] we will come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] make [[G4160]] our abode [[G3438]] with [[G3844]] him. [[G846]]

### 24
He that [[G3588]] loveth [[G25]] me [[G3165]] not [[G3361]] keepeth [[G5083]] not [[G3756]] my [[G3450]] sayings: [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] which [[G3739]] ye hear [[G191]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] mine, [[G1699]] but [[G235]] the Father's [[G3962]] which sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 25
These things [[G5023]] have I spoken [[G2980]] unto you, [[G5213]] being present [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] you. [[G5213]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Comforter, [[G3875]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] will send [[G3992]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] he [[G1565]] shall teach [[G1321]] you [[G5209]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] bring remembrance, [[G5279]] all things [[G3956]] to your [[G5209]] whatsoever [[G3739]] I have said [[G2036]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 27
Peace [[G1515]] I leave [[G863]] with you, [[G5213]] my [[G1699]] peace [[G1515]] I give [[G1325]] unto you: [[G5213]] not [[G3756]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] giveth, [[G1325]] give [[G1325]] I [[G1473]] unto you. [[G5213]] not [[G3361]] Let be [[G5015]] your [[G5216]] heart [[G2588]] troubled, [[G5015]] neither [[G3366]] let it be afraid. [[G1168]]

### 28
Ye have heard [[G191]] how [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] said [[G2036]] unto you, [[G5213]] I go away, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]] If [[G1487]] ye loved [[G25]] me, [[G3165]] ye would rejoice, [[G5463]] because [[G3754]] I said, [[G2036]] I go [[G4198]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father: [[G3962]] for [[G3754]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G2076]] greater [[G3187]] than I. [[G3450]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I have told [[G2046]] you [[G5213]] before [[G4250]] it come to pass, [[G1096]] that, [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] it is come to pass, [[G1096]] ye might believe. [[G4100]]

### 30
Hereafter [[G2089]] not [[G3756]] I will [[G2980]] talk [[G2980]] much [[G4183]] with [[G3326]] you: [[G5216]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] of this [[G5127]] world [[G2889]] cometh, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] hath [[G2192]] nothing [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]

### 31
But [[G235]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] may know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] Father; [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father commandment, [[G3962]] gave [[G1781]] me [[G3427]] even so [[G3779]] I do. [[G4160]] Arise, [[G1453]] let us go [[G71]] hence. [[G1782]]
