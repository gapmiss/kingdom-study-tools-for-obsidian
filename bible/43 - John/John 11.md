### 1
Now [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] was [[G2258]] sick, [[G770]] Lazarus, [[G2976]] of [[G575]] Bethany, [[G963]] the [[G3588]] town [[G2968]] of Mary [[G3137]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] sister [[G79]] Martha. [[G3136]]

### 2
(It was [[G2258]] Mary [[G3137]] which [[G3588]] anointed [[G218]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] with ointment, [[G3464]] and [[G2532]] wiped [[G1591]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] with [[G2359]] her [[G846]] hair, [[G2359]] whose [[G3739]] brother [[G80]] Lazarus [[G2976]] was sick.) [[G770]]

### 3
Therefore [[G3767]]  his [[G3588]] sisters [[G79]] sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] behold, [[G1492]] he whom [[G3739]] thou lovest [[G5368]] is sick. [[G770]]

### 4
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] he said, [[G2036]] This [[G3778]] sickness [[G769]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] unto [[G4314]] death, [[G2288]] but [[G235]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] might be glorified [[G1392]] thereby. [[G1223]]

### 5
Now [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved [[G25]] Martha, [[G3136]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] sister, [[G79]] and [[G2532]] Lazarus. [[G2976]]

### 6
When [[G5613]] he had heard [[G191]] therefore [[G3767]] that [[G3754]] he was sick, [[G770]] he abode [[G3306]] two [[G1417]] days [[G2250]] still [[G5119]] in [[G1722]] the same [[G3739]] place where [[G5117]] he was. [[G2258]]

### 7
Then [[G1899]] after [[G3326]] that [[G5124]] saith he [[G3004]] to [[G3101]] disciples, [[G3101]] Let us go [[G71]] into [[G1519]] Judaea [[G2449]] again. [[G3825]]

### 8
disciples [[G3101]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G4461]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] of late [[G3568]] sought [[G2212]] to stone [[G3034]] thee; [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] goest thou [[G5217]] thither [[G1563]] again? [[G3825]]

### 9
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] Are there [[G1526]] not [[G3780]] twelve [[G1427]] hours [[G5610]] in the [[G3588]] day? [[G2250]] If [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day, [[G2250]] he stumbleth [[G4350]] not, [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] he seeth [[G991]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of [[G5127]] this [[G5127]] world. [[G2889]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] night, [[G3571]] he stumbleth, [[G4350]] because [[G3754]] there is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] light [[G5457]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 11
These things [[G5023]] said he: [[G2036]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] that [[G5124]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Our [[G2257]] friend [[G5384]] Lazarus [[G2976]] sleepeth; [[G2837]] but [[G235]] I go, [[G4198]] that [[G2443]] I may awake out of sleep. [[G1852]] him [[G846]]

### 12
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] he sleep, [[G2837]] he shall do well. [[G4982]]

### 13
Howbeit [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] spake [[G2046]] of [[G4012]] his [[G846]] death: [[G2288]] but [[G1161]] they [[G1565]] thought [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] he had spoken [[G3004]] of [[G4012]] taking of [[G2838]] rest [[G2838]] in [[G5258]] sleep. [[G5258]]

### 14
Then [[G5119]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto them [[G846]] plainly, [[G3954]] Lazarus [[G2976]] is dead. [[G599]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] I am glad [[G5463]] for [[G1223]] your sakes [[G5209]] that [[G3754]] I was [[G2252]] not [[G3756]] there, [[G1563]] to the intent [[G2443]] ye may believe; [[G4100]] nevertheless [[G235]] let us go [[G71]] unto [[G4314]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Thomas, [[G2381]] which is called [[G3004]] Didymus, [[G1324]]  unto his [[G3588]] fellowdisciples, [[G4827]] Let [[G71]] us [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] go, [[G71]] that [[G2443]] we may die [[G599]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 17
Then when [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] came, [[G2064]] he [[G846]] found that [[G2147]] he had [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] grave [[G3419]] four [[G5064]] days [[G2250]] already. [[G2235]]

### 18
Now [[G1161]] Bethany [[G963]] was [[G2258]] nigh unto [[G1451]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] about [[G5613]] fifteen [[G1178]] furlongs [[G4712]] off: [[G575]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Martha [[G3136]] and [[G2532]] Mary, [[G3137]] to [[G2443]] comfort [[G3888]] them [[G846]] concerning [[G4012]] their [[G846]] brother. [[G80]]

### 20
Then [[G3767]] Martha, [[G3136]] as soon as [[G5613]] she heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] was coming, [[G2064]] went and met [[G5221]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] sat [[G2516]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house. [[G3624]]

### 21
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Martha [[G3136]] unto [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] thou hadst been [[G2258]] here, [[G5602]] my [[G3450]] brother [[G80]] not [[G3756]] had died. [[G2348]]

### 22
But [[G235]] I know, [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] even [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] whatsoever [[G3745]] thou wilt ask [[G154]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] will give [[G1325]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 23
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Thy [[G4675]] brother [[G80]] shall rise again. [[G450]]

### 24
Martha [[G3136]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he shall rise again [[G450]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

### 25
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] resurrection, [[G386]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] life: [[G2222]] he [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] me, [[G1691]] though yet [[G2579]] he were dead, [[G599]] shall he live: [[G2198]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3956]] liveth [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] believeth [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] me [[G1691]] never [[G3756]] shall [[G599]] die. [[G599]] Believest thou [[G4100]] this? [[G5124]]

### 27
She saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Yea, [[G3483]] Lord: [[G2962]] I [[G1473]] believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] which should come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] so [[G5023]] when she had [[G2036]] said, [[G2036]] she went her way, [[G565]] and [[G2532]] called [[G5455]] Mary [[G3137]] her [[G846]] sister [[G79]] secretly, [[G2977]] saying, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] Master [[G1320]] is come, [[G3918]] and [[G2532]] calleth [[G5455]] for thee. [[G4571]]

### 29
As soon as [[G5613]] she [[G1565]] heard [[G191]] she arose [[G1453]] quickly, [[G5035]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him. [[G846]]

### 30
Now [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] not yet [[G3768]] was [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the that [[G3588]] town, [[G2968]] but [[G235]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] Martha [[G3136]] met [[G5221]] him. [[G846]]

### 31
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] which [[G3588]] then [[G3767]] were [[G5607]] with [[G3326]] her [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] comforted [[G3888]] her, [[G846]] when they saw [[G1492]] Mary, [[G3137]] that [[G3754]] she rose up [[G450]] hastily [[G5030]] and [[G2532]] went out, [[G1831]] followed [[G190]] her, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] She goeth [[G5217]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] grave [[G3419]] to [[G2443]] weep [[G2799]] there. [[G1563]]

### 32
Then [[G3767]] when [[G5613]] Mary [[G3137]] was come [[G2064]] where [[G3699]] Jesus [[G2424]] was, [[G2258]] and saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] she fell down [[G4098]] at [[G1519]] his [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] thou hadst been [[G2258]] here, [[G5602]] my [[G3450]] brother [[G80]] not [[G3756]] had [[G599]] died. [[G599]]

### 33
When [[G5613]] Jesus [[G2424]] therefore [[G3767]] saw [[G1492]] her [[G846]] weeping, [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] also which [[G4905]] weeping [[G2799]] came [[G4905]] with [[G846]] her, [[G846]] groaned [[G1690]] he [[G1438]] in the [[G3588]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] was troubled, [[G5015]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Where [[G4226]] have ye laid [[G5087]] him? [[G846]] They said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G1492]]

### 35
Jesus [[G1145]] wept. [[G1145]]

### 36
Then [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] Behold [[G1492]] how [[G4459]] he loved [[G5368]] him! [[G846]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] Could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] this man, [[G3778]] which opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5185]] blind, [[G5185]] have caused [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] even [[G2532]] this man [[G3778]] not [[G3361]] should have [[G599]] died? [[G599]]

### 38
Jesus [[G2424]] therefore [[G3767]] again [[G3825]] groaning [[G1690]] in [[G1722]] himself [[G1438]] cometh [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] grave. [[G3419]] It was [[G2258]] a cave, [[G4693]] and [[G2532]] a stone [[G3037]] lay [[G1945]] upon [[G1909]] it. [[G846]]

### 39
Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G3004]] Take ye away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] stone. [[G3037]] Martha, [[G3136]] the [[G3588]] sister [[G79]] of him that was dead, [[G2348]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] by this time [[G2235]] he stinketh: [[G3605]] for [[G1063]] he hath been [[G2076]] four days. [[G5066]]

### 40
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Said I [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] unto thee, [[G4671]] that, [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] thou wouldest believe, [[G4100]] thou shouldest see [[G3700]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]]  of [[G3588]] God? [[G2316]]

### 41
Then [[G3767]] they took away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] where [[G3757]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G2348]] was [[G2258]] laid. [[G2749]] And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] lifted [[G142]] up [[G507]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Father, [[G3962]] I thank [[G2168]] thee [[G4671]] that [[G3754]] thou hast heard [[G191]] me. [[G3450]]

### 42
And [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] thou hearest [[G191]] me [[G3450]] always: [[G3842]] but [[G235]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] which stand by [[G4026]] I said [[G2036]] that [[G2443]] they may believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] hast sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] thus [[G5023]] when he had [[G2036]] spoken, [[G2036]] he cried [[G2905]] with a [[G5456]] loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] Lazarus, [[G2976]] come [[G1204]] forth. [[G1854]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that was dead [[G2348]] came forth, [[G1831]] bound with [[G1210]] hand [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] foot [[G4228]] graveclothes: [[G2750]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] face [[G3799]] was bound about with [[G4019]] a napkin. [[G4676]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Loose [[G3089]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] let him [[G863]] go. [[G5217]]

### 45
Then [[G3767]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] which came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Mary, [[G3137]] and [[G2532]] had seen [[G2300]] the things which [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] did, [[G4160]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 46
But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] went their ways [[G565]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] what things [[G3739]] Jesus had [[G4160]] done. [[G4160]]

### 47
Then [[G3767]] gathered [[G4863]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] a council, [[G4892]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] do we? [[G4160]] for [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] doeth [[G4160]] many [[G4183]] miracles. [[G4592]]

### 48
If [[G1437]] we let [[G863]] him [[G846]] thus alone, [[G3779]] all [[G3956]] will believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Romans [[G4514]] shall come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] take away [[G142]] both [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] place [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] nation. [[G1484]]

### 49
And [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] Caiaphas, [[G2533]] being [[G5607]] the high priest [[G749]] that same [[G1565]] year, [[G1763]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye [[G5210]] know [[G1492]] nothing [[G3756]] at all, [[G3762]]

### 50
Nor [[G3761]] consider [[G1260]] that [[G3754]] it is expedient [[G4851]] for us, [[G2254]] that that [[G2443]] one [[G1520]] man [[G444]] should die [[G599]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] nation [[G1484]] perish [[G622]] not. [[G3361]]

### 51
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] spake he [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] of [[G575]] himself: [[G1438]] but [[G235]] being [[G5607]] high priest [[G749]] that [[G1565]] year, [[G1763]] he prophesied [[G4395]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] should [[G3195]] die [[G599]] for [[G5228]] that [[G3588]] nation; [[G1484]]

### 52
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] for [[G5228]] that [[G1484]] nation [[G1484]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] also [[G2532]] he should gather together [[G4863]] in [[G1519]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of that were scattered [[G1287]] God [[G2316]] abroad. [[G1287]]

### 53
Then [[G3767]] from forth [[G575]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] they took counsel together [[G4823]] for to [[G2443]] put to [[G615]] him [[G846]] death. [[G615]]

### 54
Jesus [[G2424]] therefore [[G3767]] walked [[G4043]] no [[G3756]] more [[G2089]] openly [[G3954]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Jews; [[G2453]] but [[G235]] went [[G565]] thence [[G1564]] unto [[G1519]]  a [[G3588]] country [[G5561]] near to [[G1451]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] into [[G1519]] a city [[G4172]] called [[G3004]] Ephraim, [[G2187]] and there [[G2546]] continued [[G1304]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 55
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jews' [[G2453]] passover [[G3957]] was [[G2258]] nigh at hand: [[G1451]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] went [[G305]] out of [[G1537]]  the [[G3588]] country [[G5561]] up to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] passover, [[G3957]] to [[G2443]] purify [[G48]] themselves. [[G1438]]

### 56
Then [[G3767]] sought they [[G2212]] for [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] spake [[G3004]] among [[G3326]] themselves, [[G240]] as they stood [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] What [[G5101]] think [[G1380]] ye, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] he will [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast? [[G1859]]

### 57
Now [[G1161]] both [[G2532]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] had given [[G1325]] a commandment, [[G1785]] that, [[G2443]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] knew [[G1097]] where [[G4226]] he were, [[G2076]] he should shew [[G3377]] that [[G3704]] they might take [[G4084]] him. [[G846]]
