### 1
After [[G3326]] this [[G5023]] there was [[G2258]] a feast [[G1859]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews; [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 2
Now [[G1161]] there is [[G2076]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] by [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4262]] a pool, [[G2861]] which [[G3588]] is called [[G1951]] in the Hebrew tongue [[G1447]] Bethesda, [[G964]] having [[G2192]] five [[G4002]] porches. [[G4745]]

### 3
In [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] lay [[G2621]] a [[G4128]] great [[G4183]] multitude [[G4128]] of impotent [[G770]] folk, [[G770]] of blind, [[G5185]] halt, [[G5560]] withered, [[G3584]] waiting for [[G1551]] the [[G3588]] moving [[G2796]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5204]] water. [[G5204]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] an angel [[G32]] went down [[G2597]] at [[G2596]] a certain [[G2540]] season [[G2540]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] pool, [[G2861]] and [[G2532]] troubled [[G5015]] the [[G3588]] water: [[G5204]] whosoever [[G3588]] then [[G3767]] first [[G4413]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] troubling [[G5016]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5204]] water [[G5204]] stepped in [[G1684]] was made [[G1096]] whole [[G5199]] whatsoever [[G3739]] of [[G3553]] disease [[G3553]] he had. [[G2722]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G444]] was [[G2258]] there, [[G1563]] which had [[G2192]] an [[G3588]] infirmity [[G769]] thirty [[G5144]] and [[G2532]] eight [[G3638]] years. [[G2094]]

### 6
When [[G1492]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] him [[G5126]] lie, [[G2621]] and [[G2532]] knew [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] he had been [[G2192]] now [[G2235]] a long [[G4183]] time [[G5550]] he saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Wilt thou [[G2309]] be made [[G1096]] whole? [[G5199]]

### 7
The [[G3588]] impotent man [[G770]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] Sir, [[G2962]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] man, [[G444]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] is troubled, [[G5015]] to [[G2443]] put [[G906]] me [[G3165]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pool: [[G2861]] but [[G1161]] while [[G1722]] I [[G1473]] am coming, [[G2064]] another [[G243]] steppeth down [[G2597]] before [[G4253]] me. [[G1700]]

### 8
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Rise, [[G1453]] take up [[G142]] thy [[G4675]] bed, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] walk. [[G4043]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] was made [[G1096]] whole, [[G5199]] and [[G2532]] took up [[G142]] his [[G846]] bed, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] walked: [[G4043]] and [[G1161]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] was [[G2258]] the sabbath. [[G4521]]

### 10
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] therefore [[G3767]] said [[G3004]] him [[G3588]] unto that was [[G2323]] cured, [[G2323]] It is [[G2076]] the sabbath day: [[G4521]] not [[G3756]] it is [[G1832]] lawful [[G1832]] for thee [[G4671]] to carry [[G142]] bed. [[G2895]]

### 11
He answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] He [[G3588]] that made [[G4160]] me [[G3165]] whole, [[G5199]] the same [[G1565]] said [[G2036]] unto me, [[G3427]] Take up [[G142]] thy [[G4675]] bed, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] walk. [[G4043]]

### 12
Then [[G3767]] asked they [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] man [[G444]] is [[G2076]] that [[G3588]] which said [[G2036]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Take up [[G142]] thy [[G4675]] bed, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] walk? [[G4043]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] he that was healed [[G2390]] wist [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] who [[G5101]] it was: [[G2076]] for [[G1063]] Jesus [[G2424]] had conveyed himself away, [[G1593]] a multitude [[G3793]] being [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] place. [[G5117]]

### 14
Afterward [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] findeth [[G2147]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Behold, [[G1492]] thou art made [[G1096]] whole: [[G5199]] sin [[G264]] no more, [[G3371]] lest [[G2443]] a worse [[G5501]] thing [[G5100]] come [[G1096]] unto thee. [[G4671]]

### 15
The [[G3588]] man [[G444]] departed, [[G565]] and [[G2532]] told [[G312]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G2076]] Jesus, [[G2424]] which [[G3588]] had made [[G4160]] him [[G846]] whole. [[G5199]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] therefore [[G1223]] did [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] persecute [[G1377]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] sought [[G2212]] to slay [[G615]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] he had done [[G4160]] these things [[G5023]] on [[G1722]] the sabbath day. [[G4521]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] My [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] worketh [[G2038]] hitherto, [[G2193]] I [[G2504]] and work. [[G2038]]

### 18
Therefore [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] sought [[G2212]] the more [[G3123]] to kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] he had [[G3089]] only [[G3440]] broken [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] sabbath, [[G4521]] but [[G235]] said that [[G3004]] also [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] was his [[G2398]] Father, [[G3962]] making [[G4160]] himself [[G1438]] equal [[G2470]] with God. [[G2316]]

### 19
Then [[G3767]] answered [[G611]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] can [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] nothing [[G3762]] of [[G575]] himself, [[G1438]] but [[G3361]] what [[G5100]] he seeth [[G991]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] do: [[G4160]] for [[G1063]] what things [[G3739]] soever [[G302]] he [[G1565]] doeth, [[G4160]] these [[G5023]] also [[G2532]] doeth [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] likewise. [[G3668]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] loveth [[G5368]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] sheweth [[G1166]] him [[G846]] all things [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] himself [[G846]] doeth: [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] he will shew [[G1166]] him [[G846]] greater [[G3173]] works [[G2041]] than these, [[G5130]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] may marvel. [[G2296]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] raiseth up [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] quickeneth [[G2227]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] quickeneth [[G2227]] whom [[G3739]] he will. [[G2309]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] judgeth [[G2919]] no man, [[G3762]] but [[G235]] hath committed [[G1325]] all [[G3956]] judgment [[G2920]] unto the [[G3588]] Son: [[G5207]]

### 23
That [[G2443]] all [[G3956]] should honour [[G5091]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] even as [[G2531]] they honour [[G5091]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]] He that honoureth [[G5091]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] honoureth [[G5091]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Father which hath [[G3962]] sent [[G3992]] him. [[G846]]

### 24
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] He that [[G3588]] heareth [[G191]] my [[G3450]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] believeth [[G4100]] him [[G3588]] on that [[G3992]] sent [[G3992]] me, [[G3165]] hath [[G2192]] everlasting [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] condemnation; [[G2920]] but [[G235]] is passed [[G3327]] from [[G1537]] death [[G2288]] unto [[G1519]] life. [[G2222]]

### 25
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] The hour [[G5610]] is coming, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] is, [[G2076]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] shall hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of God: [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] they that hear [[G191]] shall live. [[G2198]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] hath [[G2192]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] himself; [[G1438]] so [[G3779]] hath he given [[G1325]] to [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] to have [[G2192]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] himself; [[G1438]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] hath given [[G1325]] him [[G846]] authority [[G1849]] to execute [[G4160]] judgment [[G2920]] also, [[G2532]] because [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] the Son [[G5207]] of man. [[G444]]

### 28
Marvel [[G2296]] not [[G3361]] at this: [[G5124]] for [[G3754]] the hour [[G5610]] is coming, [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] are [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] graves [[G3419]] shall hear [[G191]] his [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] shall come forth; [[G1607]] they that have done [[G4160]] good, [[G18]] unto [[G1519]] the resurrection [[G386]] of life; [[G2222]] and [[G1161]] they that have done [[G4238]] evil, [[G5337]] unto [[G1519]] the resurrection [[G386]] of damnation. [[G2920]]

### 30
I [[G1473]] can [[G1410]] of [[G575]] mine own self [[G1683]] do [[G4160]] nothing: [[G3762]] as [[G2531]] I hear, [[G191]] I judge: [[G2919]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1699]] judgment [[G2920]] is [[G2076]] just; [[G1342]] because [[G3754]] I seek [[G2212]] not [[G3756]] mine own [[G1699]] will, [[G2307]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] will of [[G2307]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] which hath sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 31
If [[G1437]] I [[G1473]] bear witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] myself, [[G1683]] my [[G3450]] witness [[G3141]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] true. [[G227]]

### 32
There is [[G2076]] another [[G243]] that beareth witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] me; [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] witness [[G3141]] which [[G3739]] he witnesseth [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] me [[G1700]] is [[G2076]] true. [[G227]]

### 33
Ye [[G5210]] sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] he bare witness [[G3140]] unto the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] receive [[G2983]] not [[G3756]] testimony [[G3141]] from [[G3844]] man: [[G444]] but [[G235]] these things [[G5023]] I say, [[G3004]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] might be saved. [[G4982]]

### 35
He [[G1565]] was [[G2258]] a [[G3588]] burning [[G2545]] and [[G2532]] a shining [[G5316]] light: [[G3088]] and [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] were willing [[G2309]] for [[G4314]] a season [[G5610]] to rejoice [[G21]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] light. [[G5457]]

### 36
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] greater than [[G3173]] witness [[G3141]] of [[G2491]] John: [[G2491]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] hath given [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] to [[G2443]] finish, [[G5048]] the same [[G846]] works [[G2041]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] do, [[G4160]] bear witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] me, [[G1700]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] hath sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] himself, [[G846]] which hath sent [[G3992]] me, [[G3165]] hath borne witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] me. [[G1700]] neither [[G3777]] Ye have [[G191]] heard [[G191]] his [[G846]] voice [[G5456]] at any time, [[G4455]] nor [[G3777]] seen [[G3708]] his [[G846]] shape. [[G1491]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] ye have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] word [[G3056]] abiding [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you: [[G5213]] for [[G3754]] whom [[G3739]] he [[G1565]] hath sent, [[G649]] him [[G5129]] ye [[G5210]] believe [[G4100]] not. [[G3756]]

### 39
Search [[G2045]] the [[G3588]] scriptures; [[G1124]] for [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] them [[G846]] ye [[G5210]] think [[G1380]] have [[G2192]] ye [[G2532]] eternal [[G166]] life: [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] they [[G1565]] are [[G1526]] testify [[G3140]] they which [[G4012]] of [[G4012]] me. [[G1700]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] ye will [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] that [[G2443]] ye might have [[G2192]] life. [[G2222]]

### 41
I receive [[G2983]] not [[G3756]] honour [[G1391]] from [[G3844]] men. [[G444]]

### 42
But [[G235]] I know [[G1097]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G3754]] ye have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G1438]]

### 43
I [[G1473]] am come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] Father's [[G3962]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] ye receive [[G2983]] me [[G3165]] not: [[G3756]] if [[G1437]] another [[G243]] shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G2398]] name, [[G3686]] him [[G1565]] ye will receive. [[G2983]]

### 44
How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] ye [[G5210]] believe, [[G4100]] which receive [[G2983]] honour [[G1391]] of [[G3844]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]]  from [[G3844]] and [[G2532]] seek [[G2212]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] honour [[G1391]] that [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] only? [[G3441]]

### 45
not [[G3361]] Do [[G1380]] think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] will accuse [[G2723]] you [[G5216]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father: [[G3962]] there is [[G2076]] that accuseth [[G2723]] you, [[G5216]] Moses, [[G3475]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] trust. [[G1679]]

### 46
For [[G1063]] had [[G1487]] ye [[G4100]] believed [[G4100]] Moses, [[G3475]] ye would have believed [[G4100]] me: [[G1698]] for [[G1063]] he [[G1565]] wrote [[G1125]] of [[G4012]] me. [[G1700]]

### 47
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye believe [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] his [[G1565]] writings, [[G1121]] how [[G4459]] shall ye believe [[G4100]] my [[G1699]] words? [[G4487]]
