### 1
Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] six [[G1803]] days [[G2250]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] passover [[G3957]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Bethany, [[G963]] where [[G3699]] Lazarus [[G2976]] was [[G2258]] which had been dead, [[G2348]] whom [[G3739]] he raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 2
There [[G1563]] they made [[G4160]] him [[G846]] a supper; [[G1173]] and [[G2532]] Martha [[G3136]] served: [[G1247]] but [[G1161]] Lazarus [[G2976]] was [[G2258]] one [[G1520]] them [[G3588]] of that at the table [[G4873]] sat [[G4873]] with him. [[G846]]

### 3
Then [[G3767]] took [[G2983]] Mary [[G3137]] a [[G3588]] pound [[G3046]] of ointment [[G3464]] of spikenard, [[G3487]] very costly, [[G4186]] and anointed [[G218]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] wiped [[G1591]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] with her [[G846]] hair: [[G2359]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] was filled [[G4137]] with [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] odour [[G3744]] of the [[G3588]] ointment. [[G3464]]

### 4
Then [[G3767]] saith [[G3004]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] Simon's [[G4613]] which should [[G3195]] betray [[G3860]] him, [[G846]]

### 5
Why [[G1302]] not [[G3756]] was for three [[G5145]] this [[G5124]] ointment [[G3464]] sold [[G4097]] hundred [[G5145]] pence, [[G1220]] and [[G2532]] given [[G1325]] to the poor? [[G4434]]

### 6
This [[G5124]] he said, [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] he [[G846]] cared [[G3199]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] poor; [[G4434]] but [[G235]] because [[G3754]] he was [[G2258]] a thief, [[G2812]] and [[G2532]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] bag, [[G1101]] and [[G2532]] bare [[G941]] what was put therein. [[G906]]

### 7
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Let [[G863]] her [[G846]] alone: [[G863]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G1780]] my [[G3450]] burying [[G1780]] hath she kept [[G5083]] this. [[G846]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] always [[G3842]] ye have [[G2192]] with [[G3326]] you; [[G1438]] but [[G1161]] me [[G1691]] ye have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] always. [[G3842]]

### 9
Much [[G4183]] people [[G3793]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] therefore [[G3767]] knew [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2076]] there: [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] for sake [[G1223]] Jesus' [[G2424]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] they might see [[G1492]] Lazarus [[G2976]] also, [[G2532]] whom [[G3739]] he had raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] consulted [[G1011]] that [[G2443]] they might put to death; [[G615]] Lazarus [[G2976]] also [[G2532]]

### 11
Because [[G3754]] that by reason of [[G1223]] him [[G846]] many [[G4183]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] went away, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 12
the [[G3588]] On next [[G1887]] day [[G1887]] much [[G4183]] people [[G3793]] that [[G3588]] were come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] when they heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] was coming [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]]

### 13
Took [[G2983]] branches [[G902]] of palm trees, [[G5404]] and [[G2532]] went [[G1831]] forth [[G1519]] to meet [[G5222]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] cried, [[G2896]] Hosanna: [[G5614]] Blessed [[G2127]] King [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of Israel [[G2474]] that [[G3588]] cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] Jesus, [[G2424]] when he had found [[G2147]] a young ass, [[G3678]] sat [[G2523]] thereon; [[G1909]] as [[G2531]] it is [[G2076]] written, [[G1125]]

### 15
Fear [[G5399]] not, [[G3361]] daughter [[G2364]] of Sion: [[G4622]] behold, [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] King [[G935]] cometh, [[G2064]] sitting [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] an ass's [[G3688]] colt. [[G4454]]

### 16
These things [[G5023]] understood [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] the [[G3588]] at [[G4413]] first: [[G4413]] but [[G235]] when [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] was glorified, [[G1392]] then [[G5119]] remembered they [[G3415]] that [[G3754]] these things [[G5023]] were [[G2258]] written [[G1125]] of [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they had done [[G4160]] these things [[G5023]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 17
The [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] therefore [[G3767]] that [[G3588]] was [[G5607]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] when [[G3753]] he called [[G5455]]  his [[G3588]] Lazarus [[G2976]] out of [[G1537]] grave, [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] raised [[G1453]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] bare record. [[G3140]]

### 18
For [[G1223]] this [[G5124]] cause [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] also [[G2532]] met [[G5221]] him, [[G846]] for that [[G3754]] they heard that [[G191]] he [[G846]] had done [[G4160]] this [[G3588]] miracle. [[G4592]]

### 19
The [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] therefore [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] Perceive ye [[G2334]] how [[G3754]] ye prevail [[G5623]] nothing? [[G3762]] behold, [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] is gone [[G565]] after [[G3694]] him. [[G846]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] certain [[G5100]] Greeks [[G1672]] among [[G1537]] them that came up [[G305]] to [[G2443]] worship [[G4352]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast: [[G1859]]

### 21
The same [[G3778]] came [[G4334]] therefore [[G3767]] to Philip, [[G5376]] which of [[G3588]] was of [[G575]] Bethsaida [[G966]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] desired [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Sir, [[G2962]] we would [[G2309]] see [[G1492]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 22
Philip [[G5376]] cometh [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] telleth [[G3004]] Andrew: [[G406]] and [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] Andrew [[G406]] and [[G2532]] Philip [[G5376]] tell [[G3004]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] is come, [[G2064]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of should be [[G1392]] man [[G444]] glorified. [[G1392]]

### 24
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Except [[G1437]] a [[G2848]] corn [[G2848]] of [[G4621]] wheat [[G4621]] fall [[G4098]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] and die, [[G599]] it [[G846]] abideth [[G3306]] alone: [[G3441]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] it die, [[G599]] it bringeth forth [[G5342]] much [[G4183]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 25
He [[G3588]] that loveth [[G5368]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] shall lose [[G622]] it; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that hateth [[G3404]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] world [[G2889]] shall keep [[G5442]] it [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] life [[G2222]] eternal. [[G166]]

### 26
If [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] serve [[G1247]] me, [[G1698]] let him follow [[G190]] me; [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am, [[G1510]] there [[G1563]] also [[G2532]] shall servant [[G2071]] my [[G1699]] be: [[G2071]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] serve [[G1247]] me, [[G1698]] him [[G846]] will Father [[G5091]] honour. [[G5091]]

### 27
Now [[G3568]] my [[G3450]] is [[G5015]] soul [[G5590]] troubled; [[G5015]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] shall I say? [[G2036]] Father, [[G3962]] save [[G4982]] me [[G3165]] from [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] hour: [[G5610]] but [[G235]] for cause [[G1223]] this [[G5124]] came I [[G2064]] unto [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 28
Father, [[G3962]] glorify [[G1392]] thy [[G4675]] name. [[G3767]] Then [[G3767]] came there [[G2064]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] both [[G2532]] I have [[G1392]] glorified [[G1392]] and [[G2532]] will glorify [[G1392]] again. [[G3825]]

### 29
The [[G3588]] people [[G3767]]  therefore, [[G3793]] that stood by, [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] said that [[G3004]] thundered: [[G1027]] it [[G1096]] others [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] An angel [[G32]] spake [[G2980]] to him. [[G846]]

### 30
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] This [[G3778]] voice [[G5456]] came [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] because [[G1223]] of me, [[G1691]] but [[G235]] for sakes. [[G1223]] your [[G5209]]

### 31
Now [[G3568]] is [[G2076]] the judgment [[G2920]] of [[G2889]] this [[G5127]] world: [[G2889]] now [[G3568]] the [[G3588]] shall be [[G1544]] prince [[G758]] of [[G5127]] this [[G5127]] world [[G2889]] cast [[G1544]] out. [[G1854]]

### 32
And I, [[G2504]] if [[G1437]] I be lifted up [[G5312]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] will draw [[G1670]] all [[G3956]] unto [[G4314]] me. [[G1683]]

### 33
This [[G5124]] he said, [[G3004]] signifying [[G4591]] what [[G4169]] death [[G2288]] he should [[G3195]] die. [[G599]]

### 34
The [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] We [[G2249]] have heard [[G191]] out [[G1537]] of [[G3551]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] that [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] abideth [[G3306]] for [[G1519]] ever: [[G165]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] sayest [[G3004]] thou, [[G4771]] The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] be lifted up? [[G5312]] who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] this [[G3778]] Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] man? [[G444]]

### 35
Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Yet [[G2089]] a little [[G3398]] while [[G5550]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G5216]] Walk [[G4043]] while [[G2193]] ye have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] lest [[G2443]] darkness [[G4653]] come upon [[G2638]] you: [[G5209]] for [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that walketh [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] darkness [[G4653]] knoweth [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] whither [[G4226]] he goeth. [[G5217]]

### 36
While [[G2193]] ye have [[G2192]] light, [[G5457]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] that [[G2443]] ye may be [[G1096]] the children [[G5207]] of light. [[G5457]] These things [[G5023]] spake [[G2980]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] departed, [[G565]] and did hide himself [[G2928]] from [[G575]] them. [[G846]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] he [[G846]] though had [[G4160]] done [[G4160]] so many [[G5118]] miracles [[G4592]] before [[G1715]] them, [[G846]] yet they believed [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] on [[G1519]] him: [[G846]]

### 38
That [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] of Esaias [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] might be fulfilled, [[G4137]] which [[G3739]] he spake, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G5101]] hath believed [[G4100]] our [[G2257]] report? [[G189]] and [[G2532]] to whom [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] hath been [[G601]] arm [[G1023]] of the Lord [[G2962]] revealed? [[G601]]

### 39
Therefore [[G1223]] they could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] believe, [[G4100]] because [[G3754]] that [[G5124]] Esaias [[G2268]] said [[G2036]] again, [[G3825]]

### 40
He hath blinded [[G5186]] their [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] hardened [[G4456]] their [[G846]] heart; [[G2588]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] they should [[G1492]] see [[G1492]] with [[G3788]] eyes, [[G3788]] nor [[G2532]] understand [[G3539]] with [[G2588]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] be converted, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] I should heal [[G2390]] them. [[G846]]

### 41
These things [[G5023]] said [[G2036]] Esaias, [[G2268]] when [[G3753]] he saw [[G1492]] his [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] spake [[G2980]] of [[G4012]] him. [[G846]]

### 42
Nevertheless [[G3676]] among [[G1537]] the chief [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] also [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him; [[G846]] but [[G235]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] not [[G3756]] they did [[G3670]] confess [[G3670]] lest [[G2443]] they should be [[G1096]] put out of the synagogue: [[G656]]

### 43
For [[G1063]] they loved [[G25]] the [[G3588]] praise [[G1391]] of [[G444]] men [[G444]] more [[G3123]] than [[G2260]] the [[G3588]] praise [[G1391]]  of [[G3588]] God. [[G2316]]

### 44
Jesus [[G2424]] cried [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] He [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] me, [[G1691]] believeth [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] on [[G1519]] me, [[G1691]] but [[G235]] on [[G1519]] him [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that seeth [[G2334]] me [[G1691]] seeth [[G2334]] him [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 46
I [[G1473]] am come [[G2064]] a light [[G5457]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] that [[G2443]] whosoever [[G3956]] believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] me [[G1691]] not [[G3361]] should [[G3306]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] darkness. [[G4653]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] hear [[G191]] my [[G3450]] words, [[G4487]] and [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] not, [[G3361]] I [[G1473]] judge [[G2919]] him [[G846]] not: [[G3756]] for [[G1063]] came [[G2064]] I [[G2443]] not [[G3756]] to [[G2443]] judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] to [[G2443]] save [[G4982]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 48
He [[G3588]] that rejecteth [[G114]] me, [[G1691]] and [[G2532]] receiveth [[G2983]] not [[G3361]] my [[G3450]] words, [[G4487]] hath [[G2192]] one that judgeth [[G2919]] him: [[G846]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3739]] I have spoken, [[G2980]] the same [[G1565]] shall judge [[G2919]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

### 49
For [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] not [[G3756]] have [[G2980]] spoken [[G2980]] of [[G1537]] myself; [[G1683]] but [[G235]] the Father [[G3962]] which sent [[G3992]] me, [[G3165]] he [[G846]] gave [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] a commandment, [[G1785]] what [[G5101]] I should say, [[G2036]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] I should speak. [[G2980]]

### 50
And [[G2532]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] commandment [[G1785]] is [[G2076]] life [[G2222]] everlasting: [[G166]] whatsoever [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] speak [[G2980]] therefore, [[G3767]] even as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] said [[G2046]] unto me, [[G3427]] so [[G3779]] I speak. [[G2980]]
