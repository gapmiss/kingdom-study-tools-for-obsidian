### 1
In [[G1722]] the beginning [[G746]] was [[G2258]] the [[G3588]] Word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] was [[G2258]] with [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] was [[G2258]] God. [[G2316]]

### 2
The same [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the beginning [[G746]] with [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]]

### 3
All things [[G3956]] were made [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] without [[G5565]] him [[G846]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3761]] any thing [[G1520]] made [[G1096]] that [[G3739]] was made. [[G1096]]

### 4
In [[G1722]] him [[G846]] was [[G2258]] life; [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] was [[G2258]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of [[G444]] men. [[G444]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] shineth [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] darkness; [[G4653]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] darkness [[G4653]] comprehended [[G2638]] it [[G846]] not. [[G3756]]

### 6
There was [[G1096]] a man [[G444]] sent [[G649]] from [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] whose [[G846]] name [[G3686]] John. [[G2491]]

### 7
The same [[G3778]] came [[G2064]] for [[G1519]] a witness, [[G3141]] to [[G2443]] bear witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] that [[G2443]] all [[G3956]] through [[G1223]] him [[G846]] might believe. [[G4100]]

### 8
He was [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] that [[G1565]] Light, [[G5457]] but [[G235]] to [[G2443]] bear witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] that [[G3588]] Light. [[G5457]]

### 9
was [[G2258]] the [[G3588]] true [[G228]] Light, [[G5457]] which [[G3739]] lighteth [[G5461]] every [[G3956]] man [[G444]] that cometh [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 10
He was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] was made [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] knew [[G1097]] him [[G846]] not. [[G3756]]

### 11
He came [[G2064]] unto [[G1519]] his [[G3588]] own, [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] his [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] received [[G3880]] him [[G846]] not. [[G3756]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] as many as [[G3745]] received [[G2983]] him, [[G846]] to them [[G846]] gave he [[G1325]] power [[G1849]] to become [[G1096]] the sons [[G5043]] of God, [[G2316]] them [[G3588]] to that [[G4100]] believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] his [[G846]] name: [[G3686]]

### 13
Which [[G3739]] were born, [[G1080]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] blood, [[G129]] nor [[G3761]] of [[G1537]] the will [[G2307]] of the flesh, [[G4561]] nor [[G3761]] of [[G1537]] the will [[G2307]] of man, [[G435]] but [[G235]] of [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] was made [[G1096]] flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] dwelt [[G4637]] among [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] (and [[G2532]] we beheld [[G2300]] his [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] as [[G5613]] of the only begotten [[G3439]] of [[G3844]] the Father,) [[G3962]] full [[G4134]] of grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] truth. [[G225]]

### 15
John [[G2491]] bare witness [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] cried, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] he of whom [[G3739]] I spake, [[G2036]] He that [[G3588]] cometh [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me [[G3450]] is preferred [[G1096]] before [[G1715]] me: [[G3450]] for [[G3754]] he [[G2258]] was [[G2258]] before [[G4413]] me. [[G3450]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] fulness [[G4138]] all [[G3956]] have [[G2983]] we [[G2249]] received, [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] grace [[G5485]] for [[G473]] grace. [[G5485]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] was given [[G1325]] by [[G1223]] Moses, [[G3475]] grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] truth [[G225]] came [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 18
No man [[G3762]] hath seen [[G3708]] God [[G2316]] at any time; [[G4455]] the [[G3588]] only begotten [[G3439]] Son, [[G5207]] which [[G3588]] is [[G5607]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] bosom [[G2859]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3962]] Father, [[G3962]] he [[G1565]] hath declared [[G1834]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] record [[G3141]] of [[G2491]] John, [[G2491]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] sent [[G649]] priests [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] Levites [[G3019]] from [[G1537]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to [[G2443]] ask [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] Who [[G5101]] art [[G1488]] thou? [[G4771]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] he confessed, [[G3670]] and [[G2532]] denied [[G720]] not; [[G3756]] but [[G2532]] confessed, [[G3670]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] they asked [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] then? [[G3767]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] Elias? [[G2243]] And [[G2532]] he saith, [[G3004]] I am [[G1510]] not. [[G3756]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] that [[G3588]] prophet? [[G4396]] And [[G2532]] he answered, [[G611]] No. [[G3756]]

### 22
Then [[G3767]] said they [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Who [[G5101]] art thou? [[G1488]] that [[G2443]] we may give [[G1325]] an answer [[G612]] them [[G3588]] to that [[G3992]] sent [[G3992]] us. [[G2248]] What [[G5101]] sayest thou [[G3004]] of [[G4012]] thyself? [[G4572]]

### 23
He said, [[G5346]] I [[G1473]] the voice [[G5456]] of one crying [[G994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] Make straight [[G2116]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] as [[G2531]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Esaias. [[G2268]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] which were sent [[G649]] were [[G2258]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees. [[G5330]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] they asked [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] baptizest thou [[G907]] then, [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] thou [[G4771]] be [[G1488]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] nor [[G3777]] Elias, [[G2243]] neither [[G3777]] that [[G3588]] prophet? [[G4396]]

### 26
John [[G2491]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] baptize [[G907]] with [[G1722]] water: [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] there standeth [[G2476]] one among [[G3319]] you, [[G5216]] whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] know [[G1492]] not; [[G3756]]

### 27
He [[G846]] it is, [[G2076]] who [[G3739]] coming [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me [[G3450]] is preferred [[G1096]] before [[G1715]] me, [[G3450]] whose [[G3739]] shoe's [[G846]] latchet [[G2438]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] to [[G2443]] unloose. [[G3089]]

### 28
These things [[G5023]] were done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Bethabara [[G962]] beyond [[G4008]] Jordan, [[G2446]] where [[G3699]] John [[G2491]] was [[G2258]] baptizing. [[G907]]

### 29
The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] John [[G2491]] seeth [[G991]] Jesus [[G2424]] coming [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saith, [[G3004]] Behold [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G286]] of God, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] taketh away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] sin [[G266]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world. [[G2889]]

### 30
This [[G3778]] is he [[G2076]] of [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] said, [[G2036]] After [[G3694]] me [[G3450]] cometh [[G2064]] a man [[G435]] which [[G3739]] is preferred [[G1096]] before [[G1715]] me: [[G3450]] for [[G3754]] he was [[G2258]] before [[G4413]] me. [[G3450]]

### 31
And I [[G2504]] knew [[G1492]] him [[G846]] not: [[G3756]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] he should be made manifest [[G5319]] to [[G2474]] Israel, [[G2474]] therefore [[G1223]] am [[G2064]] I [[G1473]] come [[G2064]] baptizing [[G907]] with [[G1722]] water. [[G5204]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] bare record, [[G3140]] saying, [[G3004]] I saw [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] descending [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] like [[G5616]] a dove, [[G4058]] and [[G2532]] it abode [[G3306]] upon [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G2504]] I [[G1492]] knew [[G1492]] him [[G846]] not: [[G3756]] but [[G235]] he [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me [[G3165]] to baptize [[G907]] with [[G1722]] water, [[G5204]] the same [[G1565]] said [[G2036]] unto me, [[G3427]] Upon [[G1909]] whom [[G3739]] thou shalt see [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] descending, [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] remaining [[G3306]] on [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] the same [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] he [[G3588]] which baptizeth [[G907]] with [[G1722]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 34
And [[G2504]] I [[G3708]] saw, [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] bare record [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 35
Again [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] next day after [[G1887]] John [[G2491]] stood, [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] disciples; [[G3101]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] looking [[G1689]]  upon [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] as he walked, [[G4043]] he saith, [[G3004]] Behold [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G286]] of [[G2316]] God! [[G2316]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] speak, [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] they followed [[G190]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 38
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] turned, [[G4762]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2300]] them [[G846]] following, [[G190]] and saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] seek ye? [[G2212]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Rabbi, [[G4461]] (which [[G3739]] is to say, [[G3004]] being interpreted, [[G2059]] Master,) [[G1320]] where [[G4226]] dwellest thou? [[G3306]] They [[G3588]]

### 39
He saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G1492]] They came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] where [[G4225]] he dwelt, [[G3306]] and [[G2532]] abode [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] him [[G846]] that [[G1565]] day: [[G2250]] for [[G1161]] it was [[G2258]] about [[G5613]] the tenth [[G1182]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 40
One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] which [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] John [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] was [[G2258]] Andrew, [[G406]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter's [[G4074]] brother. [[G80]]

### 41
He [[G3778]] first [[G4413]] findeth [[G2147]] his [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] brother [[G80]] Simon, [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] We have found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] Messias, [[G3323]] which [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] being interpreted, [[G3177]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] he brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] Jesus. [[G2424]] And [[G1161]] when [[G1689]] Jesus [[G2424]] beheld [[G1689]] him, [[G846]] he said, [[G2036]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Jona: [[G2495]] thou [[G4771]] shalt be called [[G2564]] Cephas, [[G2786]] which [[G3739]] is by interpretation, [[G2059]] A stone. [[G4074]]

### 43
The [[G3588]] day following [[G1887]] Jesus [[G2424]] would [[G2309]] go forth [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] findeth [[G2147]] Philip, [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 44
Now [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] was [[G2258]] of [[G575]] Bethsaida, [[G966]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] of Andrew [[G406]] and [[G2532]] Peter. [[G4074]]

### 45
Philip [[G5376]] findeth [[G2147]] Nathanael, [[G3482]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] We have found [[G2147]] him, of whom [[G3739]] Moses [[G3475]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] did write, [[G1125]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G575]] Nazareth, [[G3478]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of [[G2501]] Joseph. [[G2501]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] Nathanael [[G3482]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Can there [[G1410]] any [[G5100]] good thing [[G18]] come [[G1511]] out of [[G1537]] Nazareth? [[G3478]] Philip [[G5376]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G1492]]

### 47
Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] Nathanael [[G3482]] coming [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] of [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] Behold [[G1492]] an Israelite [[G2475]] indeed, [[G230]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] guile! [[G1388]]

### 48
Nathanael [[G3482]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Whence [[G4159]] knowest thou [[G1097]] me? [[G3165]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Before [[G4253]] that [[G3588]] Philip [[G5376]] called [[G5455]] thee, [[G4571]] when thou wast [[G5607]] under [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] fig [[G4808]] tree, [[G4808]] I saw [[G1492]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 49
Nathanael [[G3482]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Rabbi, [[G4461]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of [[G2474]] Israel. [[G2474]]

### 50
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Because [[G3754]] I said [[G2036]] unto thee, [[G4671]] I saw [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] fig tree, [[G4808]] believest thou? [[G4100]] thou shalt see [[G3700]] greater things than [[G3187]] these. [[G5130]]

### 51
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Hereafter [[G575]] ye shall see [[G3700]] heaven [[G3772]] open, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] ascending [[G305]] and [[G2532]] descending [[G2597]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man. [[G444]]
