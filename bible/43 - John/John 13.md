### 1
Now [[G1161]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3957]] passover, [[G3957]] when [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] was come [[G2064]] that [[G2443]] he should depart [[G3327]] out of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] world [[G2889]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] having loved [[G25]] his [[G2398]] own [[G2398]] which [[G3588]] were in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] he loved [[G25]] them [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] the end. [[G5056]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] supper [[G1173]] being ended, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] now [[G2235]] having [[G906]] put [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] of Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] Simon's [[G4613]] to [[G2443]] betray [[G3860]] him; [[G846]]

### 3
Jesus [[G2424]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] had given [[G1325]] all things [[G3956]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] hands, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] he was come [[G1831]] from [[G575]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] went [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] God; [[G2316]]

### 4
He riseth [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] supper, [[G1173]] and [[G2532]] laid aside [[G5087]] his [[G3588]] garments; [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2983]] a towel, [[G3012]] and girded [[G1241]] himself. [[G1438]]

### 5
After that [[G1534]] he poureth [[G906]] water [[G5204]] into [[G1519]]  a bason, [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to wash [[G3538]] the [[G3588]] disciples' [[G3101]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] to wipe [[G1591]] with the [[G3588]] towel [[G3012]] wherewith [[G3739]] he was [[G2258]] girded. [[G1241]]

### 6
Then [[G3767]] cometh he [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter: [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] Peter saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] thou [[G4771]] dost [[G3538]] wash [[G3538]] my [[G3450]] feet? [[G4228]]

### 7
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] What [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] do [[G4160]] thou [[G4771]] knowest [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] now; [[G737]] but [[G1161]] thou shalt know [[G1097]] hereafter. [[G3326]]

### 8
Peter [[G4074]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou shalt [[G3538]] never [[G1519]] wash [[G3538]] my [[G3450]] feet. [[G4228]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] If [[G1437]] I wash [[G3538]] thee [[G4571]] not, [[G3361]] thou hast [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] part [[G3313]] with [[G3326]] me. [[G1700]]

### 9
Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] not [[G3361]] my [[G3450]] feet [[G4228]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] head. [[G2776]]

### 10
Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] to him, [[G846]] He that [[G3588]] is washed [[G3068]] needeth [[G5532]]  save [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] to wash [[G3538]] feet, [[G4228]] but [[G235]] is [[G2076]] clean [[G2513]] every whit: [[G3650]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] clean, [[G2513]] but [[G235]] not [[G3780]] all. [[G3956]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] he knew [[G1492]] who [[G3588]] should betray [[G3860]] him; [[G846]] therefore [[G1223]] said he, [[G2036]] Ye are [[G2075]] not [[G3780]] all [[G3956]] clean. [[G2513]]

### 12
So [[G3767]] after [[G3753]] he had washed [[G3538]] their [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] had taken [[G2983]] his [[G846]] garments, [[G2440]] and was set down [[G377]] again, [[G3825]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Know ye [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] I have done [[G4160]] to you? [[G5213]]

### 13
Ye [[G5210]] call [[G5455]] me [[G3165]] Master [[G1320]] and [[G2532]] Lord: [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] ye say [[G3004]] well; [[G2573]] for [[G1063]] I am. [[G1510]]

### 14
If [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] then, [[G3767]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Master, [[G1320]] have washed [[G3538]] your [[G5216]] feet; [[G4228]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] ought [[G3784]] to wash [[G3538]] one another's [[G240]] feet. [[G4228]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] I have given [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] an example, [[G5262]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] should do [[G4160]] as [[G2531]] I [[G1473]] have done [[G4160]] to you. [[G5213]]

### 16
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] The servant [[G1401]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] greater [[G3187]] than his [[G846]] lord; [[G2962]] neither [[G3761]] he that is sent [[G652]] greater [[G3187]] he [[G3588]] than that [[G3992]] sent [[G3992]] him. [[G846]]

### 17
If [[G1487]] ye know [[G1492]] these things, [[G5023]] happy [[G3107]] are ye [[G2075]] if [[G1437]] ye do [[G4160]] them. [[G846]]

### 18
I speak [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] of [[G4012]] you [[G5216]] all: [[G3956]] I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] whom [[G3739]] I have chosen: [[G1586]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] may be fulfilled, [[G4137]] He that [[G3588]] eateth [[G5176]] bread [[G740]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] hath lifted up [[G1869]] his [[G846]] heel [[G4418]] against [[G1909]] me. [[G1691]]

### 19
Now [[G575]]  I [[G737]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] before [[G4253]] it come, [[G1096]] that, [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] it is come to pass, [[G1096]] ye may believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]]

### 20
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] He that [[G3588]] receiveth [[G2983]] whomsoever [[G1437]] I send [[G3992]] receiveth [[G2983]] me; [[G1691]] and [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] receiveth [[G2983]] me [[G1691]] receiveth [[G2983]] him that [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 21
When [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] thus [[G5023]] had [[G2036]] said, [[G2036]] he was troubled [[G5015]] in spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] testified, [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] shall betray [[G3860]] me. [[G3165]]

### 22
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] looked [[G991]] one [[G1519]] on another, [[G240]] doubting [[G639]] of [[G4012]] whom [[G5101]] he spake. [[G3004]]

### 23
Now [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] leaning [[G345]] on [[G1722]] Jesus' [[G2424]] bosom [[G2859]] one [[G1520]] of his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] whom [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] loved. [[G25]]

### 24
Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] therefore [[G3767]] beckoned [[G3506]] to him, [[G5129]] that he should ask [[G4441]] who [[G5101]] it should be [[G1498]] of [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] he spake. [[G3004]]

### 25
He [[G1565]] then [[G1161]] lying [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] Jesus' [[G2424]] breast [[G4738]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G5101]] is it? [[G2076]]

### 26
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] He [[G1565]] it is, [[G2076]] to whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] shall give [[G1929]] a sop, [[G5596]] when I have dipped [[G911]] And [[G2532]] when he had dipped [[G1686]] the [[G3588]] sop, [[G5596]] he gave [[G1325]] to Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] of Simon. [[G4613]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] sop [[G5596]] Satan [[G4567]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] him. [[G1565]] Then [[G5119]] said [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto him, [[G846]] That [[G3739]] thou doest, [[G4160]] do [[G4160]] quickly. [[G5032]]

### 28
Now [[G1161]] no man [[G3762]] the [[G3588]] at [[G345]] table [[G345]] knew [[G1097]] for [[G4314]] what intent [[G5101]] he spake [[G2036]] this [[G5124]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] some [[G5100]] thought, [[G1380]] because [[G1893]] Judas [[G2455]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] bag, [[G1101]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] had said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Buy [[G59]] that [[G3739]] we have [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] of against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast; [[G1859]] or, [[G2228]] that [[G2443]] he should give [[G1325]] something [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4434]] poor. [[G4434]]

### 30
He [[G1565]] then [[G3767]] having received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] sop [[G5596]] went out: [[G1831]] immediately [[G2112]] and [[G1161]] it was [[G2258]] night. [[G3571]]

### 31
when [[G3753]] Therefore, he was gone [[G1831]] out, [[G1831]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G3004]] Now [[G3568]] the [[G3588]] is [[G1392]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] glorified, [[G1392]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] is glorified [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 32
If [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] be glorified [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] God [[G2316]] also [[G2532]] shall [[G1392]] glorify [[G1392]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] straightway [[G2117]] shall [[G1392]] glorify [[G1392]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
Little children, [[G5040]] yet [[G2089]] a little while [[G3397]] I am [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G5216]] Ye shall seek [[G2212]] me: [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] I said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2453]] Jews, [[G2453]] Whither [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] go, [[G5217]] ye [[G5210]] cannot [[G1410]] come; [[G2064]] so [[G2532]] now [[G737]] I say [[G3004]] to you. [[G5213]]

### 34
A new [[G2537]] commandment [[G1785]] I give [[G1325]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G2443]] ye love [[G25]] one another; [[G240]] as [[G2531]] I have loved [[G25]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]]

### 35
By [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] shall [[G1097]] all [[G3956]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] my [[G1698]] disciples, [[G3101]] if [[G1437]] ye have [[G2192]] love [[G26]] to [[G1722]] one [[G240]] another. [[G240]]

### 36
Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] whither [[G4226]] goest thou? [[G5217]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] Whither [[G3699]] I go, [[G5217]] thou canst [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] follow [[G190]] me [[G3427]] now; [[G3568]] but [[G1161]] thou shalt follow [[G190]] me [[G3427]] afterwards. [[G5305]]

### 37
Peter [[G4074]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] why [[G1302]] cannot I [[G1410]] follow [[G190]] thee [[G4671]] now? [[G737]] I will lay down [[G5087]] my [[G3450]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] thy sake. [[G4675]]

### 38
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] Wilt thou lay down [[G5087]] thy [[G4675]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] my sake? [[G1700]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] The cock [[G220]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G5455]] crow, [[G5455]] till [[G2193]] thou hast denied [[G533]] me [[G3165]] thrice. [[G5151]]
