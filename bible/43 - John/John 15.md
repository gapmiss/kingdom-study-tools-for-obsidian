### 1
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] true [[G228]] vine, [[G288]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] husbandman. [[G1092]]

### 2
Every [[G3956]] branch [[G2814]] in [[G1722]] me [[G1698]] that beareth [[G5342]] not [[G3361]] fruit [[G2590]] he [[G846]] taketh away: [[G142]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] that beareth [[G5342]] fruit, [[G2590]] he purgeth [[G2508]] it, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] it may bring forth [[G5342]] more [[G4119]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 3
Now [[G2235]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] clean [[G2513]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] which [[G3739]] I have spoken [[G2980]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 4
Abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]] As [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] branch [[G2814]] cannot [[G1410]] bear [[G5342]] fruit [[G2590]] of [[G575]] itself, [[G1438]] except [[G1437]] it abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] vine; [[G288]] no more can [[G3761]] ye, [[G5210]] except [[G1437]] ye abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]

### 5
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] vine, [[G288]] ye [[G5210]] the [[G3588]] branches: [[G2814]] He that [[G3588]] abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] the same [[G3778]] bringeth forth [[G5342]] much [[G4183]] fruit: [[G2590]] for [[G3754]] without [[G5565]] me [[G1700]] ye can [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 6
If [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] abide [[G3306]] not [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] he is cast [[G906]] forth [[G1854]] as [[G5613]] a branch, [[G2814]] and [[G2532]] is withered; [[G3583]] and [[G2532]] men gather [[G4863]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] they are burned. [[G2545]]

### 7
If [[G1437]] ye abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] words [[G4487]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] ye shall ask [[G154]] what [[G3739]] ye will, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] it shall be done [[G1096]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 8
Herein [[G1722]]  is [[G5129]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] glorified, [[G1392]] that [[G2443]] ye bear [[G5342]] much [[G4183]] fruit; [[G2590]] so [[G2532]] shall ye be [[G1096]] my [[G1698]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 9
As [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] hath loved [[G25]] me, [[G3165]] so have I [[G2504]] loved [[G25]] you: [[G5209]] continue ye [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1699]] love. [[G26]]

### 10
If [[G1437]] ye keep [[G5083]] my [[G3450]] commandments, [[G1785]] ye shall abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] love; [[G26]] even as [[G2531]] I [[G1473]] have kept [[G5083]] my [[G3450]] Father's [[G3962]] commandments, [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] love. [[G26]]

### 11
These things [[G5023]] have I spoken [[G2980]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] my [[G1699]] joy [[G5479]] might remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] joy [[G5479]] might be full. [[G4137]]

### 12
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] my [[G1699]] commandment, [[G1785]] That [[G2443]] ye love [[G25]] one another, [[G240]] as [[G2531]] I have loved [[G25]] you. [[G5209]]

### 13
Greater [[G3173]] love [[G26]] hath [[G2192]] no man [[G3762]] than this, [[G3778]] that [[G2443]] a man [[G5100]] lay down [[G5087]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] his [[G846]] friends. [[G5384]]

### 14
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] my [[G3450]] friends, [[G5384]] if [[G1437]] ye do [[G4160]] whatsoever [[G3745]] I [[G1473]] command [[G1781]] you. [[G5213]]

### 15
Henceforth I call [[G3004]] you [[G5209]] not [[G3765]] servants; [[G1401]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] knoweth [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] his [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] doeth: [[G4160]] but [[G1161]] I have called [[G2046]] you [[G5209]] friends; [[G5384]] for [[G3754]] all things [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] I have heard [[G191]] of [[G3844]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] I have made known [[G1107]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 16
Ye have [[G5210]] not [[G3756]] chosen [[G1586]] me, [[G3165]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] have chosen [[G1586]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] ordained [[G5087]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] should go [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] bring forth [[G5342]] fruit, [[G2590]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] fruit [[G2590]] should remain: [[G3306]] that [[G2443]] whatsoever [[G302]] ye shall ask [[G154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3962]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] he may give it [[G1325]] you. [[G5213]]

### 17
These things [[G5023]] I command [[G1781]] you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] ye love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]]

### 18
If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] hate [[G3404]] you, [[G5209]] ye know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] it [[G5216]] hated [[G3404]] me [[G1691]] before [[G4412]] you. [[G5216]]

### 19
If [[G1487]] ye were [[G2258]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] the [[G3588]] world would [[G2889]] love [[G5368]]  his [[G302]] own: [[G2398]] but [[G1161]] because [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] have chosen [[G1586]] you [[G5209]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] therefore [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] hateth [[G3404]] you. [[G5209]]

### 20
Remember [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] said [[G2036]] unto you, [[G5213]] The servant [[G1401]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] greater than [[G3187]] his [[G846]] lord. [[G2962]] If [[G1487]] they have persecuted [[G1377]] me, [[G1691]] also [[G2532]] they will [[G1377]] persecute [[G1377]] you; [[G5209]] if [[G1487]] they have kept [[G5083]] my [[G3450]] saying, [[G3056]] they will keep [[G5083]] yours [[G5212]] also. [[G2532]]

### 21
But [[G235]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] will they do [[G4160]] unto you [[G5213]] for [[G1223]] my [[G3450]]  name's sake, [[G3588]] because [[G3754]] they know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] him [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 22
If [[G1487]] not [[G3361]] I had [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] spoken [[G2980]] unto them, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] they had [[G2192]] had [[G2192]] sin: [[G266]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] they have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] cloke [[G4392]] for [[G4012]] their [[G846]] sin. [[G266]]

### 23
He [[G3588]] that hateth [[G3404]] me [[G1691]] hateth [[G3404]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] also. [[G2532]]

### 24
If [[G1487]] not [[G3361]] I had [[G4160]] done [[G4160]] among [[G1722]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] none [[G3762]] other man [[G243]] did, [[G4160]] they had had [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] sin: [[G266]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] both [[G2532]] have they [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] hated [[G3404]] both [[G2532]] me [[G1691]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 25
But [[G235]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] that [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] might be fulfilled [[G4137]] is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] law, [[G3551]] They hated [[G3404]] me [[G3165]] without a cause. [[G1432]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Comforter [[G3875]] is come, [[G2064]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] will send [[G3992]] unto you [[G5213]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G225]] truth, [[G225]] which [[G3739]] proceedeth [[G1607]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] he [[G1565]] shall testify [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] me: [[G1700]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G1161]] shall bear witness, [[G3140]] because [[G3754]] ye have been [[G2075]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] from [[G575]] the beginning. [[G746]]
