### 1
After [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G565]] over [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] of [[G1056]] Galilee, [[G1056]] which is of [[G5085]] Tiberias. [[G5085]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] a [[G3793]] great [[G4183]] multitude [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they saw [[G3708]] his [[G846]] miracles [[G4592]] which [[G3739]] he did [[G4160]] on [[G1909]] them that were diseased. [[G770]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] went up [[G424]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3735]] mountain, [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] there [[G1563]] he sat [[G2521]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] passover, [[G3957]]  a [[G3588]] feast of [[G2453]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] was [[G2258]] nigh. [[G1451]]

### 5
When [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] then [[G3767]] lifted up [[G1869]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2300]] great [[G4183]] a [[G3793]] company [[G3793]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] he saith [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] Philip, [[G5376]] Whence [[G4159]] shall we buy [[G59]] bread, [[G740]] that [[G2443]] these [[G3778]] may eat? [[G5315]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] he said [[G3004]] to prove [[G3985]] him: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] he himself [[G846]] knew [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] he would [[G3195]] do. [[G4160]]

### 7
Philip [[G5376]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] Two hundred [[G1250]] pennyworth [[G1220]] of bread [[G740]] not [[G3756]] is [[G714]] sufficient [[G714]] for them, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] every one [[G1538]] of them [[G846]] may take [[G2983]] a [[G5100]] little. [[G1024]]

### 8
One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Andrew, [[G406]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter's [[G4074]] brother, [[G80]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]]

### 9
There is [[G2076]] a here, [[G1520]] lad [[G3808]] which [[G3739]] hath [[G2192]] five [[G4002]] barley [[G2916]] loaves, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] small fishes: [[G3795]] but [[G235]] what [[G5101]] are [[G2076]] they [[G5023]] among [[G1519]] so many? [[G5118]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Make [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] men [[G444]] sit down. [[G377]] Now [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] much [[G4183]] grass [[G5528]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] place. [[G5117]] So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] sat down, [[G377]] in [[G706]] number [[G706]] about [[G5616]] five thousand. [[G4000]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] loaves; [[G740]] and [[G2532]] when he had given thanks, [[G2168]] he distributed [[G1239]] to the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] to them that [[G3588]] were set down; [[G345]] and [[G2532]] likewise [[G3668]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fishes [[G3795]] as much as [[G3745]] they would. [[G2309]]

### 12
When [[G5613]] they were filled, [[G1705]] he said [[G3004]] unto his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Gather up [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] fragments [[G2801]] that remain, [[G4052]] that [[G2443]] nothing [[G3361]] be lost. [[G622]]

### 13
Therefore [[G3767]] they gathered together, [[G4863]] and [[G2532]] filled [[G1072]] twelve [[G1427]] baskets [[G2894]] with the fragments [[G2801]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] barley [[G2916]] loaves, [[G740]] which [[G3739]] remained over and above [[G4052]] unto them that had eaten. [[G977]]

### 14
Then [[G3767]] those men, [[G444]] when they had seen [[G1492]] the miracle [[G4592]] that [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] did, [[G4160]] said, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] of a truth [[G230]]  that [[G3588]] prophet [[G3588]] that should come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 15
Jesus [[G2424]] When [[G3767]] therefore [[G3767]] perceived [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] they would [[G3195]] come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] take by force, [[G726]] him [[G846]] to [[G2443]] make [[G4160]] him [[G846]] a king, [[G935]] he departed [[G402]] again [[G3825]] into [[G1519]]  a [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] himself [[G846]] alone. [[G3441]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] even [[G3798]] was come, [[G1096]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] went down [[G2597]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] entered [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] a [[G4143]] ship, [[G4143]] and went [[G2064]] over [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] toward [[G1519]] Capernaum. [[G2584]] And [[G2532]] it was [[G1096]] now [[G2235]] dark, [[G4653]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] not [[G3756]] was [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] them. [[G846]]

### 18
And [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] arose [[G1326]] by reason of a great [[G3173]] wind [[G417]] that blew. [[G4154]]

### 19
So when [[G3767]] they had rowed [[G1643]] about [[G5613]] five [[G4002]] and twenty [[G1501]] or [[G2228]] thirty [[G5144]] furlongs, [[G4712]] they see [[G2334]] Jesus [[G2424]] walking [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] drawing [[G1096]] nigh [[G1451]] unto the [[G3588]] ship: [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] they were afraid. [[G5399]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] It is [[G1510]] I; [[G1473]] not [[G3361]] be [[G5399]] afraid. [[G5399]]

### 21
Then [[G3767]] they willingly [[G2309]] received [[G2983]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship: [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] was [[G1096]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] whither [[G1519]]  they [[G3739]] went. [[G5217]]

### 22
The [[G3588]] day following, [[G1887]] the [[G3588]] when which [[G2476]] people [[G3793]] stood [[G2476]] on the other side [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea [[G2281]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] there was [[G2258]] none [[G3756]] other [[G243]] boat [[G4142]] there, [[G1563]] save [[G1487]] that [[G1565]] one [[G1520]] whereinto [[G1519]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were entered, [[G1684]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] went with [[G4897]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4142]] but [[G235]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were gone away [[G565]] alone; [[G3441]]

### 23
(Howbeit [[G1161]] there came [[G2064]] other [[G243]] boats [[G4142]] from [[G1537]] Tiberias [[G5085]] nigh unto [[G1451]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] they did eat [[G5315]] bread, [[G740]] after that had given [[G2168]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] thanks:) [[G2168]]

### 24
When [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] therefore [[G3767]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] was [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] there, [[G1563]] neither [[G3761]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] took [[G1684]] shipping, [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] seeking for [[G2212]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] when they had found [[G2147]] him [[G846]] on the other side [[G4008]] of the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] they said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Rabbi, [[G4461]] when [[G4219]] camest thou [[G1096]] hither? [[G5602]]

### 26
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Ye seek [[G2212]] me, [[G3165]] not [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] ye saw [[G1492]] the miracles, [[G4592]] but [[G235]] because [[G3754]] ye did eat [[G5315]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] loaves, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] were filled. [[G5526]]

### 27
Labour [[G2038]] not [[G3361]] for the [[G3588]] meat [[G1035]] which [[G622]] perisheth, [[G622]] but [[G235]]  for that [[G3588]] meat [[G1035]] which [[G3306]] endureth [[G3306]] unto [[G1519]] everlasting [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] shall give [[G1325]] unto you: [[G5213]] for [[G1063]] him [[G5126]] hath [[G4972]] God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] sealed. [[G4972]]

### 28
Then [[G3767]] said they [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] shall we do, [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] we might work [[G2038]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G2316]] God? [[G2316]]

### 29
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] This [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]]  of [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] ye believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him whom [[G3739]] he [[G1565]] hath sent. [[G649]]

### 30
They said [[G2036]] therefore [[G3767]] unto him, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] sign [[G4592]] shewest [[G4160]] thou [[G4771]] then, [[G3767]] that [[G2443]] we may see, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] thee? [[G4671]] what [[G5101]] dost thou work? [[G2038]]

### 31
Our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] did eat [[G5315]] manna [[G3131]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] desert; [[G2048]] as [[G2531]] it is [[G2076]] written, [[G1125]] He gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] bread [[G740]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] to eat. [[G5315]]

### 32
Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Moses [[G3475]] gave [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] not [[G3756]]  that [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] from [[G1537]] heaven; [[G3772]] but [[G235]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] giveth [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] true [[G228]] bread [[G740]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 33
For [[G1063]] the of [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] he [[G3588]] which cometh down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] giveth [[G1325]] life [[G2222]] unto the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 34
Then [[G3767]] said they [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] evermore [[G3842]] give [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] this [[G5126]] bread. [[G740]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]]  of [[G3588]] life: [[G2222]] he [[G3588]] that cometh [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me [[G3165]] never [[G3756]] shall [[G3983]] hunger; [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] me [[G1691]] never [[G3756]] shall [[G1372]] thirst. [[G1372]]

### 36
But [[G235]] I said [[G2036]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] also [[G2532]] ye have [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] not. [[G3756]]

### 37
All [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] giveth [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] shall come [[G2240]] to [[G4314]] me; [[G1691]] and [[G2532]] him [[G3588]] that cometh [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me [[G3165]] in no wise [[G3756]] I will [[G1544]] cast [[G1544]] out. [[G1854]]

### 38
For [[G3754]] I came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] not [[G3756]] to [[G2443]] do [[G4160]] mine [[G1699]] own [[G1699]] will, [[G2307]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of him that [[G3992]] sent [[G3992]] me. [[G3165]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Father's [[G3962]] will [[G2307]] which hath sent [[G3992]] me, [[G3165]] that [[G2443]] of [[G1537]] all [[G3956]] which [[G3739]] he hath given [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] I should lose [[G622]] nothing, [[G3361]] but [[G235]] should raise up again [[G450]] it [[G846]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of him that sent [[G3992]] me, [[G3165]] that [[G2443]] every one [[G3956]] which seeth [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] may have [[G2192]] everlasting [[G166]] life: [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] will raise up [[G450]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] at [[G2250]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

### 41
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] then [[G3767]] murmured [[G1111]] at [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] he said, [[G2036]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] which [[G3588]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] they said, [[G3004]] Is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Joseph, [[G2501]] whose [[G3739]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother [[G3384]] we [[G2249]] know? [[G1492]] how [[G4459]] is it then [[G3767]] that [[G3754]] he [[G3778]] saith, [[G3004]] I came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven? [[G3772]]

### 43
Jesus [[G2424]] therefore [[G3767]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Murmur [[G1111]] not [[G3361]] among [[G3326]] yourselves. [[G240]]

### 44
No man [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] except [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] which hath sent [[G3992]] me [[G3165]] draw [[G1670]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] will raise up [[G450]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] at [[G2250]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

### 45
It is [[G2076]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] And [[G2532]] they shall be [[G2071]] all [[G3956]] taught [[G1318]]  of [[G3588]] God. [[G2316]] Every man [[G3956]] therefore [[G3767]] that hath heard, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] hath learned [[G3129]] of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] cometh [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me. [[G3165]]

### 46
Not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] any man [[G5100]] hath seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] save [[G1487]] he [[G3588]] which is [[G5607]] of [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] he [[G3778]] hath seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 47
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] He [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] me [[G1691]] hath [[G2192]] everlasting [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 48
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]]  that [[G3588]] bread [[G740]]  of [[G3588]] life. [[G2222]]

### 49
Your [[G5216]] fathers [[G3962]] did eat [[G5315]] manna [[G3131]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] and [[G2532]] are dead. [[G599]]

### 50
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] which [[G3588]] cometh down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] that [[G2443]] a man [[G5100]] may eat [[G5315]] thereof, [[G1537]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] die. [[G599]]

### 51
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] bread [[G740]] which [[G3588]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven: [[G3772]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] eat [[G5315]] of [[G1537]] this [[G5127]] bread, [[G740]] he shall live [[G2198]] for [[G1519]] ever: [[G165]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] will give [[G1325]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] flesh, [[G4561]] which [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] will give [[G1325]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] of the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 52
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] therefore [[G3767]] strove [[G3164]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] saying, [[G3004]] How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] this man [[G3778]] give [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] flesh [[G4561]] to eat? [[G5315]]

### 53
Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Except [[G1437]] ye eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] his [[G846]] blood, [[G129]] ye have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G1438]]

### 54
Whoso eateth [[G5176]] my [[G3450]] flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] drinketh [[G4095]] my [[G3450]] blood, [[G129]] hath [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life; [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] will raise up [[G450]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] at [[G2250]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

### 55
For [[G1063]] my [[G3450]] flesh [[G4561]] is [[G2076]] meat [[G1035]] indeed, [[G230]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] blood [[G129]] is [[G2076]] drink [[G4213]] indeed. [[G230]]

### 56
He [[G3588]] that eateth [[G5176]] my [[G3450]] flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] drinketh [[G4095]] my [[G3450]] blood, [[G129]] dwelleth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 57
As [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] Father [[G3962]] hath sent [[G649]] me, [[G3165]] and I [[G2504]] live [[G2198]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Father: [[G3962]] so [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that eateth [[G5176]] me, [[G3165]] even he [[G2548]] shall live [[G2198]] by [[G1223]] me. [[G1691]]

### 58
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]]  that [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] which [[G3588]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven: [[G3772]] not [[G3756]] as [[G2531]] your [[G5216]] fathers [[G3962]] did eat [[G5315]] manna, [[G3131]] and [[G2532]] are dead: [[G599]] he [[G3588]] that eateth [[G5176]] this [[G5126]] of [[G740]] bread [[G740]] shall live [[G2198]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 59
These things [[G5023]] said he [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] the synagogue, [[G4864]] as he taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] Capernaum. [[G2584]]

### 60
Many [[G4183]] therefore [[G3767]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] when they had heard [[G191]] said, [[G2036]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] hard [[G4642]] an [[G3056]] saying; [[G3056]] who [[G5101]] can [[G1410]] hear [[G191]] it? [[G846]]

### 61
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1492]] in [[G1722]] himself [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] murmured [[G1111]] at [[G4012]] it, [[G5127]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] this [[G5124]] Doth [[G4624]] offend [[G4624]] you? [[G5209]]

### 62
and [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] ye shall see [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] ascend up [[G305]] where [[G3699]] he was [[G2258]] before? [[G4386]]

### 63
It is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G2227]] quickeneth; [[G2227]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] profiteth [[G5623]] nothing: [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] speak [[G2980]] unto you, [[G5213]] are [[G2076]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] are [[G2076]] life. [[G2222]]

### 64
But [[G235]] there are [[G1526]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] that [[G3739]] believe [[G4100]] not. [[G3756]] For [[G1063]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1492]] from [[G1537]] the beginning [[G746]] who [[G5101]] they were [[G1526]] that believed [[G4100]] not, [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] should [[G2076]] betray [[G3860]] him. [[G846]]

### 65
And [[G2532]] he said, [[G3004]] Therefore [[G1223]] said I [[G2046]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] no man [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] except [[G1437]] it were [[G5600]] given [[G1325]] unto him [[G846]] of [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 66
From [[G1537]] that [[G5127]] many [[G4183]] of [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] went [[G565]] back, [[G1519]] and [[G2532]] walked [[G4043]] no more [[G3765]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 67
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus unto [[G1427]] the [[G3588]] twelve, [[G1427]] Will [[G2309]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] go away? [[G5217]]

### 68
Then [[G3767]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] to [[G4314]] whom [[G5101]] shall we go? [[G565]] thou hast [[G2192]] the words [[G4487]] of [[G2222]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 69
And [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] believe [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] are sure [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] that [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]]

### 70
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] Have [[G1586]] I [[G1473]] chosen [[G1586]] you [[G5209]] twelve, [[G1427]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] is [[G2076]] a devil? [[G1228]]

### 71
He spake [[G3004]] of [[G2455]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot [[G2469]] of Simon: [[G4613]] for [[G1063]] he [[G3778]] it was that should [[G3195]] betray [[G3860]] him, [[G846]] being [[G5607]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] twelve. [[G1427]]
