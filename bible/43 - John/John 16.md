### 1
These things [[G5023]] have I spoken [[G2980]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] ye should be [[G4624]] offended. [[G4624]]

### 2
They shall put [[G4160]] you [[G5209]] out of the synagogues: [[G656]] yea, [[G235]] the time [[G5610]] cometh, [[G2064]] that [[G2443]] whosoever [[G3956]] killeth [[G615]] you [[G5209]] will think [[G1380]] that he doeth [[G4374]] God [[G2316]] service. [[G2999]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] these things [[G5023]] will they do [[G4160]] unto you, [[G5213]] because [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] they have [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] nor [[G3761]] me. [[G1691]]

### 4
But [[G235]] these things [[G5023]] have I told [[G2980]] you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5610]] shall come, [[G2064]] ye may remember [[G3421]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] told [[G2036]] you [[G5213]] of them. [[G846]] And [[G1161]] these things [[G5023]] I said [[G2036]] not [[G3756]] unto you [[G5213]] at [[G1537]] the beginning, [[G746]] because [[G3754]] I was [[G2252]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G5216]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] I go my way [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] him [[G3588]] that sent [[G3992]] me; [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] none [[G3762]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] asketh [[G2065]] me, [[G3165]] Whither [[G4226]] goest thou? [[G5217]]

### 6
But [[G235]] because [[G3754]] I have said [[G2980]] these things [[G5023]] unto you, [[G5213]] sorrow [[G3077]] hath filled [[G4137]] your [[G5216]] heart. [[G2588]]

### 7
Nevertheless [[G235]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] truth; [[G225]] It is expedient [[G4851]] for you [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] I [[G1473]] go away: [[G565]] for [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] I away, [[G565]] go [[G565]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] Comforter [[G3875]] not [[G3756]] will [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you; [[G5209]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] I depart, [[G4198]] I will send [[G3992]] him [[G846]] unto [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] when is [[G2064]] he [[G1565]] come, [[G2064]] he will reprove [[G1651]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] of [[G4012]] sin, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] of [[G4012]] righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] of [[G4012]] judgment: [[G2920]]

### 9
Of [[G4012]] sin, [[G266]] because [[G3754]] they believe [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] on [[G1519]] me; [[G1691]]

### 10
Of [[G4012]] righteousness, [[G1343]] because [[G3754]] I go [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] my [[G3450]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] ye see [[G2334]] me [[G3165]] no [[G3756]] more; [[G2089]]

### 11
Of [[G4012]] judgment, [[G2920]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] of this [[G5127]] world [[G2889]] is judged. [[G2919]]

### 12
I have [[G2192]] yet [[G2089]] many things them [[G4183]] to say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] but [[G235]] ye cannot [[G1410]] bear [[G941]] now. [[G737]]

### 13
Howbeit [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] he, [[G1565]] the [[G3588]] Spirit of [[G4151]] truth, [[G225]] is come, [[G2064]] he will guide [[G3594]] you [[G5209]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] truth: [[G225]] for [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] he shall [[G2980]] speak [[G2980]] of [[G575]] himself; [[G1438]] but [[G235]] whatsoever [[G3745]] he shall hear, [[G191]] shall he speak: [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] he will shew [[G312]] you [[G5213]] things [[G3588]] to come. [[G2064]]

### 14
He [[G1565]] shall glorify [[G1392]] me: [[G1691]] for [[G3754]] he shall receive [[G2983]] of [[G1537]] mine, [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] shall shew [[G312]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 15
All things [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] hath [[G2192]] are [[G2076]] mine: [[G1699]] therefore [[G1223]] said I, [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] he shall take [[G2983]] of [[G1537]] mine, [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] shall shew [[G312]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 16
A little while, [[G3397]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye shall [[G2334]] see [[G2334]] me: [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] a little while, [[G3397]] and [[G2532]] ye shall see [[G3700]] me, [[G3165]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] go [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 17
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] What [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] this [[G5124]] that [[G3739]] he saith [[G3004]] unto us, [[G2254]] A little while, [[G3397]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye shall [[G2334]] see [[G2334]] me: [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] a little while, [[G3397]] and [[G2532]] ye shall see [[G3700]] me: [[G3165]] and, [[G2532]] Because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] go [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father? [[G3962]]

### 18
They said [[G3004]] therefore, [[G3767]] What [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] this [[G5124]] that [[G3739]] he saith, [[G3004]] A [[G3588]] little while? [[G3397]] cannot [[G3756]] we [[G1492]] tell [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] he saith. [[G2980]]

### 19
Now [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] they were desirous [[G2309]] to ask [[G2065]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Do ye inquire [[G2212]] among [[G3326]] yourselves [[G240]] of [[G4012]] that [[G3754]] I said, [[G2036]] A little while, [[G3397]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye shall [[G2334]] see [[G2334]] me: [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] a little while, [[G3397]] and [[G2532]] ye shall see [[G3700]] me? [[G3165]]

### 20
Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] ye [[G5210]] shall weep [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] lament, [[G2354]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] shall rejoice: [[G5463]] and [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] shall be sorrowful, [[G3076]] but [[G235]] your [[G5216]] sorrow [[G3077]] shall be turned [[G1096]] into [[G1519]] joy. [[G5479]]

### 21
A [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] when [[G3752]] she is in travail [[G5088]] hath [[G2192]] sorrow, [[G3077]] because [[G3754]] her [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] is come: [[G2064]] but [[G1161]] as soon as [[G3752]] she is delivered [[G1080]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3813]] child, [[G3813]] she remembereth [[G3421]] no [[G3756]] more [[G2089]] the [[G3588]] anguish, [[G2347]] for [[G1223]] joy [[G5479]] that [[G3754]] a man [[G444]] is born [[G1080]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] now [[G3568]] therefore [[G3767]] have [[G2192]] sorrow: [[G3077]] but [[G1161]] I will see [[G3700]] you [[G5209]] again, [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] heart [[G2588]] shall rejoice, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] joy [[G5479]] no man [[G3762]] taketh [[G142]] from [[G575]] you. [[G5216]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] ye shall ask [[G2065]] me [[G1691]] nothing. [[G3762]] Verily, [[G281]] verily, [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Whatsoever [[G3745]] ye shall ask [[G154]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] he will give [[G1325]] you. [[G5213]]

### 24
Hitherto [[G2193]]  have ye [[G737]] asked [[G154]] nothing [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name: [[G3686]] ask, [[G154]] and [[G2532]] ye shall receive, [[G2983]] that [[G2443]] your [[G5216]] joy [[G5479]] may be [[G5600]] full. [[G4137]]

### 25
These things [[G5023]] have I spoken [[G2980]] unto you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]] proverbs: [[G3942]] but [[G235]] the time [[G5610]] cometh, [[G2064]] when [[G3753]] no [[G3756]] I shall unto [[G2980]] more [[G2089]] speak [[G2980]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]] proverbs, [[G3942]] but [[G235]] I shall shew [[G312]] you [[G5213]] plainly [[G3954]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 26
At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] ye shall ask [[G154]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name: [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] I say [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] will pray [[G2065]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] for [[G4012]] you: [[G5216]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] himself [[G846]] loveth [[G5368]] you, [[G5209]] because [[G3754]] ye [[G5210]] have loved [[G5368]] me, [[G1691]] and [[G2532]] have believed [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] came out [[G1831]] from [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]]

### 28
I came forth [[G1831]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] am come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world: [[G2889]] again, [[G3825]] I leave [[G863]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 29
His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said unto [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] Lo, [[G1492]] now [[G3568]] speakest thou [[G2980]] plainly, [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] speakest [[G3004]] no [[G3762]] proverb. [[G3942]]

### 30
Now [[G3568]] are we sure [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] thou knowest [[G1492]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] needest [[G5532]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] any man [[G5100]] should ask [[G2065]] thee: [[G4571]] by [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] we believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] thou camest forth [[G1831]] from [[G575]] God. [[G2316]]

### 31
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] now [[G737]] Do ye [[G4100]] believe? [[G4100]]

### 32
Behold, [[G2400]] the hour [[G5610]] cometh, [[G2064]] yea, [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] is [[G2064]] come, [[G2064]] that [[G2443]] ye shall be scattered, [[G4650]] every man [[G1538]] to [[G1519]] his own, [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] shall leave [[G863]] me [[G1691]] alone: [[G3441]] and yet [[G2532]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] alone, [[G3441]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G2076]] with [[G3326]] me. [[G1700]]

### 33
These things [[G5023]] I have spoken [[G2980]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] me [[G1698]] ye might have [[G2192]] peace. [[G1515]] In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] ye shall have [[G2192]] tribulation: [[G2347]] but [[G235]] be of good cheer; [[G2293]] I [[G1473]] have overcome [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]
