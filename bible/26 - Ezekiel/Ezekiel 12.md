### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] also came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] thou [[H859]] dwellest [[H3427]] in the midst [[H8432]] of a rebellious [[H4805]] house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] have eyes [[H5869]] to see, [[H7200]] and see [[H7200]] not; [[H3808]] they have ears [[H241]] to hear, [[H8085]] and hear [[H8085]] not: [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]]

### 3
Therefore, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prepare [[H6213]] thee stuff [[H3627]] for removing, [[H1473]] and remove [[H1540]] by day [[H3119]] in their sight; [[H5869]] and thou shalt remove [[H1540]] from thy place [[H4725]] to [[H413]] another [[H312]] place [[H4725]] in their sight: [[H5869]] it may be [[H194]] they will consider, [[H7200]] though [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]]

### 4
Then shalt thou bring forth [[H3318]] thy stuff [[H3627]] by day [[H3119]] in their sight, [[H5869]] as stuff [[H3627]] for removing: [[H1473]] and thou [[H859]] shalt go forth [[H3318]] at even [[H6153]] in their sight, [[H5869]] as they that go forth [[H4161]] into captivity. [[H1473]]

### 5
Dig [[H2864]] thou through the wall [[H7023]] in their sight, [[H5869]] and carry out [[H3318]] thereby. [[H3318]]

### 6
In their sight [[H5869]] shalt thou bear [[H5375]] upon [[H5921]] shoulders, [[H3802]] carry forth [[H3318]] in the twilight: [[H5939]] thou shalt cover [[H3680]] thy face, [[H6440]] that thou see [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] the ground: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] I have set [[H5414]] thee a sign [[H4159]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And I did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] as [[H834]] I was commanded: [[H6680]] I brought forth [[H3318]] my stuff [[H3627]] by day, [[H3119]] as stuff [[H3627]] for captivity, [[H1473]] and in the even [[H6153]] I digged [[H2864]] through the wall [[H7023]] with mine hand; [[H3027]] I brought forth [[H3318]] in the twilight, [[H5939]] I bare [[H5375]] upon [[H5921]] shoulder [[H3802]] in their sight. [[H5869]]

### 8
And in the morning [[H1242]] came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 9
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] hath not [[H3808]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the rebellious [[H4805]] house, [[H1004]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, What [[H4100]] doest [[H6213]] thou? [[H6213]]

### 10
Say [[H559]] thou unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] This [[H2088]] burden [[H4853]] the prince [[H5387]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 11
Say, [[H559]] I [[H589]] your sign: [[H4159]] like as [[H834]] I have done, [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] shall it be done [[H6213]] unto them: they shall remove [[H1473]] go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]]

### 12
And the prince [[H5387]] that [[H834]] among [[H8432]] them shall bear [[H5375]] upon [[H413]] shoulder [[H3802]] in the twilight, [[H5939]] and shall go forth: [[H3318]] they shall dig [[H2864]] through the wall [[H7023]] to carry out [[H3318]] thereby: he shall cover [[H3680]] his face, [[H6440]] that [[H3282]] he [[H1931]] see [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] the ground [[H776]] with eyes. [[H5869]]

### 13
My net [[H7568]] also will I spread [[H6566]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he shall be taken [[H8610]] in my snare: [[H4686]] and I will bring [[H935]] him to Babylon [[H894]] the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans; [[H3778]] yet shall he not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] it, though he shall die [[H4191]] there. [[H4191]]

### 14
And I will scatter [[H2219]] toward every [[H3605]] wind [[H7307]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] about [[H5439]] him to help [[H5828]] him, and all [[H3605]] his bands; [[H102]] and I will draw out [[H7324]] the sword [[H2719]] after [[H310]] them. [[H310]]

### 15
And they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I shall scatter [[H6327]] them among the nations, [[H1471]] and disperse [[H2219]] them in the countries. [[H776]]

### 16
But I will leave [[H3498]] a few [[H4557]] men [[H376]] of them from the sword, [[H2719]] from the famine, [[H7458]] and from the pestilence; [[H1698]] that [[H4616]] they may declare [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] their abominations [[H8441]] among the heathen [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] they come; [[H935]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] eat [[H398]] thy bread [[H3899]] with quaking, [[H7494]] and drink [[H8354]] thy water [[H4325]] with trembling [[H7269]] and with carefulness; [[H1674]]

### 19
And say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H127]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] of [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Israel; [[H3478]] They shall eat [[H398]] their bread [[H3899]] with carefulness, [[H1674]] and drink [[H8354]] their water [[H4325]] with astonishment, [[H8078]] that [[H4616]] her land [[H776]] may be desolate [[H3456]] from all that is therein, [[H4393]] because of the violence [[H2555]] of all [[H3605]] them that dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 20
And the cities [[H5892]] that are inhabited [[H3427]] shall be laid waste, [[H2717]] and the land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate; [[H8077]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 22
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] what [[H4100]] that [[H2088]] proverb [[H4912]] ye have in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] The days [[H3117]] are prolonged, [[H748]] and every [[H3605]] vision [[H2377]] faileth? [[H6]]

### 23
Tell [[H559]] them therefore, [[H3651]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] I will make this [[H2088]] proverb [[H4912]] to cease, [[H7673]] and they shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] use it as a proverb [[H4911]] in Israel; [[H3478]] but [[H3588]] say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, The days [[H3117]] are at hand, [[H7126]] and the effect [[H1697]] of every [[H3605]] vision. [[H2377]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] any [[H3605]] vain [[H7723]] vision [[H2377]] nor flattering [[H2509]] divination [[H4738]] within [[H8432]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord: [[H3068]] I will speak, [[H1696]] and the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I shall speak [[H1696]] shall come to pass; [[H6213]] it shall be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] prolonged: [[H4900]] for [[H3588]] in your days, [[H3117]] O rebellious [[H4805]] house, [[H1004]] will I say [[H1696]] the word, [[H1697]] and will perform [[H6213]] it, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 26
Again the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 27
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] behold, [[H2009]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] say, [[H559]] The vision [[H2377]] that [[H834]] he [[H1931]] seeth [[H2372]] for many [[H7227]] days [[H3117]] and he [[H1931]] prophesieth [[H5012]] of the times [[H6256]] far [[H7350]] off. [[H7350]]

### 28
Therefore [[H3651]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] There shall none [[H3808]] of my words [[H1697]] be prolonged [[H4900]] any more, [[H5750]] but the word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] shall be done, [[H6213]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God.
