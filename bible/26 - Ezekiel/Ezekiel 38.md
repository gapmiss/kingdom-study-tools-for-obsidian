And say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] thee, O Gog, [[H1463]] the chief [[H7218]] prince [[H5387]] of Meshech [[H4902]] and Tubal: [[H8422]]

### 4
And I will turn thee back, [[H7725]] and put [[H5414]] hooks [[H2397]] into thy jaws, [[H3895]] and I will bring thee forth, [[H3318]] and all [[H3605]] thine army, [[H2428]] horses [[H5483]] and horsemen, [[H6571]] all [[H3605]] of them clothed [[H3847]] with all sorts [[H4358]] a great [[H7227]] company [[H6951]] bucklers [[H6793]] and shields, [[H4043]] all [[H3605]] of them handling [[H8610]] swords: [[H2719]]

### 7
Be thou prepared, [[H3559]] and prepare [[H3559]] for thyself, thou, [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] thy company [[H6951]] that are assembled [[H6950]] unto [[H5921]] thee, and be [[H1961]] thou a guard [[H4929]] unto them. [[H4929]]

### 8
After many [[H7227]] days [[H3117]] thou shalt be visited: [[H6485]] in the latter [[H319]] years [[H8141]] thou shalt come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] brought back [[H7725]] from the sword, [[H2719]] gathered [[H6908]] out of many [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] against [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] have been [[H1961]] always [[H8548]] waste: [[H2723]] but it [[H1931]] is brought forth [[H3318]] out of the nations, [[H5971]] and they shall dwell [[H3427]] safely [[H983]] all [[H3605]] of them.

Thou shalt ascend [[H5927]] and come [[H935]] like a storm, [[H7722]] thou shalt be [[H1961]] like a cloud [[H6051]] to cover [[H3680]] the land, [[H776]] thou, [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] thy bands, [[H102]] and many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] with [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 10
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] It shall also come to pass, [[H1961]] at the same [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] shall things [[H1697]] come [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] thy mind, [[H3824]] and thou shalt think [[H2803]] an evil [[H7451]] thought: [[H4284]]

### 11
And thou shalt say, [[H559]] I will go up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of unwalled villages; [[H6519]] I will go [[H935]] to them that are at rest, [[H8252]] that dwell [[H3427]] safely, [[H983]] all [[H3605]] of them dwelling [[H3427]] without [[H369]] walls, [[H2346]] and having neither [[H369]] bars [[H1280]] nor gates, [[H1817]]

### 12
To take [[H7997]] a spoil, [[H7998]] and to take [[H962]] a prey; [[H957]] to turn [[H7725]] thine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the desolate places [[H2723]] inhabited, [[H3427]] and upon [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] gathered [[H622]] out of the nations, [[H1471]] which have gotten [[H6213]] cattle [[H4735]] and goods, [[H7075]] that dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the midst [[H2872]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 13
Sheba, [[H7614]] and Dedan, [[H1719]] and the merchants [[H5503]] of Tarshish, [[H8659]] with all [[H3605]] the young lions [[H3715]] thereof, shall say [[H559]] unto thee, Art thou [[H859]] come [[H935]] to take [[H7997]] a spoil? [[H7998]] hast thou gathered [[H6950]] thy company [[H6951]] to take [[H962]] a prey? [[H957]] to carry away [[H5375]] silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] to take away [[H3947]] cattle [[H4735]] and goods, [[H7075]] to take [[H7997]] a great [[H1419]] spoil? [[H7998]]

### 14
Therefore, [[H3651]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] and say [[H559]] unto Gog, [[H1463]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] when my people [[H5971]] of Israel [[H3478]] dwelleth [[H3427]] safely, [[H983]] shalt thou not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]]

### 15
And thou shalt come [[H935]] from thy place [[H4725]] out of the north [[H6828]] parts, [[H3411]] thou, [[H859]] and many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] with [[H854]] thee, all [[H3605]] of them riding [[H7392]] upon horses, [[H5483]] a great [[H1419]] company, [[H6951]] and a mighty [[H7227]] army: [[H2428]]

### 16
And thou shalt come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as a cloud [[H6051]] to cover [[H3680]] the land; [[H776]] it shall be [[H1961]] in the latter [[H319]] days, [[H3117]] and I will bring [[H935]] thee against [[H5921]] my land, [[H776]] that [[H4616]] the heathen [[H1471]] may know [[H3045]] me, when I shall be sanctified [[H6942]] in thee, O Gog, [[H1463]] before their eyes. [[H5869]]

### 17
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] thou [[H859]] he [[H1931]] of whom [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] in old [[H6931]] time [[H3117]] by [[H3027]] my servants [[H5650]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which prophesied [[H5012]] in those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] years [[H8141]] that I would bring [[H935]] thee against [[H5921]] them? [[H5921]]

### 18
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] at the same [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] when [[H3117]] Gog [[H1463]] shall come [[H935]] against [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] my fury [[H2534]] shall come up [[H5927]] in my face. [[H639]]

### 19
For in my jealousy [[H7068]] in the fire [[H784]] of my wrath [[H5678]] have I spoken, [[H1696]] Surely [[H518]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there shall be [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] shaking [[H7494]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel; [[H3478]]

### 20
So that the fishes [[H1709]] of the sea, [[H3220]] and the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] and the beasts [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] and all [[H3605]] creeping things [[H7431]] that creep [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H127]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H120]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth, [[H127]] shall shake [[H7493]] at my presence, [[H6440]] and the mountains [[H2022]] shall be thrown down, [[H2040]] and the steep places [[H4095]] shall fall, [[H5307]] and every [[H3605]] wall [[H2346]] shall fall [[H5307]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 21
And I will call for [[H7121]] a sword [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] him throughout all [[H3605]] my mountains, [[H2022]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3069]] every man's [[H376]] sword [[H2719]] shall be [[H1961]] against his brother. [[H251]]

### 22
And I will plead against [[H8199]]  him [[H853]] with pestilence [[H1698]] and with blood; [[H1818]] and I will rain [[H4305]] upon [[H5921]] him, and upon [[H5921]] his bands, [[H102]] and upon [[H5921]] the many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, an overflowing [[H7857]] rain, [[H1653]] and great hailstones, [[H417]] fire, [[H784]] and brimstone. [[H1614]]

### 23
Thus will I magnify myself, [[H1431]] and sanctify myself; [[H6942]] and I will be known [[H3045]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of many [[H7227]] nations, [[H1471]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
