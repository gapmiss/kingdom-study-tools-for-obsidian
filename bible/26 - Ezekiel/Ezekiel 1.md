### 1
Now it came to pass [[H1961]] in the thirtieth [[H7970]] year, [[H8141]] in the fourth [[H7243]] in the fifth [[H2568]] of the month, [[H2320]] as I [[H589]] among [[H8432]] the captives [[H1473]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H5104]] of Chebar, [[H3529]] the heavens [[H8064]] were opened, [[H6605]] and I saw [[H7200]] visions [[H4759]] of God. [[H430]]

### 2
In the fifth [[H2568]] of the month, [[H2320]] which [[H1931]] the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Jehoiachin's [[H3112]] captivity, [[H1546]]

### 3
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came expressly [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Ezekiel [[H3168]] the priest, [[H3548]] the son [[H1121]] of Buzi, [[H941]] in the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H5104]] Chebar; [[H3529]] and the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 4
And I looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a whirlwind [[H7307]] came [[H935]] out of [[H4480]] the north, [[H6828]] a great [[H1419]] cloud, [[H6051]] and a fire [[H784]] infolding itself, [[H3947]] and a brightness [[H5051]] about [[H5439]] it, and out of the midst [[H8432]] thereof as the colour [[H5869]] of amber, [[H2830]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire. [[H784]]

### 5
Also out of the midst [[H8432]] thereof the likeness [[H1823]] of four [[H702]] living creatures. [[H2416]] And this [[H2088]] their appearance; [[H4758]] they [[H2007]] had the likeness [[H1823]] of a man. [[H120]]

### 6
And every one [[H259]] had four [[H702]] faces, [[H6440]] and every one [[H259]] had four [[H702]] wings. [[H3671]]

### 7
And their feet [[H7272]] straight [[H3477]] feet; [[H7272]] and the sole [[H3709]] of their feet [[H7272]] like the sole [[H3709]] of a calf's [[H5695]] foot: [[H7272]] and they sparkled [[H5340]] like the colour [[H5869]] of burnished [[H7044]] brass. [[H5178]]

### 8
And the hands [[H3027]] of a man [[H120]] under [[H8478]] their wings [[H3671]] on [[H5921]] their four [[H702]] sides; [[H7253]] and they four [[H702]] had their faces [[H6440]] and their wings. [[H3671]]

### 9
Their wings [[H3671]] joined [[H2266]] one [[H802]] to [[H413]] another; [[H269]] they turned [[H5437]] not [[H3808]] when they went; [[H1980]] they went [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] straight [[H5676]] forward. [[H6440]]

### 10
As for the likeness [[H1823]] of their faces, [[H6440]] they four [[H702]] had the face [[H6440]] of a man, [[H120]] and the face [[H6440]] of a lion, [[H738]] on [[H413]] the right side: [[H3225]] and they four [[H702]] had the face [[H6440]] of an ox [[H7794]] on the left side; [[H8040]] they four [[H702]] also had the face [[H6440]] of an eagle. [[H5404]]

### 11
Thus their faces: [[H6440]] and their wings [[H3671]] stretched [[H6504]] upward; [[H4605]] two [[H8147]] of every one [[H376]] joined [[H2266]] one to another, [[H376]] and two [[H8147]] covered [[H3680]] their bodies. [[H1472]]

### 12
And they went [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] straight [[H5676]] forward: [[H6440]] whither [[H834]] the spirit [[H7307]] was [[H1961]] to go, [[H1980]] they went; [[H1980]] they turned [[H5437]] not [[H3808]] when they went. [[H1980]]

### 13
As for the likeness [[H1823]] of the living creatures, [[H2416]] their appearance [[H4758]] like burning [[H1197]] coals [[H1513]] of fire, [[H784]] like the appearance [[H4758]] of lamps: [[H3940]] it [[H1931]] went up and down [[H1980]] among [[H996]] the living creatures; [[H2416]] and the fire [[H784]] was bright, [[H5051]] and out of [[H4480]] the fire [[H784]] went forth [[H3318]] lightning. [[H1300]]

### 14
And the living creatures [[H2416]] ran [[H7519]] and returned [[H7725]] as the appearance [[H4758]] of a flash of lightning. [[H965]]

### 15
Now as I beheld [[H7200]] the living creatures, [[H2416]] behold [[H2009]] one [[H259]] wheel [[H212]] upon the earth [[H776]] by [[H681]] the living creatures, [[H2416]] with his four [[H702]] faces. [[H6440]]

### 16
The appearance [[H4758]] of the wheels [[H212]] and their work [[H4639]] like unto the colour [[H5869]] of a beryl: [[H8658]] and they four [[H702]] had one [[H259]] likeness: [[H1823]] and their appearance [[H4758]] and their work [[H4639]] as [[H834]] it were [[H1961]] a wheel [[H212]] in the middle [[H8432]] of a wheel. [[H212]]

### 17
When they went, [[H1980]] they went [[H1980]] upon [[H5921]] their four [[H702]] sides: [[H7253]] they turned [[H5437]] not [[H3808]] when they went. [[H1980]]

### 18
As for their rings, [[H1354]] they were so high [[H1363]] that they were dreadful; [[H3374]] and their rings [[H1354]] full [[H4392]] of eyes [[H5869]] round about [[H5439]] them four. [[H702]]

### 19
And when the living creatures [[H2416]] went, [[H1980]] the wheels [[H212]] went [[H1980]] by them: [[H681]] and when the living creatures [[H2416]] were lifted up [[H5375]] from [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] the wheels [[H212]] were lifted up. [[H5375]]

### 20
Whithersoever [[H5921]] the spirit [[H7307]] was [[H1961]] to go, [[H1980]] they went, [[H1980]] thither [[H8033]] spirit [[H7307]] to go; [[H1980]] and the wheels [[H212]] were lifted up [[H5375]] over against [[H5980]] them: for [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the living creature [[H2416]] in the wheels. [[H212]]

### 21
When those went, [[H1980]] went; [[H1980]] and when those stood, [[H5975]] stood; [[H5975]] and when those were lifted up [[H5375]] from [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] the wheels [[H212]] were lifted up [[H5375]] over against [[H5980]] them: for [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the living creature [[H2416]] in the wheels. [[H212]]

### 22
And the likeness [[H1823]] of the firmament [[H7549]] upon [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of the living creature [[H2416]] as the colour [[H5869]] of the terrible [[H3372]] crystal, [[H7140]] stretched forth [[H5186]] over [[H5921]] their heads [[H7218]] above. [[H4605]]

### 23
And under [[H8478]] the firmament [[H7549]] their wings [[H3671]] straight, [[H3477]] the one [[H802]] toward [[H413]] the other: [[H269]] every one [[H376]] had two, [[H8147]] which covered [[H3680]] on this side, [[H2007]] and every one [[H376]] had two, [[H8147]] which covered [[H3680]] on that side, [[H2007]] their bodies. [[H1472]]

### 24
And when they went, [[H1980]] I heard [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] of their wings, [[H3671]] like the noise [[H6963]] of great [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] as the voice [[H6963]] of the Almighty, [[H7706]] the voice [[H6963]] of speech, [[H1999]] as the noise [[H6963]] of an host: [[H4264]] when they stood, [[H5975]] they let down [[H7503]] their wings. [[H3671]]

### 25
And there was [[H1961]] a voice [[H6963]] from [[H5921]] the firmament [[H7549]] that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] their heads, [[H7218]] when they stood, [[H5975]] had let down [[H7503]] their wings. [[H3671]]

### 26
And above [[H4605]] the firmament [[H7549]] that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] their heads [[H7218]] the likeness [[H1823]] of a throne, [[H3678]] as the appearance [[H4758]] of a sapphire [[H5601]] stone: [[H68]] and upon [[H5921]] the likeness [[H1823]] of the throne [[H3678]] the likeness [[H1823]] as the appearance [[H4758]] of a man [[H120]] above [[H4605]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 27
And I saw [[H7200]] as the colour [[H5869]] of amber, [[H2830]] as the appearance [[H4758]] of fire [[H784]] round about [[H5439]] within [[H1004]] it, from the appearance [[H4758]] of his loins [[H4975]] even upward, [[H4605]] and from the appearance [[H4758]] of his loins [[H4975]] even downward, [[H4295]] I saw [[H7200]] as it were the appearance [[H4758]] of fire, [[H784]] and it had brightness [[H5051]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 28
As the appearance [[H4758]] of the bow [[H7198]] that [[H834]] is [[H1961]] in the cloud [[H6051]] in the day [[H3117]] of rain, [[H1653]] so [[H3651]] the appearance [[H4758]] of the brightness [[H5051]] round about. [[H5439]] This [[H1931]] the appearance [[H4758]] of the likeness [[H1823]] of the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And when I saw [[H7200]] I fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] my face, [[H6440]] and I heard [[H8085]] a voice [[H6963]] of one that spake. [[H1696]]
