### 1
Therefore, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] Gog, [[H1463]] and say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] thee, O Gog, [[H1463]] the chief [[H7218]] prince [[H5387]] of Meshech [[H4902]] and Tubal: [[H8422]]

### 2
And I will turn thee back, [[H7725]] and leave but the sixth part [[H8338]] of thee, and will cause thee to come up [[H5927]] from the north [[H6828]] parts, [[H3411]] and will bring [[H935]] thee upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 3
And I will smite [[H5221]] thy bow [[H7198]] out of thy left [[H8040]] hand, [[H3027]] and will cause thine arrows [[H2671]] to fall [[H5307]] out of thy right [[H3225]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 4
Thou shalt fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] thou, [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] thy bands, [[H102]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] thee: I will give [[H5414]] thee unto the ravenous [[H5861]] birds [[H6833]] of every [[H3605]] sort, [[H3671]] and the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] to be devoured. [[H402]]

### 5
Thou shalt fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field: [[H7704]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have spoken [[H1696]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 6
And I will send [[H7971]] a fire [[H784]] on Magog, [[H4031]] and among them that dwell [[H3427]] carelessly [[H983]] in the isles: [[H339]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
So will I make my holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] known [[H3045]] in the midst [[H8432]] of my people [[H5971]] Israel; [[H3478]] and I will not [[H3808]] pollute [[H2490]] my holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] any more: [[H5750]] and the heathen [[H1471]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the Holy One [[H6918]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
Behold, [[H2009]] it is come, [[H935]] and it is done, [[H1961]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] this [[H1931]] the day [[H3117]] whereof [[H834]] I have spoken. [[H1696]]

### 9
And they that dwell [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall go forth, [[H3318]] and shall set on fire [[H1197]] and burn [[H5400]] the weapons, [[H5402]] both the shields [[H4043]] and the bucklers, [[H6793]] the bows [[H7198]] and the arrows, [[H2671]] and the handstaves, [[H3027]] and the spears, [[H7420]] and they shall burn [[H1197]] them with fire [[H784]] seven [[H7651]] years: [[H8141]]

### 10
So that they shall take [[H5375]] no [[H3808]] wood [[H6086]] out of [[H4480]] the field, [[H7704]] neither [[H3808]] cut down [[H2404]] out of [[H4480]] the forests; [[H3293]] for [[H3588]] they shall burn [[H1197]] the weapons [[H5402]] with fire: [[H784]] and they shall spoil [[H7997]] those that spoiled [[H7997]] them, and rob [[H962]] those that robbed [[H962]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 11
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] I will give [[H5414]] unto Gog [[H1463]] a place [[H4725]] there [[H8033]] of graves [[H6913]] in Israel, [[H3478]] the valley [[H1516]] of the passengers [[H5674]] on the east [[H6926]] of the sea: [[H3220]] and it [[H1931]] shall stop [[H2629]] the of the passengers: [[H5674]] and there [[H8033]] shall they bury [[H6912]] Gog [[H1463]] and all [[H3605]] his multitude: [[H1995]] and they shall call [[H7121]] The valley [[H1516]] of Hamon-gog. [[H1996]]

### 12
And seven [[H7651]] months [[H2320]] shall the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] be burying [[H6912]] of them, that [[H4616]] they may cleanse [[H2891]] the land. [[H776]]

### 13
Yea, all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] shall bury [[H6912]] and it shall be [[H1961]] to them a renown [[H8034]] the day [[H3117]] that I shall be glorified, [[H3513]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 14
And they shall sever out [[H914]] men [[H376]] of continual employment, [[H8548]] passing through [[H5674]] the land [[H776]] to bury [[H6912]] with the passengers [[H5674]] those that remain [[H3498]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth, [[H776]] to cleanse [[H2891]] it: after the end [[H7097]] of seven [[H7651]] months [[H2320]] shall they search. [[H2713]]

### 15
And the passengers [[H5674]] pass through [[H5674]] the land, [[H776]] when seeth [[H7200]] a man's [[H120]] bone, [[H6106]] then shall he set up [[H1129]] a sign [[H6725]] by [[H681]] it, till [[H5704]] the buriers [[H6912]] have buried [[H6912]] it in [[H413]] the valley [[H1516]] of Hamon-gog. [[H1996]]

### 16
And also [[H1571]] the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] Hamonah. [[H1997]] Thus shall they cleanse [[H2891]] the land. [[H776]]

### 17
And, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Speak [[H559]] unto every [[H3605]] feathered [[H3671]] fowl, [[H6833]] and to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] Assemble yourselves, [[H6908]] and come; [[H935]] gather yourselves [[H622]] on every side [[H5439]] to [[H5921]] my sacrifice [[H2077]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] do sacrifice [[H2076]] for you, a great [[H1419]] sacrifice [[H2077]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that ye may eat [[H398]] flesh, [[H1320]] and drink [[H8354]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 18
Ye shall eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of the mighty, [[H1368]] and drink [[H8354]] the blood [[H1818]] of the princes [[H5387]] of the earth, [[H776]] of rams, [[H352]] of lambs, [[H3733]] and of goats, [[H6260]] of bullocks, [[H6499]] all [[H3605]] of them fatlings [[H4806]] of Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 19
And ye shall eat [[H398]] fat [[H2459]] till ye be full, [[H7654]] and drink [[H8354]] blood [[H1818]] till ye be drunken, [[H7943]] of my sacrifice [[H2077]] which [[H834]] I have sacrificed [[H2076]] for you. [[H2076]]

### 20
Thus ye shall be filled [[H7646]] at [[H5921]] my table [[H7979]] with horses [[H5483]] and chariots, [[H7393]] with mighty men, [[H1368]] and with all [[H3605]] men [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 21
And I will set [[H5414]] my glory [[H3519]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] and all [[H3605]] the heathen [[H1471]] shall see [[H7200]] my judgment [[H4941]] that [[H834]] I have executed, [[H6213]] and my hand [[H3027]] that [[H834]] I have laid [[H7760]] upon them. [[H7760]]

### 22
So the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] from [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] and forward. [[H1973]]

### 23
And the heathen [[H1471]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] went into captivity [[H1540]] for their iniquity: [[H5771]] because [[H5921]] they trespassed [[H4603]] against me, therefore hid [[H5641]] I my face [[H6440]] from them, and gave [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies: [[H6862]] so fell [[H5307]] they all [[H3605]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 24
According to their uncleanness [[H2932]] and according to their transgressions [[H6588]] have I done [[H6213]] unto them, and hid [[H5641]] my face [[H6440]] from them. [[H6440]]

### 25
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Now [[H6258]] will I bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and have mercy [[H7355]] upon the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and will be jealous [[H7065]] for my holy [[H6944]] name; [[H8034]]

### 26
After that they have borne [[H5375]] their shame, [[H3639]] and all [[H3605]] their trespasses [[H4604]] whereby [[H834]] they have trespassed [[H4603]] against me, when they dwelt [[H3427]] safely [[H983]] in [[H5921]] their land, [[H127]] and none [[H369]] made afraid. [[H2729]]

### 27
When I have brought them again [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] and gathered [[H6908]] them out of their enemies' [[H341]] lands, [[H776]] and am sanctified [[H6942]] in them in the sight [[H5869]] of many [[H7227]] nations; [[H1471]]

### 28
Then shall they know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] which caused them to be led into captivity [[H1540]] among [[H413]] the heathen: [[H1471]] but I have gathered [[H3664]] them unto [[H5921]] their own land, [[H127]] and have left [[H3498]] none [[H3808]] of them any more [[H5750]] there. [[H5750]]

### 29
Neither [[H3808]] will I hide [[H5641]] my face [[H6440]] any more [[H5750]] from them: for [[H834]] I have poured out [[H8210]] my spirit [[H7307]] upon [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]
