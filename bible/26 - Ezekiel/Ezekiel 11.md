### 1
Moreover the spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up, [[H5375]] and brought [[H935]] me unto [[H413]] the east [[H6931]] gate [[H8179]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] which looketh [[H6437]] eastward: [[H6921]] and behold [[H2009]] at the door [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] five [[H2568]] and twenty [[H6242]] men; [[H376]] among [[H8432]] whom I saw [[H7200]] Jaazaniah [[H2970]] the son [[H1121]] of Azur, [[H5809]] and Pelatiah [[H6410]] the son [[H1121]] of Benaiah, [[H1141]] princes [[H8269]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 2
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] these [[H428]] the men [[H376]] that devise [[H2803]] mischief, [[H205]] and give [[H3289]] wicked [[H7451]] counsel [[H6098]] in this [[H2063]] city: [[H5892]]

### 3
Which say, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] near; [[H7138]] let us build [[H1129]] houses: [[H1004]] this [[H1931]] the caldron, [[H5518]] and we [[H587]] the flesh. [[H1320]]

### 4
Therefore [[H3651]] prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] them, prophesy, [[H5012]] O son [[H1121]] of man. [[H120]]

### 5
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] me, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Speak; [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Thus [[H3651]] have ye said, [[H559]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] for I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] the things that come [[H4609]] into your mind, [[H7307]] them. [[H7307]]

### 6
Ye have multiplied [[H7235]] your slain [[H2491]] in this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and ye have filled [[H4390]] the streets [[H2351]] thereof with the slain. [[H2491]]

### 7
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Your slain [[H2491]] whom [[H834]] ye have laid [[H7760]] in the midst [[H8432]] of it, they [[H1992]] the flesh, [[H1320]] and this [[H1931]] the caldron: [[H5518]] but I will bring you forth [[H3318]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of it. [[H8432]]

### 8
Ye have feared [[H3372]] the sword; [[H2719]] and I will bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 9
And I will bring out [[H3318]] you of the midst [[H8432]] thereof, and deliver [[H5414]] you into the hands [[H3027]] of strangers, [[H2114]] and will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] among you. [[H8201]]

### 10
Ye shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword; [[H2719]] I will judge [[H8199]] you in [[H5921]] the border [[H1366]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
This [[H1931]] shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] your caldron, [[H5518]] neither shall ye [[H859]] be [[H1961]] the flesh [[H1320]] in the midst [[H8432]] thereof; I will judge [[H8199]] you in [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 12
And ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H834]] ye have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in my statutes, [[H2706]] neither [[H3808]] executed [[H6213]] my judgments, [[H4941]] but have done [[H6213]] after the manners [[H4941]] of the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] you. [[H5439]]

### 13
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when I prophesied, [[H5012]] that Pelatiah [[H6410]] the son [[H1121]] of Benaiah [[H1141]] died. [[H4191]] Then fell I down [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] my face, [[H6440]] and cried [[H2199]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] and said, [[H559]] Ah [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] God! [[H3069]] wilt thou [[H859]] make [[H6213]] a full end [[H3617]] of the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 14
Again the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 15
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] thy brethren, [[H251]] thy brethren, [[H251]] the men [[H582]] of thy kindred, [[H1353]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] wholly, [[H3605]] they unto whom [[H834]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] have said, [[H559]] Get you far [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] the Lord: [[H3068]] unto us is this [[H1931]] land [[H776]] given [[H5414]] in possession. [[H4181]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Although [[H3588]] I have cast them far off [[H7368]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] and although [[H3588]] I have scattered [[H6327]] them among the countries, [[H776]] yet will I be [[H1961]] to them as a little [[H4592]] sanctuary [[H4720]] in the countries [[H776]] where [[H834]] they shall come. [[H935]]

### 17
Therefore [[H3651]] say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] I will even gather [[H6908]] you from [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] and assemble [[H622]] you out of [[H4480]] the countries [[H776]] where [[H834]] ye have been scattered, [[H6327]] and I will give [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] the land [[H127]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 18
And they shall come [[H935]] thither, [[H8033]] and they shall take away [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] the detestable things [[H8251]] thereof and all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] thereof from [[H4480]] thence. [[H4480]]

### 19
And I will give [[H5414]] them one [[H259]] heart, [[H3820]] and I will put [[H5414]] a new [[H2319]] spirit [[H7307]] within [[H7130]] you; and I will take [[H5493]] the stony [[H68]] heart [[H3820]] out of their flesh, [[H1320]] and will give [[H5414]] them an heart [[H3820]] of flesh: [[H1320]]

### 20
That [[H4616]] they may walk [[H1980]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] and keep [[H8104]] mine ordinances, [[H4941]] and do [[H6213]] them: [[H853]] and they shall be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]]

### 21
But whose heart [[H3820]] walketh [[H1980]] after [[H413]] the heart [[H3820]] of their detestable things [[H8251]] and their abominations, [[H8441]] I will recompense [[H5414]] their way [[H1870]] upon their own heads, [[H7218]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]

### 22
Then did the cherubims [[H3742]] lift up [[H5375]] their wings, [[H3671]] and the wheels [[H212]] beside [[H5980]] them; and the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] over [[H5921]] them above. [[H4605]]

### 23
And the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] went up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] the midst [[H8432]] of the city, [[H5892]] and stood [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] the mountain [[H2022]] which [[H834]] on the east side [[H6924]] of the city. [[H5892]]

### 24
Afterwards the spirit [[H7307]] took me up, [[H5375]] and brought [[H935]] me in a vision [[H4758]] by the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] into Chaldea, [[H3778]] to [[H413]] them of the captivity. [[H1473]] So the vision [[H4758]] that [[H834]] I had seen [[H7200]] went up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 25
Then I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them of the captivity [[H1473]] all [[H3605]] the things [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had shewed [[H7200]] me. [[H7200]]
