### 1
Then I looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] in [[H413]] the firmament [[H7549]] that [[H834]] was above [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the cherubims [[H3742]] there appeared [[H7200]] over [[H5921]] them as it were a sapphire [[H5601]] stone, [[H68]] as the appearance [[H4758]] of the likeness [[H1823]] of a throne. [[H3678]]

### 2
And he spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] with linen, [[H906]] and said, [[H559]] Go in [[H935]] between [[H996]] the wheels, [[H1534]] under [[H8478]] the cherub, [[H3742]] and fill [[H4390]] thine hand [[H2651]] with coals [[H1513]] of fire [[H784]] from between [[H996]] the cherubims, [[H3742]] and scatter [[H2236]] over [[H5921]] the city. [[H5892]] And he went in [[H935]] in my sight. [[H5869]]

### 3
Now the cherubims [[H3742]] stood [[H5975]] on the right side [[H3225]] of the house, [[H1004]] when the man [[H376]] went in; [[H935]] and the cloud [[H6051]] filled [[H4390]] the inner [[H6442]] court. [[H2691]]

### 4
Then the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] went up [[H7311]] from [[H5921]] the cherub, [[H3742]] over [[H5921]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the house; [[H1004]] and the house [[H1004]] was filled [[H4390]] with [[H854]] the cloud, [[H6051]] and the court [[H2691]] was full [[H4390]] of [[H854]] the brightness [[H5051]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] glory. [[H3519]]

### 5
And the sound [[H6963]] of the cherubims' [[H3742]] wings [[H3671]] was heard [[H8085]] to [[H5704]] the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] as the voice [[H6963]] of the Almighty [[H7706]] God [[H410]] when he speaketh. [[H1696]]

### 6
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he had commanded [[H6680]] the man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] with linen, [[H906]] saying, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] fire [[H784]] from between [[H996]] the wheels, [[H1534]] from between [[H996]] the cherubims; [[H3742]] then he went in, [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] the wheels. [[H212]]

### 7
And cherub [[H3742]] stretched forth [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] from between [[H996]] the cherubims [[H3742]] unto [[H413]] the fire [[H784]] that [[H834]] between [[H996]] the cherubims, [[H3742]] and took [[H5375]] and put [[H5414]] into [[H413]] the hands [[H2651]] of clothed [[H3847]] with linen: [[H906]] who took [[H3947]] and went out. [[H3318]]

### 8
And there appeared [[H7200]] in the cherubims [[H3742]] the form [[H8403]] of a man's [[H120]] hand [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] their wings. [[H3671]]

### 9
And when I looked, [[H7200]] behold [[H2009]] the four [[H702]] wheels [[H212]] by [[H681]] the cherubims, [[H3742]] one [[H259]] wheel [[H212]] by [[H681]] one [[H259]] cherub, [[H3742]] and another [[H259]] wheel [[H212]] by [[H681]] another [[H259]] cherub: [[H3742]] and the appearance [[H4758]] of the wheels [[H212]] as the colour [[H5869]] of a beryl [[H8658]] stone. [[H68]]

### 10
And their appearances, [[H4758]] they four [[H702]] had one [[H259]] likeness, [[H1823]] as if [[H834]] a wheel [[H212]] had been [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of a wheel. [[H212]]

### 11
When they went, [[H1980]] they went [[H1980]] upon [[H413]] their four [[H702]] sides; [[H7253]] they turned [[H5437]] not [[H3808]] as they went, [[H1980]] but [[H3588]] to the place [[H4725]] whither [[H834]] the head [[H7218]] looked [[H6437]] they followed [[H1980]] it; they turned [[H5437]] not [[H3808]] as they went. [[H1980]]

### 12
And their whole [[H3605]] body, [[H1320]] and their backs, [[H1354]] and their hands, [[H3027]] and their wings, [[H3671]] and the wheels, [[H212]] full [[H4392]] of eyes [[H5869]] round about, [[H5439]] the wheels [[H212]] that they four [[H702]] had. [[H702]]

### 13
As for the wheels, [[H212]] it was cried [[H7121]] unto them in my hearing, [[H241]] O wheel. [[H1534]]

### 14
And every one [[H259]] had four [[H702]] faces: [[H6440]] the first [[H259]] face [[H6440]] the face [[H6440]] of a cherub, [[H3742]] and the second [[H8145]] face [[H6440]] the face [[H6440]] of a man, [[H120]] and the third [[H7992]] the face [[H6440]] of a lion, [[H738]] and the fourth [[H7243]] the face [[H6440]] of an eagle. [[H5404]]

### 15
And the cherubims [[H3742]] were lifted up. [[H7426]] This [[H1931]] the living creature [[H2416]] that [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]] by the river [[H5104]] of Chebar. [[H3529]]

### 16
And when the cherubims [[H3742]] went, [[H1980]] the wheels [[H212]] went [[H1980]] by them: [[H681]] and when the cherubims [[H3742]] lifted up [[H5375]] their wings [[H3671]] to mount up [[H7311]] from [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] the same [[H1992]] wheels [[H212]] also [[H1571]] turned [[H5437]] not [[H3808]] from beside them. [[H681]]

### 17
When they stood, [[H5975]] stood; [[H5975]] and when they were lifted up, [[H7311]] lifted up [[H7426]] themselves for [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the living creature [[H2416]] in them. [[H2416]]

### 18
Then the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] departed [[H3318]] from off [[H5921]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the house, [[H1004]] and stood [[H5975]] over [[H5921]] the cherubims. [[H3742]]

### 19
And the cherubims [[H3742]] lifted up [[H5375]] their wings, [[H3671]] and mounted up [[H7426]] from [[H4480]] the earth [[H776]] in my sight: [[H5869]] when they went out, [[H3318]] the wheels [[H212]] also beside [[H5980]] them, and stood [[H5975]] at the door [[H6607]] of the east [[H6931]] gate [[H8179]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house; [[H1004]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] over [[H5921]] them above. [[H4605]]

### 20
This [[H1931]] the living creature [[H2416]] that [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] by the river [[H5104]] of Chebar; [[H3529]] and I knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] the cherubims. [[H3742]]

### 21
Every one [[H259]] had four [[H702]] faces [[H6440]] apiece, [[H702]] and every one [[H259]] four [[H702]] wings; [[H3671]] and the likeness [[H1823]] of the hands [[H3027]] of a man [[H120]] under [[H8478]] their wings. [[H3671]]

### 22
And the likeness [[H1823]] of their faces [[H6440]] the same [[H1992]] faces [[H6440]] which [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H5104]] of Chebar, [[H3529]] their appearances [[H4758]] and themselves: they went [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] straight [[H5676]] forward. [[H6440]]
