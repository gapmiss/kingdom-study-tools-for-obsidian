### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the sixth [[H8345]] year, [[H8141]] in the sixth [[H8345]] in the fifth [[H2568]] of the month, [[H2320]] I [[H589]] sat [[H3427]] in mine house, [[H1004]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Judah [[H3063]] sat [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] me, that the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] fell [[H5307]] there [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 2
Then I beheld, [[H7200]] and lo [[H2009]] a likeness [[H1823]] as the appearance [[H4758]] of fire: [[H784]] from the appearance [[H4758]] of his loins [[H4975]] even downward, [[H4295]] fire; [[H784]] and from his loins [[H4975]] even upward, [[H4605]] as the appearance [[H4758]] of brightness, [[H2096]] as the colour [[H5869]] of amber. [[H2830]]

### 3
And he put forth [[H7971]] the form [[H8403]] of an hand, [[H3027]] and took [[H3947]] me by a lock [[H6734]] of mine head; [[H7218]] and the spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up [[H5375]] between [[H996]] the earth [[H776]] and the heaven, [[H8064]] and brought [[H935]] me in the visions [[H4759]] of God [[H430]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the inner [[H6442]] gate [[H8179]] that looketh [[H6437]] toward the north; [[H6828]] where [[H834]] the seat [[H4186]] of the image [[H5566]] of jealousy, [[H7068]] which provoketh to jealousy. [[H7069]]

### 4
And, behold, [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] there, [[H8033]] according to the vision [[H4758]] that [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]] in the plain. [[H1237]]

### 5
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] lift up [[H5375]] thine eyes [[H5869]] now [[H4994]] the way [[H1870]] toward the north. [[H6828]] So I lifted up [[H5375]] mine eyes [[H5869]] the way [[H1870]] toward the north, [[H6828]] and behold [[H2009]] northward [[H6828]] at the gate [[H8179]] of the altar [[H4196]] this [[H2088]] image [[H5566]] of jealousy [[H7068]] in the entry. [[H872]]

### 6
He said [[H559]] furthermore unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] seest [[H7200]] thou [[H859]] what they [[H4100]] do? [[H6213]] the great [[H1419]] abominations [[H8441]] that [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] committeth [[H6213]] here, [[H6311]] that I should go far off [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] my sanctuary? [[H4720]] but turn [[H7725]]  thee yet again, [[H5750]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] greater [[H1419]] abominations. [[H8441]]

### 7
And he brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the court; [[H2691]] and when I looked, [[H7200]] behold [[H2009]] a [[H259]] hole [[H2356]] in the wall. [[H7023]]

### 8
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] dig [[H2864]] now [[H4994]] in the wall: [[H7023]] and when I had digged [[H2864]] in the wall, [[H7023]] behold [[H2009]] a [[H259]] door. [[H6607]]

### 9
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Go in, [[H935]] and behold [[H7200]] the wicked [[H7451]] abominations [[H8441]] that [[H834]] they [[H1992]] do [[H6213]] here. [[H6213]]

### 10
So I went in [[H935]] and saw; [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] every [[H3605]] form [[H8403]] of creeping things, [[H7431]] and abominable [[H8263]] beasts, [[H929]] and all [[H3605]] the idols [[H1544]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] pourtrayed [[H2707]] upon [[H5921]] the wall [[H7023]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 11
And there stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] them seventy [[H7657]] men [[H376]] of the ancients [[H2205]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and in the midst [[H8432]] of them stood [[H5975]] Jaazaniah [[H2970]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] with every man [[H376]] his censer [[H4730]] in his hand; [[H3027]] and a thick [[H6282]] cloud [[H6051]] of incense [[H7004]] went up. [[H5927]]

### 12
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] hast thou seen [[H7200]] what [[H834]] the ancients [[H2205]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] do [[H6213]] in the dark, [[H2822]] every man [[H376]] in the chambers [[H2315]] of his imagery? [[H4906]] for [[H3588]] they say, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] seeth [[H7200]] us not; [[H369]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath forsaken [[H5800]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 13
He said [[H559]] also unto [[H413]] me, Turn [[H7725]]  thee yet again, [[H5750]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] greater [[H1419]] abominations [[H8441]] that [[H834]] they [[H1992]] do. [[H6213]]

### 14
Then he brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] toward [[H413]] the north; [[H6828]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there [[H8033]] sat [[H3427]] women [[H802]] weeping [[H1058]] for [[H853]] Tammuz. [[H8542]]

### 15
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, Hast thou seen [[H7200]] O son [[H1121]] of man? [[H120]] turn [[H7725]]  thee yet again, [[H5750]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] greater [[H1419]] abominations [[H8441]] than these. [[H8441]]

### 16
And he brought [[H935]] me into [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] and, behold, [[H2009]] at the door [[H6607]] of the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] between [[H996]] the porch [[H197]] and the altar, [[H4196]] about five [[H2568]] and twenty [[H6242]] men, [[H376]] with their backs [[H268]] toward [[H413]] the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and their faces [[H6440]] toward the east; [[H6924]] and they [[H1992]] worshipped [[H7812]] the sun [[H8121]] toward the east. [[H6924]]

### 17
Then he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Hast thou seen [[H7200]] O son [[H1121]] of man? [[H120]] Is it a light thing [[H7043]] to the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] that they commit [[H6213]] the abominations [[H8441]] which [[H834]] they commit [[H6213]] here? [[H6311]] for [[H3588]] they have filled [[H4390]] the land [[H776]] with violence, [[H2555]] and have returned [[H7725]] to provoke me to anger: [[H3707]] and, lo, [[H2005]] they put [[H7971]] the branch [[H2156]] to [[H413]] their nose. [[H639]]

### 18
Therefore will I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] deal [[H6213]] in fury: [[H2534]] mine eye [[H5869]] shall not [[H3808]] spare, [[H2347]] neither [[H3808]] will I have pity: [[H2550]] and though they cry [[H7121]] in mine ears [[H241]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] will I not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] them.
