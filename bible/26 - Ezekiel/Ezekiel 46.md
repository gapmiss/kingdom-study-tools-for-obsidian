### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] The gate [[H8179]] of the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] that looketh [[H6437]] toward the east [[H6921]] shall be [[H1961]] shut [[H5462]] the six [[H8337]] working [[H4639]] days; [[H3117]] but on the sabbath [[H7676]] it shall be opened, [[H6605]] and in the day [[H3117]] of the new moon [[H2320]] it shall be opened. [[H6605]]

### 2
And the prince [[H5387]] shall enter [[H935]] by the way [[H1870]] of the porch [[H197]] of gate [[H8179]] without, [[H2351]] and shall stand [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the post [[H4201]] of the gate, [[H8179]] and the priests [[H3548]] shall prepare [[H6213]] his burnt offering [[H5930]] and his peace offerings, [[H8002]] and he shall worship [[H7812]] at [[H5921]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the gate: [[H8179]] then he shall go forth; [[H3318]] but the gate [[H8179]] shall not [[H3808]] be shut [[H5462]] until [[H5704]] the evening. [[H6153]]

### 3
Likewise the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] shall worship [[H7812]] at the door [[H6607]] of this [[H1931]] gate [[H8179]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the sabbaths [[H7676]] and in the new moons. [[H2320]]

### 4
And the burnt offering [[H5930]] that [[H834]] the prince [[H5387]] shall offer [[H7126]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] in the sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] six [[H8337]] lambs [[H3532]] without blemish, [[H8549]] and a ram [[H352]] without blemish. [[H8549]]

### 5
And the meat offering [[H4503]] an ephah [[H374]] for a ram, [[H352]] and the meat offering [[H4503]] for the lambs [[H3532]] as he shall be able [[H3027]] to give, [[H4991]] and an hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] to an ephah. [[H374]]

### 6
And in the day [[H3117]] of the new moon [[H2320]] a young [[H1121]] bullock [[H6499]] without blemish, [[H8549]] and six [[H8337]] lambs, [[H3532]] and a ram: [[H352]] they shall be [[H1961]] without blemish. [[H8549]]

### 7
And he shall prepare [[H6213]] a meat offering, [[H4503]] an ephah [[H374]] for a bullock, [[H6499]] and an ephah [[H374]] for a ram, [[H352]] and for the lambs [[H3532]] according as [[H834]] his hand [[H3027]] shall attain [[H5381]] unto, and an hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] to an ephah. [[H374]]

### 8
And when the prince [[H5387]] shall enter, [[H935]] he shall go in [[H935]] by the way [[H1870]] of the porch [[H197]] of gate, [[H8179]] and he shall go forth [[H3318]] by the way [[H1870]] thereof. [[H1870]]

### 9
But when the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] shall come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the solemn feasts, [[H4150]] he that entereth in [[H935]] by the way [[H1870]] of the north [[H6828]] gate [[H8179]] to worship [[H7812]] shall go out [[H3318]] by the way [[H1870]] of the south [[H5045]] gate; [[H8179]] and he that entereth [[H935]] by the way [[H1870]] of the south [[H5045]] gate [[H8179]] shall go forth [[H3318]] by the way [[H1870]] of the north [[H6828]] gate: [[H8179]] he shall not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] by the way [[H1870]] of the gate [[H8179]] whereby [[H834]] he came in, [[H935]] but [[H3588]] shall go forth [[H3318]] over against it. [[H5226]]

### 10
And the prince [[H5387]] in the midst [[H8432]] of them, when they go in, [[H935]] shall go in; [[H935]] and when they go forth, [[H3318]] shall go forth. [[H3318]]

### 11
And in the feasts [[H2282]] and in the solemnities [[H4150]] the meat offering [[H4503]] shall be [[H1961]] an ephah [[H374]] to a bullock, [[H6499]] and an ephah [[H374]] to a ram, [[H352]] and to the lambs [[H3532]] as he is able [[H3027]] to give, [[H4991]] and an hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] to an ephah. [[H374]]

### 12
Now when [[H3588]] the prince [[H5387]] shall prepare [[H6213]] a voluntary [[H5071]] burnt offering [[H5930]] or [[H176]] peace offerings [[H8002]] voluntarily [[H5071]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] shall then open [[H6605]]  him [[H853]] the gate [[H8179]] that looketh [[H6437]] toward the east, [[H6921]] and he shall prepare [[H6213]] his burnt offering [[H5930]] and his peace offerings, [[H8002]] as [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] day: [[H3117]] then he shall go forth; [[H3318]] and after [[H310]] his going forth [[H3318]] shall shut [[H5462]] the gate. [[H8179]]

### 13
Thou shalt daily [[H3117]] prepare [[H6213]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] a lamb [[H3532]] of the first [[H1121]] year [[H8141]] without blemish: [[H8549]] thou shalt prepare [[H6213]] it every [[H1242]] morning. [[H1242]]

### 14
And thou shalt prepare [[H6213]] a meat offering [[H4503]] for [[H5921]] it every morning, [[H1242]] the sixth part [[H8345]] of an ephah, [[H374]] and the third part [[H7992]] of an hin [[H1969]] of oil, [[H8081]] to temper with [[H7450]] the fine flour; [[H5560]] a meat offering [[H4503]] continually [[H8548]] by a perpetual [[H5769]] ordinance [[H2708]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
Thus shall they prepare [[H6213]] the lamb, [[H3532]] and the meat offering, [[H4503]] and the oil, [[H8081]] every morning [[H1242]] a continual [[H8548]] burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 16
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] If [[H3588]] the prince [[H5387]] give [[H5414]] a gift [[H4979]] unto any [[H376]] of his sons, [[H1121]] the inheritance [[H5159]] thereof shall be [[H1961]] his sons'; [[H1121]] it [[H1931]] their possession [[H272]] by inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 17
But if [[H3588]] he give [[H5414]] a gift [[H4979]] of his inheritance [[H5159]] to one [[H259]] of his servants, [[H5650]] then it shall be [[H1961]] his to [[H5704]] the year [[H8141]] of liberty; [[H1865]] after it shall return [[H7725]] to the prince: [[H5387]] but [[H389]] his inheritance [[H5159]] shall be [[H1961]] his sons' [[H1121]] for them. [[H1121]]

### 18
Moreover the prince [[H5387]] shall not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] of the people's [[H5971]] inheritance [[H5159]] by oppression, [[H3238]] to thrust them out of their possession; [[H272]]  he shall give [[H853]] his sons [[H1121]] inheritance [[H5157]] out of his own possession: [[H272]] that [[H4616]] my people [[H5971]] be not [[H3808]] scattered [[H6327]] every man [[H376]] from his possession. [[H272]]

### 19
After he brought [[H935]] me through the entry, [[H3996]] which [[H834]] at [[H5921]] the side [[H3802]] of the gate, [[H8179]] into [[H413]] the holy [[H6944]] chambers [[H3957]] of [[H413]] the priests, [[H3548]] which looked [[H6437]] toward the north: [[H6828]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there [[H8033]] a place [[H4725]] on the two sides [[H3411]] westward. [[H3220]]

### 20
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, This [[H2088]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the priests [[H3548]] shall boil [[H1310]] the trespass offering [[H817]] and the sin offering, [[H2403]] where [[H834]] they shall bake [[H644]] the meat offering; [[H4503]] that they bear [[H3318]]  not out [[H1115]] into [[H413]] the utter [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] to sanctify [[H6942]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 21
Then he brought me forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the utter [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] and caused me to pass by [[H5674]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H4740]] of the court; [[H2691]] and, behold, [[H2009]] in every [[H4740]] corner [[H4740]] of the court [[H2691]] a court. [[H2691]]

### 22
In the four [[H702]] corners [[H4740]] of the court [[H2691]] courts [[H2691]] joined [[H7000]] of forty [[H705]] long [[H753]] and thirty [[H7970]] broad: [[H7341]] these four [[H702]] corners [[H7106]] of one [[H259]] measure. [[H4060]]

### 23
And a row [[H2905]] round about [[H5439]] in them, round about [[H5439]] them four, [[H702]] and made [[H6213]] with boiling places [[H4018]] under [[H8478]] the rows [[H2918]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 24
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, These [[H428]] the places [[H1004]] of them that boil, [[H1310]] where [[H834]] the ministers [[H8334]] of the house [[H1004]] shall boil [[H1310]] the sacrifice [[H2077]] of the people. [[H5971]]
