### 1
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Also, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] unto the land [[H127]] of Israel; [[H3478]] An end, [[H7093]] the end [[H7093]] is come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H3671]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 3
Now [[H6258]] the end [[H7093]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and I will send [[H7971]] mine anger [[H639]] upon thee, and will judge [[H8199]] thee according to thy ways, [[H1870]] and will recompense [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]]  thee [[H853]] all [[H3605]] thine abominations. [[H8441]]

### 4
And mine eye [[H5869]] shall not [[H3808]] spare [[H2347]] thee, neither [[H3808]] will I have pity: [[H2550]] but [[H3588]] I will recompense [[H5414]] thy ways [[H1870]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and thine abominations [[H8441]] shall be [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee: and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] An evil, [[H7451]] an only [[H259]] evil, [[H7451]] behold, [[H2009]] is come. [[H935]]

### 6
An end [[H7093]] is come, [[H935]] the end [[H7093]] is come: [[H935]] it watcheth [[H6974]] for [[H413]] thee; behold, [[H2009]] it is come. [[H935]]

### 7
The morning [[H6843]] is come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, O thou that dwellest [[H3427]] in the land: [[H776]] the time [[H6256]] is come, [[H935]] the day [[H3117]] of trouble [[H4103]] near, [[H7138]] and not [[H3808]] the sounding again [[H1906]] of the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 8
Now [[H6258]] will I shortly [[H7138]] pour out [[H8210]] my fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and accomplish [[H3615]] mine anger [[H639]] upon thee: and I will judge [[H8199]] thee according to thy ways, [[H1870]] and will recompense [[H5414]]  thee for [[H853]] all [[H3605]] thine abominations. [[H8441]]

### 9
And mine eye [[H5869]] shall not [[H3808]] spare, [[H2347]] neither [[H3808]] will I have pity: [[H2550]] I will recompense [[H5414]] thee according to thy ways [[H1870]] and thine abominations [[H8441]] are [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee; and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] that smiteth. [[H5221]]

### 10
Behold [[H2009]] the day, [[H3117]] behold, [[H2009]] it is come: [[H935]] the morning [[H6843]] is gone forth; [[H3318]] the rod [[H4294]] hath blossomed, [[H6692]] pride [[H2087]] hath budded. [[H6524]]

### 11
Violence [[H2555]] is risen up [[H6965]] into a rod [[H4294]] of wickedness: [[H7562]] none [[H3808]] of them nor [[H3808]] of their multitude, [[H1995]] nor [[H3808]] of any [[H1991]] of theirs: neither [[H3808]] wailing [[H5089]] for them. [[H5089]]

### 12
The time [[H6256]] is come, [[H935]] the day [[H3117]] draweth near: [[H5060]] let not [[H408]] the buyer [[H7069]] rejoice, [[H8055]] nor [[H408]] the seller [[H4376]] mourn: [[H56]] for [[H3588]] wrath [[H2740]] upon [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the multitude [[H1995]] thereof. [[H1995]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] the seller [[H4376]] shall not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] that which is sold, [[H4465]] although they were yet [[H5750]] alive: [[H2416]] for [[H3588]] the vision [[H2377]] touching [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] multitude [[H1995]] thereof, shall not [[H3808]] return; [[H7725]] neither [[H3808]] shall any [[H376]] strengthen himself [[H2388]] in the iniquity [[H5771]] of his life. [[H2416]]

### 14
They have blown [[H8628]] the trumpet, [[H8619]] even to make all ready; [[H3559]] but none [[H369]] goeth [[H1980]] to the battle: [[H4421]] for [[H3588]] my wrath [[H2740]] upon [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the multitude [[H1995]] thereof. [[H1995]]

### 15
The sword [[H2719]] without, [[H2351]] and the pestilence [[H1698]] and the famine [[H7458]] within: [[H1004]] he that [[H834]] in the field [[H7704]] shall die [[H4191]] with the sword; [[H2719]] and he that [[H834]] in the city, [[H5892]] famine [[H7458]] and pestilence [[H1698]] shall devour [[H398]] him. [[H398]]

### 16
But they that escape [[H6403]] of them shall escape, [[H6412]] and shall be [[H1961]] on [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] like doves [[H3123]] of the valleys, [[H1516]] all [[H3605]] of them mourning, [[H1993]] every one [[H376]] for his iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 17
All [[H3605]] hands [[H3027]] shall be feeble, [[H7503]] and all [[H3605]] knees [[H1290]] shall be weak [[H1980]] water. [[H4325]]

### 18
They shall also gird [[H2296]] with sackcloth, [[H8242]] and horror [[H6427]] shall cover [[H3680]] them; and shame [[H955]] upon [[H413]] all [[H3605]] faces, [[H6440]] and baldness [[H7144]] upon all [[H3605]] their heads. [[H7218]]

### 19
They shall cast [[H7993]] their silver [[H3701]] in the streets, [[H2351]] and their gold [[H2091]] shall be [[H1961]] removed: [[H5079]] their silver [[H3701]] and their gold [[H2091]] shall not [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] them in the day [[H3117]] of the wrath [[H5678]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] they shall not [[H3808]] satisfy [[H7646]] their souls, [[H5315]] neither [[H3808]] fill [[H4390]] their bowels: [[H4578]] because [[H3588]] it is [[H1961]] the stumblingblock [[H4383]] of their iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 20
As for the beauty [[H6643]] of his ornament, [[H5716]] he set [[H7760]] it in majesty: [[H1347]] but they made [[H6213]] the images [[H6754]] of their abominations [[H8441]] of their detestable things [[H8251]] therein: therefore [[H5921]] have I set [[H5414]] it far [[H5079]] from them. [[H5079]]

### 21
And I will give [[H5414]] it into the hands [[H3027]] of the strangers [[H2114]] for a prey, [[H957]] and to the wicked [[H7563]] of the earth [[H776]] for a spoil; [[H7998]] and they shall pollute [[H2490]] it. [[H2490]]

### 22
My face [[H6440]] will I turn [[H5437]] also from them, and they shall pollute [[H2490]] my secret [[H6845]] for the robbers [[H6530]] shall enter [[H935]] into it, and defile [[H2490]] it. [[H2490]]

### 23
Make [[H6213]] a chain: [[H7569]] for [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] is full [[H4390]] of bloody [[H1818]] crimes, [[H4941]] and the city [[H5892]] is full [[H4390]] of violence. [[H2555]]

### 24
Wherefore I will bring [[H935]] the worst [[H7451]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] and they shall possess [[H3423]] their houses: [[H1004]] I will also make the pomp [[H1347]] of the strong [[H5794]] to cease; [[H7673]] and their holy places [[H6942]] shall be defiled. [[H2490]]

### 25
Destruction [[H7089]] cometh; [[H935]] and they shall seek [[H1245]] peace, [[H7965]] and none. [[H7965]]

### 26
Mischief [[H1943]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] mischief, [[H1943]] and rumour [[H8052]] shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] rumour; [[H8052]] then shall they seek [[H1245]] a vision [[H2377]] of the prophet; [[H5030]] but the law [[H8451]] shall perish [[H6]] from the priest, [[H3548]] and counsel [[H6098]] from the ancients. [[H2205]]

### 27
The king [[H4428]] shall mourn, [[H56]] and the prince [[H5387]] shall be clothed [[H3847]] with desolation, [[H8077]] and the hands [[H3027]] of the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] shall be troubled: [[H926]] I will do [[H6213]] unto them after their way, [[H1870]] and according to their deserts [[H4941]] will I judge [[H8199]] them; and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord.
