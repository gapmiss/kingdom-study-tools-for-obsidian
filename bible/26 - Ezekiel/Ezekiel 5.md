### 1
And thou, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take [[H3947]] thee a sharp [[H2299]] knife, [[H2719]] take [[H3947]] thee a barber's [[H1532]] razor, [[H8593]] and cause to pass [[H5674]] upon [[H5921]] thine head [[H7218]] and upon [[H5921]] thy beard: [[H2206]] then take [[H3947]] thee balances [[H3976]] to weigh, [[H4948]] and divide [[H2505]] the [[H2505]]

### 2
Thou shalt burn [[H1197]] with fire [[H217]] a third part [[H7992]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the city, [[H5892]] when the days [[H3117]] of the siege [[H4692]] are fulfilled: [[H4390]] and thou shalt take [[H3947]] a third part, [[H7992]] smite [[H5221]] about [[H5439]] it with a knife: [[H2719]] and a third part [[H7992]] thou shalt scatter [[H2219]] in the wind; [[H7307]] and I will draw out [[H7324]] a sword [[H2719]] after [[H310]] them. [[H310]]

### 3
Thou shalt also take [[H3947]] thereof [[H8033]] a few [[H4592]] in number, [[H4557]] and bind [[H6696]] them in thy skirts. [[H3671]]

### 4
Then take [[H3947]] of them again, [[H5750]] and cast [[H7993]] them into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the fire, [[H784]] and burn [[H8313]] them in the fire; [[H784]] thereof [[H4480]] shall a fire [[H784]] come forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] This [[H2063]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]] I have set [[H7760]] it in the midst [[H8432]] of the nations [[H1471]] and countries [[H776]] round about [[H5439]] her. [[H5439]]

### 6
And she hath changed [[H4784]] my judgments [[H4941]] into wickedness [[H7564]] more than [[H4480]] the nations, [[H1471]] and my statutes [[H2708]] more than [[H4480]] the countries [[H776]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] her: for [[H3588]] they have refused [[H3988]] my judgments [[H4941]] and my statutes, [[H2708]] they have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in them. [[H1980]]

### 7
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Because [[H3282]] ye multiplied [[H1995]] more than [[H4480]] the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] you, have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] neither [[H3808]] have kept [[H6213]] my judgments, [[H4941]] neither [[H3808]] have done [[H6213]] according to the judgments [[H4941]] of the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] you; [[H5439]]

### 8
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I, even [[H1571]] I, [[H589]] against [[H5921]] thee, and will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H4941]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee in the sight [[H5869]] of the nations. [[H1471]]

### 9
And I will do [[H6213]]  in thee [[H853]] that which [[H834]] I have not [[H3808]] done, [[H6213]] and whereunto [[H834]] I will not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] any more [[H5750]] the like, [[H3644]] because of [[H3282]] all [[H3605]] thine abominations. [[H8441]]

### 10
Therefore [[H3651]] the fathers [[H1]] shall eat [[H398]] the sons [[H1121]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee, and the sons [[H1121]] shall eat [[H398]] their fathers; [[H1]] and I will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]]  in thee, and [[H853]] the whole [[H3605]] remnant [[H7611]] of thee will I scatter [[H2219]] into all [[H3605]] the winds. [[H7307]]

### 11
Wherefore, [[H3651]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Surely, [[H518]] because [[H3282]] thou hast defiled [[H2930]] my sanctuary [[H4720]] with all [[H3605]] thy detestable things, [[H8251]] and with all [[H3605]] thine abominations, [[H8441]] therefore [[H1571]] will I [[H589]] also diminish [[H1639]] neither [[H3808]] shall mine eye [[H5869]] spare, [[H2347]] neither [[H3808]] will I [[H589]] have any pity. [[H2550]]

### 12
A third part [[H7992]] of thee shall die [[H4191]] with the pestilence, [[H1698]] and with famine [[H7458]] shall they be consumed [[H3615]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee: and a third part [[H7992]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] round about [[H5439]] thee; and I will scatter [[H2219]] a third part [[H7992]] into all [[H3605]] the winds, [[H7307]] and I will draw out [[H7324]] a sword [[H2719]] after [[H310]] them. [[H310]]

### 13
Thus shall mine anger [[H639]] be accomplished, [[H3615]] and I will cause my fury [[H2534]] to rest [[H5117]] upon them, and I will be comforted: [[H5162]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]] in my zeal, [[H7068]] when I have accomplished [[H3615]] my fury [[H2534]] in them. [[H2534]]

### 14
Moreover I will make [[H5414]] thee waste, [[H2723]] and a reproach [[H2781]] among the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] thee, in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] that pass by. [[H5674]]

### 15
So it shall be [[H1961]] a reproach [[H2781]] and a taunt, [[H1422]] an instruction [[H4148]] and an astonishment [[H4923]] unto the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] thee, when I shall execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] in thee in anger [[H639]] and in fury [[H2534]] and in furious [[H2534]] rebukes. [[H8433]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]]

### 16
When I shall send [[H7971]]  upon them the [[H853]] evil [[H7451]] arrows [[H2671]] of famine, [[H7458]] which [[H834]] shall be [[H1961]] for destruction, [[H4889]] which [[H834]] I will send [[H7971]] to destroy [[H7843]] you: and I will increase [[H3254]] the famine [[H7458]] upon [[H5921]] you, and will break [[H7665]] your staff [[H4294]] of bread: [[H3899]]

### 17
So will I send [[H7971]] upon [[H5921]] you famine [[H7458]] and evil [[H7451]] beasts, [[H2416]] and they shall bereave [[H7921]] thee; and pestilence [[H1698]] and blood [[H1818]] shall pass through [[H5674]] thee; and I will bring [[H935]] the sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] thee. I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]]
