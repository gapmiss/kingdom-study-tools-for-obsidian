### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] again unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] there were [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] women, [[H802]] the daughters [[H1323]] of one [[H259]] mother: [[H517]]

### 3
And they committed whoredoms [[H2181]] in Egypt; [[H4714]] they committed whoredoms [[H2181]] in their youth: [[H5271]] there [[H8033]] were their breasts [[H7699]] pressed, [[H4600]] and there [[H8033]] they bruised [[H6213]] the teats [[H1717]] of their virginity. [[H1331]]

### 4
And the names [[H8034]] of them Aholah [[H170]] the elder, [[H1419]] and Aholibah [[H172]] her sister: [[H269]] and they were [[H1961]] mine, and they bare [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] Thus their names; [[H8034]] Samaria [[H8111]] Aholah, [[H170]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] Aholibah. [[H172]]

### 5
And Aholah [[H170]] played the harlot [[H2181]] when she was mine; [[H8478]] and she doted [[H5689]] on [[H5921]] her lovers, [[H157]] on [[H413]] the Assyrians [[H804]] neighbours, [[H7138]]

### 6
clothed [[H3847]] with blue, [[H8504]] captains [[H6346]] and rulers, [[H5461]] all [[H3605]] of them desirable [[H2531]] young men, [[H970]] horsemen [[H6571]] riding upon [[H7392]] horses. [[H5483]]

### 7
Thus she committed [[H5414]] her whoredoms [[H8457]] with [[H5921]] them, with all [[H3605]] them the chosen [[H4005]] men [[H1121]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and with all [[H3605]] on whom [[H834]] she doted: [[H5689]] with all [[H3605]] their idols [[H1544]] she defiled [[H2930]] herself. [[H2930]]

### 8
Neither [[H3808]] left [[H5800]] she her whoredoms [[H8457]] from Egypt: [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] in her youth [[H5271]] they lay [[H7901]] with [[H854]] her, and they [[H1992]] bruised [[H6213]] the breasts [[H1717]] of her virginity, [[H1331]] and poured [[H8210]] their whoredom [[H8457]] upon [[H5921]] her. [[H5921]]

### 9
Wherefore [[H3651]] I have delivered [[H5414]] her into the hand [[H3027]] of her lovers, [[H157]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Assyrians, [[H1121]] upon [[H5921]] whom [[H834]] she doted. [[H5689]]

### 10
These [[H1992]] discovered [[H1540]] her nakedness: [[H6172]] they took [[H3947]] her sons [[H1121]] and her daughters, [[H1323]] and slew [[H2026]] her with the sword: [[H2719]] and she became [[H1961]] famous [[H8034]] among women; [[H802]] for they had executed [[H6213]] judgment [[H8196]] upon her. [[H8196]]

### 11
And when her sister [[H269]] Aholibah [[H172]] saw [[H7200]] she was more corrupt [[H7843]] in her inordinate love [[H5691]] than [[H4480]] she, and in her whoredoms [[H8457]] more than her sister [[H269]] in whoredoms. [[H2183]]

### 12
She doted [[H5689]] upon [[H413]] the Assyrians [[H1121]] neighbours, [[H7138]] captains [[H6346]] and rulers [[H5461]] clothed [[H3847]] most gorgeously, [[H4358]] horsemen [[H6571]] riding upon [[H7392]] horses, [[H5483]] all [[H3605]] of them desirable [[H2531]] young men. [[H970]]

### 13
Then I saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she was defiled, [[H2930]] they both [[H8147]] one [[H259]] way, [[H1870]]

### 14
And she increased [[H3254]] her whoredoms: [[H8457]] for when she saw [[H7200]] men [[H376]] pourtrayed [[H2707]] upon [[H5921]] the wall, [[H7023]] the images [[H6754]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] pourtrayed [[H2710]] with vermilion, [[H8350]]

### 15
Girded [[H2289]] with girdles [[H232]] upon their loins, [[H4975]] exceeding [[H5628]] in dyed attire [[H2871]] upon their heads, [[H7218]] all [[H3605]] of them princes [[H7991]] to look to, [[H4758]] after the manner [[H1823]] of the Babylonians [[H1121]] of Chaldea, [[H3778]] the land [[H776]] of their nativity: [[H4138]]

### 16
And as soon as she saw [[H4758]] them with her eyes, [[H5869]] she doted [[H5689]] upon [[H5921]] them, and sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] them into Chaldea. [[H3778]]

### 17
And the Babylonians [[H1121]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] her into the bed [[H4904]] of love, [[H1730]] and they defiled [[H2930]] her with their whoredom, [[H8457]] and she was polluted [[H2930]] with them, and her mind [[H5315]] was alienated [[H3363]] from them. [[H3363]]

### 18
So she discovered [[H1540]] her whoredoms, [[H8457]] and discovered [[H1540]] her nakedness: [[H6172]] then my mind [[H5315]] was alienated [[H3363]] from [[H5921]] her, like as [[H834]] my mind [[H5315]] was alienated [[H5361]] from [[H5921]] her sister. [[H269]]

### 19
Yet she multiplied [[H7235]] her whoredoms, [[H8457]] in calling to remembrance [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of her youth, [[H5271]] wherein [[H834]] she had played the harlot [[H2181]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 20
For she doted [[H5689]] upon [[H5921]] their paramours, [[H6370]] whose [[H834]] flesh [[H1320]] the flesh [[H1320]] of asses, [[H2543]] and whose issue [[H2231]] the issue [[H2231]] of horses. [[H5483]]

### 21
Thus thou calledst to remembrance [[H6485]] the lewdness [[H2154]] of thy youth, [[H5271]] in bruising [[H6213]] thy teats [[H1717]] by the Egyptians [[H4714]] for [[H4616]] the paps [[H7699]] of thy youth. [[H5271]]

### 22
Therefore, [[H3651]] O Aholibah, [[H172]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will raise up [[H5782]] thy lovers [[H157]] against [[H5921]] thee, from whom [[H853]] thy mind [[H5315]] is alienated, [[H5361]] and I will bring [[H935]] them against [[H5921]] thee on every side; [[H5439]]

### 23
The Babylonians, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] Pekod, [[H6489]] and Shoa, [[H7772]] and Koa, [[H6970]] all [[H3605]] the Assyrians [[H1121]] with [[H854]] them: all [[H3605]] of them desirable [[H2531]] young men, [[H970]] captains [[H6346]] and rulers, [[H5461]] great lords [[H7991]] and renowned, [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] of them riding upon [[H7392]] horses. [[H5483]]

### 24
And they shall come [[H935]] against [[H5921]] thee with chariots, [[H2021]] wagons, [[H7393]] and wheels, [[H1534]] and with an assembly [[H6951]] of people, [[H5971]] shall set [[H7760]] against [[H5921]] thee buckler [[H6793]] and shield [[H4043]] and helmet [[H6959]] round about: [[H5439]] and I will set [[H5414]] judgment [[H4941]] before [[H6440]] them, and they shall judge [[H8199]] thee according to their judgments. [[H4941]]

### 25
And I will set [[H5414]] my jealousy [[H7068]] against thee, and they shall deal [[H6213]] furiously [[H2534]] with [[H854]] thee: they shall take away [[H5493]] thy nose [[H639]] and thine ears; [[H241]] and thy remnant [[H319]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword: [[H2719]] they [[H1992]] shall take [[H3947]] thy sons [[H1121]] and thy daughters; [[H1323]] and thy residue [[H319]] shall be devoured [[H398]] by the fire. [[H784]]

### 26
They shall also strip [[H6584]] thee out of [[H853]] thy clothes, [[H899]] and take away [[H3947]] thy fair [[H8597]] jewels. [[H3627]]

### 27
Thus will I make thy lewdness [[H2154]] to cease [[H7673]] from [[H4480]] thee, and thy whoredom [[H2184]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] so that thou shalt not [[H3808]] lift up [[H5375]] thine eyes [[H5869]] unto [[H413]] them, nor [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] Egypt [[H4714]] any more. [[H4714]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will deliver [[H5414]] thee into the hand [[H3027]] whom [[H834]] thou hatest, [[H8130]] into the hand [[H3027]] from whom [[H834]] thy mind [[H5315]] is alienated: [[H5361]]

### 29
And they shall deal [[H6213]] with [[H854]] thee hatefully, [[H8135]] and shall take away [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] thy labour, [[H3018]] and shall leave [[H5800]] thee naked [[H5903]] and bare: [[H6181]] and the nakedness [[H6172]] of thy whoredoms [[H2183]] shall be discovered, [[H1540]] both thy lewdness [[H2154]] and thy whoredoms. [[H8457]]

### 30
I will do [[H6213]] these [[H428]] unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] the heathen, [[H1471]] because [[H5921]] thou art polluted [[H2930]] with their idols. [[H1544]]

### 31
Thou hast walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of thy sister; [[H269]] therefore will I give [[H5414]] her cup [[H3563]] into thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 32
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Thou shalt drink [[H8354]] of thy sister's [[H269]] cup [[H3563]] deep [[H6013]] and large: [[H7342]] thou shalt be [[H1961]] laughed to scorn [[H6712]] and had in derision; [[H3933]] it containeth [[H3557]] much. [[H4767]]

### 33
Thou shalt be filled [[H4390]] with drunkenness [[H7943]] and sorrow, [[H3015]] with the cup [[H3563]] of astonishment [[H8047]] and desolation, [[H8077]] with the cup [[H3563]] of thy sister [[H269]] Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 34
Thou shalt even drink [[H8354]] it and suck out, [[H4680]] and thou shalt break [[H1633]] the sherds [[H2789]] thereof, and pluck off [[H5423]] thine own breasts: [[H7699]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have spoken [[H1696]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 35
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] thou hast forgotten [[H7911]] me, and cast [[H7993]] me behind [[H310]] thy back, [[H1458]] therefore bear [[H5375]] thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] thy lewdness [[H2154]] and thy whoredoms. [[H8457]]

### 36
The Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] moreover unto [[H413]] me; Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] wilt thou judge [[H8199]] Aholah [[H170]] and Aholibah? [[H172]] yea, declare [[H5046]]  unto them [[H853]] their abominations; [[H8441]]

### 37
That [[H3588]] they have committed adultery, [[H5003]] and blood [[H1818]] in their hands, [[H3027]] and with [[H854]] their idols [[H1544]] have they committed adultery, [[H5003]] and have also [[H1571]]  caused [[H853]] their sons, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] they bare [[H3205]] unto me, to pass for them through [[H5674]] to devour [[H402]]

### 38
Moreover [[H5750]] this [[H2063]] they have done [[H6213]] unto me: they have defiled [[H2930]] my sanctuary [[H4720]] in the same [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and have profaned [[H2490]] my sabbaths. [[H7676]]

### 39
For when they had slain [[H7819]] their children [[H1121]] to their idols, [[H1544]] then they came [[H935]] the same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] into [[H413]] my sanctuary [[H4720]] to profane [[H2490]] it; and, lo, [[H2009]] thus [[H3541]] have they done [[H6213]] in the midst [[H8432]] of mine house. [[H1004]]

### 40
And furthermore, [[H637]] that [[H3588]] ye have sent [[H7971]] for men [[H376]] to come [[H935]] from far, [[H4801]] unto [[H413]] whom [[H834]] a messenger [[H4397]] sent; [[H7971]] and, lo, [[H2009]] they came: [[H935]] for whom [[H834]] thou didst wash [[H7364]] thyself, paintedst [[H3583]] thy eyes, [[H5869]] and deckedst [[H5710]] thyself with ornaments, [[H5716]]

### 41
And satest [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] a stately [[H3520]] bed, [[H4296]] and a table [[H7979]] prepared [[H6186]] before [[H6440]] it, whereupon [[H5921]] thou hast set [[H7760]] mine incense [[H7004]] and mine oil. [[H8081]]

### 42
And a voice [[H6963]] of a multitude [[H1995]] being at ease [[H7961]] with her: and with [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of the common sort [[H7230]] brought [[H935]] Sabeans [[H5436]] from the wilderness, [[H4057]] which put [[H5414]] bracelets [[H6781]] upon [[H5921]] their hands, [[H3027]] and beautiful [[H8597]] crowns [[H5850]] upon [[H413]] their heads. [[H7218]]

### 43
Then said I [[H559]] unto old [[H1087]] in adulteries, [[H5004]] Will they now [[H6258]] commit [[H2181]] whoredoms [[H8457]] with her, and she [[H1931]]

### 44
Yet they went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her, as they go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] a woman [[H802]] that playeth the harlot: [[H2181]] so [[H3651]] went they in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Aholah [[H170]] and unto [[H413]] Aholibah, [[H172]] the lewd [[H2154]] women. [[H802]]

### 45
And the righteous [[H6662]] men, [[H376]] they [[H1992]] shall judge [[H8199]] them after the manner [[H4941]] of adulteresses, [[H5003]] and after the manner [[H4941]] of women that shed [[H8210]] blood; [[H1818]] because [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] adulteresses, [[H5003]] and blood [[H1818]] in their hands. [[H3027]]

### 46
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I will bring up [[H5927]] a company [[H6951]] upon [[H5921]] them, and will give [[H5414]] them to be removed [[H2189]] and spoiled. [[H957]]

### 47
And the company [[H6951]] shall stone [[H7275]] them with stones, [[H68]] and dispatch [[H1254]] them with their swords; [[H2719]] they shall slay [[H2026]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters, [[H1323]] and burn up [[H8313]] their houses [[H1004]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 48
Thus will I cause lewdness [[H2154]] to cease [[H7673]] out of [[H4480]] the land, [[H776]] that all [[H3605]] women [[H802]] may be taught [[H3256]] not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] after your lewdness. [[H2154]]

### 49
And they shall recompense [[H5414]] your lewdness [[H2154]] upon [[H5921]] you, and ye shall bear [[H5375]] the sins [[H2399]] of your idols: [[H1544]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]
