### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] again unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] and say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Howl [[H3213]] ye, Woe worth [[H1929]] the day! [[H3117]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] near, [[H7138]] even the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] near, [[H7138]] a cloudy [[H6051]] day; [[H3117]] it shall be [[H1961]] the time [[H6256]] of the heathen. [[H1471]]

### 4
And the sword [[H2719]] shall come [[H935]] upon Egypt, [[H4714]] and great pain [[H2479]] shall be [[H1961]] in Ethiopia, [[H3568]] when the slain [[H2491]] shall fall [[H5307]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and they shall take away [[H3947]] her multitude, [[H1995]] and her foundations [[H3247]] shall be broken down. [[H2040]]

### 5
Ethiopia, [[H3568]] and Libya, [[H6316]] and Lydia, [[H3865]] and all [[H3605]] the mingled people, [[H6153]] and Chub, [[H3552]] and the men [[H1121]] of the land [[H776]] that is in league, [[H1285]] shall fall [[H5307]] with [[H854]] them by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 6
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] They also that uphold [[H5564]] Egypt [[H4714]] shall fall; [[H5307]] and the pride [[H1347]] of her power [[H5797]] shall come down: [[H3381]] from the tower [[H4024]] of Syene [[H5482]] shall they fall [[H5307]] in it by the sword, [[H2719]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 7
And they shall be desolate [[H8074]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the countries [[H776]] desolate, [[H8074]] and her cities [[H5892]] shall be [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the cities [[H5892]] wasted. [[H2717]]

### 8
And they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I have set [[H5414]] a fire [[H784]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and all [[H3605]] her helpers [[H5826]] shall be destroyed. [[H7665]]

### 9
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall messengers [[H4397]] go forth [[H3318]] from [[H6440]] me in ships [[H6716]]  to make [[H853]] the careless [[H983]] Ethiopians [[H3568]] afraid, [[H2729]] and great pain [[H2479]] shall come [[H1961]] upon them, as in the day [[H3117]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] for, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] it cometh. [[H935]]

### 10
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]]  I will also make [[H853]] the multitude [[H1995]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to cease [[H7673]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 11
He [[H1931]] and his people [[H5971]] with [[H854]] him, the terrible [[H6184]] of the nations, [[H1471]] shall be brought [[H935]] to destroy [[H7843]] the land: [[H776]] and they shall draw [[H7324]] their swords [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] Egypt, [[H4714]] and fill [[H4390]] the land [[H776]] with the slain. [[H2491]]

### 12
And I will make [[H5414]] the rivers [[H2975]] dry, [[H2724]] and sell [[H4376]] the land [[H776]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked: [[H7451]] and I will make the land [[H776]] waste, [[H8074]] and all that is therein, [[H4393]] by the hand [[H3027]] of strangers: [[H2114]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]]

### 13
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I will also destroy [[H6]] the idols, [[H1544]] and I will cause images [[H457]] to cease [[H7673]] out of Noph; [[H5297]] and there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] a prince [[H5387]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] and I will put [[H5414]] a fear [[H3374]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 14
And I will make Pathros [[H6624]] desolate, [[H8074]] and will set [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] in Zoan, [[H6814]] and will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] in No. [[H4996]]

### 15
And I will pour [[H8210]] my fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] Sin, [[H5512]] the strength [[H4581]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] the multitude [[H1995]] of No. [[H4996]]

### 16
And I will set [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] in Egypt: [[H4714]] Sin [[H5512]] shall have great [[H2342]] pain, [[H2342]] and No [[H4996]] shall be [[H1961]] rent asunder, [[H1234]] and Noph [[H5297]] distresses [[H6862]] daily. [[H3119]]

### 17
The young men [[H970]] of Aven [[H206]] and of Pi-beseth [[H6364]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword: [[H2719]] and these [[H2007]] shall go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]]

### 18
At Tehaphnehes [[H8471]] also the day [[H3117]] shall be darkened, [[H2821]] when I shall break [[H7665]] there [[H8033]] the yokes [[H4133]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] and the pomp [[H1347]] of her strength [[H5797]] shall cease [[H7673]] in her: as for her, a cloud [[H6051]] shall cover [[H3680]] her, [[H1931]] and her daughters [[H1323]] shall go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]]

### 19
Thus will I execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] in Egypt: [[H4714]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the eleventh [[H259]] year, [[H8141]] in the first [[H7223]] in the seventh [[H7651]] of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 21
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] I have broken [[H7665]] the arm [[H2220]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] and, lo, [[H2009]] it shall not [[H3808]] be bound up [[H2280]] to be healed, [[H7499]] to put [[H7760]] a roller [[H2848]] to bind [[H2280]] it, to make it strong [[H2388]] to hold [[H8610]] the sword. [[H2719]]

### 22
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and will break [[H7665]] his arms, [[H2220]] the strong, [[H2389]] and that which was broken; [[H7665]]  and I will cause [[H853]] the sword [[H2719]] to fall [[H5307]] out of his hand. [[H3027]]

### 23
And I will scatter [[H6327]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] among the nations, [[H1471]] and will disperse [[H2219]] them through the countries. [[H776]]

### 24
And I will strengthen [[H2388]] the arms [[H2220]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and put [[H5414]] my sword [[H2719]] in his hand: [[H3027]] but I will break [[H7665]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] arms, [[H2220]] and he shall groan [[H5008]] before [[H6440]] him with the groanings [[H5009]] of a deadly wounded [[H2491]]

### 25
But I will strengthen [[H2388]] the arms [[H2220]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and the arms [[H2220]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] shall fall down; [[H5307]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I shall put [[H5414]] my sword [[H2719]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he shall stretch it out [[H5186]] upon [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 26
And I will scatter [[H6327]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] among the nations, [[H1471]] and disperse [[H2219]] them among the countries; [[H776]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
