### 1
Then he brought me back [[H7725]] the way [[H1870]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the outward [[H2435]] sanctuary [[H4720]] which looketh [[H6437]] toward the east; [[H6921]] and it [[H1931]] shut. [[H5462]]

### 2
Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me; This [[H2088]] gate [[H8179]] shall be [[H1961]] shut, [[H5462]] it shall not [[H3808]] be opened, [[H6605]] and no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] shall enter in [[H935]] by it; because [[H3588]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hath entered in [[H935]] by it, therefore it shall be [[H1961]] shut. [[H5462]]

### 3
for the prince; [[H5387]] the prince, [[H5387]] he [[H1931]] shall sit [[H3427]] in it to eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] he shall enter [[H935]] by the way [[H1870]] of the porch [[H197]] of gate, [[H8179]] and shall go out [[H3318]] by the way of the same. [[H1870]]

### 4
Then brought [[H935]] he me the way [[H1870]] of the north [[H6828]] gate [[H8179]] before [[H6440]] the house: [[H1004]] and I looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and I fell [[H5307]] upon [[H413]] my face. [[H6440]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] mark [[H7760]] well, [[H3820]] and behold [[H7200]] with thine eyes, [[H5869]] and hear [[H8085]] with thine ears [[H241]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] say [[H1696]] unto thee concerning all [[H3605]] the ordinances [[H2708]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the laws [[H8451]] thereof; and mark [[H7760]] well [[H3820]] the entering in [[H3996]] of the house, [[H1004]] with every [[H3605]] going forth [[H4161]] of the sanctuary. [[H4720]]

### 6
And thou shalt say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the rebellious, [[H4805]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] O ye house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] let it suffice [[H7227]] you of all [[H3605]] your abominations, [[H8441]]

### 7
In that ye have brought [[H935]] strangers, [[H1121]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] in heart, [[H3820]] and uncircumcised [[H6189]] in flesh, [[H1320]] to be [[H1961]] in my sanctuary, [[H4720]] to pollute [[H2490]]  it, [[H853]] my house, [[H1004]] when ye offer [[H7126]] my bread, [[H3899]] the fat [[H2459]] and the blood, [[H1818]] and they have broken [[H6565]] my covenant [[H1285]] because of [[H413]] all [[H3605]] your abominations. [[H8441]]

### 8
And ye have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of mine holy things: [[H6944]] but ye have set [[H7760]] keepers [[H8104]] of my charge [[H4931]] in my sanctuary [[H4720]] for yourselves. [[H4720]]

### 9
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] No [[H3808]] stranger, [[H1121]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] in heart, [[H3820]] nor uncircumcised [[H6189]] in flesh, [[H1320]] shall enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] my sanctuary, [[H4720]] of any [[H3605]] stranger [[H1121]] that [[H834]] among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 10
And [[H3588]] the Levites [[H3881]] that [[H834]] are gone away far [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] me, when Israel [[H3478]] went astray, [[H8582]] which [[H834]] went astray away [[H8582]] from [[H5921]] me after [[H310]] their idols; [[H1544]] they shall even bear [[H5375]] their iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 11
Yet they shall be [[H1961]] ministers [[H8334]] in my sanctuary, [[H4720]] charge [[H6486]] at [[H413]] the gates [[H8179]] of the house, [[H1004]] and ministering [[H8334]] to the house: [[H1004]] they [[H1992]] shall slay [[H7819]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the sacrifice [[H2077]] for the people, [[H5971]] and they [[H1992]] shall stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] them to minister [[H8334]] unto them. [[H8334]]

### 12
Because [[H3282]] they ministered unto [[H8334]] them before [[H6440]] their idols, [[H1544]] and caused [[H1961]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] to fall [[H4383]] into iniquity; [[H5771]] therefore [[H5921]] have I lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] and they shall bear [[H5375]] their iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 13
And they shall not [[H3808]] come near [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] me, to do the office of a priest [[H3547]] unto me, nor to come near [[H5066]] to [[H5921]] any [[H3605]] of my holy things, [[H6944]] in [[H413]] the most holy [[H6944]] but they shall bear [[H5375]] their shame, [[H3639]] and their abominations [[H8441]] which [[H834]] they have committed. [[H6213]]

### 14
But I will make [[H5414]] them keepers [[H8104]] of the charge [[H4931]] of the house, [[H1004]] for all [[H3605]] the service [[H5656]] thereof, and for all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] shall be done [[H6213]] therein. [[H6213]]

### 15
But the priests [[H3548]] the Levites, [[H3881]] the sons [[H1121]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] that [[H834]] kept [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of my sanctuary [[H4720]] when the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went astray [[H8582]] from [[H5921]] me, they [[H1992]] shall come near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] me to minister [[H8334]] unto me, and they shall stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] me to offer [[H7126]] unto me the fat [[H2459]] and the blood, [[H1818]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3069]]

### 16
They [[H1992]] shall enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] my sanctuary, [[H4720]] and they [[H1992]] shall come near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] my table, [[H7979]] to minister [[H8334]] unto me, and they shall keep [[H8104]] my charge. [[H4931]]

### 17
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when they enter in [[H935]] at [[H413]] the gates [[H8179]] of the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] they shall be clothed with [[H3847]] linen [[H6593]] garments; [[H899]] and no [[H3808]] wool [[H6785]] shall come [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] them, whiles they minister [[H8334]] in the gates [[H8179]] of the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] and within. [[H1004]]

### 18
They shall have [[H1961]] linen [[H6593]] bonnets [[H6287]] upon [[H5921]] their heads, [[H7218]] and shall have [[H1961]] linen [[H6593]] breeches [[H4370]] upon [[H5921]] their loins; [[H4975]] they shall not [[H3808]] gird [[H2296]] with any thing that causeth sweat. [[H3154]]

### 19
And when they go forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the utter [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] into [[H413]] the utter [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] they shall put off [[H6584]] their garments [[H899]] wherein [[H834]] they [[H1992]] ministered, [[H8334]] and lay [[H3240]] them in the holy [[H6944]] chambers, [[H3957]] and they shall put on [[H3847]] other [[H312]] garments; [[H899]] and they shall not [[H3808]] sanctify [[H6942]] the people [[H5971]] with their garments. [[H899]]

### 20
Neither [[H3808]] shall they shave [[H1548]] their heads, [[H7218]] nor [[H3808]] suffer their locks [[H6545]] to grow long; [[H7971]] they shall only [[H3697]] poll [[H3697]] their heads. [[H7218]]

### 21
Neither [[H3808]] shall any [[H3605]] priest [[H3548]] drink [[H8354]] wine, [[H3196]] when they enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court. [[H2691]]

### 22
Neither [[H3808]] shall they take [[H3947]] for their wives [[H802]] a widow, [[H490]] nor her that is put away: [[H1644]] but [[H3588]] they shall take [[H3947]] maidens [[H1330]] of the seed [[H2233]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] or a widow [[H490]] that [[H834]] had [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] before. [[H3548]]

### 23
And they shall teach [[H3384]] my people [[H5971]] between [[H996]] the holy [[H6944]] and profane, [[H2455]] and cause them to discern [[H3045]] between [[H996]] the unclean [[H2931]] and the clean. [[H2889]]

### 24
And in [[H5921]] controversy [[H7379]] they [[H1992]] shall stand [[H5975]] in judgment; [[H8199]] they shall judge [[H8199]] it according to my judgments: [[H4941]] and they shall keep [[H8104]] my laws [[H8451]] and my statutes [[H2708]] in all [[H3605]] mine assemblies; [[H4150]] and they shall hallow [[H6942]] my sabbaths. [[H7676]]

### 25
And they shall come [[H935]] at [[H413]] no [[H3808]] dead [[H4191]] person [[H120]] to defile [[H2930]] themselves: but [[H3588]] for father, [[H1]] or for mother, [[H517]] or for son, [[H1121]] or for daughter, [[H1323]] for brother, [[H251]] or for sister [[H269]] that [[H834]] hath had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] husband, [[H376]] they may defile [[H2930]] themselves. [[H2930]]

### 26
And after [[H310]] he is cleansed, [[H2893]] they shall reckon [[H5608]] unto him seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]

### 27
And in the day [[H3117]] that he goeth [[H935]] into [[H413]] the sanctuary, [[H6944]] unto [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] to minister [[H8334]] in the sanctuary, [[H6944]] he shall offer [[H7126]] his sin offering, [[H2403]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 28
And it shall be [[H1961]] unto them for an inheritance: [[H5159]] I [[H589]] their inheritance: [[H5159]] and ye shall give [[H5414]] them no [[H3808]] possession [[H272]] in Israel: [[H3478]] I [[H589]] their possession. [[H272]]

### 29
They [[H1992]] shall eat [[H398]] the meat offering, [[H4503]] and the sin offering, [[H2403]] and the trespass offering; [[H817]] and every [[H3605]] dedicated thing [[H2764]] in Israel [[H3478]] shall be [[H1961]] theirs. [[H1961]]

### 30
And the first [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] the firstfruits [[H1061]] of all [[H3605]] and every [[H3605]] oblation [[H8641]] of all, [[H3605]] of every [[H3605]] of your oblations, [[H8641]] shall be [[H1961]] the priest's: [[H3548]] ye shall also give [[H5414]] unto the priest [[H3548]] the first [[H7225]] of your dough, [[H6182]] that he may cause the blessing [[H1293]] to rest [[H5117]] in [[H413]] thine house. [[H1004]]

### 31
The priests [[H3548]] shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of any thing [[H3605]] that is dead of itself, [[H5038]] or torn, [[H2966]] whether [[H4480]] it be fowl [[H5775]] or [[H4480]] beast. [[H929]]
