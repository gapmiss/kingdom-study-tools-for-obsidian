### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] thy face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] them, [[H413]]

### 3
And say, [[H559]] Ye mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] to the mountains, [[H2022]] and to the hills, [[H1389]] to the rivers, [[H650]] and to the valleys; [[H1516]] Behold, [[H2009]] I, I, [[H589]] will bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] you, and I will destroy [[H6]] your high places. [[H1116]]

### 4
And your altars [[H4196]] shall be desolate, [[H8074]] and your images [[H2553]] shall be broken: [[H7665]] and I will cast down [[H5307]] your slain [[H2491]] before [[H6440]] your idols. [[H1544]]

### 5
And I will lay [[H5414]] the dead carcases [[H6297]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] before [[H6440]] their idols; [[H1544]] and I will scatter [[H2219]] your bones [[H6106]] round about [[H5439]] your altars. [[H4196]]

### 6
In all [[H3605]] your dwellingplaces [[H4186]] the cities [[H5892]] shall be laid waste, [[H2717]] and the high places [[H1116]] shall be desolate; [[H3456]] that [[H4616]] your altars [[H4196]] may be laid waste [[H2717]] and made desolate, [[H816]] and your idols [[H1544]] may be broken [[H7665]] and cease, [[H7673]] and your images [[H2553]] may be cut down, [[H1438]] and your works [[H4639]] may be abolished. [[H4229]]

### 7
And the slain [[H2491]] shall fall [[H5307]] in the midst [[H8432]] of you, and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
Yet will I leave a remnant, [[H3498]] that ye may have [[H1961]] that shall escape [[H6412]] the sword [[H2719]] among the nations, [[H1471]] when ye shall be scattered [[H2219]] through the countries. [[H776]]

### 9
And they that escape [[H6412]] of you shall remember [[H2142]] me among the nations [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] they shall be carried captives, [[H7617]] because [[H834]] I am broken [[H7665]] with [[H854]] their whorish [[H2181]] heart, [[H3820]] which [[H834]] hath departed [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] me, and with [[H854]] their eyes, [[H5869]] which go a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] their idols: [[H1544]] and they shall lothe [[H6962]] themselves [[H6440]] for [[H413]] the evils [[H7451]] which [[H834]] they have committed [[H6213]] in all [[H3605]] their abominations. [[H8441]]

### 10
And they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I have not [[H3808]] said [[H1696]] in vain [[H2600]] that I would do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] unto them. [[H7451]]

### 11
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Smite [[H5221]] with thine hand, [[H3709]] and stamp [[H7554]] with thy foot, [[H7272]] and say, [[H559]] Alas [[H253]] for [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] abominations [[H8441]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel! [[H3478]] for [[H834]] they shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence. [[H1698]]

### 12
He that is far off [[H7350]] shall die [[H4191]] of the pestilence; [[H1698]] and he that is near [[H7138]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword; [[H2719]] and he that remaineth [[H7604]] and is besieged [[H5341]] shall die [[H4191]] by the famine: [[H7458]] thus will I accomplish [[H3615]] my fury [[H2534]] upon them. [[H2534]]

### 13
Then shall ye know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when their slain [[H2491]] shall be [[H1961]] among [[H8432]] their idols [[H1544]] round about [[H5439]] their altars, [[H4196]] upon [[H413]] every [[H3605]] high [[H7311]] hill, [[H1389]] in all [[H3605]] the tops [[H7218]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree, [[H6086]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] thick [[H5687]] oak, [[H424]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] they did offer [[H5414]] sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] to all [[H3605]] their idols. [[H1544]]

### 14
So will I stretch out [[H5186]] my hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] them, and make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] desolate, [[H8077]] yea, more desolate [[H4923]] than the wilderness [[H4057]] toward Diblath, [[H1689]] in all [[H3605]] their habitations: [[H4186]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord.
