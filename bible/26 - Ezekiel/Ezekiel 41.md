And the breadth [[H7341]] of the door [[H6607]] ten [[H6235]] cubits; [[H520]] and the sides [[H3802]] of the door [[H6607]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] on the one side, [[H6311]] and five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] on the other side: [[H6311]] and he measured [[H4058]] the length [[H753]] thereof, forty [[H705]] cubits: [[H520]] and the breadth, [[H7341]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 3
Then went [[H935]] he inward, [[H6441]] and measured [[H4058]] the post [[H352]] of the door, [[H6607]] two [[H8147]] cubits; [[H520]] and the door, [[H6607]] six [[H8337]] cubits; [[H520]] and the breadth [[H7341]] of the door, [[H6607]] seven [[H7651]] cubits. [[H520]]

After he measured [[H4058]] the wall [[H7023]] of the house, [[H1004]] six [[H8337]] cubits; [[H520]] and the breadth [[H7341]] of side chamber, [[H6763]] four [[H702]] cubits, [[H520]] round about [[H5439]] the house [[H1004]] on every side. [[H5439]]

### 6
And the side chambers [[H6763]] three, [[H7969]] one [[H6763]] over [[H413]] another, [[H6763]] and thirty [[H7970]] in order; [[H6471]] and they entered [[H935]] into the wall [[H7023]] which [[H834]] of the house [[H1004]] for the side chambers [[H6763]] round about, [[H5439]] that they might have [[H1961]] hold, [[H270]] but they had [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] hold [[H270]] in the wall [[H7023]] of the house. [[H1004]]

### 7
And an enlarging, [[H7337]] and a winding about [[H5437]] still upward [[H4605]] to the side chambers: [[H6763]] for [[H3588]] the winding about [[H4141]] of the house [[H1004]] went still upward [[H4605]] round about [[H5439]] the house: [[H1004]] therefore [[H5921]] the breadth [[H7341]] of the house [[H1004]] upward, [[H4605]] and so [[H3651]] increased [[H5927]] the lowest [[H8481]] to [[H5921]] the highest [[H5945]] by the midst. [[H8484]]

### 8
I saw [[H7200]] also the height [[H1363]] of the house [[H1004]] round [[H5439]] about: [[H5439]] the foundations [[H4328]] of the side chambers [[H6763]] a full [[H4393]] reed [[H7070]] of six [[H8337]] great [[H679]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 9
The thickness [[H7341]] of the wall, [[H7023]] which [[H834]] for the side chamber [[H6763]] without, [[H2351]] five [[H2568]] cubits: [[H520]] and which [[H834]] left [[H3240]] the place [[H1004]] of the side chambers [[H6763]] that [[H834]] within. [[H1004]]

### 10

### 11
And the doors [[H6607]] of the side chambers [[H6763]] toward left, [[H3240]] one [[H259]] door [[H6607]] toward [[H1870]] the north, [[H6828]] and another [[H259]] door [[H6607]] toward the south: [[H1864]] and the breadth [[H7341]] of the place [[H4725]] that was left [[H3240]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 12
Now the building [[H1146]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the separate place [[H1508]] at the end [[H6285]] toward [[H1870]] the west [[H3220]] seventy [[H7657]] cubits [[H520]] broad; [[H7341]] and the wall [[H7023]] of the building [[H1146]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] thick [[H7341]] round about, [[H5439]] and the length [[H753]] thereof ninety [[H8673]] cubits.

So he measured [[H4058]] the house, [[H1004]] an hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long; [[H753]] and the separate place, [[H1508]] and the building, [[H1140]] with the walls [[H7023]] thereof, an hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long; [[H753]]

### 15
And he measured [[H4058]] the length [[H753]] of the building [[H1146]] over against [[H6440]] the separate place [[H1508]] which [[H834]] behind [[H310]] it, and the galleries [[H862]] thereof on the one side [[H6311]] and on the other side, [[H6311]] an hundred [[H3967]] cubits, [[H520]] with the inner [[H6442]] temple, [[H1964]] and the porches [[H197]] of the court; [[H2691]]

### 16
The door posts, [[H5592]] and the narrow [[H331]] windows, [[H2474]] and the galleries [[H862]] round about [[H5439]] on their three stories, [[H7969]] over against [[H5048]] the door, [[H5592]] cieled [[H7824]] with wood [[H6086]] round about, [[H5439]] and from the ground [[H776]] up to [[H5704]] the windows, [[H2474]] and the windows [[H2474]] covered; [[H3680]]

### 17
To [[H5921]] that above [[H5921]] the door, [[H6607]] even unto [[H5704]] the inner [[H6442]] house, [[H1004]] and without, [[H2351]] and by [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the wall [[H7023]] round about [[H5439]] within [[H6442]] and without, [[H2435]] by measure. [[H4060]]

### 18
And made [[H6213]] with cherubims [[H3742]] and palm trees, [[H8561]] so that a palm tree [[H8561]] between [[H996]] a cherub [[H3742]] and a cherub; [[H3742]] and cherub [[H3742]] had two [[H8147]] faces; [[H6440]]

So that the face [[H6440]] of a man [[H120]] toward [[H413]] the palm tree [[H8561]] on the one side, [[H6311]] and the face [[H6440]] of a young lion [[H3715]] toward [[H413]] the palm tree [[H8561]] on the other side: [[H6311]] made [[H6213]] through [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 20
From the ground [[H776]] unto [[H5704]] above [[H5921]] the door [[H6607]] cherubims [[H3742]] and palm trees [[H8561]] made, [[H6213]] and the wall [[H7023]] of the temple. [[H1964]]

### 21
The posts [[H4201]] of the temple [[H1964]] squared, [[H7251]] the face [[H6440]] of the sanctuary; [[H6944]] the appearance [[H4758]] as the appearance [[H4758]]

The altar [[H4196]] of wood [[H6086]] three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H1364]] and the length [[H753]] thereof two [[H8147]] cubits; [[H520]] and the corners [[H4740]] thereof, and the length [[H753]] thereof, and the walls [[H7023]] thereof, of wood: [[H6086]] and he said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me, This [[H2088]] the table [[H7979]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
And the temple [[H1964]] and the sanctuary [[H6944]] had two [[H8147]] doors. [[H1817]]

### 24
And the doors [[H1817]] had two [[H8147]] leaves [[H1817]] two [[H8147]] turning [[H4142]] leaves; [[H1817]] two [[H8147]] for the one [[H259]] door, [[H1817]] and two [[H8147]] leaves [[H1817]] for the other [[H312]]
