### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Israel [[H3478]] that prophesy, [[H5012]] and say [[H559]] thou unto them that prophesy [[H5030]] out of their own hearts, [[H3820]] Hear [[H8085]] ye the word [[H1697]] of the Lord; [[H3068]]

### 3
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Woe [[H1945]] unto [[H5921]] the foolish [[H5036]] prophets, [[H5030]] that [[H834]] follow [[H1980]] their own spirit, [[H7307]] and have seen [[H7200]] nothing! [[H7200]]

### 4
O Israel, [[H3478]] thy prophets [[H5030]] are [[H1961]] like the foxes [[H7776]] in the deserts. [[H2723]]

### 5
Ye have not [[H3808]] gone up [[H5927]] into the gaps, [[H6556]] neither made up [[H1443]] the hedge [[H1447]] for [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] to stand [[H5975]] in the battle [[H4421]] in the day [[H3117]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
They have seen [[H2372]] vanity [[H7723]] and lying [[H3577]] divination, [[H7081]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] saith: [[H5002]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] them: and they have made to hope [[H3176]] that they would confirm [[H6965]] the word. [[H1697]]

### 7
Have ye not [[H3808]] seen [[H2372]] a vain [[H7723]] vision, [[H4236]] and have ye not spoken [[H1696]] a lying [[H3577]] divination, [[H4738]] whereas ye say, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] saith [[H5002]] albeit I [[H589]] have not [[H3808]] spoken? [[H1696]]

### 8
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] ye have spoken [[H1696]] vanity, [[H7723]] and seen [[H2372]] lies, [[H3577]] therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 9
And mine hand [[H3027]] shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] the prophets [[H5030]] that see [[H2374]] vanity, [[H7723]] and that divine [[H7080]] lies: [[H3577]] they shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] in the assembly [[H5475]] of my people, [[H5971]] neither [[H3808]] shall they be written [[H3789]] in the writing [[H3791]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] neither [[H3808]] shall they enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]

### 10
Because, [[H3282]] even because [[H3282]] they have seduced [[H2937]] my people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Peace; [[H7965]] and no [[H369]] peace; [[H7965]] and one [[H1931]] built up [[H1129]] a wall, [[H2434]] and, lo, [[H2009]] others daubed [[H2902]] it with untempered [[H8602]]

### 11
Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them which daub [[H2902]] with untempered [[H8602]] that it shall fall: [[H5307]] there shall be [[H1961]] an overflowing [[H7857]] shower; [[H1653]] and ye, [[H859]] O great hailstones, [[H417]] shall fall; [[H5307]] and a stormy [[H5591]] wind [[H7307]] shall rend [[H1234]]

### 12
Lo, [[H2009]] when the wall [[H7023]] is fallen, [[H5307]] shall it not [[H3808]] be said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, Where [[H346]] the daubing [[H2915]] wherewith [[H834]] ye have daubed [[H2902]]

### 13
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I will even rend [[H1234]] with a stormy [[H5591]] wind [[H7307]] in my fury; [[H2534]] and there shall be [[H1961]] an overflowing [[H7857]] shower [[H1653]] in mine anger, [[H639]] and great hailstones [[H417]] in fury [[H2534]] to consume [[H3617]]

### 14
So will I break down [[H2040]] the wall [[H7023]] that [[H834]] ye have daubed [[H2902]] with untempered [[H8602]] and bring [[H5060]] it down to [[H413]] the ground, [[H776]] so that the foundation [[H3247]] thereof shall be discovered, [[H1540]] and it shall fall, [[H5307]] and ye shall be consumed [[H3615]] in the midst [[H8432]] thereof: and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
Thus will I accomplish [[H3615]] my wrath [[H2534]] upon the wall, [[H7023]] and upon them that have daubed [[H2902]] it with untempered [[H8602]] and will say [[H559]] unto you, The wall [[H7023]] no [[H369]] neither [[H369]] they that daubed [[H2902]] it; [[H2902]]

### 16
the prophets [[H5030]] of Israel [[H3478]] which prophesy [[H5012]] concerning [[H413]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and which see [[H2374]] visions [[H2377]] of peace [[H7965]] for her, and no [[H369]] peace, [[H7965]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 17
Likewise, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] thy face [[H6440]] against [[H413]] the daughters [[H1323]] of thy people, [[H5971]] which prophesy [[H5012]] out of their own heart; [[H3820]] and prophesy [[H5012]] thou against [[H5921]] them, [[H5921]]

### 18
And say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Woe [[H1945]] to the that sew [[H8609]] pillows [[H3704]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] armholes, [[H679]] and make [[H6213]] kerchiefs [[H4555]] upon [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] stature [[H6967]] to hunt [[H6679]] souls! [[H5315]] Will ye hunt [[H6679]] the souls [[H5315]] of my people, [[H5971]] and will ye save [[H2421]] the souls [[H5315]] alive [[H2421]] unto you? [[H2421]]

### 19
And will ye pollute [[H2490]] me among [[H413]] my people [[H5971]] for handfuls [[H8168]] of barley [[H8184]] and for pieces [[H6595]] of bread, [[H3899]] to slay [[H4191]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] should not [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] and to save [[H2421]] the souls [[H5315]] alive that [[H834]] should not [[H3808]] live, [[H2421]] by your lying [[H3576]] to my people [[H5971]] that hear [[H8085]] lies? [[H3577]]

### 20
Wherefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] your pillows, [[H3704]] wherewith [[H834]] ye [[H859]] there [[H8033]] hunt [[H6679]] the souls [[H5315]] to make fly, [[H6524]] and I will tear [[H7167]] them from [[H5921]] your arms, [[H2220]] and will let the souls [[H5315]] go, [[H7971]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] ye [[H859]] hunt [[H6679]] to make fly. [[H6524]]

### 21
Your kerchiefs [[H4555]] also will I tear, [[H7167]] and deliver [[H5337]] my people [[H5971]] out of your hand, [[H3027]] and they shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] in your hand [[H3027]] to be hunted; [[H4686]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
Because [[H3282]] with lies [[H8267]] ye have made the heart [[H3820]] of the righteous [[H6662]] sad, [[H3512]] whom I [[H589]] have not [[H3808]] made sad; [[H3510]] and strengthened [[H2388]] the hands [[H3027]] of the wicked, [[H7451]] that he should not [[H1115]] return [[H7725]] from his wicked [[H7563]] way, [[H1870]] by promising him life: [[H2421]]

### 23
Therefore [[H3651]] ye shall see [[H2372]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] vanity, [[H7723]] nor [[H3808]] divine [[H7080]] divinations: [[H7081]] for I will deliver [[H5337]] my people [[H5971]] out of your hand: [[H3027]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
