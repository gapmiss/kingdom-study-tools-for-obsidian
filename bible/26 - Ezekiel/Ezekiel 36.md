### 1
Also, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] unto [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say, [[H559]] Ye mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] the enemy [[H341]] hath said [[H559]] against [[H5921]] you, Aha, [[H1889]] even the ancient [[H5769]] high places [[H1116]] are [[H1961]] ours in possession: [[H4181]]

### 3
Therefore [[H3651]] prophesy [[H5012]] and say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] they have made desolate, [[H8074]] and swallowed you up [[H7602]] on every side, [[H5439]] that ye might be [[H1961]] a possession [[H4181]] unto the residue [[H7611]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] and ye are taken up [[H5927]] in [[H5921]] the lips [[H8193]] of talkers, [[H3956]] and an infamy [[H1681]] of the people: [[H5971]]

### 4
Therefore, [[H3651]] ye mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3068]] to the mountains, [[H2022]] and to the hills, [[H1389]] to the rivers, [[H650]] and to the valleys, [[H1516]] to the desolate [[H8074]] wastes, [[H2723]] and to the cities [[H5892]] that are forsaken, [[H5800]] which [[H834]] became [[H1961]] a prey [[H957]] and derision [[H3933]] to the residue [[H7611]] of the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] round about; [[H5439]]

### 5
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Surely [[H518]] in the fire [[H784]] of my jealousy [[H7068]] have I spoken [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] the residue [[H7611]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Idumea, [[H123]] which [[H834]] have appointed [[H5414]] my land [[H776]] into their possession [[H4181]] with the joy [[H8057]] of all [[H3605]] heart, [[H3824]] with despiteful [[H7589]] minds, [[H5315]] to [[H4616]] cast it out [[H4054]] for a prey. [[H957]]

### 6
Prophesy [[H5012]] therefore [[H3651]] concerning [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto the mountains, [[H2022]] and to the hills, [[H1389]] to the rivers, [[H650]] and to the valleys, [[H1516]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I have spoken [[H1696]] in my jealousy [[H7068]] and in my fury, [[H2534]] because [[H3282]] ye have borne [[H5375]] the shame [[H3639]] of the heathen: [[H1471]]

### 7
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I [[H589]] have lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand, [[H3027]] Surely [[H518]] the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] about [[H5439]] you, they [[H1992]] shall bear [[H5375]] their shame. [[H3639]]

### 8
But ye, [[H859]] O mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] ye shall shoot forth [[H5414]] your branches, [[H6057]] and yield [[H5375]] your fruit [[H6529]] to my people [[H5971]] of Israel; [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] they are at hand [[H7126]] to come. [[H935]]

### 9
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I for [[H413]] you, and I will turn [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] you, and ye shall be tilled [[H5647]] and sown: [[H2232]]

### 10
And I will multiply [[H7235]] men [[H120]] upon [[H5921]] you, all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] of it: and the cities [[H5892]] shall be inhabited, [[H3427]] and the wastes [[H2723]] shall be builded: [[H1129]]

### 11
And I will multiply [[H7235]] upon [[H5921]] you man [[H120]] and beast; [[H929]] and they shall increase [[H7235]] and bring fruit: [[H6509]] and I will settle [[H3427]] you after your old estates, [[H6927]] and will do better [[H2895]] than at your beginnings: [[H7221]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
Yea, I will cause men [[H120]] to walk [[H1980]] upon [[H5921]]  you, [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] Israel; [[H3478]] and they shall possess [[H3423]] thee, and thou shalt be [[H1961]] their inheritance, [[H5159]] and thou shalt no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] henceforth [[H5750]] bereave [[H7921]] them [[H7921]]

### 13
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] they say [[H559]] unto you, Thou [[H859]] devourest up [[H398]] men, [[H120]] and hast bereaved [[H7921]] thy nations; [[H1471]]

### 14
Therefore [[H3651]] thou shalt devour [[H398]] men [[H120]] no [[H3808]] more, [[H5750]] neither [[H3808]] bereave [[H3782]] thy nations [[H1471]] any more, [[H5750]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 15
Neither [[H3808]] will I cause to hear [[H8085]] in [[H413]] thee the shame [[H3639]] of the heathen [[H1471]] any more, [[H5750]] neither [[H3808]] shalt thou bear [[H5375]] the reproach [[H2781]] of the people [[H5971]] any more, [[H5750]] neither [[H3808]] shalt thou cause thy nations [[H1471]] to fall [[H3782]] any more, [[H5750]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 16
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 17
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] when the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] dwelt [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] their own land, [[H127]] they defiled [[H2930]] it by their own way [[H1870]] and by their doings: [[H5949]] their way [[H1870]] was [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] me as the uncleanness [[H2932]] of a removed woman. [[H5079]]

### 18
Wherefore I poured [[H8210]] my fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] them for [[H5921]] the blood [[H1818]] that [[H834]] they had shed [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]] and for their idols [[H1544]] they had polluted [[H2930]] it: [[H2930]]

### 19
And I scattered [[H6327]] them among the heathen, [[H1471]] and they were dispersed [[H2219]] through the countries: [[H776]] according to their way [[H1870]] and according to their doings [[H5949]] I judged [[H8199]] them. [[H8199]]

### 20
And when they entered [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the heathen, [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] they went, [[H935]] they profaned [[H2490]] my holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] when they said [[H559]] to them, These [[H428]] the people [[H5971]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and are gone forth [[H3318]] out of his land. [[H776]]

### 21
But I had pity [[H2550]] for [[H5921]] mine holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] which [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] had profaned [[H2490]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] they went. [[H935]]

### 22
Therefore [[H3651]] say [[H559]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I [[H589]] do [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] for your sakes, [[H4616]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] but [[H3588]] for mine holy [[H6944]] name's [[H8034]] sake, which [[H834]] ye have profaned [[H2490]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] ye went. [[H935]]

### 23
And I will sanctify [[H6942]] my great [[H1419]] name, [[H8034]] which was profaned [[H2490]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] which [[H834]] ye have profaned [[H2490]] in the midst [[H8432]] of them; and the heathen [[H1471]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] when I shall be sanctified [[H6942]] in you before their eyes. [[H5869]]

### 24
For I will take [[H3947]] you from among [[H4480]] the heathen, [[H1471]] and gather [[H6908]] you out of all [[H3605]] countries, [[H776]] and will bring [[H935]] you into [[H413]] your own land. [[H127]]

### 25
Then will I sprinkle [[H2236]] clean [[H2889]] water [[H4325]] upon [[H5921]] you, and ye shall be clean: [[H2891]] from all [[H3605]] your filthiness, [[H2932]] and from all [[H3605]] your idols, [[H1544]] will I cleanse [[H2891]] you. [[H2891]]

### 26
A new [[H2319]] heart [[H3820]] also will I give [[H5414]] you, and a new [[H2319]] spirit [[H7307]] will I put [[H5414]] within [[H7130]] you: and I will take away [[H5493]] the stony [[H68]] heart [[H3820]] out of your flesh, [[H1320]] and I will give [[H5414]] you an heart [[H3820]] of flesh. [[H1320]]

### 27
And I will put [[H5414]] my spirit [[H7307]] within [[H7130]] you, and cause [[H6213]] you to walk [[H1980]] in [[H853]] my statutes, [[H2706]] and ye shall keep [[H8104]] my judgments, [[H4941]] and do [[H6213]]

### 28
And ye shall dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to your fathers; [[H1]] and ye shall be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] your God. [[H430]]

### 29
I will also save [[H3467]] you from all [[H3605]] your uncleannesses: [[H2932]] and I will call [[H7121]] for [[H413]] the corn, [[H1715]] and will increase [[H7235]] it, and lay [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] famine [[H7458]] upon [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 30
And I will multiply [[H7235]] the fruit [[H6529]] of the tree, [[H6086]] and the increase [[H8570]] of the field, [[H7704]] that [[H4616]] ye shall receive [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] reproach [[H2781]] of famine [[H7458]] among the heathen. [[H1471]]

### 31
Then shall ye remember [[H2142]] your own evil [[H7451]] ways, [[H1870]] and your doings [[H4611]] that [[H834]] not [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] and shall lothe yourselves [[H6962]] in your own sight [[H6440]] for [[H5921]] your iniquities [[H5771]] and for [[H5921]] your abominations. [[H8441]]

### 32
Not [[H3808]] for your sakes [[H4616]] do [[H6213]] I [[H589]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] be it known [[H3045]] unto you: be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded [[H3637]] for your own ways, [[H1870]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 33
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] In the day [[H3117]] that I shall have cleansed [[H2891]] you from all [[H3605]] your iniquities [[H5771]] I will also cause to dwell [[H3427]] in the cities, [[H5892]] and the wastes [[H2723]] shall be builded. [[H1129]]

### 34
And the desolate [[H8074]] land [[H776]] shall be tilled, [[H5647]] whereas [[H8478]] it lay [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] that passed by. [[H5674]]

### 35
And they shall say, [[H559]] This [[H1977]] land [[H776]] that was desolate [[H8074]] is become [[H1961]] like the garden [[H1588]] of Eden; [[H5731]] and the waste [[H2720]] and desolate [[H8074]] and ruined [[H2040]] cities [[H5892]] fenced, [[H1219]] are inhabited. [[H3427]]

### 36
Then the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] are left [[H7604]] round about [[H5439]] you shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] build [[H1129]] the ruined [[H2040]] plant [[H5193]] that that was desolate: [[H8074]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]] and I will do [[H6213]]

### 37
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I will yet [[H5750]] this [[H2063]] be inquired of [[H1875]] by the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to do [[H6213]] for them; I will increase [[H7235]] them with men [[H120]] like a flock. [[H6629]]

### 38
As the holy [[H6944]] flock, [[H6629]] as the flock [[H6629]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] in her solemn feasts; [[H4150]] so [[H3651]] shall the waste [[H2720]] cities [[H5892]] be [[H1961]] filled [[H4392]] with flocks [[H6629]] of men: [[H120]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
