### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] put forth [[H2330]] a riddle, [[H2420]] and speak [[H4911]] a parable [[H4912]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]]

### 3
And say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] A great [[H1419]] eagle [[H5404]] with great [[H1419]] wings, [[H3671]] longwinged, [[H83]] full [[H4392]] of feathers, [[H5133]] which [[H834]] had divers colours, [[H7553]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Lebanon, [[H3844]] and took [[H3947]] the highest branch [[H6788]] of the cedar: [[H730]]

### 4
He cropped off [[H6998]] the top [[H7218]] of his young twigs, [[H3242]] and carried [[H935]] it into [[H413]] a land [[H776]] of traffick; [[H3667]] he set [[H7760]] it in a city [[H5892]] of merchants. [[H7402]]

### 5
He took [[H3947]] also of the seed [[H2233]] of the land, [[H776]] and planted [[H5414]] it in a fruitful [[H2233]] field; [[H7704]] he placed [[H3947]] by [[H5921]] great [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] set [[H7760]] it a willow tree. [[H6851]]

### 6
And it grew, [[H6779]] and became [[H1961]] a spreading [[H5628]] vine [[H1612]] of low [[H8217]] stature, [[H6967]] whose branches [[H1808]] turned [[H6437]] toward [[H413]] him, and the roots [[H8328]] thereof were [[H1961]] under [[H8478]] him: so it became [[H1961]] a vine, [[H1612]] and brought forth [[H6213]] branches, [[H905]] and shot forth [[H7971]] sprigs. [[H6288]]

### 7
There was [[H1961]] also another [[H259]] great [[H1419]] eagle [[H5404]] with great [[H1419]] wings [[H3671]] and many [[H7227]] feathers: [[H5133]] and, behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] vine [[H1612]] did bend [[H3719]] her roots [[H8328]] toward him, and shot forth [[H7971]] her branches [[H1808]] toward [[H5921]] him, that he might water [[H8248]] it by the furrows [[H6170]] of her plantation. [[H4302]]

### 8
It [[H1931]] was planted [[H8362]] in [[H413]] a good [[H2896]] soil [[H7704]] by [[H413]] great [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] that it might bring forth [[H6213]] branches, [[H6057]] and that it might bear [[H5375]] fruit, [[H6529]] that it might be [[H1961]] a goodly [[H155]] vine. [[H1612]]

### 9
Say [[H559]] thou, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Shall it prosper? [[H6743]] shall he not [[H3808]] pull up [[H5423]] the roots [[H8328]] thereof, and cut off [[H7082]] the fruit [[H6529]] thereof, that it wither? [[H3001]] it shall wither [[H3001]] in all [[H3605]] the leaves [[H2964]] of her spring, [[H6780]] even without [[H3808]] great [[H1419]] power [[H2220]] or many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] to pluck it up [[H5375]] by the roots [[H8328]] thereof. [[H8328]]

### 10
Yea, behold, [[H2009]] planted, [[H8362]] shall it prosper? [[H6743]] shall it not [[H3808]] utterly [[H3001]] wither, [[H3001]] when the east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] toucheth [[H5060]] it? it shall wither [[H3001]] in [[H5921]] the furrows [[H6170]] where it grew. [[H6780]]

### 11
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 12
Say [[H559]] now [[H4994]] to the rebellious [[H4805]] house, [[H1004]] Know [[H3045]] ye not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] these [[H428]] tell [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] is come [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and hath taken [[H3947]] the king [[H4428]] thereof, and the princes [[H8269]] thereof, and led [[H935]] them with [[H413]] him to Babylon; [[H894]]

### 13
And hath taken [[H3947]] of the king's [[H4410]] seed, [[H2233]] and made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] him, and hath taken [[H935]] an oath [[H423]] of him: he hath also taken [[H3947]] the mighty [[H352]] of the land: [[H776]]

### 14
That the kingdom [[H4467]] might be [[H1961]] base, [[H8217]] that it might not [[H1115]] lift itself up, [[H5375]] that by keeping [[H8104]] of his covenant [[H1285]] it might stand. [[H5975]]

### 15
But he rebelled [[H4775]] against him in sending [[H7971]] his ambassadors [[H4397]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] that they might give [[H5414]] him horses [[H5483]] and much [[H7227]] people. [[H5971]] Shall he prosper? [[H6743]] shall he escape [[H4422]] that doeth [[H6213]] such [[H428]] or shall he break [[H6565]] the covenant, [[H1285]] and be delivered? [[H4422]]

### 16
I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3068]] surely [[H518]] in the place [[H4725]] the king [[H4428]] that made him king, [[H4427]] whose [[H834]] oath [[H423]] he despised, [[H959]] and whose [[H834]] covenant [[H1285]] he brake, [[H6565]] with [[H854]] him in the midst [[H8432]] of Babylon [[H894]] he shall die. [[H4191]]

### 17
Neither [[H3808]] shall Pharaoh [[H6547]] with mighty [[H1419]] army [[H2428]] and great [[H7227]] company [[H6951]] make [[H6213]] for him in the war, [[H4421]] by casting up [[H8210]] mounts, [[H5550]] and building [[H1129]] forts, [[H1785]] to cut off [[H3772]] many [[H7227]] persons: [[H5315]]

### 18
Seeing he despised [[H959]] the oath [[H423]] by breaking [[H6565]] the covenant, [[H1285]] when, lo, [[H2009]] he had given [[H5414]] his hand, [[H3027]] and hath done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] he shall not [[H3808]] escape. [[H4422]]

### 19
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] surely [[H518]] mine oath [[H423]] that [[H834]] he hath despised, [[H959]] and my covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] he hath broken, [[H6331]] even it will I recompense [[H5414]] upon his own head. [[H7218]]

### 20
And I will spread [[H6566]] my net [[H7568]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he shall be taken [[H8610]] in my snare, [[H4686]] and I will bring [[H935]] him to Babylon, [[H894]] and will plead [[H8199]] with [[H854]] him there [[H8033]] for his trespass [[H4603]] that [[H834]] he hath trespassed [[H4604]] against me. [[H4604]]

### 21
And all [[H3605]] his fugitives [[H4015]] with all [[H3605]] his bands [[H102]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and they that remain [[H7604]] shall be scattered [[H6566]] toward all [[H3605]] winds: [[H7307]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]]

### 22
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I [[H589]] will also take [[H3947]] of the highest branch [[H6788]] of the high [[H7311]] cedar, [[H730]] and will set [[H5414]] I will crop off [[H6998]] from the top [[H7218]] of his young twigs [[H3127]] a tender one, [[H7390]] and will plant [[H8362]] upon [[H5921]] an high [[H1364]] mountain [[H2022]] and eminent: [[H8524]]

### 23
In the mountain [[H2022]] of the height [[H4791]] of Israel [[H3478]] will I plant [[H8362]] it: and it shall bring forth [[H5375]] boughs, [[H6057]] and bear [[H6213]] fruit, [[H6529]] and be [[H1961]] a goodly [[H117]] cedar: [[H730]] and under [[H8478]] it shall dwell [[H7931]] all [[H3605]] fowl [[H6833]] of every [[H3605]] wing; [[H3671]] in the shadow [[H6738]] of the branches [[H1808]] thereof shall they dwell. [[H7931]]

### 24
And all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have brought down [[H8213]] the high [[H1364]] tree, [[H6086]] have exalted [[H1361]] the low [[H8217]] tree, [[H6086]] have dried up [[H3001]] the green [[H3892]] tree, [[H6086]] and have made the dry [[H3002]] tree [[H6086]] to flourish: [[H6524]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]] and have done [[H6213]]
