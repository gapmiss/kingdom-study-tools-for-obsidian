### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] thy face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and drop [[H5197]] toward [[H413]] the holy places, [[H4720]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 3
And say [[H559]] to the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] thee, and will draw forth [[H3318]] my sword [[H2719]] out of his sheath, [[H8593]] and will cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] thee the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 4
Seeing then [[H3282]] that [[H834]] I will cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] thee the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked, [[H7563]] therefore [[H3651]] shall my sword [[H2719]] go forth [[H3318]] out of his sheath [[H8593]] against [[H413]] all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] from the south [[H5045]] to the north: [[H6828]]

### 5
That all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have drawn forth [[H3318]] my sword [[H2719]] out of his sheath: [[H8593]] it shall not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] any more. [[H7725]]

### 6
Sigh [[H584]] therefore, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] with the breaking [[H7670]] of loins; [[H4975]] and with bitterness [[H4814]] sigh [[H584]] before their eyes. [[H5869]]

### 7
And it shall be, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] they say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, Wherefore [[H5921]] sighest [[H584]] thou? [[H859]] that thou shalt answer, [[H559]] For [[H413]] the tidings; [[H8052]] because [[H3588]] it cometh: [[H935]] and every [[H3605]] heart [[H3820]] shall melt, [[H4549]] and all [[H3605]] hands [[H3027]] shall be feeble, [[H7503]] and every [[H3605]] spirit [[H7307]] shall faint, [[H3543]] and all [[H3605]] knees [[H1290]] shall be weak [[H1980]] water: [[H4325]] behold, [[H2009]] it cometh, [[H935]] and shall be brought to pass, [[H1961]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 8
Again the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 9
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy, [[H5012]] and say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H136]] Say, [[H559]] A sword, [[H2719]] a sword [[H2719]] is sharpened, [[H2300]] and also [[H1571]] furbished: [[H4803]]

### 10
It is sharpened [[H2300]] to [[H4616]] make a sore [[H2874]] slaughter; [[H2873]] it is furbished [[H4803]] that [[H4616]] it may glitter: [[H1300]] should we then [[H176]] make mirth? [[H7797]] it contemneth [[H3988]] the rod [[H7626]] of my son, [[H1121]] every [[H3605]] tree. [[H6086]]

### 11
And he hath given [[H5414]] it to be furbished, [[H4803]] that it may be handled: [[H3709]] this [[H1931]] sword [[H2719]] is sharpened, [[H2300]] and it [[H1931]] is furbished, [[H4803]] to give [[H5414]] it into the hand [[H3027]] of the slayer. [[H2026]]

### 12
Cry [[H2199]] and howl, [[H3213]] son [[H1121]] of man: [[H120]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] upon my people, [[H5971]] it [[H1931]] upon all [[H3605]] the princes [[H5387]] of Israel: [[H3478]] terrors [[H4048]] by reason of [[H413]] the sword [[H2719]] shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H854]] my people: [[H5971]] smite [[H5606]] therefore [[H3651]] upon [[H413]] thigh. [[H3409]]

### 13
Because [[H3588]] a trial, [[H974]] and what [[H4100]] if [[H518]] contemn [[H3988]] even [[H1571]] the rod? [[H7626]] it shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 14
Thou [[H859]] therefore, son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy, [[H5012]] and smite [[H5221]] hands [[H3709]]  together, [[H3709]] and let the sword [[H2719]] be doubled [[H3717]] the third time, [[H7992]] the sword [[H2719]] of the slain: [[H2491]] it [[H1931]] the sword [[H2719]] of the great [[H1419]] slain, [[H2491]] which entereth into their privy chambers. [[H2314]]

### 15
I have set [[H5414]] the point [[H19]] of the sword [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their gates, [[H8179]] that [[H4616]] heart [[H3820]] may faint, [[H4127]] and ruins [[H4383]] be multiplied: [[H7235]] ah! [[H253]] made [[H6213]] bright, [[H1300]] wrapped up [[H4593]] for the slaughter. [[H2874]]

### 16
Go thee one way or other, [[H258]] on [[H7760]] the right hand, [[H3231]] on the left, [[H8041]] whithersoever [[H575]] thy face [[H6440]] set. [[H3259]]

### 17
I [[H589]] will also [[H1571]] smite [[H5221]] mine hands [[H3709]] together, [[H3709]] and I will cause my fury [[H2534]] to rest: [[H5117]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have said [[H1696]]

### 18
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me again, saying, [[H559]]

### 19
Also, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] appoint [[H7760]] thee two [[H8147]] ways, [[H1870]] that the sword [[H2719]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] may come: [[H935]] both twain [[H8147]] shall come forth [[H3318]] out of one [[H259]] land: [[H776]] and choose [[H1254]] thou a place, [[H3027]] choose [[H1254]] at the head [[H7218]] of the way [[H1870]] to the city. [[H5892]]

### 20
Appoint [[H7760]] a way, [[H1870]] that the sword [[H2719]] may come [[H935]] to [[H853]] Rabbath [[H7237]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and to [[H853]] Judah [[H3063]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] the defenced. [[H1219]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] stood [[H5975]] at [[H413]] the parting [[H517]] of the way, [[H1870]] at the head [[H7218]] of the two [[H8147]] ways, [[H1870]] to use [[H7080]] divination: [[H7081]] he made arrows [[H2671]] bright, [[H7043]] he consulted [[H7592]] with images, [[H8655]] he looked [[H7200]] in the liver. [[H3516]]

### 22
At his right hand [[H3225]] was [[H1961]] the divination [[H7081]] for Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to appoint [[H7760]] captains, [[H3733]] to open [[H6605]] the mouth [[H6310]] in the slaughter, [[H7524]] to lift up [[H7311]] the voice [[H6963]] with shouting, [[H8643]] to appoint [[H7760]] rams [[H3733]] against [[H5921]] the gates, [[H8179]] to cast [[H8210]] a mount, [[H5550]] to build [[H1129]] a fort. [[H1785]]

### 23
And it shall be [[H1961]] unto them as a false [[H7723]] divination [[H7080]] in their sight, [[H5869]] to them that have sworn [[H7650]] oaths: [[H7621]] but he [[H1931]] will call to remembrance [[H2142]] the iniquity, [[H5771]] that they may be taken. [[H8610]]

### 24
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] ye have made your iniquity [[H5771]] to be remembered, [[H2142]] in that your transgressions [[H6588]] are discovered, [[H1540]] so that in all [[H3605]] your doings [[H5949]] your sins [[H2403]] do appear; [[H7200]] because, [[H3282]] that ye are come to remembrance, [[H2142]] ye shall be taken [[H8610]] with the hand. [[H3709]]

### 25
And thou, [[H859]] profane [[H2491]] wicked [[H7563]] prince [[H5387]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whose [[H834]] day [[H3117]] is come, [[H935]] when [[H6256]] iniquity [[H5771]] an end, [[H7093]]

### 26
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Remove [[H5493]] the diadem, [[H4701]] and take off [[H7311]] the crown: [[H5850]] this [[H2063]] not [[H3808]] the same: [[H2063]] exalt [[H1361]] low, [[H8217]] and abase [[H8213]] high. [[H1364]]

### 27
I will [[H7760]] overturn, [[H5754]] overturn, [[H5754]] overturn, [[H5754]] it: and [[H1571]] it [[H2063]] shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] until [[H5704]] he come [[H935]] whose [[H834]] right [[H4941]] it is; and I will give it [[H5414]]

### 28
And thou, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] and say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] concerning [[H413]] the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and concerning [[H413]] their reproach; [[H2781]] even say [[H559]] thou, The sword, [[H2719]] the sword [[H2719]] drawn: [[H6605]] for the slaughter [[H2874]] furbished, [[H4803]] to consume [[H398]] because of [[H4616]] the glittering: [[H1300]]

### 29
Whiles they see [[H2372]] vanity [[H7723]] unto thee, whiles they divine [[H7080]] a lie [[H3577]] unto thee, to bring [[H5414]] thee upon [[H413]] the necks [[H6677]] of slain, [[H2491]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] whose [[H834]] day [[H3117]] is come, [[H935]] when [[H6256]] their iniquity [[H5771]] an end. [[H7093]]

### 30
Shall I cause to return [[H7725]] into [[H413]] his sheath? [[H8593]] I will judge [[H8199]] thee in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] thou wast created, [[H1254]] in the land [[H776]] of thy nativity. [[H4351]]

### 31
And I will pour out [[H8210]] mine indignation [[H2195]] upon [[H5921]] thee, I will blow [[H6315]] against [[H5921]] thee in the fire [[H784]] of my wrath, [[H5678]] and deliver [[H5414]] thee into the hand [[H3027]] of brutish [[H1197]] men, [[H376]] skilful [[H2796]] to destroy. [[H4889]]

### 32
Thou shalt be [[H1961]] for fuel [[H402]] to the fire; [[H784]] thy blood [[H1818]] shall be [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the land; [[H776]] thou shalt be no [[H3808]] remembered: [[H2142]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]]
