### 1
Afterward he brought me again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the house; [[H1004]] and, behold, [[H2009]] waters [[H4325]] issued out [[H3318]] from under [[H8478]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the house [[H1004]] eastward: [[H6921]] for [[H3588]] the forefront [[H6440]] of the house [[H1004]] the east, [[H6921]] and the waters [[H4325]] came down [[H3381]] from under [[H8478]] from the right [[H3233]] side [[H3802]] of the house, [[H1004]] at the south [[H5045]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

### 2
Then brought he me out [[H3318]] of the way [[H1870]] of the gate [[H8179]] northward, [[H6828]] and led me about [[H5437]] the way [[H1870]] without [[H2351]] unto [[H413]] the utter [[H2351]] gate [[H8179]] by the way [[H1870]] that looketh [[H6437]] eastward; [[H6921]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there ran out [[H6379]] waters [[H4325]] on [[H4480]] the right [[H3233]] side. [[H3802]]

### 3
And when the man [[H376]] that had the line [[H6957]] in his hand [[H3027]] went forth [[H3318]] eastward, [[H6921]] he measured [[H4058]] a thousand [[H505]] cubits, [[H520]] and he brought me through [[H5674]] the waters; [[H4325]] the waters [[H4325]] to the ankles. [[H657]]

### 4
Again he measured [[H4058]] a thousand, [[H505]] and brought [[H5674]] me through the waters; [[H4325]] the waters [[H4325]] to the knees. [[H1290]] Again he measured [[H4058]] a thousand, [[H505]] and brought me through; [[H5674]] the waters [[H4325]] to the loins. [[H4975]]

### 5
Afterward he measured [[H4058]] a thousand; [[H505]] a river [[H5158]] that [[H834]] I could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] pass over: [[H5674]] for [[H3588]] the waters [[H4325]] were risen, [[H1342]] waters [[H4325]] to swim in, [[H7813]] a river [[H5158]] that [[H834]] could not [[H3808]] be passed over. [[H5674]]

### 6
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] hast thou seen [[H7200]] Then he brought [[H1980]] me, and caused me to return [[H7725]] to the brink [[H8193]] of the river. [[H5158]]

### 7
Now when I had returned, [[H7725]] behold, [[H2009]] at [[H413]] the bank [[H8193]] of the river [[H5158]] very [[H3966]] many [[H7227]] trees [[H6086]] on the one side [[H2088]] and on the other. [[H2088]]

### 8
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, These [[H428]] waters [[H4325]] issue out [[H3318]] toward [[H413]] the east [[H6930]] country, [[H1552]] and go down [[H3381]] into [[H5921]] the desert, [[H6160]] and go into [[H935]] the sea: [[H3220]] brought forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the sea, [[H3220]] the waters [[H4325]] shall be healed. [[H7495]]

### 9
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] every [[H3605]] thing [[H5315]] that liveth, [[H2416]] which [[H834]] moveth, [[H8317]] whithersoever [[H413]] the rivers [[H5158]] shall come, [[H935]] shall live: [[H2421]] and there shall be [[H1961]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H7227]] multitude of fish, [[H1710]] because [[H3588]] these [[H428]] waters [[H4325]] shall come [[H935]] thither: [[H8033]] for they shall be healed; [[H7495]] and every thing [[H3605]] shall live [[H2425]] whither [[H834]] the river [[H5158]] cometh. [[H935]]

### 10
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] the fishers [[H1728]] shall stand [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] it from En-gedi [[H5872]] even unto [[H5704]] En-eglaim; [[H5882]] they shall be [[H1961]] a to spread forth [[H4894]] nets; [[H2764]] their fish [[H1710]] shall be [[H1961]] according to their kinds, [[H4327]] as the fish [[H1710]] of the great [[H1419]] sea, [[H3220]] exceeding [[H3966]] many. [[H7227]]

### 11
But the miry places [[H1207]] thereof and the marishes [[H1360]] thereof shall not [[H3808]] be healed; [[H7495]] they shall be given [[H5414]] to salt. [[H4417]]

### 12
And by [[H5921]] the river [[H5158]] upon [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] thereof, on this side [[H2088]] and on that side, [[H2088]] shall grow [[H5927]] all [[H3605]] trees [[H6086]] for meat, [[H3978]] whose leaf [[H5929]] shall not [[H3808]] fade, [[H5034]] neither [[H3808]] shall the fruit [[H6529]] thereof be consumed: [[H8552]] it shall bring forth new fruit [[H1069]] according to his months, [[H2320]] because [[H3588]] their waters [[H4325]] they [[H1992]] issued out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the sanctuary: [[H4720]] and the fruit [[H6529]] thereof shall be [[H1961]] for meat, [[H3978]] and the leaf [[H5929]] thereof for medicine. [[H8644]]

### 13
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] This [[H1454]] the border, [[H1366]] whereby [[H834]] ye shall inherit [[H5157]] the land [[H776]] according to the twelve [[H8147]] tribes [[H7626]] of Israel: [[H3478]] Joseph [[H3130]] portions. [[H2256]]

### 14
And ye shall inherit [[H5157]] it, one [[H376]] as well as another: [[H251]] the which [[H834]] I lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] to give [[H5414]] it unto your fathers: [[H1]] and this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] shall fall [[H5307]] unto you for inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 15
And this [[H2088]] the border [[H1366]] of the land [[H776]] toward the north [[H6828]] side, [[H6285]] from [[H4480]] the great [[H1419]] sea, [[H3220]] the way [[H1870]] of Hethlon, [[H2855]] as men go [[H935]] to Zedad; [[H6657]]

### 16
Hamath, [[H2574]] Berothah, [[H1268]] Sibraim, [[H5453]] which [[H834]] between [[H996]] the border [[H1366]] of Damascus [[H1834]] and the border [[H1366]] of Hamath; [[H2574]] Hazar-hatticon, [[H2694]] which [[H834]] by [[H413]] the coast [[H1366]] of Hauran. [[H2362]]

### 17
And the border [[H1366]] from [[H4480]] the sea [[H3220]] shall be [[H1961]] Hazar-enan, [[H2703]] the border [[H1366]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] and the north [[H6828]] northward, [[H6828]] and the border [[H1366]] of Hamath. [[H2574]] And the north [[H6828]] side. [[H6285]]

### 18
And the east [[H6921]] side [[H6285]] ye shall measure [[H4058]] from [[H996]] Hauran, [[H2362]] and from [[H996]] Damascus, [[H1834]] and from [[H996]] Gilead, [[H1568]] and from [[H996]] the land [[H776]] of Israel [[H3478]] Jordan, [[H3383]] from the border [[H1366]] unto [[H5921]] the east [[H6931]] sea. [[H3220]] And the east [[H6921]] side. [[H6285]]

### 19
And the south [[H5045]] side [[H6285]] southward, [[H8486]] from Tamar [[H8559]] to [[H5704]] the waters [[H4325]] of strife [[H4808]] Kadesh, [[H6946]] the river [[H5158]] to [[H413]] the great [[H1419]] sea. [[H3220]] And the south [[H8486]] side [[H6285]] southward. [[H5045]]

### 20
The west [[H3220]] side [[H6285]] also the great [[H1419]] sea [[H3220]] from the border, [[H1366]] till [[H5704]] a man come [[H935]] over against [[H5227]] Hamath. [[H2574]] This [[H2063]] the west [[H3220]] side. [[H6285]]

### 21
So shall ye divide [[H2505]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] unto you according to the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 22
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] ye shall divide [[H5307]]  it by lot [[H853]] for an inheritance [[H5159]] unto you, and to the strangers [[H1616]] that sojourn [[H1481]] among [[H8432]] you, which [[H834]] shall beget [[H3205]] children [[H1121]] among [[H8432]] you: and they shall be [[H1961]] unto you as born in the country [[H249]] among the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] they shall have [[H5307]] inheritance [[H5159]] with [[H854]] you among [[H8432]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 23
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] in what [[H834]] tribe [[H7626]] the stranger [[H1616]] sojourneth, [[H1481]] there [[H854]] shall ye give [[H5414]] his inheritance, [[H5159]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]
