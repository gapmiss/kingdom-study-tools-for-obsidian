### 1
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] thy face [[H6440]] against [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] it, [[H5921]]

### 3
And say [[H559]] unto it, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] O mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] I against [[H413]] thee, and I will stretch out [[H5186]] mine hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] thee, and I will make [[H5414]] thee most [[H4923]] desolate. [[H8077]]

### 4
I will lay [[H7760]] thy cities [[H5892]] waste, [[H2723]] and thou [[H859]] shalt be [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8077]] and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
Because [[H3282]] thou hast had [[H1961]] a perpetual [[H5769]] hatred, [[H342]] and hast shed [[H5064]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] by [[H5921]] the force [[H3027]] of the sword [[H2719]] in the time [[H6256]] of their calamity, [[H343]] in the time [[H6256]] iniquity [[H5771]] an end: [[H7093]]

### 6
Therefore, [[H3651]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3068]] I will prepare [[H6213]] thee unto blood, [[H1818]] and blood [[H1818]] shall pursue [[H7291]] thee: sith [[H518]] thou hast not [[H3808]] hated [[H8130]] blood, [[H1818]] even blood [[H1818]] shall pursue [[H7291]] thee. [[H7291]]

### 7
Thus will I make [[H5414]] mount [[H2022]] Seir [[H8165]] most [[H8077]] desolate, [[H8077]] and cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] it him that passeth out [[H5674]] and him that returneth. [[H7725]]

### 8
And I will fill [[H4390]] his mountains [[H2022]] with his slain [[H2491]] in thy hills, [[H1389]] and in thy valleys, [[H1516]] and in all [[H3605]] thy rivers, [[H650]] shall they fall [[H5307]] that are slain [[H2491]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 9
I will make [[H5414]] thee perpetual [[H5769]] desolations, [[H8077]] and thy cities [[H5892]] shall not [[H3808]] return: [[H3427]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
Because [[H3282]] thou hast said, [[H559]] These two [[H8147]] nations [[H1471]] and these two [[H8147]] countries [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] mine, and we will possess [[H3423]] it; whereas the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] there: [[H1961]]

### 11
Therefore, [[H3651]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] I will even do [[H6213]] according to thine anger, [[H639]] and according to thine envy [[H7068]] which [[H834]] thou hast used [[H6213]] out of thy hatred [[H8135]] against them; and I will make myself known [[H3045]] among them, when [[H834]] I have judged [[H8199]] thee. [[H8199]]

### 12
And thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I have heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] thy blasphemies [[H5007]] which [[H834]] thou hast spoken [[H559]] against [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] They are laid desolate, [[H8074]] they are given [[H5414]] us to consume. [[H402]]

### 13
Thus with your mouth [[H6310]] ye have boasted [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] me, and have multiplied [[H6280]] your words [[H1697]] against [[H5921]] me: I [[H589]] have heard [[H8085]]

### 14
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] When the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] rejoiceth, [[H8055]] I will make [[H6213]] thee desolate. [[H8077]]

### 15
As thou didst rejoice [[H8057]] at the inheritance [[H5159]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H5921]] it was desolate, [[H8074]] so [[H3651]] will I do [[H6213]] unto thee: thou shalt be [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8077]] O mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] and all [[H3605]] Idumea, [[H123]] all [[H3605]] of it: and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord.
