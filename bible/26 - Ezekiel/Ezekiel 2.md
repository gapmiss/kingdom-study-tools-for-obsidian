And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] stand [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] thy feet, [[H7272]] and I will speak [[H1696]] unto thee. [[H1696]]

### 2
And the spirit [[H7307]] entered [[H935]] into me when [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me, and set [[H5975]] me upon [[H5921]] my feet, [[H7272]] that I heard [[H8085]] him that spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 3
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] I [[H589]] send [[H7971]] thee [[H853]] to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to [[H413]] a rebellious [[H4775]] nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] hath rebelled [[H4775]] against me: they [[H1992]] and their fathers [[H1]] have transgressed [[H6586]] against me, unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day. [[H3117]]

### 4
For impudent [[H7186]] children [[H1121]] and stiffhearted. [[H2389]] I [[H589]] do send [[H7971]] thee unto [[H413]] them; and thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 5
And they, [[H1992]] whether [[H518]] they will hear, [[H8085]] or whether [[H518]] they will forbear, [[H2308]] (for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a rebellious [[H4805]] house,) [[H1004]] yet shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there hath been [[H1961]] a prophet [[H5030]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 6
And thou, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] be not afraid [[H3372]] of them, neither [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of their words, [[H1697]] though [[H3588]] briers [[H5621]] and thorns [[H5544]] with [[H854]] thee, and thou [[H859]] dost dwell [[H3427]] among [[H413]] scorpions: [[H6137]] be not afraid [[H3372]] of their words, [[H1697]] nor [[H408]] be dismayed [[H2865]] at their looks, [[H6440]] though [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]]

### 7
And thou shalt speak [[H1696]] my words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] them, whether [[H518]] they will hear, [[H8085]] or whether [[H518]] they will forbear: [[H2308]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] most rebellious. [[H4805]]

### 8
But thou, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] hear [[H8085]] what [[H834]] I [[H589]] say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee; Be not [[H1961]] thou rebellious [[H4805]] like that rebellious [[H4805]] house: [[H1004]] open [[H6475]] thy mouth, [[H6310]] and eat [[H398]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] give [[H5414]] thee. [[H413]]

### 9
And when I looked, [[H7200]] behold, [[H2009]] an hand [[H3027]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] me; and, lo, [[H2009]] a roll [[H4039]] of a book [[H5612]] therein; [[H5612]]

### 10
And he spread [[H6566]] it before [[H6440]] me; and it [[H1931]] written [[H3789]] within [[H6440]] and without: [[H268]] and written [[H3789]] therein [[H413]] lamentations, [[H7015]] and mourning, [[H1899]] and woe. [[H1958]]
