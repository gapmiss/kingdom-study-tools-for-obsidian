### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] again unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] say [[H559]] unto the prince [[H5057]] of Tyrus, [[H6865]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] thine heart [[H3820]] lifted up, [[H1361]] and thou hast said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] a God, [[H410]] I sit [[H3427]] the seat [[H4186]] of God, [[H430]] in the midst [[H3820]] of the seas; [[H3220]] yet thou [[H859]] a man, [[H120]] and not [[H3808]] God, [[H410]] though thou set [[H5414]] thine heart [[H3820]] as the heart [[H3820]] of God: [[H430]]

### 3
Behold, [[H2009]] thou [[H859]] wiser [[H2450]] than Daniel; [[H1840]] there is no [[H3808]] secret [[H5640]] that they can hide [[H6004]] from thee: [[H6004]]

### 4
With thy wisdom [[H2451]] and with thine understanding [[H8394]] thou hast gotten [[H6213]] thee riches, [[H2428]] and hast gotten [[H6213]] gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] into thy treasures: [[H214]]

### 5
By thy great [[H7230]] wisdom [[H2451]] by thy traffick [[H7404]] hast thou increased [[H7235]] thy riches, [[H2428]] and thine heart [[H3824]] is lifted up [[H1361]] because of thy riches: [[H2428]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] thou hast set [[H5414]] thine heart [[H3820]] as the heart [[H3824]] of God; [[H430]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2005]] therefore [[H3651]] I will bring [[H935]] strangers [[H2114]] upon [[H5921]] thee, the terrible [[H6184]] of the nations: [[H1471]] and they shall draw [[H7324]] their swords [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] the beauty [[H3308]] of thy wisdom, [[H2451]] and they shall defile [[H2490]] thy brightness. [[H3314]]

### 8
They shall bring thee down [[H3381]] to the pit, [[H7845]] and thou shalt die [[H4191]] the deaths [[H4463]] of slain [[H2491]] in the midst [[H3820]] of the seas. [[H3220]]

### 9
Wilt thou yet [[H559]] say [[H559]] before [[H6440]] him that slayeth [[H2026]] thee, I [[H589]] God? [[H430]] but thou [[H859]] a man, [[H120]] and no [[H3808]] God, [[H410]] in the hand [[H3027]] of him that slayeth [[H2490]] thee. [[H2490]]

### 10
Thou shalt die [[H4191]] the deaths [[H4194]] of the uncircumcised [[H6189]] by the hand [[H3027]] of strangers: [[H2114]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have spoken [[H1696]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 11
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 12
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take up [[H5375]] a lamentation [[H7015]] upon [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Tyrus, [[H6865]] and say [[H559]] unto him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Thou [[H859]] sealest up [[H2856]] the sum, [[H8508]] full [[H4392]] of wisdom, [[H2451]] and perfect [[H3632]] in beauty. [[H3308]]

### 13
Thou hast been [[H1961]] in Eden [[H5731]] the garden [[H1588]] of God; [[H430]] every [[H3605]] precious [[H3368]] stone [[H68]] thy covering, [[H4540]] the sardius, [[H124]] topaz, [[H6357]] and the diamond, [[H3095]] the beryl, [[H8658]] the onyx, [[H7718]] and the jasper, [[H3471]] the sapphire, [[H5601]] the emerald, [[H5306]] and the carbuncle, [[H1304]] and gold: [[H2091]] the workmanship [[H4399]] of thy tabrets [[H8596]] and of thy pipes [[H5345]] was prepared [[H3559]] in thee in the day [[H3117]] that thou wast created. [[H1254]]

### 14
Thou [[H859]] the anointed [[H4473]] cherub [[H3742]] that covereth; [[H5526]] and I have set [[H5414]] thee thou wast [[H1961]] upon the holy [[H6944]] mountain [[H2022]] of God; [[H430]] thou hast walked up and down [[H1980]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the stones [[H68]] of fire. [[H784]]

### 15
Thou [[H859]] perfect [[H8549]] in thy ways [[H1870]] from the day [[H3117]] that thou wast created, [[H1254]] till [[H5704]] iniquity [[H5766]] was found [[H4672]] in thee. [[H4672]]

### 16
By the multitude [[H7230]] of thy merchandise [[H7404]] they have filled [[H4390]] the midst [[H8432]] of thee with violence, [[H2555]] and thou hast sinned: [[H2398]] therefore I will cast thee as profane [[H2490]] out of the mountain [[H2022]] of God: [[H430]] and I will destroy [[H6]] thee, O covering [[H5526]] cherub, [[H3742]] from the midst [[H8432]] of the stones [[H68]] of fire. [[H784]]

### 17
Thine heart [[H3820]] was lifted up [[H1361]] because of thy beauty, [[H3308]] thou hast corrupted [[H7843]] thy wisdom [[H2451]] by reason of [[H5921]] thy brightness: [[H3314]] I will cast [[H7993]] thee to [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] I will lay [[H5414]] thee before [[H6440]] kings, [[H4428]] that they may behold [[H7200]] thee. [[H7200]]

### 18
Thou hast defiled [[H2490]] thy sanctuaries [[H4720]] by the multitude [[H7230]] of thine iniquities, [[H5771]] by the iniquity [[H5766]] of thy traffick; [[H7404]] therefore will I bring forth [[H3318]] a fire [[H784]] from the midst [[H8432]] of thee, it [[H1931]] shall devour [[H398]] thee, and I will bring [[H5414]] thee to ashes [[H665]] upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] them that behold [[H7200]] thee. [[H7200]]

### 19
All [[H3605]] they that know [[H3045]] thee among the people [[H5971]] shall be astonished [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] thee: thou shalt be [[H1961]] a terror, [[H1091]] and never [[H369]] thou any more. [[H5704]]

### 20
Again the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 21
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] thy face [[H6440]] against [[H413]] Zidon, [[H6721]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] it, [[H5921]]

### 22
And say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H5921]] thee, O Zidon; [[H6721]] and I will be glorified [[H3513]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee: and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I shall have executed [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] in her, and shall be sanctified [[H6942]] in her. [[H6942]]

### 23
For I will send [[H7971]] into her pestilence, [[H1698]] and blood [[H1818]] into her streets; [[H2351]] and the wounded [[H2491]] shall be judged [[H5307]] in the midst [[H8432]] of her by the sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] her on every side; [[H5439]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 24
And there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] a pricking [[H3992]] brier [[H5544]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] nor grieving [[H3510]] thorn [[H6975]] of all [[H3605]] round about [[H5439]] them, that despised [[H7590]] them; and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 25
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] When I shall have gathered [[H6908]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] from [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] among whom [[H834]] they are scattered, [[H6327]] and shall be sanctified [[H6942]] in them in the sight [[H5869]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] then shall they dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] their land [[H127]] that [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] to my servant [[H5650]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 26
And they shall dwell [[H3427]] safely [[H983]] therein, [[H5921]] and shall build [[H1129]] houses, [[H1004]] and plant [[H5193]] vineyards; [[H3754]] yea, they shall dwell [[H3427]] with confidence, [[H983]] when I have executed [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] upon all [[H3605]] those that despise [[H7590]] them round about [[H5439]] them; and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God.
