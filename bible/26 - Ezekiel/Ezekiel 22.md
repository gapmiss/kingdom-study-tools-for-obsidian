### 1
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Now, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] wilt thou judge, [[H8199]] wilt thou judge [[H8199]] the bloody [[H1818]] city? [[H5892]] yea, thou shalt shew [[H3045]]  her [[H853]] all [[H3605]] her abominations. [[H8441]]

### 3
Then say [[H559]] thou, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] The city [[H5892]] sheddeth [[H8210]] blood [[H1818]] in the midst [[H8432]] of it, that her time [[H6256]] may come, [[H935]] and maketh [[H6213]] idols [[H1544]] against [[H5921]] herself to defile [[H2930]] herself. [[H2930]]

### 4
Thou art become guilty [[H816]] in thy blood [[H1818]] that [[H834]] thou hast shed; [[H8210]] and hast defiled [[H2930]] thyself in thine idols [[H1544]] which [[H834]] thou hast made; [[H6213]] and thou hast caused thy days [[H3117]] to draw near, [[H7126]] and art come [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] thy years: [[H8141]] therefore [[H5921]] have I made [[H5414]] thee a reproach [[H2781]] unto the heathen, [[H1471]] and a mocking [[H7048]] to all [[H3605]] countries. [[H776]]

### 5
near, [[H7138]] and far [[H7350]] from [[H4480]] thee, shall mock [[H7046]] thee, infamous [[H2931]] much [[H7227]] vexed. [[H4103]]

### 6
Behold, [[H2009]] the princes [[H5387]] of Israel, [[H3478]] every one [[H376]] were [[H1961]] in thee to their power [[H2220]] to [[H4616]] shed [[H8210]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 7
In thee have they set light [[H7043]] by father [[H1]] and mother: [[H517]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee have they dealt [[H6213]] by oppression [[H6233]] with the stranger: [[H1616]] in thee have they vexed [[H3238]] the fatherless [[H3490]] and the widow. [[H490]]

### 8
Thou hast despised [[H959]] mine holy things, [[H6944]] and hast profaned [[H2490]] my sabbaths. [[H7676]]

### 9
In thee are [[H1961]] men [[H582]] that carry tales [[H7400]] to [[H4616]] shed [[H8210]] blood: [[H1818]] and in thee they eat [[H398]] upon [[H413]] the mountains: [[H2022]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee they commit [[H6213]] lewdness. [[H2154]]

### 10
In thee have they discovered [[H1540]] their fathers' [[H1]] nakedness: [[H6172]] in thee have they humbled [[H6031]] her that was set apart [[H5079]] for pollution. [[H2931]]

### 11
And one [[H376]] hath committed [[H6213]] abomination [[H8441]] with [[H854]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife; [[H802]] and another [[H376]] hath lewdly [[H2154]] defiled [[H2930]] his daughter in law; [[H3618]] and another [[H376]] in thee hath humbled [[H6031]] his sister, [[H269]] his father's [[H1]] daughter. [[H1323]]

### 12
In thee have they taken [[H3947]] gifts [[H7810]] to [[H4616]] shed [[H8210]] blood; [[H1818]] thou hast taken [[H3947]] usury [[H5392]] and increase, [[H8636]] and thou hast greedily gained [[H1214]] of thy neighbours [[H7453]] by extortion, [[H6233]] and hast forgotten [[H7911]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] therefore I have smitten [[H5221]] mine hand [[H3709]] at [[H413]] thy dishonest gain [[H1215]] which [[H834]] thou hast made, [[H6213]] and at [[H5921]] thy blood [[H1818]] which [[H834]] hath been [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee. [[H8432]]

### 14
Can thine heart [[H3820]] endure, [[H5975]] or [[H518]] can thine hands [[H3027]] be strong, [[H2388]] in the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] shall deal [[H6213]] with thee? I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]] and will do [[H6213]]

### 15
And I will scatter [[H6327]] thee among the heathen, [[H1471]] and disperse [[H2219]] thee in the countries, [[H776]] and will consume [[H8552]] thy filthiness [[H2932]] out of [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 16
And thou shalt take thine inheritance [[H2490]] in thyself in the sight [[H5869]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] is to me become [[H1961]] dross: [[H5509]] all [[H3605]] they brass, [[H5178]] and tin, [[H913]] and iron, [[H1270]] and lead, [[H5777]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the furnace; [[H3564]] they are [[H1961]] the dross [[H5509]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 19
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] ye are all [[H3605]] become [[H1961]] dross, [[H5509]] behold, [[H2005]] therefore [[H3651]] I will gather [[H6908]] you into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 20
they gather [[H6910]] silver, [[H3701]] and brass, [[H5178]] and iron, [[H1270]] and lead, [[H5777]] and tin, [[H913]] into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the furnace, [[H3564]] to blow [[H5301]] the fire [[H784]] upon [[H5921]] it, to melt [[H5413]] so [[H3651]] will I gather [[H6908]] in mine anger [[H639]] and in my fury, [[H2534]] and I will leave [[H3240]] and melt [[H5413]] you. [[H5413]]

### 21
Yea, I will gather [[H3664]] you, and blow [[H5301]] upon [[H5921]] you in the fire [[H784]] of my wrath, [[H5678]] and ye shall be melted [[H5413]] in the midst [[H8432]] thereof. [[H8432]]

### 22
As silver [[H3701]] is melted [[H2046]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the furnace, [[H3564]] so [[H3651]] shall ye be melted [[H5413]] in the midst [[H8432]] thereof; and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have poured out [[H8210]] my fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 23
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 24
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] say [[H559]] unto her, Thou [[H859]] the land [[H776]] that [[H1931]] is not [[H3808]] cleansed, [[H2891]] nor [[H3808]] rained upon [[H1656]] in the day [[H3117]] of indignation. [[H2195]]

### 25
a conspiracy [[H7195]] of her prophets [[H5030]] in the midst [[H8432]] thereof, like a roaring [[H7580]] lion [[H738]] ravening [[H2963]] the prey; [[H2964]] they have devoured [[H398]] souls; [[H5315]] they have taken [[H3947]] the treasure [[H2633]] and precious things; [[H3366]] they have made her many [[H7235]] widows [[H490]] in the midst [[H8432]] thereof. [[H8432]]

### 26
Her priests [[H3548]] have violated [[H2554]] my law, [[H8451]] and have profaned [[H2490]] mine holy things: [[H6944]] they have put no difference [[H914]] between [[H996]] the holy [[H6944]] and profane, [[H2455]] neither [[H3808]] have they shewed [[H3045]] between [[H996]] the unclean [[H2931]] and the clean, [[H2889]] and have hid [[H5956]] their eyes [[H5869]] from my sabbaths, [[H7676]] and I am profaned [[H2490]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 27
Her princes [[H8269]] in the midst [[H7130]] thereof like wolves [[H2061]] ravening [[H2963]] the prey, [[H2964]] to shed [[H8210]] blood, [[H1818]] to destroy [[H6]] souls, [[H5315]] to [[H4616]] get [[H1214]] dishonest gain. [[H1215]]

### 28
And her prophets [[H5030]] have daubed [[H2902]] them with untempered [[H8602]] seeing [[H2374]] vanity, [[H7723]] and divining [[H7080]] lies [[H3577]] unto them, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] when the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] spoken. [[H1696]]

### 29
The people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] have used oppression, [[H6231]] and exercised [[H1497]] robbery, [[H1498]] and have vexed [[H3238]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy: [[H34]] yea, they have oppressed [[H6231]] the stranger [[H1616]] wrongfully. [[H4941]]

### 30
And I sought [[H1245]] for a man [[H376]] among them, that should make up [[H1443]] the hedge, [[H1447]] and stand [[H5975]] in the gap [[H6556]] before [[H6440]] me for [[H1157]] the land, [[H776]] that I should not [[H1115]] destroy [[H7843]] it: but I found [[H4672]] none. [[H4672]]

### 31
Therefore have I poured out [[H8210]] mine indignation [[H2195]] upon [[H5921]] them; I have consumed [[H3615]] them with the fire [[H784]] of my wrath: [[H5678]] their own way [[H1870]] have I recompensed [[H5414]] upon their heads, [[H7218]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]
