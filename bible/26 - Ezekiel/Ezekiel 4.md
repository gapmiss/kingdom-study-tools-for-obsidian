Thou [[H859]] also, son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take [[H3947]] thee a tile, [[H3843]] and lay [[H5414]] it before [[H6440]] thee, and pourtray [[H2710]] upon [[H5921]] it the city, [[H5892]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]]

[[H5439]]

Moreover take [[H3947]] thou [[H859]] unto thee an iron [[H1270]] pan, [[H4227]] and set [[H5414]] it a wall [[H7023]] of iron [[H1270]] between [[H996]] thee and the city: [[H5892]] and set [[H3559]] thy face [[H6440]] against [[H413]] it, and it shall be [[H1961]] besieged, [[H4692]] and thou shalt lay siege [[H6696]] against [[H5921]] it. This [[H1931]] a sign [[H226]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

For I [[H589]] have laid [[H5414]]  upon thee [[H853]] the years [[H8141]] of their iniquity, [[H5771]] according to the number [[H4557]] of the days, [[H3117]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] and ninety [[H8673]] days: [[H3117]] so shalt thou bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

And when thou hast accomplished [[H3615]] them, [[H428]] lie [[H7901]] again [[H8145]] on [[H5921]] thy right [[H3227]] side, [[H6654]] and thou shalt bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] forty [[H705]] days: [[H3117]] I have appointed [[H5414]] thee each day [[H3117]] for a year. [[H8141]]

Therefore thou shalt set [[H3559]] thy face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the siege [[H4692]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and thine arm [[H2220]] uncovered, [[H2834]] and thou shalt prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 8
And, behold, [[H2009]] I will lay [[H5414]] bands [[H5688]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and thou shalt not [[H3808]] turn [[H2015]] thee from one side [[H6654]] to [[H413]] another, [[H6654]] till [[H5704]] thou hast ended [[H3615]] the days [[H3117]] of thy siege. [[H4692]]

### 9
Take [[H3947]] thou [[H859]] also unto thee wheat, [[H2406]] and barley, [[H8184]] and beans, [[H6321]] and lentiles, [[H5742]] and millet, [[H1764]] and fitches, [[H3698]] and put [[H5414]] them in one [[H259]] vessel, [[H3627]] and make [[H6213]] thee bread [[H3899]] thereof, to the number [[H4557]] of the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] shalt lie [[H7901]] upon [[H5921]] thy side, [[H6654]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] and ninety [[H8673]] days [[H3117]] shalt thou eat [[H398]] thereof. [[H398]]

### 10
And thy meat [[H3978]] which [[H834]] thou shalt eat [[H398]] by weight, [[H4946]] twenty [[H6242]] shekels [[H8255]] a day: [[H3117]] from time [[H6256]] to [[H5704]] time [[H6256]] shalt thou eat [[H398]] it. [[H398]]

### 11
Thou shalt drink [[H8354]] also water [[H4325]] by measure, [[H4884]] the sixth part [[H8345]] of an hin: [[H1969]] from time [[H6256]] to [[H5704]] time [[H6256]] shalt thou drink. [[H8354]]

### 12
And thou shalt eat [[H398]] it barley [[H8184]] cakes, [[H5692]] and thou shalt bake [[H5746]] it [[H1931]] with dung [[H1561]] that cometh out [[H6627]] of man, [[H120]] in their sight. [[H5869]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Even thus [[H3602]] shall the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] eat [[H398]] their defiled [[H2931]] bread [[H3899]] among the Gentiles, [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] I will drive [[H5080]] them. [[H5080]]

### 14
Then said [[H559]] I, Ah [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] God! [[H3069]] behold, [[H2009]] my soul [[H5315]] hath not [[H3808]] been polluted: [[H2930]] for from my youth [[H5271]] up even till [[H5704]] now [[H6258]] have I not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] of that which dieth of itself, [[H5038]] or is torn in pieces; [[H2966]] neither [[H3808]] came [[H935]] there abominable [[H6292]] flesh [[H1320]] into my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 15
Then he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Lo, [[H7200]] I have given [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] cow's [[H1241]] dung [[H6832]] for [[H8478]] man's [[H120]] dung, [[H1561]] and thou shalt prepare [[H6213]] thy bread [[H3899]] therewith. [[H3899]]

### 16
Moreover he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] behold, [[H2005]] I will break [[H7665]] the staff [[H4294]] of bread [[H3899]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and they shall eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] by weight, [[H4948]] and with care; [[H1674]] and they shall drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] by measure, [[H4884]] and with astonishment: [[H8078]]

### 17
That [[H4616]] they may want [[H2637]] bread [[H3899]] and water, [[H4325]] and be astonied [[H8074]] one [[H376]] with another, [[H251]] and consume away [[H4743]] for their iniquity. [[H5771]]
