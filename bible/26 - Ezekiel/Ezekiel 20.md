### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the seventh [[H7637]] year, [[H8141]] in the fifth [[H2549]] the tenth [[H6218]] of the month, [[H2320]] certain [[H582]] of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to inquire [[H1875]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and sat [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] me. [[H6440]]

### 2
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 3
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] speak [[H1696]] unto the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Are ye [[H859]] come [[H935]] to inquire [[H1875]] of me? I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3068]] I will not [[H518]] be inquired [[H1875]] of by you. [[H1875]]

### 4
Wilt thou judge [[H8199]] them, son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] wilt thou judge [[H8199]] cause them to know [[H3045]] the abominations [[H8441]] of their fathers: [[H1]]

### 5
And say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] In the day [[H3117]] when I chose [[H977]] Israel, [[H3478]] and lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] unto the seed [[H2233]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and made myself known [[H3045]] unto them in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] when I lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] unto them, saying, [[H559]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]]

### 6
In the day [[H3117]] I lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] unto them, to bring them forth [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] into [[H413]] a land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I had espied [[H8446]] for them, flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] which [[H1931]] the glory [[H6643]] of all [[H3605]] lands: [[H776]]

### 7
Then said [[H559]] I unto [[H413]] them, Cast ye away [[H7993]] every man [[H376]] the abominations [[H8251]] of his eyes, [[H5869]] and defile [[H2930]]  not yourselves [[H408]] with the idols [[H1544]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 8
But they rebelled [[H4784]] against me, and would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me: they did not [[H3808]] every man [[H376]] cast away [[H7993]] the abominations [[H8251]] of their eyes, [[H5869]] neither [[H3808]] did they forsake [[H5800]] the idols [[H1544]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] then I said, [[H559]] I will pour out [[H8210]] my fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] them, to accomplish [[H3615]] my anger [[H639]] against them in the midst [[H8432]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
But I wrought [[H6213]] for my name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]] that it should not [[H1115]] be polluted [[H2490]] before [[H5869]] the heathen, [[H1471]] among [[H8432]] whom [[H834]] they [[H1992]] in whose [[H834]] sight [[H5869]] I made myself known [[H3045]] unto [[H413]] them, in bringing them forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 10
Wherefore I caused them to go forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and brought [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 11
And I gave [[H5414]]  them [[H853]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and shewed [[H3045]] them my judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] a man [[H120]] do, [[H6213]] he shall even live [[H2425]] in them. [[H2425]]

### 12
Moreover also [[H1571]] I gave [[H5414]]  them [[H853]] my sabbaths, [[H7676]] to be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] between [[H996]] me and them, that they might know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] that sanctify [[H6942]] them. [[H6942]]

### 13
But the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] rebelled [[H4784]] against me in the wilderness: [[H4057]] they walked [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] and they despised [[H3988]] my judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] a man [[H120]] do, [[H6213]] he shall even live [[H2425]] in them; and my sabbaths [[H7676]] they greatly [[H3966]] polluted: [[H2490]] then I said, [[H559]] I would pour out [[H8210]] my fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] them in the wilderness, [[H4057]] to consume [[H3615]] them. [[H3615]]

### 14
But I wrought [[H6213]] for my name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]] that it should not [[H1115]] be polluted [[H2490]] before [[H5869]] the heathen, [[H1471]] in whose [[H834]] sight [[H5869]] I brought them out. [[H3318]]

### 15
Yet also [[H1571]] I [[H589]] lifted up [[H5375]] my hand [[H3027]] unto them in the wilderness, [[H4057]] that I would not [[H1115]] bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I had given [[H5414]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] which [[H1931]] the glory [[H6643]] of all [[H3605]] lands; [[H776]]

### 16
Because [[H3282]] they despised [[H3988]] my judgments, [[H4941]] and walked [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] but polluted [[H2490]] my sabbaths: [[H7676]] for [[H3588]] their heart [[H3820]] went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] their idols. [[H1544]]

### 17
Nevertheless mine eye [[H5869]] spared [[H2347]] them from destroying [[H7843]] them, neither [[H3808]] did I make [[H6213]] an end [[H3617]] of them in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 18
But I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] their children [[H1121]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] Walk [[H1980]] ye not [[H408]] in the statutes [[H2706]] of your fathers, [[H1]] neither [[H408]] observe [[H8104]] their judgments, [[H4941]] nor [[H408]] defile yourselves [[H2930]] with their idols: [[H1544]]

### 19
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] walk [[H1980]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] and keep [[H8104]] my judgments, [[H4941]] and do [[H6213]] them; [[H6213]]

### 20
And hallow [[H6942]] my sabbaths; [[H7676]] and they shall be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] between [[H996]] me and you, that ye may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 21
Notwithstanding the children [[H1121]] rebelled [[H4784]] against me: they walked [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] neither [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] my judgments [[H4941]] to do [[H6213]] them, which [[H834]] a man [[H120]] do, [[H6213]] he shall even live [[H2425]] in them; they polluted [[H2490]] my sabbaths: [[H7676]] then I said, [[H559]] I would pour out [[H8210]] my fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] them, to accomplish [[H3615]] my anger [[H639]] against them in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 22
Nevertheless I withdrew [[H7725]] mine hand, [[H3027]] and wrought [[H6213]] for my name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]] that it should not [[H1115]] be polluted [[H2490]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] in whose [[H834]] sight [[H5869]] I brought them forth. [[H3318]]

### 23
I [[H589]] lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] unto them also [[H1571]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] that I would scatter [[H6327]] them among the heathen, [[H1471]] and disperse [[H2219]] them through the countries; [[H776]]

### 24
Because [[H3282]] they had not [[H3808]] executed [[H6213]] my judgments, [[H4941]] but had despised [[H3988]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and had polluted [[H2490]] my sabbaths, [[H7676]] and their eyes [[H5869]] were [[H1961]] after [[H310]] their fathers' [[H1]] idols. [[H1544]]

### 25
Wherefore I [[H589]] gave [[H5414]] them also [[H1571]] statutes [[H2706]] not [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] and judgments [[H4941]] whereby they should not [[H3808]] live; [[H2421]]

### 26
And I polluted [[H2930]] them in their own gifts, [[H4979]] in that they caused to pass through [[H5674]] all [[H3605]] that openeth [[H6363]] the womb, [[H7356]] that [[H4616]] I might make them desolate, [[H8074]] to the end [[H4616]] that [[H834]] they might know [[H3045]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
Therefore, [[H3651]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Yet [[H5750]] in this [[H2063]] your fathers [[H1]] have blasphemed [[H1442]] me, in that they have committed [[H4603]] a trespass [[H4604]] against me. [[H4604]]

### 28
when I had brought [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land, [[H776]] the which [[H834]] I lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] to give [[H5414]] it to them, then they saw [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] high [[H7311]] hill, [[H1389]] and all [[H3605]] the thick [[H5687]] trees, [[H6086]] and they offered [[H2076]] there [[H8033]] their sacrifices, [[H2077]] and there [[H8033]] they presented [[H5414]] the provocation [[H3708]] of their offering: [[H7133]] there [[H8033]] also they made [[H7760]] their sweet [[H5207]] savour, [[H7381]] and poured out [[H5258]] there [[H8033]] their drink offerings. [[H5262]]

### 29
Then I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, What [[H4100]] the high place [[H1116]] whereunto [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go? [[H935]] And the name [[H8034]] thereof is called [[H7121]] Bamah [[H1117]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 30
Wherefore [[H3651]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Are ye [[H859]] polluted [[H2930]] after the manner [[H1870]] of your fathers? [[H1]] and commit ye whoredom [[H2181]] after [[H310]] their abominations? [[H8251]]

### 31
For when ye offer [[H5375]] your gifts, [[H4979]] when ye make your sons [[H1121]] to pass through [[H5674]] the fire, [[H784]] ye [[H859]] pollute yourselves [[H2930]] with all [[H3605]] your idols, [[H1544]] even unto [[H5704]] this day: [[H3117]] and shall I [[H589]] be inquired of [[H1875]] by you, O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] I will not [[H518]] be inquired of [[H1875]] by you. [[H1875]]

### 32
And that which cometh [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] your mind [[H7307]] shall not [[H3808]] be at all, [[H1961]] that [[H834]] ye [[H859]] say, [[H559]] We will be [[H1961]] as the heathen, [[H1471]] as the families [[H4940]] of the countries, [[H776]] to serve [[H8334]] wood [[H6086]] and stone. [[H68]]

### 33
I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] surely [[H518]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and with a stretched out [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] and with fury [[H2534]] poured out, [[H8210]] will I rule [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] you: [[H5921]]

### 34
And I will bring you out [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] and will gather [[H6908]] you out of [[H4480]] the countries [[H776]] wherein [[H834]] ye are scattered, [[H6327]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and with a stretched out [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] and with fury [[H2534]] poured out. [[H8210]]

### 35
And I will bring [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the wilderness [[H4057]] of the people, [[H5971]] and there [[H8033]] will I plead [[H8199]] with [[H854]] you face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face. [[H6440]]

### 36
Like as [[H834]] I pleaded [[H8199]] with [[H854]] your fathers [[H1]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] so [[H3651]] will I plead [[H8199]] with [[H854]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 37
And I will cause you to pass [[H5674]] under [[H8478]] the rod, [[H7626]] and I will bring [[H935]] you into the bond [[H4562]] of the covenant: [[H1285]]

### 38
And I will purge out [[H1305]] from [[H4480]] among you the rebels, [[H4775]] and them that transgress [[H6586]] against me: I will bring them forth [[H3318]] out of the country [[H776]] where they sojourn, [[H4033]] and they shall not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 39
As for you, [[H859]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Go [[H1980]] ye, serve [[H5647]] ye every one [[H376]] his idols, [[H1544]] and hereafter [[H310]] if [[H518]] ye will not [[H369]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me: but pollute [[H2490]] ye my holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] with your gifts, [[H4979]] and with your idols. [[H1544]]

### 40
For [[H3588]] in mine holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] in the mountain [[H2022]] of the height [[H4791]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] there [[H8033]] shall all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] of them in the land, [[H776]] serve [[H5647]] me: there [[H8033]] will I accept [[H7521]] them, and there [[H8033]] will I require [[H1875]] your offerings, [[H8641]] and the firstfruits [[H7225]] of your oblations, [[H4864]] with all [[H3605]] your holy things. [[H6944]]

### 41
I will accept [[H7521]] you with your sweet [[H5207]] savour, [[H7381]] when I bring you out [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] and gather [[H6908]] you out of [[H4480]] the countries [[H776]] wherein [[H834]] ye have been scattered; [[H6327]] and I will be sanctified [[H6942]] in you before [[H5869]] the heathen. [[H1471]]

### 42
And ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I shall bring [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] into [[H413]] the country [[H776]] the which [[H834]] I lifted up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] to give [[H5414]] it to your fathers. [[H1]]

### 43
And there [[H8033]] shall ye remember [[H2142]] your ways, [[H1870]] and all [[H3605]] your doings, [[H5949]] wherein [[H834]] ye have been defiled; [[H2930]] and ye shall lothe yourselves [[H6962]] in your own sight [[H6440]] for all [[H3605]] your evils [[H7451]] that [[H834]] ye have committed. [[H6213]]

### 44
And ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I have wrought [[H6213]] with [[H854]] you for my name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]] not [[H3808]] according to your wicked [[H7451]] ways, [[H1870]] nor according to your corrupt [[H7843]] doings, [[H5949]] O ye house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 45
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 46
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] thy face [[H6440]] toward [[H1870]] the south, [[H8486]] and drop [[H5197]] toward [[H413]] the south, [[H1864]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] the forest [[H3293]] of the south [[H5045]] field; [[H7704]]

### 47
And say [[H559]] to the forest [[H3293]] of the south, [[H5045]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in thee, and it shall devour [[H398]] every [[H3605]] green [[H3892]] tree [[H6086]] in thee, and every [[H3605]] dry [[H3002]] tree: [[H6086]] the flaming [[H3852]] flame [[H7957]] shall not [[H3808]] be quenched, [[H3518]] and all [[H3605]] faces [[H6440]] from the south [[H5045]] to the north [[H6828]] shall be burned [[H6866]] therein. [[H6866]]

### 48
And all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] shall see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have kindled [[H1197]] it: it shall not [[H3808]] be quenched. [[H3518]]

### 49
Then said [[H559]] I, Ah [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] God! [[H3069]] they [[H1992]] say [[H559]] of me, Doth he [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] speak [[H4911]] parables? [[H4912]]
