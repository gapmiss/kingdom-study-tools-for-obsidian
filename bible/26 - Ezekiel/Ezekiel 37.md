### 1
The hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] me, and carried me out [[H3318]] in the spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and set me down [[H5117]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the valley [[H1237]] which [[H1931]] full [[H4392]] of bones, [[H6106]]

### 2
And caused me to pass [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] them round about: [[H5439]] and, behold, [[H2009]] very [[H3966]] many [[H7227]] in [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] valley; [[H1237]] and, lo, [[H2009]] very [[H3966]] dry. [[H3002]]

### 3
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] can these [[H428]] bones [[H6106]] live? [[H2421]] And I answered, [[H559]] O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] thou [[H859]] knowest. [[H3045]]

### 4
Again he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Prophesy [[H5012]] upon [[H5921]] these [[H428]] bones, [[H6106]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, O ye dry [[H3002]] bones, [[H6106]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] unto these [[H428]] bones; [[H6106]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] will cause breath [[H7307]] to enter [[H935]] into you, and ye shall live: [[H2421]]

### 6
And I will lay [[H5414]] sinews [[H1517]] upon [[H5921]] you, and will bring up [[H5927]] flesh [[H1320]] upon [[H5921]] you, and cover [[H7159]] you with skin, [[H5785]] and put [[H5414]] breath [[H7307]] in you, and ye shall live; [[H2421]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
So I prophesied [[H5012]] as [[H834]] I was commanded: [[H6680]] and as I prophesied, [[H5012]] there was [[H1961]] a noise, [[H6963]] and behold [[H2009]] a shaking, [[H7494]] and the bones [[H6106]] came together, [[H7126]] bone [[H6106]] to [[H413]] his bone. [[H6106]]

### 8
And when I beheld, [[H7200]] lo, [[H2009]] the sinews [[H1517]] and the flesh [[H1320]] came up [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] them, and the skin [[H5785]] covered [[H7159]] them above: [[H4605]] but no [[H369]] breath [[H7307]] in them. [[H7307]]

### 9
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, Prophesy [[H5012]] unto [[H413]] the wind, [[H7307]] prophesy, [[H5012]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] and say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the wind, [[H7307]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Come [[H935]] from the four [[H702]] winds, [[H7307]] O breath, [[H7307]] and breathe [[H5301]] upon these [[H428]] slain, [[H2026]] that they may live. [[H2421]]

### 10
So I prophesied [[H5012]] as [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] me, and the breath [[H7307]] came [[H935]] into them, and they lived, [[H2421]] and stood up [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] their feet, [[H7272]] an exceeding [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] army. [[H2428]]

### 11
Then he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] these [[H428]] bones [[H6106]] are the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] behold, [[H2009]] they say, [[H559]] Our bones [[H6106]] are dried, [[H3001]] and our hope [[H8615]] is lost: [[H6]] we are cut off [[H1504]] for our parts. [[H1504]]

### 12
Therefore [[H3651]] prophesy [[H5012]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2009]] O my people, [[H5971]] I [[H589]] will open [[H6605]] your graves, [[H6913]] and cause you to come up [[H5927]] out of your graves, [[H6913]] and bring [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 13
And ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I have opened [[H6605]] your graves, [[H6913]] O my people, [[H5971]] and brought you up [[H5927]] out of your graves, [[H6913]]

### 14
And shall put [[H5414]] my spirit [[H7307]] in you, and ye shall live, [[H2421]] and I shall place [[H3240]] you in [[H5921]] your own land: [[H127]] then shall ye know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]] and performed [[H6213]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] again unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Moreover, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take [[H3947]] thee one [[H259]] stick, [[H6086]] and write [[H3789]] upon [[H5921]] it, For Judah, [[H3063]] and for the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] his companions: [[H2270]] then take [[H3947]] another [[H259]] stick, [[H6086]] and write [[H3789]] upon [[H5921]] it, For Joseph, [[H3130]] the stick [[H6086]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] his companions: [[H2270]]

### 17
And join [[H7126]] them one [[H259]] to [[H413]] another [[H259]] into one [[H259]] stick; [[H6086]] and they shall become [[H1961]] one [[H259]] in thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 18
And when [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of thy people [[H5971]] shall speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Wilt thou not [[H3808]] shew [[H5046]] us what [[H4100]] thou by these? [[H4100]]

### 19
Say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] will take [[H3947]] the stick [[H6086]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] which [[H834]] in the hand [[H3027]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] his fellows, [[H2270]] and will put [[H5414]] them with [[H5921]] him, with [[H854]] the stick [[H6086]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and make [[H6213]] them one [[H259]] stick, [[H6086]] and they shall be [[H1961]] one [[H259]] in mine hand. [[H3027]]

### 20
And the sticks [[H6086]] whereon [[H834]] thou writest [[H3789]] shall be [[H1961]] in thine hand [[H3027]] before their eyes. [[H5869]]

### 21
And say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] will take [[H3947]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] from among [[H996]] the heathen, [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] they be gone, [[H1980]] and will gather [[H6908]] them on every side, [[H5439]] and bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] their own land: [[H127]]

### 22
And I will make [[H6213]] them one [[H259]] nation [[H1471]] in the land [[H776]] upon the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and one [[H259]] king [[H4428]] shall be [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] to them all: [[H3605]] and they shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] two [[H8147]] nations, [[H1471]] neither [[H3808]] shall they be divided [[H2673]] into two [[H8147]] kingdoms [[H4467]] any more at all: [[H5750]]

### 23
Neither [[H3808]] shall they defile [[H2930]] themselves any more [[H5750]] with their idols, [[H1544]] nor with their detestable things, [[H8251]] nor with any [[H3605]] of their transgressions: [[H6588]] but I will save [[H3467]] them out of all [[H3605]] their dwellingplaces, [[H4186]] wherein [[H834]] they have sinned, [[H2398]] and will cleanse [[H2891]] them: so shall they be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]]

### 24
And David [[H1732]] my servant [[H5650]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] them; and they all [[H3605]] shall have [[H1961]] one [[H259]] shepherd: [[H7462]] they shall also walk [[H1980]] in my judgments, [[H4941]] and observe [[H8104]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and do [[H6213]] them. [[H6213]]

### 25
And they shall dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] unto Jacob [[H3290]] my servant, [[H5650]] wherein [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] have dwelt; [[H3427]] and they shall dwell [[H3427]] therein, [[H5921]] they, [[H1992]] and their children, [[H1121]] and their children's [[H1121]] children [[H1121]] for ever: [[H5769]] and my servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] their prince [[H5387]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 26
Moreover I will make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] of peace [[H7965]] with them; it shall be [[H1961]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] them: and I will place [[H5414]] them, and multiply [[H7235]] them, and will set [[H5414]] my sanctuary [[H4720]] in the midst [[H8432]] of them for evermore. [[H5769]]

### 27
My tabernacle [[H4908]] also shall be [[H1961]] with [[H5921]] them: yea, I will be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] and they [[H1992]] shall be [[H1961]] my people. [[H5971]]

### 28
And the heathen [[H1471]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] do sanctify [[H6942]] Israel, [[H3478]] when my sanctuary [[H4720]] shall be [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of them for evermore. [[H5769]]
