### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] What [[H4100]] is [[H1961]] the vine [[H1612]] tree [[H6086]] more than any [[H3605]] tree, [[H6086]] a branch [[H2156]] which [[H834]] is [[H1961]] among the trees [[H6086]] of the forest? [[H3293]]

### 3
Shall wood [[H6086]] be taken [[H3947]] thereof [[H4480]] to do [[H6213]] any work? [[H4399]] or [[H518]] will take [[H3947]] a pin [[H3489]] of [[H4480]] it to hang [[H8518]] any [[H3605]] vessel [[H3627]] thereon? [[H3627]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2009]] it is cast [[H5414]] into the fire [[H784]] for fuel; [[H402]] the fire [[H784]] devoureth [[H398]] both [[H8147]] the ends [[H7098]] of it, and the midst [[H8432]] of it is burned. [[H2787]] Is it meet [[H6743]] for work? [[H4399]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2009]] when it was [[H1961]] whole, [[H8549]] it was meet [[H6213]] for no [[H3808]] work: [[H4399]] how much less [[H637]] shall it be meet [[H6213]] yet [[H5750]] for work, [[H4399]] when [[H3588]] the fire [[H784]] hath devoured [[H398]] it, and it is burned? [[H2787]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] As [[H834]] the vine [[H1612]] tree [[H6086]] among the trees [[H6086]] of the forest, [[H3293]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] to the fire [[H784]] for fuel, [[H402]] so [[H3651]] will I give [[H5414]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 7
And I will set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] against them; they shall go out [[H3318]] from fire, [[H784]] and fire [[H784]] shall devour [[H398]] them; and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I set [[H7760]] my face [[H6440]] against them. [[H6440]]

### 8
And I will make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] desolate, [[H8077]] because [[H3282]] they have committed [[H4603]] a trespass, [[H4604]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]
