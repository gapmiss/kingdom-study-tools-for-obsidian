### 1
Afterward he brought [[H1980]] me to [[H413]] the gate, [[H8179]] the gate [[H8179]] that [[H834]] looketh [[H6437]] toward [[H1870]] the east: [[H6921]]

### 2
And, behold, [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] from the way [[H1870]] of the east: [[H6921]] and his voice [[H6963]] like a noise [[H6963]] of many [[H7227]] waters: [[H4325]] and the earth [[H776]] shined [[H215]] with his glory. [[H3519]]

### 3
And according to the appearance [[H4758]] of the vision [[H4758]] which [[H834]] I saw, [[H7200]] according to the vision [[H4758]] that [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]] when I came [[H935]] to destroy [[H7843]] the city: [[H5892]] and the visions [[H4759]] like the vision [[H4758]] that [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]] by [[H413]] the river [[H5104]] Chebar; [[H3529]] and I fell [[H5307]] upon [[H413]] my face. [[H6440]]

### 4
And the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H935]] into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] by the way [[H1870]] of the gate [[H8179]] whose [[H834]] prospect [[H6440]] toward [[H1870]] the east. [[H6921]]

### 5
So the spirit [[H7307]] took me up, [[H5375]] and brought [[H935]] me into [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court; [[H2691]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the house. [[H1004]]

### 6
And I heard [[H8085]] speaking [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me out of the house; [[H1004]] and the man [[H376]] stood [[H5975]] by me. [[H681]]

### 7
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] the place [[H4725]] of my throne, [[H3678]] and the place [[H4725]] of the soles [[H3709]] of my feet, [[H7272]] where [[H834]] I will dwell [[H7931]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] for ever, [[H5769]] and my holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] shall the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] defile, [[H2930]] they, [[H1992]] nor their kings, [[H4428]] by their whoredom, [[H2184]] nor by the carcases [[H6297]] of their kings [[H4428]] in their high places. [[H1116]]

### 8
In their setting [[H5414]] of their threshold [[H5592]] by [[H853]] my thresholds, [[H5592]] and their post [[H4201]] by [[H681]] my posts, [[H4201]] and the wall [[H7023]] between [[H996]] me and them, they have even defiled [[H2930]] my holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] by their abominations [[H8441]] that [[H834]] they have committed: [[H6213]] wherefore I have consumed [[H398]] them in mine anger. [[H639]]

### 9
Now [[H6258]] let them put away [[H7368]] their whoredom, [[H2184]] and the carcases [[H6297]] of their kings, [[H4428]] far from [[H4480]] me, and I will dwell [[H7931]] in the midst [[H8432]] of them for ever. [[H5769]]

### 10
Thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] shew [[H5046]] the house [[H1004]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they may be ashamed [[H3637]] of their iniquities: [[H5771]] and let them measure [[H4058]] the pattern. [[H8508]]

### 11
And if [[H518]] they be ashamed [[H3637]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they have done, [[H6213]] shew [[H3045]] them the form [[H6699]] of the house, [[H1004]] and the fashion [[H8498]] thereof, and the goings out [[H4161]] thereof, and the comings in [[H4126]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the forms [[H6699]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the ordinances [[H2708]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the forms [[H6699]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the laws [[H8451]] thereof: and write [[H3789]] in their sight, [[H5869]] that they may keep [[H8104]] the whole [[H3605]] form [[H6699]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the ordinances [[H2708]] thereof, and do [[H6213]] them. [[H6213]]

### 12
This [[H2063]] the law [[H8451]] of the house; [[H1004]] Upon [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of the mountain [[H2022]] the whole [[H3605]] limit [[H1366]] thereof round about [[H5439]] most [[H6944]] holy. [[H6944]] Behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] the law [[H8451]] of the house. [[H1004]]

### 13
And these [[H428]] the measures [[H4060]] of the altar [[H4196]] after the cubits: [[H520]] The cubit [[H520]] a cubit [[H520]] and an hand breadth; [[H2948]] even the bottom [[H2436]] a cubit, [[H520]] and the breadth [[H7341]] a cubit, [[H520]] and the border [[H1366]] thereof by [[H413]] the edge [[H8193]] thereof round about [[H5439]] a [[H259]] span: [[H2239]] and this [[H2088]] the higher place [[H1354]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

### 14
And from the bottom [[H2436]] the ground [[H776]] to [[H5704]] the lower [[H8481]] settle [[H5835]] two [[H8147]] cubits, [[H520]] and the breadth [[H7341]] one [[H259]] cubit; [[H520]] and from the lesser [[H6996]] settle [[H5835]] to [[H5704]] the greater [[H1419]] settle [[H5835]] four [[H702]] cubits, [[H520]] and the breadth [[H7341]] cubit. [[H520]]

### 15
So the altar [[H741]] four [[H702]] cubits; [[H520]] and from the altar [[H741]] and upward [[H4605]] four [[H702]] horns. [[H7161]]

### 16
And the altar [[H741]] twelve [[H8147]] long, [[H753]] twelve [[H8147]] broad, [[H7341]] square [[H7251]] in [[H413]] the four [[H702]] squares [[H7253]] thereof. [[H7253]]

### 17
And the settle [[H5835]] fourteen [[H702]] long [[H753]] and fourteen [[H702]] broad [[H7341]] in [[H413]] the four [[H702]] squares [[H7253]] thereof; and the border [[H1366]] about [[H5439]] it half [[H2677]] a cubit; [[H520]] and the bottom [[H2436]] thereof a cubit [[H520]] about; [[H5439]] and his stairs [[H4609]] shall look [[H6437]] toward the east. [[H6921]]

### 18
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] These [[H428]] the ordinances [[H2708]] of the altar [[H4196]] in the day [[H3117]] when they shall make [[H6213]] it, to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] thereon, [[H5921]] and to sprinkle [[H2236]] blood [[H1818]] thereon. [[H1818]]

### 19
And thou shalt give [[H5414]] to [[H413]] the priests [[H3548]] the Levites [[H3881]] that [[H834]] be of the seed [[H2233]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] which approach [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] me, to minister [[H8334]] unto me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3068]] a young [[H1121]] bullock [[H6499]] for a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 20
And thou shalt take [[H3947]] of the blood [[H1818]] thereof, and put [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] the four [[H702]] horns [[H7161]] of it, and on [[H413]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H6438]] of the settle, [[H5835]] and upon [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] round about: [[H5439]] thus shalt thou cleanse [[H2398]] and purge [[H3722]] it. [[H3722]]

### 21
Thou shalt take [[H3947]] the bullock [[H6499]] also of the sin offering, [[H2403]] and he shall burn [[H8313]] it in the appointed place [[H4662]] of the house, [[H1004]] without [[H2351]] the sanctuary. [[H4720]]

### 22
And on the second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] thou shalt offer [[H7126]] a kid [[H8163]] of the goats [[H5795]] without blemish [[H8549]] for a sin offering; [[H2403]] and they shall cleanse [[H2398]] the altar, [[H4196]] as [[H834]] they did cleanse [[H2398]] with the bullock. [[H6499]]

### 23
When thou hast made an end [[H3615]] of cleansing [[H2398]] thou shalt offer [[H7126]] a young [[H1121]] bullock [[H6499]] without blemish, [[H8549]] and a ram [[H352]] out of [[H4480]] the flock [[H6629]] without blemish. [[H8549]]

### 24
And thou shalt offer [[H7126]] them before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and the priests [[H3548]] shall cast [[H7993]] salt [[H4417]] upon [[H5921]] them, and they shall offer them up [[H5927]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 25
Seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] shalt thou prepare [[H6213]] every day [[H3117]] a goat [[H8163]] a sin offering: [[H2403]] they shall also prepare [[H6213]] a young [[H1121]] bullock, [[H6499]] and a ram [[H352]] out of [[H4480]] the flock, [[H6629]] without blemish. [[H8549]]

### 26
Seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] shall they purge [[H3722]] the altar [[H4196]] and purify [[H2891]] it; and they shall consecrate [[H4390]]  themselves. [[H3027]]

### 27
And when [[H853]] these days [[H3117]] are expired, [[H3615]] it shall be, [[H1961]] upon the eighth [[H8066]] day, [[H3117]] and forward, [[H1973]] the priests [[H3548]] shall make [[H6213]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] upon [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and your peace offerings; [[H8002]] and I will accept [[H7521]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God.
