### 1
In the tenth [[H6224]] year, [[H8141]] in the tenth [[H6224]] in the twelfth [[H8147]] of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] thy face [[H6440]] against [[H5921]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] him, and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 3
Speak, [[H1696]] and say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H5921]] thee, Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the great [[H1419]] dragon [[H8577]] that lieth [[H7257]] in the midst [[H8432]] of his rivers, [[H2975]] which [[H834]] hath said, [[H559]] My river [[H2975]] mine own, and I [[H589]] have made [[H6213]] for myself. [[H6213]]

### 4
But I will put [[H5414]] hooks [[H2397]] in thy jaws, [[H3895]] and I will cause the fish [[H1710]] of thy rivers [[H2975]] to stick [[H1692]] unto thy scales, [[H7193]] and I will bring thee up [[H5927]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of thy rivers, [[H2975]] and all [[H3605]] the fish [[H1710]] of thy rivers [[H2975]] shall stick [[H1692]] unto thy scales. [[H7193]]

### 5
And I will leave [[H5203]] thee into the wilderness, [[H4057]] thee and all [[H3605]] the fish [[H1710]] of thy rivers: [[H2975]] thou shalt fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] fields; [[H7704]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] be brought together, [[H622]] nor [[H3808]] gathered: [[H6908]] I have given [[H5414]] thee for meat [[H402]] to the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H776]] and to the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven. [[H8064]]

### 6
And all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3282]] they have been [[H1961]] a staff [[H4938]] of reed [[H7070]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
When they took hold [[H8610]] of thee by thy hand, [[H3709]] thou didst break, [[H7533]] and rend [[H1234]] all [[H3605]] their shoulder: [[H3802]] and when they leaned [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] thee, thou brakest, [[H7665]] and madest all [[H3605]] their loins [[H4975]] to be at a stand. [[H5976]]

### 8
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and cut off [[H3772]] man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] out of [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 9
And the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] and waste; [[H2723]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord: [[H3068]] because [[H3282]] he hath said, [[H559]] The river [[H2975]] mine, and I [[H589]] have made [[H6213]]

### 10
Behold, [[H2005]] therefore [[H3651]] I against [[H413]] thee, and against [[H413]] thy rivers, [[H2975]] and I will make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] utterly [[H2721]] waste [[H2723]] desolate, [[H8077]] from the tower [[H4024]] of Syene [[H5482]] even unto [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of Ethiopia. [[H3568]]

### 11
No [[H3808]] foot [[H7272]] of man [[H120]] shall pass through [[H5674]] it, nor [[H3808]] foot [[H7272]] of beast [[H929]] shall pass through [[H5674]] it, neither [[H3808]] shall it be inhabited [[H3427]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

### 12
And I will make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] desolate [[H8077]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the countries [[H776]] desolate, [[H8074]] and her cities [[H5892]] among [[H8432]] the cities [[H5892]] laid waste [[H2717]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] forty [[H705]] years: [[H8141]] and I will scatter [[H6327]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] among the nations, [[H1471]] and will disperse [[H2219]] them through the countries. [[H776]]

### 13
Yet [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] At the end [[H7093]] of forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] will I gather [[H6908]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] from [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] whither [[H834]] they were scattered: [[H6327]]

### 14
And I will bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and will cause them to return [[H7725]] the land [[H776]] of Pathros, [[H6624]] into [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of their habitation; [[H4351]] and they shall be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] a base [[H8217]] kingdom. [[H4467]]

### 15
It shall be [[H1961]] the basest [[H8217]] of [[H4480]] the kingdoms; [[H4467]] neither [[H3808]] shall it exalt itself [[H5375]] any more [[H5750]] above [[H5921]] the nations: [[H1471]] for I will diminish [[H4591]] them, that they shall no more [[H1115]] rule [[H7287]] over the nations. [[H1471]]

### 16
And it shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] the confidence [[H4009]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which bringeth [[H2142]] iniquity [[H5771]] to remembrance, when they shall look [[H6437]] after [[H310]] them: but they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]

### 17
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the seven [[H7651]] and twentieth [[H6242]] year, [[H8141]] in the first [[H7223]] in the first [[H259]] of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]]  caused [[H853]] his army [[H2428]] to serve [[H5647]] a great [[H1419]] service [[H5656]] against [[H413]] Tyrus: [[H6865]] every [[H3605]] head [[H7218]] made bald, [[H7139]] and every [[H3605]] shoulder [[H3802]] peeled: [[H4803]] yet had [[H1961]] he no [[H3808]] wages, [[H7939]] nor his army, [[H2428]] for Tyrus, [[H6865]] for [[H5921]] the service [[H5656]] that [[H834]] he had served [[H5647]] against [[H5921]] it: [[H5921]]

### 19
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon; [[H894]] and he shall take [[H5375]] her multitude, [[H1995]] and take [[H7997]] her spoil, [[H7998]] and take [[H962]] her prey; [[H957]] and it shall be [[H1961]] the wages [[H7939]] for his army. [[H2428]]

### 20
I have given [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] his labour [[H6468]] wherewith [[H834]] he served [[H5647]] against it, because [[H834]] they wrought [[H6213]] for me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 21
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] will I cause the horn [[H7161]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] to bud forth, [[H6779]] and I will give [[H5414]] thee the opening [[H6610]] of the mouth [[H6310]] in the midst [[H8432]] of them; and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord.
