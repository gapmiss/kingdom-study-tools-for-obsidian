### 1
Then he brought me forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the utter [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] the way [[H1870]] toward [[H1870]] the north: [[H6828]] and he brought [[H935]] me into [[H413]] the chamber [[H3957]] that [[H834]] over against [[H5048]] the separate place, [[H1508]] and which [[H834]] before [[H5048]] the building [[H1146]] toward [[H413]] the north. [[H6828]]

### 2
Before [[H6440]] the length [[H753]] of an hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] the north [[H6828]] door, [[H6607]] and the breadth [[H7341]] fifty [[H2572]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 3
Over against [[H5048]] the twenty [[H6242]] which [[H834]] for the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] and over against [[H5048]] the pavement [[H7531]] which [[H834]] for the utter [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] gallery [[H862]] against [[H6440]] gallery [[H862]] in three [[H7992]]

### 4
And before [[H6440]] the chambers [[H3957]] a walk [[H4109]] of ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] breadth [[H7341]] inward, [[H6442]] a way [[H1870]] of one [[H259]] cubit; [[H520]] and their doors [[H6607]] toward the north. [[H6828]]

### 5
Now the upper [[H5945]] chambers [[H3957]] shorter: [[H7114]] for [[H3588]] the galleries [[H862]] were higher [[H3201]] than these, [[H2007]] than the lower, [[H8481]] and than the middlemost [[H8484]] of the building. [[H1146]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] in three [[H8027]] but had not [[H369]] pillars [[H5982]] as the pillars [[H5982]] of the courts: [[H2691]] therefore [[H5921]] was straitened [[H680]] more than the lowest [[H8481]] and the middlemost [[H8484]] from the ground. [[H776]]

### 7
And the wall [[H1447]] that [[H834]] without [[H2351]] over against [[H5980]] the chambers, [[H3957]] toward [[H1870]] the utter [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] on [[H413]] the forepart [[H6440]] of the chambers, [[H3957]] the length [[H753]] thereof fifty [[H2572]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] the length [[H753]] of the chambers [[H3957]] that [[H834]] in the utter [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] fifty [[H2572]] cubits: [[H520]] and, lo, [[H2009]] before [[H6440]] the temple [[H1964]] an hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 9
And from under [[H8478]] these [[H428]] chambers [[H3957]] the entry [[H3996]] on the east side, [[H6921]] as one goeth [[H935]] into them [[H2007]] from the utter [[H2435]] court. [[H2691]]

### 10
The chambers [[H3957]] in the thickness [[H7341]] of the wall [[H1444]] of the court [[H2691]] toward [[H1870]] the east, [[H6921]] over against [[H6440]] the separate place, [[H1508]] and over against [[H6440]] the building. [[H1146]]

### 11
And the way [[H1870]] before [[H6440]] them like the appearance [[H4758]] of the chambers [[H3957]] which [[H834]] toward [[H1870]] the north, [[H6828]] as long as [[H753]] they, as [[H3651]] broad they: [[H7341]] as and all [[H3605]] their goings out [[H4161]] both according to their fashions, [[H4941]] and according to their doors. [[H6607]]

### 12
And according to the doors [[H6607]] of the chambers [[H3957]] that [[H834]] toward [[H1870]] the south [[H1864]] a door [[H6607]] in the head [[H7218]] of the way, [[H1870]] the way [[H1870]] directly [[H1903]] before [[H6440]] the wall [[H1448]] toward [[H1870]] the east, [[H6921]] as one entereth [[H935]] into them. [[H935]]

### 13
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, The north [[H6828]] chambers [[H3957]] the south [[H1864]] chambers, [[H3957]] which [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the separate place, [[H1508]] they [[H2007]] holy [[H6944]] chambers, [[H3957]] where [[H834]] the priests [[H3548]] that [[H834]] approach [[H7138]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] shall eat [[H398]] the most [[H6944]] holy things: [[H6944]] there [[H8033]] shall they lay [[H3240]] the most [[H6944]] holy things, [[H6944]] and the meat offering, [[H4503]] and the sin offering, [[H2403]] and the trespass offering; [[H817]] for [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] holy. [[H6918]]

### 14
When the priests [[H3548]] enter [[H935]] therein, then shall they not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] of the holy [[H6944]] into [[H413]] the utter [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] but there [[H8033]] they shall lay [[H3240]] their garments [[H899]] wherein [[H834]] they minister; [[H8334]] for [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] holy; [[H6944]] and shall put on [[H3847]] other [[H312]] garments, [[H899]] and shall approach [[H7126]] to [[H413]] which [[H834]] for the people. [[H5971]]

### 15
Now when he had made an end [[H3615]]  of [[H853]] measuring [[H4060]] the inner [[H6442]] house, [[H1004]] he brought me forth [[H3318]] toward [[H1870]] the gate [[H8179]] whose [[H834]] prospect [[H6440]] toward [[H1870]] the east, [[H6921]] and measured [[H4058]] it round about. [[H5439]]

### 16
He measured [[H4058]] the east [[H6921]] side [[H7307]] with the measuring [[H4060]] reed, [[H7070]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H520]] reeds, [[H7070]] with the measuring [[H4060]] reed [[H7070]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 18
He measured [[H4058]] the south [[H1864]] side, [[H7307]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] reeds, [[H7070]] with the measuring [[H4060]] reed. [[H7070]]

### 19
He turned about [[H5437]] to [[H413]] the west [[H3220]] side, [[H7307]] measured [[H4058]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] reeds [[H7070]] with the measuring [[H4060]] reed. [[H7070]]

### 20
He measured [[H4058]] it by the four [[H702]] sides: [[H7307]] it had a wall [[H2346]] round about, [[H5439]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] long, [[H753]] and five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] broad, [[H7341]] to make a separation [[H914]] between [[H996]] the sanctuary [[H6944]] and the profane place.
