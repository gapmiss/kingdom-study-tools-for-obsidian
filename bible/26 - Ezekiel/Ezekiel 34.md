### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] the shepherds [[H7462]] of Israel, [[H3478]] prophesy, [[H5012]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] unto the shepherds; [[H7462]] Woe [[H1945]] to the shepherds [[H7462]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] do feed [[H7462]] themselves! should not [[H3808]] the shepherds [[H7462]] feed [[H7462]] the flocks? [[H6629]]

### 3
Ye eat [[H398]] the fat, [[H2459]] and ye clothe [[H3847]] you with [[H853]] the wool, [[H6785]] ye kill [[H2076]] them that are fed: [[H1277]] ye feed [[H7462]] not [[H3808]] the flock. [[H6629]]

### 4
The diseased [[H2470]] have ye not [[H3808]] strengthened, [[H2388]] neither [[H3808]] have ye healed [[H7495]] that which was sick, [[H2470]] neither [[H3808]] have ye bound up [[H2280]] broken, [[H7665]] neither [[H3808]] have ye brought again [[H7725]] that which was driven away, [[H5080]] neither [[H3808]] have ye sought [[H1245]] that which was lost; [[H6]] but with force [[H2394]] and with cruelty [[H6531]] have ye ruled [[H7287]] them. [[H7287]]

### 5
And they were scattered, [[H6327]] because no [[H1097]] shepherd: [[H7462]] and they became [[H1961]] meat [[H402]] to all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] when they were scattered. [[H6327]]

### 6
My sheep [[H6629]] wandered [[H7686]] through all [[H3605]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H7311]] hill: [[H1389]] yea, my flock [[H6629]] was scattered [[H6327]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth, [[H776]] and none [[H369]] did search [[H1875]] or seek [[H1245]]

### 7
Therefore, [[H3651]] ye shepherds, [[H7462]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord; [[H3068]]

### 8
I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] surely [[H518]] because [[H3282]] my flock [[H6629]] became [[H1961]] a prey, [[H957]] and my flock [[H6629]] became [[H1961]] meat [[H402]] to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] because no [[H369]] shepherd, [[H7462]] neither [[H3808]] did my shepherds [[H7462]] search [[H1875]] for my flock, [[H6629]] but the shepherds [[H7462]] fed [[H7462]] themselves, and fed [[H7462]] not [[H3808]] my flock; [[H6629]]

### 9
Therefore, [[H3651]] O ye shepherds, [[H7462]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord; [[H3068]]

### 10
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] the shepherds; [[H7462]] and I will require [[H1875]] my flock [[H6629]] at their hand, [[H3027]] and cause them to cease [[H7673]] from feeding [[H7462]] the flock; [[H6629]] neither [[H3808]] shall the shepherds [[H7462]] feed [[H7462]] themselves any more; [[H5750]] for I will deliver [[H5337]] my flock [[H6629]] from their mouth, [[H6310]] that they may not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] meat [[H402]] for them. [[H402]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I, I, [[H589]] will both search [[H1875]] my sheep, [[H6629]] and seek them out. [[H1239]]

### 12
As a shepherd [[H7462]] seeketh out [[H1243]] his flock [[H5739]] in the day [[H3117]] that he is [[H1961]] among [[H8432]] his sheep [[H6629]] scattered; [[H6567]] so [[H3651]] will I seek out [[H1239]] my sheep, [[H6629]] and will deliver [[H5337]] them out of all [[H3605]] places [[H4725]] where [[H834]] they have been scattered [[H6327]] in the cloudy [[H6051]] and dark [[H6205]] day. [[H3117]]

### 13
And I will bring them out [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] and gather [[H6908]] them from [[H4480]] the countries, [[H776]] and will bring [[H935]] them to [[H413]] their own land, [[H127]] and feed [[H7462]] them upon [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] by the rivers, [[H650]] and in all [[H3605]] the inhabited places [[H4186]] of the country. [[H776]]

### 14
I will feed [[H7462]] them in a good [[H2896]] pasture, [[H4829]] and upon the high [[H4791]] mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall their fold [[H5116]] be: [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] shall they lie [[H7257]] in a good [[H2896]] fold, [[H5116]] and a fat [[H8082]] pasture [[H4829]] shall they feed [[H7462]] upon [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
I [[H589]] will feed [[H7462]] my flock, [[H6629]] and I [[H589]] will cause them to lie down, [[H7257]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 16
I will seek [[H1245]] that which was lost, [[H6]] and bring again [[H7725]] that which was driven away, [[H5080]] and will bind up [[H2280]] broken, [[H7665]] and will strengthen [[H2388]] that which was sick: [[H2470]] but I will destroy [[H8045]] the fat [[H8082]] and the strong; [[H2389]] I will feed [[H7462]] them with judgment. [[H4941]]

### 17
And you, [[H859]] O my flock, [[H6629]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] cattle [[H7716]] and cattle, [[H7716]] between the rams [[H352]] and the he goats. [[H6260]]

### 18
a small thing [[H4592]] unto [[H4480]] you to have eaten up [[H7462]] the good [[H2896]] pasture, [[H4829]] but ye must tread down [[H7429]] with your feet [[H7272]] the residue [[H3499]] of your pastures? [[H4829]] and to have drunk [[H8354]] of the deep [[H4950]] waters, [[H4325]] but ye must foul [[H7515]] the residue [[H3498]] with your feet? [[H7272]]

### 19
And my flock, [[H6629]] they eat [[H7462]] that which ye have trodden [[H4823]] with your feet; [[H7272]] and they drink [[H8354]] that which ye have fouled [[H4833]] with your feet. [[H7272]]

### 20
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] unto [[H413]] them; Behold, [[H2005]] I, [[H589]] I, will judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] the fat [[H1277]] cattle [[H7716]] and between [[H996]] the lean [[H7330]] cattle. [[H7716]]

### 21
Because [[H3282]] ye have thrust [[H1920]] with side [[H6654]] and with shoulder, [[H3802]] and pushed [[H5055]] all [[H3605]] the diseased [[H2470]] with your horns, [[H7161]] till [[H5704]] ye have scattered [[H6327]] them abroad; [[H2351]]

### 22
Therefore will I save [[H3467]] my flock, [[H6629]] and they shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] a prey; [[H957]] and I will judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] cattle [[H7716]] and cattle. [[H7716]]

### 23
And I will set up [[H6965]] one [[H259]] shepherd [[H7462]] over [[H5921]] them, and he shall feed [[H7462]]  them, [[H853]] my servant [[H5650]] David; [[H1732]] he shall feed [[H7462]] them, and he [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] their shepherd. [[H7462]]

### 24
And I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] and my servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] a prince [[H5387]] among [[H8432]] them; I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]]

### 25
And I will make [[H3772]] with them a covenant [[H1285]] of peace, [[H7965]] and will cause the evil [[H7451]] beasts [[H2416]] to cease [[H7673]] out of [[H4480]] the land: [[H776]] and they shall dwell [[H3427]] safely [[H983]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and sleep [[H3462]] in the woods. [[H3293]]

### 26
And I will make [[H5414]] them and the places round about [[H5439]] my hill [[H1389]] a blessing; [[H1293]] and I will cause the shower [[H1653]] to come down [[H3381]] in his season; [[H6256]] there shall be [[H1961]] showers [[H1653]] of blessing. [[H1293]]

### 27
And the tree [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] shall yield [[H5414]] her fruit, [[H6529]] and the earth [[H776]] shall yield [[H5414]] her increase, [[H2981]] and they shall be [[H1961]] safe [[H983]] in [[H5921]] their land, [[H127]] and shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I have broken [[H7665]] the bands [[H4133]] of their yoke, [[H5923]] and delivered [[H5337]] them out of the hand [[H3027]] of those that served [[H5647]] themselves of them. [[H5647]]

### 28
And they shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] a prey [[H957]] to the heathen, [[H1471]] neither [[H3808]] shall the beast [[H2416]] of the land [[H776]] devour [[H398]] them; but they shall dwell [[H3427]] safely, [[H983]] and none [[H369]] shall make afraid. [[H2729]]

### 29
And I will raise up [[H6965]] for them a plant [[H4302]] of renown, [[H8034]] and they shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] consumed [[H622]] with hunger [[H7458]] in the land, [[H776]] neither [[H3808]] bear [[H5375]] the shame [[H3639]] of the heathen [[H1471]] any more. [[H1471]]

### 30
Thus shall they know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] with [[H854]] them, and they, [[H1992]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] my people, [[H5971]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 31
And ye [[H859]] my flock, [[H6629]] the flock [[H6629]] of my pasture, [[H4830]] men, [[H120]] I [[H589]] your God, [[H430]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]
