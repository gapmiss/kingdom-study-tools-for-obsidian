### 1
Moreover take thou up [[H5375]] a lamentation [[H7015]] for [[H413]] the princes [[H5387]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 2
And say, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] thy mother? [[H517]] A lioness: [[H3833]] she lay down [[H7257]] among [[H996]] lions, [[H738]] she nourished [[H7235]] her whelps [[H1482]] among [[H8432]] young lions. [[H3715]]

### 3
And she brought up [[H5927]] one [[H259]] of her whelps: [[H1482]] it became [[H1961]] a young lion, [[H3715]] and it learned [[H3925]] to catch [[H2963]] the prey; [[H2964]] it devoured [[H398]] men. [[H120]]

### 4
The nations [[H1471]] also heard [[H8085]] of [[H413]] him; he was taken [[H8610]] in their pit, [[H7845]] and they brought [[H935]] him with chains [[H2397]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 5
Now when she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she had waited, [[H3176]] her hope [[H8615]] was lost, [[H6]] then she took [[H3947]] another [[H259]] of her whelps, [[H1482]] made [[H7760]] him a young lion. [[H3715]]

### 6
And he went up and down [[H1980]] among [[H8432]] the lions, [[H738]] he became [[H1961]] a young lion, [[H3715]] and learned [[H3925]] to catch [[H2963]] the prey, [[H2964]] devoured [[H398]] men. [[H120]]

### 7
And he knew [[H3045]] their desolate palaces, [[H490]] and he laid waste [[H2717]] their cities; [[H5892]] and the land [[H776]] was desolate, [[H3456]] and the fulness [[H4393]] thereof, by the noise [[H6963]] of his roaring. [[H7581]]

### 8
Then the nations [[H1471]] set [[H5414]] against [[H5921]] him on every side [[H5439]] from the provinces, [[H4082]] and spread [[H6566]] their net [[H7568]] over [[H5921]] him: he was taken [[H8610]] in their pit. [[H7845]]

### 9
And they put [[H5414]] him in ward [[H5474]] in chains, [[H2397]] and brought [[H935]] him to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon: [[H894]] they brought [[H935]] him into holds, [[H4685]] that [[H4616]] his voice [[H6963]] should no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be heard [[H8085]] upon [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 10
Thy mother [[H517]] like a vine [[H1612]] in thy blood, [[H1818]] planted [[H8362]] by [[H5921]] the waters: [[H4325]] she was [[H1961]] fruitful [[H6509]] and full of branches [[H6058]] by reason of many [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 11
And she had [[H1961]] strong [[H5797]] rods [[H4294]] for [[H413]] the sceptres [[H7626]] of them that bare rule, [[H4910]] and her stature [[H6967]] was exalted [[H1361]] among [[H5921]] the thick branches, [[H5688]] and she appeared [[H7200]] in her height [[H1363]] with the multitude [[H7230]] of her branches. [[H1808]]

### 12
But she was plucked up [[H5428]] in fury, [[H2534]] she was cast down [[H7993]] to the ground, [[H776]] and the east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] dried up [[H3001]] her fruit: [[H6529]] her strong [[H5797]] rods [[H4294]] were broken [[H6561]] and withered; [[H3001]] the fire [[H784]] consumed [[H398]] them. [[H398]]

### 13
And now [[H6258]] she planted [[H8362]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] in a dry [[H6723]] and thirsty [[H6772]] ground. [[H776]]

### 14
And fire [[H784]] is gone out [[H3318]] of a rod [[H4294]] of her branches, [[H905]] hath devoured [[H398]] her fruit, [[H6529]] so that she hath [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] strong [[H5797]] rod [[H4294]] a sceptre [[H7626]] to rule. [[H4910]] This [[H1931]] a lamentation, [[H7015]] and shall be [[H1961]] for a lamentation. [[H7015]]
