### 1
Again the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]]  cause [[H853]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to know [[H3045]] her abominations, [[H8441]]

### 3
And say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] unto Jerusalem; [[H3389]] Thy birth [[H4351]] and thy nativity [[H4138]] of the land [[H776]] of Canaan; [[H3669]] thy father [[H1]] an Amorite, [[H567]] and thy mother [[H517]] an Hittite. [[H2850]]

### 4
And thy nativity, [[H4138]] in the day [[H3117]] thou wast born [[H3205]] thy navel [[H8270]] was not [[H3808]] cut, [[H3772]] neither [[H3808]] wast thou washed [[H7364]] in water [[H4325]] to supple [[H4935]] thou wast not [[H3808]] salted [[H4414]] at all, [[H4414]] nor [[H3808]] swaddled [[H2853]] at all. [[H2853]]

### 5
None [[H3808]] eye [[H5869]] pitied [[H2347]] thee, to do [[H6213]] any [[H259]] of these [[H428]] unto thee, to have compassion [[H2550]] upon [[H5921]] thee; but thou wast cast out [[H7993]] in [[H413]] the open [[H6440]] field, [[H7704]] to the lothing [[H1604]] of thy person, [[H5315]] in the day [[H3117]] that thou wast born. [[H3205]]

### 6
And when I passed [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] thee, and saw [[H7200]] thee polluted [[H947]] in thine own blood, [[H1818]] I said [[H559]] unto thee in thy blood, [[H1818]] Live; [[H2421]] yea, I said [[H559]] unto thee in thy blood, [[H1818]] Live. [[H2421]]

### 7
I have caused [[H5414]] thee to multiply [[H7233]] as the bud [[H6780]] of the field, [[H7704]] and thou hast increased [[H7235]] and waxen great, [[H1431]] and thou art come [[H935]] to excellent ornaments: [[H5716]] breasts [[H7699]] are fashioned, [[H3559]] and thine hair [[H8181]] is grown, [[H6779]] whereas thou [[H859]] naked [[H5903]] and bare. [[H6181]]

### 8
Now when I passed [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] thee, and looked upon [[H7200]] thee, behold, [[H2009]] thy time [[H6256]] the time [[H6256]] of love; [[H1730]] and I spread [[H6566]] my skirt [[H3671]] over [[H5921]] thee, and covered [[H3680]] thy nakedness: [[H6172]] yea, I sware [[H7650]] unto thee, and entered [[H935]] into a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] and thou becamest [[H1961]] mine. [[H1961]]

### 9
Then washed [[H7364]] I thee with water; [[H4325]] yea, I throughly washed away [[H7857]] thy blood [[H1818]] from [[H5921]] thee, and I anointed [[H5480]] thee with oil. [[H8081]]

### 10
I clothed [[H3847]] thee also with broidered work, [[H7553]] and shod [[H5274]] thee with badgers' skin, [[H8476]] and I girded [[H2280]] thee about with fine linen, [[H8336]] and I covered [[H3680]] thee with silk. [[H4897]]

### 11
I decked [[H5710]] thee also with ornaments, [[H5716]] and I put [[H5414]] bracelets [[H6781]] upon [[H5921]] thy hands, [[H3027]] and a chain [[H7242]] on [[H5921]] thy neck. [[H1627]]

### 12
And I put [[H5414]] a jewel [[H5141]] on [[H5921]] thy forehead, [[H639]] and earrings [[H5694]] in [[H5921]] thine ears, [[H241]] and a beautiful [[H8597]] crown [[H5850]] upon thine head. [[H7218]]

### 13
Thus wast thou decked [[H5710]] with gold [[H2091]] and silver; [[H3701]] and thy raiment [[H4403]] fine linen, [[H8336]] and silk, [[H4897]] and broidered work; [[H7553]] thou didst eat [[H398]] fine flour, [[H5560]] and honey, [[H1706]] and oil: [[H8081]] and thou wast exceeding [[H3966]] beautiful, [[H3302]] and thou didst prosper [[H6743]] into a kingdom. [[H4410]]

### 14
And thy renown [[H8034]] went forth [[H3318]] among the heathen [[H1471]] for thy beauty: [[H3308]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] perfect [[H3632]] through my comeliness, [[H1926]] which [[H834]] I had put [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]

### 15
But thou didst trust [[H982]] in thine own beauty, [[H3308]] and playedst the harlot [[H2181]] because [[H5921]] of thy renown, [[H8034]] and pouredst out [[H8210]] thy fornications [[H8457]] on [[H5921]] every one [[H3605]] that passed by; [[H5674]] his it was. [[H5674]]

### 16
And of thy garments [[H899]] thou didst take, [[H3947]] and deckedst [[H6213]] thy high places [[H1116]] with divers colours, [[H2921]] and playedst the harlot [[H2181]] thereupon: [[H5921]] shall not [[H3808]] come, [[H935]] neither [[H3808]] shall it be [[H1961]]

### 17
Thou hast also taken [[H3947]] thy fair [[H8597]] jewels [[H3627]] of my gold [[H2091]] and of my silver, [[H3701]] which [[H834]] I had given [[H5414]] thee, and madest [[H6213]] to thyself images [[H6754]] of men, [[H2145]] and didst commit whoredom [[H2181]] with them, [[H2181]]

### 18
And tookest [[H3947]] thy broidered [[H7553]] garments, [[H899]] and coveredst [[H3680]] them: and thou hast set [[H5414]] mine oil [[H8081]] and mine incense [[H7004]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 19
My meat [[H3899]] also which [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] thee, fine flour, [[H5560]] and oil, [[H8081]] and honey, [[H1706]] I fed [[H398]] thee, thou hast even set [[H5414]] it before [[H6440]] them for a sweet [[H5207]] savour: [[H7381]] and it was, [[H1961]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 20
Moreover thou hast taken [[H3947]] thy sons [[H1121]] and thy daughters, [[H1323]] whom [[H834]] thou hast borne [[H3205]] unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed [[H2076]] unto them to be devoured. [[H398]] of thy whoredoms [[H8457]] a small matter, [[H4592]]

### 21
That thou hast slain [[H7819]] my children, [[H1121]] and delivered [[H5414]] them to cause them to pass through [[H5674]] for them? [[H5674]]

### 22
And in all [[H3605]] thine abominations [[H8441]] and thy whoredoms [[H8457]] thou hast not [[H3808]] remembered [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of thy youth, [[H5271]] when thou wast [[H1961]] naked [[H5903]] and bare, [[H6181]] wast [[H1961]] polluted [[H947]] in thy blood. [[H1818]]

### 23
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] all [[H3605]] thy wickedness, [[H7451]] (woe, [[H188]] woe [[H188]] unto thee! saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God;) [[H3069]]

### 24
thou hast also built [[H1129]] unto thee an eminent place, [[H1354]] and hast made [[H6213]] thee an high place [[H7413]] in every [[H3605]] street. [[H7339]]

### 25
Thou hast built [[H1129]] thy high place [[H7413]] at [[H413]] every [[H3605]] head [[H7218]] of the way, [[H1870]]  and hast made [[H853]] thy beauty [[H3308]] to be abhorred, [[H8581]] and hast opened [[H6589]] thy feet [[H7272]] to every one [[H3605]] that passed by, [[H5674]] and multiplied [[H7235]] thy whoredoms. [[H8457]]

### 26
Thou hast also committed fornication [[H2181]] with [[H413]] the Egyptians [[H1121]] thy neighbours, [[H7934]] great [[H1432]] of flesh; [[H1320]] and hast increased [[H7235]] thy whoredoms, [[H8457]] to provoke me to anger. [[H3707]]

### 27
Behold, [[H2009]] therefore I have stretched out [[H5186]] my hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] thee, and have diminished [[H1639]] thine ordinary [[H2706]] and delivered [[H5414]] thee unto the will [[H5315]] of them that hate [[H8130]] thee, the daughters [[H1323]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] which are ashamed [[H3637]] of thy lewd [[H2154]] way. [[H1870]]

### 28
Thou hast played the whore [[H2181]] also with [[H413]] the Assyrians, [[H1121]] because [[H1115]] thou wast unsatiable; [[H7646]] yea, thou hast played the harlot [[H2181]] with them, and yet [[H1571]] couldest not [[H3808]] be satisfied. [[H7654]]

### 29
Thou hast moreover multiplied [[H7235]] thy fornication [[H8457]] in [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] unto Chaldea; [[H3778]] and yet [[H1571]] thou wast not [[H3808]] satisfied [[H7646]] herewith. [[H2063]]

### 30
How [[H4100]] weak [[H535]] is thine heart, [[H3826]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] seeing thou doest [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] the work [[H4639]] of an imperious [[H7986]] whorish [[H2181]] woman; [[H802]]

### 31
In that thou buildest [[H1129]] thine eminent place [[H1354]] in the head [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] way, [[H1870]] and makest [[H6213]] thine high place [[H7413]] in every [[H3605]] street; [[H7339]] and hast not [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] as an harlot, [[H2181]] in that thou scornest [[H7046]] hire; [[H868]]

### 32
a wife [[H802]] that committeth adultery, [[H5003]] taketh [[H3947]] strangers [[H2114]] instead [[H8478]] of her husband! [[H376]]

### 33
They give [[H5414]] gifts [[H5078]] to all [[H3605]] whores: [[H2181]] but thou [[H859]] givest [[H5414]] thy gifts [[H5083]] to all [[H3605]] thy lovers, [[H157]] and hirest [[H7809]] them, that they may come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee on every side [[H5439]] for thy whoredom. [[H8457]]

### 34
And the contrary [[H2016]] is [[H1961]] in thee from [[H4480]] women [[H802]] in thy whoredoms, [[H8457]] whereas none [[H3808]] followeth [[H310]] thee to commit whoredoms: [[H2181]] and in that thou givest [[H5414]] a reward, [[H868]] and no [[H3808]] reward [[H868]] is given [[H5414]] unto thee, therefore thou art [[H1961]] contrary. [[H2016]]

### 35
Wherefore, [[H3651]] O harlot, [[H2181]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 36
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] thy filthiness [[H5178]] was poured out, [[H8210]] and thy nakedness [[H6172]] discovered [[H1540]] through thy whoredoms [[H8457]] with [[H5921]] thy lovers, [[H157]] and with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the idols [[H1544]] of thy abominations, [[H8441]] and by the blood [[H1818]] of thy children, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] thou didst give [[H5414]] unto them; [[H5414]]

### 37
Behold, [[H2005]] therefore [[H3651]] I will gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] thy lovers, [[H157]] with [[H5921]] whom [[H834]] thou hast taken pleasure, [[H6149]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast loved, [[H157]] with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast hated; [[H8130]] I will even gather [[H6908]] them round about [[H5439]] against [[H5921]] thee, and will discover [[H1540]] thy nakedness [[H6172]] unto [[H413]] them, that they may see [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] thy nakedness. [[H6172]]

### 38
And I will judge [[H8199]] thee, as women that break wedlock [[H5003]] and shed [[H8210]] blood [[H1818]] are judged; [[H4941]] and I will give [[H5414]] thee blood [[H1818]] in fury [[H2534]] and jealousy. [[H7068]]

### 39
And I will also give [[H5414]] thee into their hand, [[H3027]] and they shall throw down [[H2040]] thine eminent place, [[H1354]] and shall break down [[H5422]] thy high places: [[H7413]] they shall strip [[H6584]] thee also of thy clothes, [[H899]] and shall take [[H3947]] thy fair [[H8597]] jewels, [[H3627]] and leave [[H3240]] thee naked [[H5903]] and bare. [[H6181]]

### 40
They shall also bring up [[H5927]] a company [[H6951]] against [[H5921]] thee, and they shall stone [[H7275]] thee with stones, [[H68]] and thrust thee through [[H1333]] with their swords. [[H2719]]

### 41
And they shall burn [[H8313]] thine houses [[H1004]] with fire, [[H784]] and execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] upon thee in the sight [[H5869]] of many [[H7227]] women: [[H802]] and I will cause thee to cease [[H7673]] from playing the harlot, [[H2181]] and thou also [[H1571]] shalt give [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] hire [[H868]] any more. [[H868]]

### 42
So will I make my fury [[H2534]] toward thee to rest, [[H5117]] and my jealousy [[H7068]] shall depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] thee, and I will be quiet, [[H8252]] and will be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] angry. [[H3707]]

### 43
Because [[H3282]] thou hast not [[H3808]] remembered [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of thy youth, [[H5271]] but hast fretted [[H7264]] me in all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] behold, [[H1887]] therefore I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] will recompense [[H5414]] thy way [[H1870]] upon head, [[H7218]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3069]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] commit [[H6213]] this lewdness [[H2154]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] thine abominations. [[H8441]]

### 44
Behold, [[H2009]] every one [[H3605]] that useth proverbs [[H4911]] shall use proverb [[H4911]] against [[H5921]] thee, saying, [[H559]] As the mother, [[H517]] her daughter. [[H1323]]

### 45
Thou [[H859]] thy mother's [[H517]] daughter, [[H1323]] that lotheth [[H1602]] her husband [[H376]] and her children; [[H1121]] and thou [[H859]] the sister [[H269]] of thy sisters, [[H269]] which [[H834]] lothed [[H1602]] their husbands [[H582]] and their children: [[H1121]] your mother [[H517]] an Hittite, [[H2850]] and your father [[H1]] an Amorite. [[H567]]

### 46
And thine elder [[H1419]] sister [[H269]] Samaria, [[H8111]] she [[H1931]] and her daughters [[H1323]] that dwell [[H3427]] at [[H5921]] thy left hand: [[H8040]] and thy younger [[H6996]] sister, [[H269]] that dwelleth [[H3427]] at thy right hand, [[H3225]] Sodom [[H5467]] and her daughters. [[H1323]]

### 47
Yet hast thou not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] after their ways, [[H1870]] nor done [[H6213]] after their abominations: [[H8441]] but, as a very [[H6985]] little [[H4592]] thou wast corrupted [[H7843]] more than they [[H2004]] in all [[H3605]] thy ways. [[H1870]]

### 48
I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] Sodom [[H5467]] thy sister [[H269]] hath not [[H518]] done, [[H6213]] she [[H1931]] nor her daughters, [[H1323]] as [[H834]] thou hast done, [[H6213]] thou [[H859]] and thy daughters. [[H1323]]

### 49
Behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] was [[H1961]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of thy sister [[H269]] Sodom, [[H5467]] pride, [[H1347]] fulness [[H7653]] of bread, [[H3899]] and abundance [[H7962]] of idleness [[H8252]] was [[H1961]] in her and in her daughters, [[H1323]] neither [[H3808]] did she strengthen [[H2388]] the hand [[H3027]] of the poor [[H6041]] and needy. [[H34]]

### 50
And they were haughty, [[H1361]] and committed [[H6213]] abomination [[H8441]] before [[H6440]] me: therefore I took them away [[H5493]] as [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]]

### 51
Neither [[H3808]] hath Samaria [[H8111]] committed [[H2398]] half [[H2677]] of thy sins; [[H2403]] but thou hast multiplied [[H7235]] thine abominations [[H8441]] more than they, [[H2007]] and hast justified [[H6663]] thy sisters [[H269]] in all [[H3605]] thine abominations [[H8441]] which [[H834]] thou hast done. [[H6213]]

### 52
Thou [[H859]] also, [[H1571]] which [[H834]] hast judged [[H6419]] thy sisters, [[H269]] bear [[H5375]] thine own shame [[H3639]] for thy sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] thou hast committed more abominable [[H8581]] than they: [[H2004]] they are more righteous [[H6663]] than thou: [[H4480]] yea, be thou confounded [[H954]] also, [[H1571]] and bear [[H5375]] thy shame, [[H3639]] in that thou hast justified [[H6663]] thy sisters. [[H269]]

### 53
When I shall bring again [[H7725]] their captivity, [[H7622]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Sodom [[H5467]] and her daughters, [[H1323]] and the captivity [[H7622]] of Samaria [[H8111]] and her daughters, [[H1323]] then the captivity [[H7622]] of thy captives in the midst [[H8432]] of them: [[H8432]]

### 54
That [[H4616]] thou mayest bear [[H5375]] thine own shame, [[H3639]] and mayest be confounded [[H3637]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast done, [[H6213]] in that thou art a comfort [[H5162]] unto them. [[H5162]]

### 55
When thy sisters, [[H269]] Sodom [[H5467]] and her daughters, [[H1323]] shall return [[H7725]] to their former estate, [[H6927]] and Samaria [[H8111]] and her daughters [[H1323]] shall return [[H7725]] to their former estate, [[H6927]] then thou [[H859]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] shall return [[H7725]] to your former estate. [[H6927]]

### 56
For thy sister [[H269]] Sodom [[H5467]] was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] mentioned [[H8052]] by thy mouth [[H6310]] in the day [[H3117]] of thy pride, [[H1347]]

### 57
Before [[H2962]] thy wickedness [[H7451]] was discovered, [[H1540]] as at [[H3644]] the time [[H6256]] of reproach [[H2781]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Syria, [[H758]] and all [[H3605]] round about [[H5439]] her, the daughters [[H1323]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] which despise [[H7590]] thee round about. [[H5439]]

### 58
Thou [[H859]] hast borne [[H5375]] thy lewdness [[H2154]] and thine abominations, [[H8441]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 59
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I will even deal [[H6213]] with [[H854]] thee as [[H834]] thou hast done, [[H6213]] which [[H834]] hast despised [[H959]] the oath [[H423]] in breaking [[H6565]] the covenant. [[H1285]]

### 60
Nevertheless I [[H589]] will remember [[H2142]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] thee in the days [[H3117]] of thy youth, [[H5271]] and I will establish [[H6965]] unto thee an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant. [[H1285]]

### 61
Then thou shalt remember [[H2142]] thy ways, [[H1870]] and be ashamed, [[H3637]] when thou shalt receive [[H3947]] thy sisters, [[H269]] thine elder [[H1419]] and thy younger: [[H6996]] and I will give [[H5414]] them unto thee for daughters, [[H1323]] but not [[H3808]] by thy covenant. [[H1285]]

### 62
And I [[H589]] will establish [[H6965]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] thee; and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 63
That [[H4616]] thou mayest remember, [[H2142]] and be confounded, [[H954]] and never [[H3808]] open [[H6610]] thy mouth [[H6310]] any more [[H5750]] because [[H6440]] of thy shame, [[H3639]] when I am pacified [[H3722]] toward thee for all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast done, [[H6213]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]
