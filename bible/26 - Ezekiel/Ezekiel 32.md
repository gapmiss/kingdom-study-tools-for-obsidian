### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the twelfth [[H8147]] year, [[H8141]] in the twelfth [[H8147]] month, [[H2320]] in the first [[H259]] of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take up [[H5375]] a lamentation [[H7015]] for [[H5921]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thou art like [[H1819]] a young lion [[H3715]] of the nations, [[H1471]] and thou [[H859]] as a whale [[H8577]] in the seas: [[H3220]] and thou camest forth [[H1518]] with thy rivers, [[H5104]] and troubledst [[H1804]] the waters [[H4325]] with thy feet, [[H7272]] and fouledst [[H7515]] their rivers. [[H5104]]

### 3
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I will therefore spread out [[H6566]] my net [[H7568]] over [[H5921]] thee with a company [[H6951]] of many [[H7227]] people; [[H5971]] and they shall bring thee up [[H5927]] in my net. [[H2764]]

### 4
Then will I leave [[H5203]] thee upon the land, [[H776]] I will cast thee forth [[H2904]] upon [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field, [[H7704]] and will cause all [[H3605]] the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven [[H8064]] to remain [[H7931]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and I will fill [[H7646]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] with [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 5
And I will lay [[H5414]] thy flesh [[H1320]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and fill [[H4390]] the valleys [[H1516]] with thy height. [[H7419]]

### 6
I will also water [[H8248]] with thy blood [[H1818]] the land [[H776]] wherein thou swimmest, [[H6824]] to [[H413]] the mountains; [[H2022]] and the rivers [[H650]] shall be full [[H4390]] of [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 7
And when I shall put thee out, [[H3518]] I will cover [[H3680]] the heaven, [[H8064]] and make the stars [[H3556]] thereof dark; [[H6937]] I will cover [[H3680]] the sun [[H8121]] with a cloud, [[H6051]] and the moon [[H3394]] shall not [[H3808]] give [[H215]] her light. [[H216]]

### 8
All [[H3605]] the bright [[H3974]] lights [[H216]] of heaven [[H8064]] will I make dark [[H6937]] over [[H5921]] thee, and set [[H5414]] darkness [[H2822]] upon [[H5921]] thy land, [[H776]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 9
I will also vex [[H3707]] the hearts [[H3820]] of many [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] when I shall bring [[H935]] thy destruction [[H7667]] among the nations, [[H1471]] into [[H5921]] the countries [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou hast not [[H3808]] known. [[H3045]]

### 10
Yea, I will make many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] amazed [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] thee, and their kings [[H4428]] shall be horribly [[H8178]] afraid [[H8175]] for [[H5921]] thee, when I shall brandish [[H5774]] my sword [[H2719]] before [[H5921]] them; [[H6440]] and they shall tremble [[H2729]] at moment, [[H7281]] every man [[H376]] for his own life, [[H5315]] in the day [[H3117]] of thy fall. [[H4658]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] The sword [[H2719]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] shall come upon [[H935]] thee. [[H935]]

### 12
By the swords [[H2719]] of the mighty [[H1368]] will I cause thy multitude [[H1995]] to fall, [[H5307]] the terrible [[H6184]] of the nations, [[H1471]] all [[H3605]] of them: and they shall spoil [[H7703]] the pomp [[H1347]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and all [[H3605]] the multitude [[H1995]] thereof shall be destroyed. [[H8045]]

### 13
I will destroy [[H6]]  also [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H929]] thereof from [[H5921]] beside the great [[H7227]] waters; [[H4325]] neither [[H3808]] shall the foot [[H7272]] of man [[H120]] trouble [[H1804]] them any more, [[H5750]] nor [[H3808]] the hoofs [[H6541]] of beasts [[H929]] trouble [[H1804]] them. [[H1804]]

### 14
Then [[H227]] will I make their waters [[H4325]] deep, [[H8257]] and cause their rivers [[H5104]] to run [[H1980]] like oil, [[H8081]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 15
When I shall make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] desolate, [[H8077]] and the country [[H776]] shall be destitute [[H8074]] of that whereof it was full, [[H4393]] when I shall smite [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] them that dwell [[H3427]] therein, then shall they know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
This [[H1931]] the lamentation [[H7015]] wherewith they shall lament [[H6969]] her: the daughters [[H1323]] of the nations [[H1471]] shall lament [[H6969]] her: they shall lament [[H6969]] for her, for [[H5921]] Egypt, [[H4714]] and for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] her multitude, [[H1995]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 17
It came to pass [[H1961]] also in the twelfth [[H8147]] year, [[H8141]] in the fifteenth [[H2568]] of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] wail [[H5091]] for [[H5921]] the multitude [[H1995]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and cast them down, [[H3381]] her, and the daughters [[H1323]] of the famous [[H117]] nations, [[H1471]] unto [[H413]] the nether parts [[H8482]] of the earth, [[H776]] with [[H854]] them that go down [[H3381]] into the pit. [[H953]]

### 19
Whom [[H4310]] dost thou pass in beauty? [[H5276]] go down, [[H3381]] and be thou laid [[H7901]] with [[H854]] the uncircumcised. [[H6189]]

### 20
They shall fall [[H5307]] in the midst [[H8432]] of slain [[H2491]] by the sword: [[H2719]] she is delivered [[H5414]] to the sword: [[H2719]] draw [[H4900]] her and all [[H3605]] her multitudes. [[H1995]]

### 21
The strong [[H410]] among the mighty [[H1368]] shall speak [[H1696]] to him out of the midst [[H8432]] of hell [[H7585]] with [[H854]] them that help [[H5826]] him: they are gone down, [[H3381]] they lie [[H7901]] uncircumcised, [[H6189]] slain [[H2491]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 22
Asshur [[H804]] there [[H8033]] and all [[H3605]] her company: [[H6951]] his graves [[H6913]] about [[H5439]] him: all [[H3605]] of them slain, [[H2491]] fallen [[H5307]] by the sword: [[H2719]]

### 23
Whose [[H834]] graves [[H6913]] are set [[H5414]] in the sides [[H3411]] of the pit, [[H953]] and her company [[H6951]] is [[H1961]] round about [[H5439]] her grave: [[H6900]] all [[H3605]] of them slain, [[H2491]] fallen [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] which [[H834]] caused [[H5414]] terror [[H2851]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 24
There [[H8033]] Elam [[H5867]] and all [[H3605]] her multitude [[H1995]] round about [[H5439]] her grave, [[H6900]] all [[H3605]] of them slain, [[H2491]] fallen [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] which [[H834]] are gone down [[H3381]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] into [[H413]] the nether parts [[H8482]] of the earth, [[H776]] which [[H834]] caused [[H5414]] their terror [[H2851]] in the land [[H776]] of the living; [[H2416]] yet have they borne [[H5375]] their shame [[H3639]] with [[H854]] them that go down [[H3381]] to the pit. [[H953]]

### 25
They have set [[H5414]] her a bed [[H4904]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the slain [[H2491]] with all [[H3605]] her multitude: [[H1995]] her graves [[H6913]] round about [[H5439]] him: all [[H3605]] of them uncircumcised, [[H6189]] slain [[H2491]] by the sword: [[H2719]] though [[H3588]] their terror [[H2851]] was caused [[H5414]] in the land [[H776]] of the living, [[H2416]] yet have they borne [[H5375]] their shame [[H3639]] with [[H854]] them that go down [[H3381]] to the pit: [[H953]] he is put [[H5414]] in the midst [[H8432]] of slain. [[H2491]]

### 26
There [[H8033]] Meshech, [[H4902]] Tubal, [[H8422]] and all [[H3605]] her multitude: [[H1995]] her graves [[H6913]] round about [[H5439]] him: all [[H3605]] of them uncircumcised, [[H6189]] slain [[H2490]] by the sword, [[H2719]] though [[H3588]] they caused [[H5414]] their terror [[H2851]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 27
And they shall not [[H3808]] lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] the mighty [[H1368]] fallen [[H5307]] of the uncircumcised, [[H6189]] which [[H834]] are gone down [[H3381]] to hell [[H7585]] with their weapons [[H3627]] of war: [[H4421]] and they have laid [[H5414]] their swords [[H2719]] under [[H8478]] their heads, [[H7218]] but their iniquities [[H5771]] shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] their bones, [[H6106]] though [[H3588]] the terror [[H2851]] of the mighty [[H1368]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 28
Yea, thou [[H859]] shalt be broken [[H7665]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the uncircumcised, [[H6189]] and shalt lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] slain [[H2491]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 29
There [[H8033]] Edom, [[H123]] her kings, [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] her princes, [[H5387]] which [[H834]] with their might [[H1369]] are laid [[H5414]] by [[H854]] slain [[H2491]] by the sword: [[H2719]] they [[H1992]] shall lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] the uncircumcised, [[H6189]] and with [[H854]] them that go down [[H3381]] to the pit. [[H953]]

### 30
There [[H8033]] the princes [[H5257]] of the north, [[H6828]] all [[H3605]] of them, and all [[H3605]] the Zidonians, [[H6722]] which [[H834]] are gone down [[H3381]] with [[H854]] the slain; [[H2491]] with their terror [[H2851]] they are ashamed [[H954]] of their might; [[H1369]] and they lie [[H7901]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] with [[H854]] slain [[H2491]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and bear [[H5375]] their shame [[H3639]] with [[H854]] them that go down [[H3381]] to the pit. [[H953]]

### 31
Pharaoh [[H6547]] shall see [[H7200]] them, and shall be comforted [[H5162]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his multitude, [[H1995]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his army [[H2428]] slain [[H2491]] by the sword, [[H2719]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] I have caused [[H5414]] my terror [[H2851]] in the land [[H776]] of the living: [[H2416]] and he shall be laid [[H7901]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the uncircumcised [[H6189]] with [[H854]] slain [[H2491]] with the sword, [[H2719]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his multitude, [[H1995]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God.
