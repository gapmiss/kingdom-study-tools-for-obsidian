### 1
Then came [[H935]] certain [[H582]] of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] me, and sat [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] me. [[H6440]]

### 2
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 3
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] have set up [[H5927]] their idols [[H1544]] in [[H5921]] their heart, [[H3820]] and put [[H5414]] the stumblingblock [[H4383]] of their iniquity [[H5771]] before [[H5227]] their face: [[H6440]] should I be inquired [[H1875]] of at all [[H1875]] by them? [[H1875]]

### 4
Therefore [[H3651]] speak [[H1696]] unto them, and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Every man [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] setteth up [[H5927]] his idols [[H1544]] in [[H413]] his heart, [[H3820]] and putteth [[H7760]] the stumblingblock [[H4383]] of his iniquity [[H5771]] before [[H5227]] his face, [[H6440]] and cometh [[H935]] to [[H413]] the prophet; [[H5030]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] will answer [[H6030]] him that cometh according to the multitude [[H7230]] of his idols; [[H1544]]

### 5
That [[H4616]] I may take [[H8610]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] in their own heart, [[H3820]] because [[H834]] they are all [[H3605]] estranged [[H2114]] from [[H5921]] me through their idols. [[H1544]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Repent, [[H7725]] and turn [[H7725]] from [[H5921]] your idols; [[H1544]] and turn away [[H7725]] your faces [[H6440]] from [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] your abominations. [[H8441]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] every one [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] or of the stranger [[H1616]] that [[H834]] sojourneth [[H1481]] in Israel, [[H3478]] which separateth himself [[H5144]] from me, [[H310]] and setteth up [[H5927]] his idols [[H1544]] in [[H413]] his heart, [[H3820]] and putteth [[H7760]] the stumblingblock [[H4383]] of his iniquity [[H5771]] before [[H5227]] his face, [[H6440]] and cometh [[H935]] to [[H413]] a prophet [[H5030]] to inquire [[H1875]] of him concerning me; I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] will answer [[H6030]] him by myself: [[H6030]]

### 8
And I will set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] against that [[H1931]] man, [[H376]] and will make [[H8074]] him a sign [[H226]] and a proverb, [[H4912]] and I will cut him off [[H3772]] from the midst [[H8432]] of my people; [[H5971]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And if [[H3588]] the prophet [[H5030]] be deceived [[H6601]] when he hath spoken [[H1696]] a thing, [[H1697]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have deceived [[H6601]] that [[H1931]] prophet, [[H5030]] and I will stretch out [[H5186]] my hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] him, and will destroy [[H8045]] him from the midst [[H8432]] of my people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 10
And they shall bear [[H5375]] the punishment of their iniquity: [[H5771]] the punishment [[H5771]] of the prophet [[H5030]] shall be [[H1961]] even as the punishment [[H5771]] of him that seeketh [[H1875]]

### 11
That [[H4616]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] may go no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] astray [[H8582]] from [[H310]] me, neither [[H3808]] be polluted [[H2930]] any more [[H5750]] with all [[H3605]] their transgressions; [[H6588]] but that they may be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] may be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 12
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] again to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 13
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] when [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] sinneth [[H2398]] against me by trespassing [[H4603]] grievously, [[H4604]] then will I stretch out [[H5186]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] it, and will break [[H7665]] the staff [[H4294]] of the bread [[H3899]] thereof, and will send [[H7971]] famine [[H7458]] upon it, and will cut off [[H3772]] man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] from [[H4480]] it: [[H4480]]

### 14
Though these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] men, [[H582]] Noah, [[H5146]] Daniel, [[H1840]] and Job, [[H347]] were [[H1961]] in it, [[H8432]] they [[H1992]] should deliver [[H5337]] their own souls [[H5315]] by their righteousness, [[H6666]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]

### 15
If [[H3863]] I cause noisome [[H7451]] beasts [[H2416]] to pass through [[H5674]] the land, [[H776]] and they spoil [[H7921]] it, so that it be [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8077]] that no man [[H1097]] may pass through [[H5674]] because [[H6440]] of the beasts: [[H2416]]

### 16
these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] in it, [[H8432]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] they [[H1992]] shall deliver [[H5337]] neither [[H518]] sons [[H1121]] nor [[H518]] daughters; [[H1323]] they only [[H905]] shall be delivered, [[H5337]] but the land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate. [[H8077]]

### 17
Or [[H176]] I bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] land, [[H776]] and say, [[H559]] Sword, [[H2719]] go through [[H5674]] the land; [[H776]] so that I cut off [[H3772]] man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] from [[H4480]] it: [[H4480]]

### 18
Though these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] in it, [[H8432]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] they shall deliver [[H5337]] neither [[H3808]] sons [[H1121]] nor daughters, [[H1323]] but [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] only [[H905]] shall be delivered [[H5337]] themselves. [[H5337]]

### 19
Or [[H176]] I send [[H7971]] a pestilence [[H1698]] into [[H413]] that [[H1931]] land, [[H776]] and pour out [[H8210]] my fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] it in blood, [[H1818]] to cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] it man [[H120]] and beast: [[H929]]

### 20
Though Noah, [[H5146]] Daniel, [[H1840]] and Job, [[H347]] in it, [[H8432]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] they [[H1992]] shall deliver [[H5337]] neither [[H518]] son [[H1121]] nor [[H518]] daughter; [[H1323]] they shall deliver [[H5337]] their own souls [[H5315]] by their righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] How much more [[H637]] when [[H3588]] I send [[H7971]] my four [[H702]] sore [[H7451]] judgments [[H8201]] upon [[H413]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the sword, [[H2719]] and the famine, [[H7458]] and the noisome [[H7451]] beast, [[H2416]] and the pestilence, [[H1698]] to cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] it man [[H120]] and beast? [[H929]]

### 22
Yet, behold, [[H2009]] therein shall be left [[H3498]] a remnant [[H6413]] that shall be brought forth, [[H3318]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters: [[H1323]] behold, [[H2009]] they shall come forth [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] you, and ye shall see [[H7200]] their way [[H1870]] and their doings: [[H5949]] and ye shall be comforted [[H5162]] concerning [[H5921]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I have brought [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] concerning [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have brought [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 23
And they shall comfort [[H5162]] you, when [[H3588]] ye see [[H7200]] their ways [[H1870]] and their doings: [[H5949]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] done [[H6213]] without cause [[H2600]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] in it, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God.
