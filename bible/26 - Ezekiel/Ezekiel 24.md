### 1
Again in the ninth [[H8671]] year, [[H8141]] in the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] in the tenth [[H6218]] of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] write [[H3789]]  thee [[H853]] the name [[H8034]] of the day, [[H3117]] of this [[H2088]] same [[H6106]] day: [[H3117]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] set [[H5564]] himself against [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] this [[H2088]] same [[H6106]] day. [[H3117]]

### 3
And utter [[H4911]] a parable [[H4912]] unto [[H413]] the rebellious [[H4805]] house, [[H1004]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Set on [[H8239]] a pot, [[H5518]] set on, [[H8239]] and also [[H1571]] pour [[H3332]] water [[H4325]] into it: [[H4325]]

### 4
Gather [[H622]] the pieces [[H5409]] thereof into [[H413]] it, every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] piece, [[H5409]] the thigh, [[H3409]] and the shoulder; [[H3802]] fill [[H4390]] with the choice [[H4005]] bones. [[H6106]]

### 5
Take [[H3947]] the choice [[H4005]] of the flock, [[H6629]] and burn [[H1754]] also [[H1571]] the bones [[H6106]] under [[H8478]] it, make it boil [[H7570]] well, [[H7571]] and [[H1571]] let them seethe [[H1310]] the bones [[H6106]] of it therein. [[H8432]]

### 6
Wherefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Woe [[H188]] to the bloody [[H1818]] city, [[H5892]] to the pot [[H5518]] whose [[H834]] scum [[H2457]] therein, and whose scum [[H2457]] is not [[H3808]] gone out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] it! bring it out [[H3318]] piece [[H5409]] by piece; [[H5409]] let no [[H3808]] lot [[H1486]] fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] her blood [[H1818]] is [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of her; she set [[H7760]] it upon [[H5921]] the top [[H6706]] of a rock; [[H5553]] she poured [[H8210]] it not [[H3808]] upon [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] to cover [[H3680]] it with dust; [[H6083]]

### 8
That it might cause fury [[H2534]] to come up [[H5927]] to take [[H5358]] vengeance; [[H5359]] I have set [[H5414]] her blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] the top [[H6706]] of a rock, [[H5553]] that it should not [[H1115]] be covered. [[H3680]]

### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Woe [[H188]] to the bloody [[H1818]] city! [[H5892]] I [[H589]] will even [[H1571]] make the pile [[H4071]] for fire great. [[H1431]]

### 10
Heap on [[H7235]] wood, [[H6086]] kindle [[H1814]] the fire, [[H784]] consume [[H8552]] the flesh, [[H1320]] and spice [[H7543]] it well, [[H4841]] and let the bones [[H6106]] be burned. [[H2787]]

### 11
Then set [[H5975]] it empty [[H7386]] upon [[H5921]] the coals [[H1513]] thereof, that [[H4616]] the brass [[H5178]] of it may be hot, [[H3179]] and may burn, [[H2787]] and the filthiness [[H2932]] of it may be molten [[H5413]] in it, [[H8432]] the scum [[H2457]] of it may be consumed. [[H8552]]

### 12
She hath wearied [[H3811]] with lies, [[H8383]] and her great [[H7227]] scum [[H2457]] went not forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] her: her scum [[H2457]] in the fire. [[H784]]

### 13
In thy filthiness [[H2932]] lewdness: [[H2154]] because [[H3282]] I have purged [[H2891]] thee, and thou wast not [[H3808]] purged, [[H2891]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] be purged [[H2891]] from thy filthiness [[H2932]] any more, [[H5750]] till [[H5704]]  I have caused [[H853]] my fury [[H2534]] to rest [[H5117]] upon thee. [[H5117]]

### 14
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]] it shall come to pass, [[H935]] and I will do [[H6213]] I will not [[H3808]] go back, [[H6544]] neither [[H3808]] will I spare, [[H2347]] neither [[H3808]] will I repent; [[H5162]] according to thy ways, [[H1870]] and according to thy doings, [[H5949]] shall they judge [[H8199]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 15
Also the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] behold, [[H2005]] I take away [[H3947]] from [[H4480]]  thee [[H853]] the desire [[H4261]] of thine eyes [[H5869]] with a stroke: [[H4046]] yet neither [[H3808]] shalt thou mourn [[H5594]] nor [[H3808]] weep, [[H1058]] neither [[H3808]] shall thy tears [[H1832]] run down. [[H935]]

### 17
Forbear [[H1826]] to cry, [[H602]] make [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] mourning [[H60]] for the dead, [[H4191]] bind [[H2280]] the tire of thine head [[H6287]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and put on [[H7760]] thy shoes [[H5275]] upon thy feet, [[H7272]] and cover [[H5844]] not [[H3808]] lips, [[H8222]] and eat [[H398]] not [[H3808]] the bread [[H3899]] of men. [[H376]]

### 18
So I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] in the morning: [[H1242]] and at even [[H6153]] my wife [[H802]] died; [[H4191]] and I did [[H6213]] in the morning [[H1242]] as [[H834]] I was commanded. [[H6680]]

### 19
And the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Wilt thou not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] us what [[H4100]] these [[H428]] to us, that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] doest [[H6213]]

### 20
Then I answered [[H559]] them, The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 21
Speak [[H559]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will profane [[H2490]] my sanctuary, [[H4720]] the excellency [[H1347]] of your strength, [[H5797]] the desire [[H4261]] of your eyes, [[H5869]] and that which your soul [[H5315]] pitieth; [[H4263]] and your sons [[H1121]] and your daughters [[H1323]] whom [[H834]] ye have left [[H5800]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 22
And ye shall do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] I have done: [[H6213]] ye shall not [[H3808]] cover [[H5844]] lips, [[H8222]] nor [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the bread [[H3899]] of men. [[H376]]

### 23
And your tires [[H6287]] upon [[H5921]] your heads, [[H7218]] and your shoes [[H5275]] upon your feet: [[H7272]] ye shall not [[H3808]] mourn [[H5594]] nor [[H3808]] weep; [[H1058]] but ye shall pine away [[H4743]] for your iniquities, [[H5771]] and mourn [[H5098]] one [[H376]] toward [[H413]] another. [[H251]]

### 24
Thus Ezekiel [[H3168]] is [[H1961]] unto you a sign: [[H4159]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] shall ye do: [[H6213]] and when this cometh, [[H935]] ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 25
Also, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] not [[H3808]] in the day [[H3117]] when I take [[H3947]]  from them [[H853]] their strength, [[H4581]] the joy [[H4885]] of their glory, [[H8597]] the desire [[H4261]] of their eyes, [[H5869]] and that whereupon they set [[H4853]] their minds, [[H5315]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters, [[H1323]]

### 26
he that escapeth [[H6412]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, to cause to hear [[H2045]] with ears? [[H241]]

### 27
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall thy mouth [[H6310]] be opened [[H6605]] to him which is escaped, [[H6412]] and thou shalt speak, [[H1696]] and be no more dumb: [[H481]] and thou shalt be [[H1961]] a sign [[H4159]] unto them; and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord.
