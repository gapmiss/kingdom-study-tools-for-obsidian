### 1
Moreover he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] eat [[H398]] that [[H834]] thou findest; [[H4672]] eat [[H398]] this [[H2063]] roll, [[H4039]] and go [[H1980]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
So I opened [[H6605]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and he caused me to eat [[H398]] that [[H2063]] roll. [[H4039]]

### 3
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] cause thy belly [[H990]] to eat, [[H398]] and fill [[H4390]] thy bowels [[H4578]] with [[H854]] this [[H2063]] roll [[H4039]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] give [[H5414]] thee. Then did I eat [[H398]] and it was [[H1961]] in my mouth [[H6310]] as honey [[H1706]] for sweetness. [[H4966]]

### 4
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] go, [[H1980]] get [[H935]] thee unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and speak [[H1696]] with my words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] a people [[H5971]] of a strange [[H6012]] speech [[H8193]] and of an hard [[H3515]] language, [[H3956]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]]

### 6
Not [[H3808]] to [[H413]] many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] of a strange [[H6012]] speech [[H8193]] and of an hard [[H3515]] language, [[H3956]] whose [[H834]] words [[H1697]] thou canst not [[H3808]] understand. [[H8085]] Surely, [[H518]] had I sent [[H7971]] thee to [[H413]] them, they [[H1992]] would have hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 7
But the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] will [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] thee; for [[H3588]] they will [[H14]] not [[H369]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me: for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] impudent [[H2389]] and hardhearted. [[H7186]]

### 8
Behold, [[H2009]] I have made [[H5414]] thy face [[H6440]] strong [[H2389]] against [[H5980]] their faces, [[H6440]] and [[H853]] thy forehead [[H4696]] strong [[H2389]] against [[H5980]] their foreheads. [[H4696]]

### 9
As an adamant [[H8068]] harder [[H2389]] than flint [[H6864]] have I made [[H5414]] thy forehead: [[H4696]] fear [[H3372]] them not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] be dismayed [[H2865]] at their looks, [[H6440]] though [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]]

### 10
Moreover he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] all [[H3605]] my words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I shall speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee receive [[H3947]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] and hear [[H8085]] with thine ears. [[H241]]

### 11
And go, [[H1980]] get [[H935]] thee to [[H413]] them of the captivity, [[H1473]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of thy people, [[H5971]] and speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, and tell [[H559]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] whether [[H518]] they will hear, [[H8085]] or whether [[H518]] they will forbear. [[H2308]]

### 12
Then the spirit [[H7307]] took me up, [[H5375]] and I heard [[H8085]] behind [[H310]] me a voice [[H6963]] of a great [[H1419]] rushing, [[H7494]] Blessed [[H1288]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] from his place. [[H4725]]

### 13
also the noise [[H6963]] of the wings [[H3671]] of the living creatures [[H2416]] that touched [[H5401]] one [[H802]] another, [[H269]] and the noise [[H6963]] of the wheels [[H212]] over against [[H5980]] them, and a noise [[H6963]] of a great [[H1419]] rushing. [[H7494]]

### 14
So the spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up, [[H5375]] and took me away, [[H3947]] and I went [[H1980]] in bitterness, [[H4751]] in the heat [[H2534]] of my spirit; [[H7307]] but the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was strong [[H2388]] upon [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 15
Then I came [[H935]] to [[H413]] them of the captivity [[H1473]] at Tel-abib, [[H8512]] that dwelt [[H3427]] by [[H413]] the river [[H5104]] of Chebar, [[H3529]] and I sat [[H3427]] where [[H8033]] they [[H1992]] sat, and remained [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] astonished [[H8074]] among [[H8432]] them seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]

### 16
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7097]] of seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] that the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 17
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] I have made [[H5414]] thee a watchman [[H6822]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] therefore hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] at my mouth, [[H6310]] and give them warning [[H2094]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 18
When I say [[H559]] unto the wicked, [[H7563]] Thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die; [[H4191]] and thou givest him not warning, [[H2094]] nor [[H3808]] speakest [[H1696]] to warn [[H2094]] the wicked [[H7563]] from his wicked [[H7563]] way, [[H1870]] to save his life; [[H2421]] the same [[H1931]] wicked [[H7563]] shall die [[H4191]] in his iniquity; [[H5771]] but his blood [[H1818]] will I require [[H1245]] at thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 19
Yet if [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] warn [[H2094]] the wicked, [[H7563]] and he turn [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] from his wickedness, [[H7562]] nor from his wicked [[H7563]] way, [[H1870]] he [[H1931]] shall die [[H4191]] in his iniquity; [[H5771]] but thou [[H859]] hast delivered [[H5337]] thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 20
Again, When a righteous [[H6662]] doth turn [[H7725]] from his righteousness, [[H6664]] and commit [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] and I lay [[H5414]] a stumblingblock [[H4383]] before [[H6440]] him, he [[H1931]] shall die: [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] thou hast not [[H3808]] given him warning, [[H2094]] he shall die [[H4191]] in his sin, [[H2403]] and his righteousness [[H6666]] which [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] shall not [[H3808]] be remembered; [[H2142]] but his blood [[H1818]] will I require [[H1245]] at thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 21
Nevertheless if [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] warn [[H2094]] the righteous [[H6662]] that the righteous [[H6662]] sin [[H2398]] not, [[H1115]] and he [[H1931]] doth not [[H3808]] sin, [[H2398]] he shall surely [[H2421]] live, [[H2421]] because [[H3588]] he is warned; [[H2094]] also thou [[H859]] hast delivered [[H5337]] thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 22
And the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] me; and he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Arise, [[H6965]] go forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the plain, [[H1237]] and I will there [[H8033]] talk [[H1696]] with [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 23
Then I arose, [[H6965]] and went forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the plain: [[H1237]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] stood [[H5975]] there, [[H8033]] as the glory [[H3519]] which [[H834]] I saw [[H7200]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H5104]] of Chebar: [[H3529]] and I fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] my face. [[H6440]]

### 24
Then the spirit [[H7307]] entered [[H935]] into me, and set [[H5975]] me upon [[H5921]] my feet, [[H7272]] and spake [[H1696]] with [[H854]] me, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Go, [[H935]] shut thyself [[H5462]] within [[H8432]] thine house. [[H1004]]

### 25
But thou, [[H859]] O son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] behold, [[H2009]] they shall put [[H5414]] bands [[H5688]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and shall bind [[H631]] thee with them, and thou shalt not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] among [[H8432]] them: [[H8432]]

### 26
And I will make thy tongue [[H3956]] cleave [[H1692]] to [[H413]] the roof of thy mouth, [[H2441]] that thou shalt be dumb, [[H481]] and shalt not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] to them a reprover: [[H376]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]]

### 27
But when I speak [[H1696]] with [[H854]] thee, I will open [[H6605]] thy mouth, [[H6310]] and thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] He that heareth, [[H8085]] let him hear; [[H8085]] and he that forbeareth, [[H2310]] let him forbear: [[H2308]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a rebellious [[H4805]] house.
