### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the eleventh [[H6249]] year, [[H8141]] in the first [[H259]] of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] because that [[H3282]] Tyrus [[H6865]] hath said [[H559]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Aha, [[H1889]] she is broken [[H7665]] the gates [[H1817]] of the people: [[H5971]] she is turned [[H5437]] unto [[H413]] me: I shall be replenished, [[H4390]] she is laid waste: [[H2717]]

### 3
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H5921]] thee, O Tyrus, [[H6865]] and will cause many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] to come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] thee, as the sea [[H3220]] causeth his waves [[H1530]] to come up. [[H5927]]

### 4
And they shall destroy [[H7843]] the walls [[H2346]] of Tyrus, [[H6865]] and break down [[H2040]] her towers: [[H4026]] I will also scrape [[H5500]] her dust [[H6083]] from [[H4480]] her, and make [[H5414]] her like the top [[H6706]] of a rock. [[H5553]]

### 5
It shall be [[H1961]] the spreading [[H4894]] of nets [[H2764]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the sea: [[H3220]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have spoken [[H1696]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3069]] and it shall become [[H1961]] a spoil [[H957]] to the nations. [[H1471]]

### 6
And her daughters [[H1323]] which [[H834]] in the field [[H7704]] shall be slain [[H2026]] by the sword; [[H2719]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H413]] Tyrus [[H6865]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] a king [[H4428]] of kings, [[H4428]] from the north, [[H6828]] with horses, [[H5483]] and with chariots, [[H7393]] and with horsemen, [[H6571]] and companies, [[H6951]] and much [[H7227]] people. [[H5971]]

### 8
He shall slay [[H2026]] with the sword [[H2719]] thy daughters [[H1323]] in the field: [[H7704]] and he shall make [[H5414]] a fort [[H1785]] against [[H5921]] thee, and cast [[H8210]] a mount [[H5550]] against [[H5921]] thee, and lift up [[H6965]] the buckler [[H6793]] against [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 9
And he shall set [[H5414]] engines [[H4239]] of war [[H6904]] against thy walls, [[H2346]] and with his axes [[H2719]] he shall break down [[H5422]] thy towers. [[H4026]]

### 10
By reason of the abundance [[H8229]] of his horses [[H5483]] their dust [[H80]] shall cover [[H3680]] thee: thy walls [[H2346]] shall shake [[H7493]] at the noise [[H6963]] of the horsemen, [[H6571]] and of the wheels, [[H1534]] and of the chariots, [[H7393]] when he shall enter [[H935]] into thy gates, [[H8179]] as men enter into [[H3996]] a city [[H5892]] wherein is made a breach. [[H1234]]

### 11
With the hoofs [[H6541]] of his horses [[H5483]] shall he tread down [[H7429]] all [[H3605]] thy streets: [[H2351]] he shall slay [[H2026]] thy people [[H5971]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and thy strong [[H5797]] garrisons [[H4676]] shall go down [[H3381]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 12
And they shall make a spoil [[H7997]] of thy riches, [[H2428]] and make a prey [[H962]] of thy merchandise: [[H7404]] and they shall break down [[H2040]] thy walls, [[H2346]] and destroy [[H5422]] thy pleasant [[H2532]] houses: [[H1004]] and they shall lay [[H7760]] thy stones [[H68]] and thy timber [[H6086]] and thy dust [[H6083]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the water. [[H4325]]

### 13
And I will cause the noise [[H1995]] of thy songs [[H7892]] to cease; [[H7673]] and the sound [[H6963]] of thy harps [[H3658]] shall be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] heard. [[H8085]]

### 14
And I will make [[H5414]] thee like the top [[H6706]] of a rock: [[H5553]] thou shalt be [[H1961]] to spread [[H4894]] nets [[H2764]] upon; thou shalt be built [[H1129]] no [[H3808]] more: [[H5750]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have spoken [[H1696]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 15
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] to Tyrus; [[H6865]] Shall not [[H3808]] the isles [[H339]] shake [[H7493]] at the sound [[H6963]] of thy fall, [[H4658]] when the wounded [[H2491]] cry, [[H602]] when the slaughter [[H2027]] is made [[H2026]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee? [[H8432]]

### 16
Then all [[H3605]] the princes [[H5387]] of the sea [[H3220]] shall come down [[H3381]] from [[H5921]] their thrones, [[H3678]] and lay away [[H5493]] their robes, [[H4598]] and put off [[H6584]] their broidered [[H7553]] garments: [[H899]] they shall clothe [[H3847]] themselves with trembling; [[H2731]] they shall sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] and shall tremble [[H2729]] at moment, [[H7281]] and be astonished [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 17
And they shall take up [[H5375]] a lamentation [[H7015]] for [[H5921]] thee, and say [[H559]] to thee, How [[H349]] art thou destroyed, [[H6]] inhabited [[H3427]] of seafaring men, [[H3220]] the renowned [[H1984]] city, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] wast [[H1961]] strong [[H2389]] in the sea, [[H3220]] she [[H1931]] and her inhabitants, [[H3427]] which [[H834]] cause [[H5414]] their terror [[H2851]] on all [[H3605]] that haunt [[H3427]] it! [[H3427]]

### 18
Now [[H6258]] shall the isles [[H339]] tremble [[H2729]] in the day [[H3117]] of thy fall; [[H4658]] yea, the isles [[H339]] that [[H834]] in the sea [[H3220]] shall be troubled [[H926]] at thy departure. [[H3318]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] When I shall make [[H5414]] thee a desolate [[H2717]] city, [[H5892]] like the cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] are not [[H3808]] inhabited; [[H3427]] when I shall bring up [[H5927]] the deep [[H8415]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and great [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] shall cover [[H3680]] thee; [[H3680]]

### 20
When I shall bring thee down [[H3381]] with [[H854]] them that descend [[H3381]] into the pit, [[H953]] with [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] of old time, [[H5769]] and shall set [[H3427]] thee in the low parts [[H8482]] of the earth, [[H776]] in places desolate [[H2723]] of old, [[H5769]] with [[H854]] them that go down [[H3381]] to the pit, [[H953]] that [[H4616]] thou be not [[H3808]] inhabited; [[H3427]] and I shall set [[H5414]] glory [[H6643]] in the land [[H776]] of the living; [[H2416]]

### 21
I will make [[H5414]] thee a terror, [[H1091]] and thou no [[H369]] though thou be sought for, [[H1245]] yet shalt thou never [[H5769]] be found [[H4672]] again, [[H5750]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]
