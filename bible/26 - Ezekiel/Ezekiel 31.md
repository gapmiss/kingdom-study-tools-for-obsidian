### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the eleventh [[H259]] year, [[H8141]] in the third [[H7992]] in the first [[H259]] of the month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and to [[H413]] his multitude; [[H1995]] Whom [[H413]] art thou like [[H1819]] in thy greatness? [[H1433]]

### 3
Behold, [[H2009]] the Assyrian [[H804]] a cedar [[H730]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] with fair [[H3303]] branches, [[H6057]] and with a shadowing [[H6751]] shroud, [[H2793]] and of an high [[H1362]] stature; [[H6967]] and his top [[H6788]] was [[H1961]] among [[H996]] the thick boughs. [[H5688]]

### 4
The waters [[H4325]] made him great, [[H1431]] the deep [[H8415]] set him up on high [[H7311]] with [[H854]] her rivers [[H5104]] running [[H1980]] round about [[H5439]] his plants, [[H4302]] and sent out [[H7971]] her little rivers [[H8585]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 5
Therefore [[H5921]] his height [[H6967]] was exalted [[H1361]] above all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field, [[H7704]] and his boughs [[H5634]] were multiplied, [[H7235]] and his branches [[H6288]] became long [[H748]] because of the multitude [[H7227]] of waters, [[H4325]] when he shot forth. [[H7971]]

### 6
All [[H3605]] the fowls [[H5775]] of heaven [[H8064]] made their nests [[H7077]] in his boughs, [[H5589]] and under [[H8478]] his branches [[H6288]] did all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] bring forth their young, [[H3205]] and under his shadow [[H6738]] dwelt [[H3427]] all [[H3605]] great [[H7227]] nations. [[H1471]]

### 7
Thus was he fair [[H3302]] in his greatness, [[H1433]] in the length [[H753]] of his branches: [[H1808]] for [[H3588]] his root [[H8328]] was [[H1961]] by [[H413]] great [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 8
The cedars [[H730]] in the garden [[H1588]] of God [[H430]] could not [[H3808]] hide [[H6004]] him: the fir trees [[H1265]] were not like [[H1819]] his boughs, [[H5589]] and the chesnut trees [[H6196]] were [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] like his branches; [[H6288]] nor [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] in the garden [[H1588]] of God [[H430]] was like [[H1819]] unto [[H413]] him in his beauty. [[H3308]]

### 9
I have made [[H6213]] him fair [[H3303]] by the multitude [[H7230]] of his branches: [[H1808]] so that all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of Eden, [[H5731]] that [[H834]] in the garden [[H1588]] of God, [[H430]] envied [[H7065]] him. [[H7065]]

### 10
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] thou hast lifted up [[H1361]] thyself in height, [[H6967]] and he hath shot up [[H5414]] his top [[H6788]] among [[H413]] the thick boughs, [[H5688]] and his heart [[H3824]] is lifted up [[H7311]] in his height; [[H1363]]

### 11
I have therefore delivered [[H5414]] him into the hand [[H3027]] of the mighty one [[H410]] of the heathen; [[H1471]] he shall surely [[H6213]] deal [[H6213]] with him: I have driven him out [[H1644]] for his wickedness. [[H7562]]

### 12
And strangers, [[H2114]] the terrible [[H6184]] of the nations, [[H1471]] have cut him off, [[H3772]] and have left [[H5203]] him: upon [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] and in all [[H3605]] the valleys [[H1516]] his branches [[H1808]] are fallen, [[H5307]] and his boughs [[H6288]] are broken [[H7665]] by all [[H3605]] the rivers [[H650]] of the land; [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] are gone down [[H3381]] from his shadow, [[H6738]] and have left [[H5203]] him. [[H5203]]

### 13
Upon [[H5921]] his ruin [[H4658]] shall all [[H3605]] the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven [[H8064]] remain, [[H7931]] and all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] his branches: [[H6288]]

### 14
To the end [[H4616]] that [[H834]] none [[H3808]] of all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] by the waters [[H4325]] exalt themselves [[H1361]] for their height, [[H6967]] neither [[H3808]] shoot up [[H5414]] their top [[H6788]] among [[H413]] the thick boughs, [[H5688]] neither [[H3808]] their trees [[H352]] stand up [[H5975]] in their height, [[H1363]] all [[H3605]] that drink [[H8354]] water: [[H4325]] for [[H3588]] they are all [[H3605]] delivered [[H5414]] unto death, [[H4194]] to [[H413]] the nether parts [[H8482]] of the earth, [[H776]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the children [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] with [[H413]] them that go down [[H3381]] to the pit. [[H953]]

### 15
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] In the day [[H3117]] when he went down [[H3381]] to the grave [[H7585]] I caused a mourning: [[H56]] I covered [[H3680]] the deep [[H8415]] for [[H5921]] him, and I restrained [[H4513]] the floods [[H5104]] thereof, and the great [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] were stayed: [[H3607]] and I caused Lebanon [[H3844]] to mourn [[H6937]] for [[H5921]] him, and all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] fainted [[H5969]] for [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 16
I made the nations [[H1471]] to shake [[H7493]] at the sound [[H6963]] of his fall, [[H4658]] when I cast him down [[H3381]] to hell [[H7585]] with [[H854]] them that descend [[H3381]] into the pit: [[H953]] and all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of Eden, [[H5731]] the choice [[H4005]] and best [[H2896]] of Lebanon, [[H3844]] all [[H3605]] that drink [[H8354]] water, [[H4325]] shall be comforted [[H5162]] in the nether parts [[H8482]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
They [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] went down [[H3381]] into hell [[H7585]] with [[H854]] him unto [[H413]] slain [[H2491]] with the sword; [[H2719]] and his arm, [[H2220]] dwelt [[H3427]] under his shadow [[H6738]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the heathen. [[H1471]]

### 18
To [[H413]] whom [[H4310]] art thou thus like [[H1819]] in glory [[H3519]] and in greatness [[H1433]] among the trees [[H6086]] of Eden? [[H5731]] yet shalt thou be brought down [[H3381]] with [[H854]] the trees [[H6086]] of Eden [[H5731]] unto [[H413]] the nether parts [[H8482]] of the earth: [[H776]] thou shalt lie [[H7901]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the uncircumcised [[H6189]] with [[H854]] slain [[H2491]] by the sword. [[H2719]] This [[H1931]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] his multitude, [[H1995]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]
