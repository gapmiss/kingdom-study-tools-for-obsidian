### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] again unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] thy face [[H6440]] against [[H413]] the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] them; [[H5921]]

### 3
And say [[H559]] unto the Ammonites, [[H1121]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] thou saidst, [[H559]] Aha, [[H1889]] against [[H413]] my sanctuary, [[H4720]] when [[H3588]] it was profaned; [[H2490]] and against [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] when [[H3588]] it was desolate; [[H8074]] and against [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] when [[H3588]] they went [[H1980]] into captivity; [[H1473]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2005]] therefore [[H3651]] I will deliver [[H5414]] thee to the men [[H1121]] of the east [[H6924]] for a possession, [[H4181]] and they shall set [[H3427]] their palaces [[H2918]] in thee, and make [[H5414]] their dwellings [[H4908]] in thee: they [[H1992]] shall eat [[H398]] thy fruit, [[H6529]] and they [[H1992]] shall drink [[H8354]] thy milk. [[H2461]]

### 5
And I will make [[H5414]] Rabbah [[H7237]] a stable [[H5116]] for camels, [[H1581]] and the Ammonites [[H1121]] a couchingplace [[H4769]] for flocks: [[H6629]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] thou hast clapped [[H4222]] hands, [[H3027]] and stamped [[H7554]] with the feet, [[H7272]] and rejoiced [[H8055]] in heart [[H5315]] with all [[H3605]] thy despite [[H7589]] against [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel; [[H3478]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2005]] therefore [[H3651]] I will stretch out [[H5186]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and will deliver [[H5414]] thee for a spoil [[H897]] to the heathen; [[H1471]] and I will cut thee off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] and I will cause thee to perish [[H6]] out of [[H4480]] the countries: [[H776]] I will destroy [[H8045]] thee; and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because that [[H3282]] Moab [[H4124]] and Seir [[H8165]] do say, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] like unto all [[H3605]] the heathen; [[H1471]]

### 9
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I will open [[H6605]] the side [[H3802]] of Moab [[H4124]] from the cities, [[H5892]] from his cities [[H5892]] on his frontiers, [[H7097]] the glory [[H6643]] of the country, [[H776]] Beth-jeshimoth, [[H1020]] Baal-meon, [[H1186]] and Kiriathaim, [[H7156]]

### 10
Unto the men [[H1121]] of the east [[H6924]] with [[H5921]] the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and will give [[H5414]] them in possession, [[H4181]] that [[H4616]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] may not [[H3808]] be remembered [[H2142]] among the nations. [[H1471]]

### 11
And I will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] upon Moab; [[H4124]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because that [[H3282]] Edom [[H123]] hath dealt [[H6213]] against the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] by taking [[H5358]] vengeance, [[H5359]] and hath greatly [[H816]] offended, [[H816]] and revenged himself [[H5358]] upon them; [[H5358]]

### 13
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I will also stretch out [[H5186]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] Edom, [[H123]] and will cut off [[H3772]] man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] from [[H4480]] it; and I will make [[H5414]] it desolate [[H2723]] from Teman; [[H8487]] and they of Dedan [[H1719]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 14
And I will lay [[H5414]] my vengeance [[H5360]] upon Edom [[H123]] by the hand [[H3027]] of my people [[H5971]] Israel: [[H3478]] and they shall do [[H6213]] in Edom [[H123]] according to mine anger [[H639]] and according to my fury; [[H2534]] and they shall know [[H3045]] my vengeance, [[H5360]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]

### 15
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Because [[H3282]] the Philistines [[H6430]] have dealt [[H6213]] by revenge, [[H5360]] and have taken [[H5358]] vengeance [[H5359]] with a despiteful [[H7589]] heart, [[H5315]] to destroy [[H4889]] for the old [[H5769]] hatred; [[H342]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will stretch out [[H5186]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] the Cherethims, [[H3774]] and destroy [[H6]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the sea [[H3220]] coast. [[H2348]]

### 17
And I will execute [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] vengeance [[H5360]] upon them with furious [[H2534]] rebukes; [[H8433]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I shall lay [[H5414]] my vengeance [[H5360]] upon them. [[H5360]]
