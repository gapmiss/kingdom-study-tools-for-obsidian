### 1
Again the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of thy people, [[H5971]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, When [[H3588]] I bring [[H935]] the sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] a land, [[H776]] if the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] take [[H3947]] a [[H259]] man [[H376]] of their coasts, [[H7097]] and set [[H5414]] him for their watchman: [[H6822]]

### 3
If when he seeth [[H7200]] the sword [[H2719]] come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]] he blow [[H8628]] the trumpet, [[H7782]] and warn [[H2094]] the people; [[H5971]]

### 4
Then whosoever [[H8085]] heareth [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] and taketh not warning; [[H2094]] if the sword [[H2719]] come, [[H935]] and take him away, [[H3947]] his blood [[H1818]] shall be [[H1961]] upon his own head. [[H7218]]

### 5
He heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] and took not warning; [[H2094]] his blood [[H1818]] shall be [[H1961]] upon him. But he [[H1931]] that taketh warning [[H2094]] shall deliver [[H4422]] his soul. [[H5315]]

### 6
But if [[H3588]] the watchman [[H6822]] see [[H7200]] the sword [[H2719]] come, [[H935]] and blow [[H8628]] not [[H3808]] the trumpet, [[H7782]] and the people [[H5971]] be not [[H3808]] warned; [[H2094]] if the sword [[H2719]] come, [[H935]] and take [[H3947]] person [[H5315]] from among them, he [[H1931]] is taken away [[H3947]] in his iniquity; [[H5771]] but his blood [[H1818]] will I require [[H1875]] at the watchman's [[H6822]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 7
So thou, [[H859]] O son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] I have set [[H5414]] thee a watchman [[H6822]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] therefore thou shalt hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] at my mouth, [[H6310]] and warn [[H2094]] them from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 8
When I say [[H559]] unto the wicked, [[H7563]] O wicked [[H7563]] thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die; [[H4191]] if thou dost not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] to warn [[H2094]] the wicked [[H7563]] from his way, [[H1870]] that [[H1931]] wicked [[H7563]] shall die [[H4191]] in his iniquity; [[H5771]] but his blood [[H1818]] will I require [[H1245]] at thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 9
Nevertheless, if [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] warn [[H2094]] the wicked [[H7563]] of his way [[H1870]] to turn [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] it; if he do not [[H3808]] turn [[H7725]] from his way, [[H1870]] he [[H1931]] shall die [[H4191]] in his iniquity; [[H5771]] but thou [[H859]] hast delivered [[H5337]] thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 10
Therefore, O thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Thus [[H3651]] ye speak, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]] If [[H3588]] our transgressions [[H6588]] and our sins [[H2403]] upon [[H5921]] us, and we [[H587]] pine away [[H4743]] in them, how [[H349]] should we then live? [[H2421]]

### 11
Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] I have no pleasure [[H2654]] in the death [[H4194]] of the wicked; [[H7563]] but [[H3588]] that the wicked [[H7563]] turn [[H7725]] from his way [[H1870]] and live: [[H2421]] turn [[H7725]] ye, turn [[H7725]] ye from your evil [[H7451]] ways; [[H1870]] for why [[H4100]] will ye die, [[H4191]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 12
Therefore, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of thy people, [[H5971]] The righteousness [[H6666]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shall not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] him in the day [[H3117]] of his transgression: [[H6588]] as for the wickedness [[H7564]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] he shall not [[H3808]] fall [[H3782]] thereby in the day [[H3117]] that he turneth [[H7725]] from his wickedness; [[H7562]] neither [[H3808]] shall the righteous [[H6662]] be able [[H3201]] to live [[H2421]] for his in the day [[H3117]] that he sinneth. [[H2398]]

### 13
When I shall say [[H559]] to the righteous, [[H6662]] he shall surely [[H2421]] live; [[H2421]] if he [[H1931]] trust [[H982]] to [[H5921]] his own righteousness, [[H6666]] and commit [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] all [[H3605]] his righteousnesses [[H6666]] shall not [[H3808]] be remembered; [[H2142]] but for his iniquity [[H5766]] that [[H834]] he hath committed, [[H6213]] he shall die [[H4191]] for it. [[H4191]]

### 14
Again, when I say [[H559]] unto the wicked, [[H7563]] Thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die; [[H4191]] if he turn [[H7725]] from his sin, [[H2403]] and do [[H6213]] that which is lawful [[H4941]] and right; [[H6666]]

### 15
the wicked [[H7563]] restore [[H7725]] the pledge, [[H2258]] give again [[H7999]] that he had robbed, [[H1500]] walk [[H1980]] in the statutes [[H2708]] of life, [[H2416]] without [[H1115]] committing [[H6213]] iniquity; [[H5766]] he shall surely [[H2421]] live, [[H2421]] he shall not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 16
None [[H3808]] of his sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] he hath committed [[H2398]] shall be mentioned [[H2142]] unto him: he hath done [[H6213]] that which is lawful [[H4941]] and right; [[H6666]] he shall surely [[H2421]] live. [[H2421]]

### 17
Yet the children [[H1121]] of thy people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] The way [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H136]] is not equal: [[H8505]] but as for them, [[H1992]] their way [[H1870]] is not equal. [[H8505]]

### 18
When the righteous [[H6662]] turneth [[H7725]] from his righteousness, [[H6666]] and committeth [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] he shall even die [[H4191]] thereby. [[H4191]]

### 19
But if the wicked [[H7563]] turn [[H7725]] from his wickedness, [[H7564]] and do [[H6213]] that which is lawful [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]] he [[H1931]] shall live [[H2421]] thereby. [[H2421]]

### 20
Yet ye say, [[H559]] The way [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H136]] is not equal. [[H8505]] O ye house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I will judge [[H8199]] you every one [[H376]] after his ways. [[H1870]]

### 21
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of our captivity, [[H1546]] in the tenth [[H6224]] in the fifth [[H2568]] of the month, [[H2320]] one that had escaped [[H6412]] out of Jerusalem [[H3389]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] The city [[H5892]] is smitten. [[H5221]]

### 22
Now the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] me in the evening, [[H6153]] afore [[H6440]] he that was escaped [[H6412]] came; [[H935]] and had opened [[H6605]] my mouth, [[H6310]] until [[H5704]] he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] me in the morning; [[H1242]] and my mouth [[H6310]] was opened, [[H6605]] and I was no more dumb. [[H481]]

### 23
Then the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 24
Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] they that inhabit [[H3427]] those [[H428]] wastes [[H2723]] of [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel [[H3478]] speak, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]] Abraham [[H85]] was [[H1961]] one, [[H259]] and he inherited [[H3423]] the land: [[H776]] but we [[H587]] many; [[H7227]] the land [[H776]] is given [[H5414]] us for inheritance. [[H4181]]

### 25
Wherefore [[H3651]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] Ye eat [[H398]] with [[H5921]] the blood, [[H1818]] and lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] toward [[H413]] your idols, [[H1544]] and shed [[H8210]] blood: [[H1818]] and shall ye possess [[H3423]] the land? [[H776]]

### 26
Ye stand [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] your sword, [[H2719]] ye work [[H6213]] abomination, [[H8441]] and ye defile [[H2930]] every one [[H376]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife: [[H802]] and shall ye possess [[H3423]] the land? [[H776]]

### 27
Say [[H559]] thou thus [[H3541]] unto them, [[H413]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] surely [[H518]] they that [[H834]] in the wastes [[H2723]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and him that [[H834]] in [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field [[H7704]] will I give [[H5414]] to the beasts [[H2416]] to be devoured, [[H398]] and they that [[H834]] in the forts [[H4679]] and in the caves [[H4631]] shall die [[H4191]] of the pestilence. [[H1698]]

### 28
For I will lay [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] most [[H4923]] desolate, [[H8077]] and the pomp [[H1347]] of her strength [[H5797]] shall cease; [[H7673]] and the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall be desolate, [[H8074]] that none [[H369]] shall pass through. [[H5674]]

### 29
Then shall they know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I have laid [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] most [[H4923]] desolate [[H8077]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their abominations [[H8441]] which [[H834]] they have committed. [[H6213]]

### 30
Also, thou [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] the children [[H1121]] of thy people [[H5971]] still are talking [[H1696]] against thee by [[H681]] the walls [[H7023]] and in the doors [[H6607]] of the houses, [[H1004]] and speak [[H1696]] one [[H2297]] to another, [[H259]] every one [[H376]] to his brother, [[H251]] saying, [[H559]] Come, [[H935]] I pray you, [[H4994]] and hear [[H8085]] what [[H4100]] is the word [[H1697]] that cometh forth [[H3318]] from [[H854]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 31
And they come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee as the people [[H5971]] cometh, [[H3996]] and they sit [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] thee my people, [[H5971]] and they hear [[H8085]] thy words, [[H1697]] but they will not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] them: for [[H3588]] with their mouth [[H6310]] they [[H1992]] shew [[H6213]] much love, [[H5690]] their heart [[H3820]] goeth [[H1980]] after [[H310]] their covetousness. [[H1215]]

### 32
And, lo, [[H2005]] thou unto them as a very lovely [[H5690]] song [[H7892]] of one that hath a pleasant [[H3303]] voice, [[H6963]] and can play well [[H2895]] on an instrument: [[H5059]] for they hear [[H8085]] thy words, [[H1697]] but they do [[H6213]] them not. [[H6213]]

### 33
And when this cometh to pass, [[H935]] (lo, [[H2009]] it will come,) [[H935]] then shall they know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] a prophet [[H5030]] hath been [[H1961]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]
