### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me again, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
What [[H4100]] mean ye, that ye [[H859]] use [[H4911]] this [[H2088]] proverb [[H4912]] concerning [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] The fathers [[H1]] have eaten [[H398]] sour grapes, [[H1155]] and the children's [[H1121]] teeth [[H8127]] are set on edge? [[H6949]]

### 3
I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] ye shall not [[H518]] have [[H1961]] any more [[H5750]] to use [[H4911]] this [[H2088]] proverb [[H4912]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] souls [[H5315]] are mine; as the soul [[H5315]] of the father, [[H1]] so also the soul [[H5315]] of the son [[H1121]] is mine: the soul [[H5315]] that sinneth, [[H2398]] it [[H1931]] shall die. [[H4191]]

### 5
But if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] be [[H1961]] just, [[H6662]] and do [[H6213]] that which is lawful [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]]

### 6
hath not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] upon [[H413]] the mountains, [[H2022]] neither [[H3808]] hath lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes [[H5869]] to [[H413]] the idols [[H1544]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] neither [[H3808]] hath defiled [[H2930]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife, [[H802]] neither [[H3808]] hath come near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] a menstruous [[H5079]] woman, [[H802]]

### 7
And hath not [[H3808]] oppressed [[H3238]] any, [[H376]] hath restored [[H7725]] to the debtor [[H2326]] his pledge, [[H2258]] hath spoiled [[H1497]] none [[H3808]] by violence, [[H1500]] hath given [[H5414]] his bread [[H3899]] to the hungry, [[H7457]] and hath covered [[H3680]] the naked [[H5903]] with a garment; [[H899]]

### 8
He hath not [[H3808]] given forth [[H5414]] upon usury, [[H5392]] neither [[H3808]] hath taken [[H3947]] any increase, [[H8636]] hath withdrawn [[H7725]] his hand [[H3027]] from iniquity, [[H5766]] hath executed [[H6213]] true [[H571]] judgment [[H4941]] between [[H996]] man [[H376]] and man, [[H376]]

### 9
Hath walked [[H1980]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] and hath kept [[H8104]] my judgments, [[H4941]] to deal [[H6213]] truly; [[H571]] he [[H1931]] just, [[H6662]] he shall surely [[H2421]] live, [[H2421]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 10
If he beget [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] a robber, [[H6530]] a shedder [[H8210]] of blood, [[H1818]] and doeth [[H6213]] the like [[H251]] to one [[H259]] of these [[H428]]

### 11
And that [[H1931]] doeth [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] of those [[H428]] but [[H3588]] even [[H1571]] hath eaten [[H398]] upon [[H413]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and defiled [[H2930]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife, [[H802]]

### 12
Hath oppressed [[H3238]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] hath spoiled [[H1497]] by violence, [[H1500]] hath not [[H3808]] restored [[H7725]] the pledge, [[H2258]] and hath lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes [[H5869]] to [[H413]] the idols, [[H1544]] hath committed [[H6213]] abomination, [[H8441]]

### 13
Hath given forth [[H5414]] upon usury, [[H5392]] and hath taken [[H3947]] increase: [[H8636]] shall he then live? [[H2425]] he shall not [[H3808]] live: [[H2421]] he hath done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] abominations; [[H8441]] he shall surely [[H4191]] die; [[H4191]] his blood [[H1818]] shall be [[H1961]] upon him. [[H1961]]

### 14
Now, lo, [[H2009]] he beget [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] that seeth [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] his father's [[H1]] sins [[H2403]] which [[H834]] he hath done, [[H6213]] and considereth, [[H7200]] and doeth [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] such like, [[H2004]]

### 15
hath not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] neither [[H3808]] hath lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes [[H5869]] to [[H413]] the idols [[H1544]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hath not [[H3808]] defiled [[H2930]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife, [[H802]]

### 16
Neither [[H3808]] hath oppressed [[H3238]] any, [[H376]] hath not [[H3808]] withholden [[H2254]] the pledge, [[H2258]] neither [[H3808]] hath spoiled [[H1497]] by violence, [[H1500]] hath given [[H5414]] his bread [[H3899]] to the hungry, [[H7457]] and hath covered [[H3680]] the naked [[H5903]] with a garment, [[H899]]

### 17
hath taken off [[H7725]] his hand [[H3027]] from the poor, [[H6041]] hath not [[H3808]] received [[H3947]] usury [[H5392]] nor increase, [[H8636]] hath executed [[H6213]] my judgments, [[H4941]] hath walked [[H1980]] in my statutes; [[H2708]] he [[H1931]] shall not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] for the iniquity [[H5771]] of his father, [[H1]] he shall surely [[H2421]] live. [[H2421]]

### 18
his father, [[H1]] because [[H3588]] he cruelly [[H6233]] oppressed, [[H6231]] spoiled [[H1497]] his brother [[H251]] by violence, [[H1499]] and did [[H6213]] which [[H834]] not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] among [[H8432]] his people, [[H5971]] lo, [[H2009]] even he shall die [[H4191]] in his iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 19
Yet say [[H559]] ye, Why? [[H4069]] doth not [[H3808]] the son [[H1121]] bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the father? [[H1]] When the son [[H1121]] hath done [[H6213]] that which is lawful [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]] hath kept [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and hath done [[H6213]] them, he shall surely [[H2421]] live. [[H2421]]

### 20
The soul [[H5315]] that sinneth, [[H2398]] it [[H1931]] shall die. [[H4191]] The son [[H1121]] shall not [[H3808]] bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the father, [[H1]] neither [[H3808]] shall the father [[H1]] bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the son: [[H1121]] the righteousness [[H6666]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] him, and the wickedness [[H7564]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 21
But if [[H3588]] the wicked [[H7563]] will turn [[H7725]] from all [[H3605]] his sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] he hath committed, [[H6213]] and keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and do [[H6213]] that which is lawful [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]] he shall surely [[H2421]] live, [[H2421]] he shall not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 22
All [[H3605]] his transgressions [[H6588]] that [[H834]] he hath committed, [[H6213]] they shall not [[H3808]] be mentioned [[H2142]] unto him: in his righteousness [[H6666]] that [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] he shall live. [[H2421]]

### 23
Have I any pleasure [[H2654]] at all [[H2654]] that the wicked [[H7563]] should die? [[H4194]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3069]] not [[H3808]] that he should return [[H7725]] from his ways, [[H1870]] and live? [[H2421]]

### 24
But when the righteous [[H6662]] turneth away [[H7725]] from his righteousness, [[H6666]] and committeth [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] doeth [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] that [[H834]] the wicked [[H7563]] doeth, [[H6213]] shall he live? [[H2425]] All [[H3605]] his righteousness [[H6666]] that [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] shall not [[H3808]] be mentioned: [[H2142]] in his trespass [[H4603]] that [[H834]] he hath trespassed, [[H4604]] and in his sin [[H2403]] that [[H834]] he hath sinned, [[H2398]] in them shall he die. [[H4191]]

### 25
Yet ye say, [[H559]] The way [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H136]] is not equal. [[H8505]] Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Is not [[H3808]] my way [[H1870]] equal? [[H8505]] are not [[H3808]] your ways [[H1870]] unequal? [[H8505]]

### 26
When a righteous [[H6662]] turneth away [[H7725]] from his righteousness, [[H6666]] and committeth [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] and dieth [[H4191]] in [[H5921]] them; for his iniquity [[H5766]] that [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] shall he die. [[H4191]]

### 27
Again, when the wicked [[H7563]] turneth away [[H7725]] from his wickedness [[H7564]] that [[H834]] he hath committed, [[H6213]] and doeth [[H6213]] that which is lawful [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]] he [[H1931]] shall save [[H2421]] his soul [[H5315]] alive. [[H5315]]

### 28
Because he considereth, [[H7200]] and turneth away [[H7725]] from all [[H3605]] his transgressions [[H6588]] that [[H834]] he hath committed, [[H6213]] he shall surely [[H2421]] live, [[H2421]] he shall not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 29
Yet saith [[H559]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] The way [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H136]] is not equal. [[H8505]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] are not [[H3808]] my ways [[H1870]] equal? [[H8505]] are not [[H3808]] your ways [[H1870]] unequal? [[H8505]]

### 30
Therefore [[H3651]] I will judge [[H8199]] you, O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] every one [[H376]] according to his ways, [[H1870]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]] Repent, [[H7725]] and turn [[H7725]] from all [[H3605]] your transgressions; [[H6588]] so iniquity [[H5771]] shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] your ruin. [[H4383]]

### 31
Cast away [[H7993]] from [[H5921]]  you [[H853]] all [[H3605]] your transgressions, [[H6588]] whereby [[H834]] ye have transgressed; [[H6586]] and make [[H6213]] you a new [[H2319]] heart [[H3820]] and a new [[H2319]] spirit: [[H7307]] for why [[H4100]] will ye die, [[H4191]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] I have no pleasure [[H2654]] in the death [[H4194]] of him that dieth, [[H4191]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3069]] wherefore turn [[H7725]] and live [[H2421]] ye. [[H2421]]
