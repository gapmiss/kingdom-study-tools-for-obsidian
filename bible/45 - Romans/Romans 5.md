### 1
Therefore [[G3767]] being justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] we have [[G2192]] peace [[G1515]] with [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 2
By [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] we have [[G2192]] access by [[G4318]] faith [[G4102]] into [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] grace [[G5485]] wherein [[G1722]] we stand, [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] rejoice [[G2744]] in [[G1909]] hope [[G1680]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] but [[G235]] we glory [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] tribulations [[G2347]] also: [[G2532]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] tribulation [[G2347]] worketh [[G2716]] patience; [[G5281]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] patience, [[G5281]] experience; [[G1382]] and [[G1161]] experience, [[G1382]] hope: [[G1680]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] hope [[G1680]] not [[G3756]] maketh [[G2617]] ashamed; [[G2617]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is shed abroad [[G1632]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] hearts [[G2588]] by [[G1223]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] which is given [[G1325]] unto us. [[G2254]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] when [[G5607]] we [[G2257]] were [[G5607]] yet [[G2089]] without strength, [[G772]] in due [[G2596]] time [[G2540]] Christ [[G5547]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] the ungodly. [[G765]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] scarcely [[G3433]] for [[G5228]] a righteous man [[G1342]] one [[G5100]] will [[G599]] die: [[G599]] yet [[G1063]] peradventure [[G5029]] for [[G5228]] a [[G3588]] good man [[G18]] some [[G5100]] even [[G2532]] would [[G5111]] dare [[G5111]] to die. [[G599]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] commendeth [[G4921]] his [[G1438]] love [[G26]] toward [[G1519]] us, [[G2248]] in that, [[G3754]] while [[G5607]] we [[G2257]] were [[G5607]] yet [[G2089]] sinners, [[G268]] Christ [[G5547]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] us. [[G2257]]

### 9
Much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] then, [[G3767]] being [[G1344]] now [[G3568]] justified [[G1344]] by [[G1722]] his [[G846]] blood, [[G129]] we shall be saved [[G4982]] from [[G575]] wrath [[G3709]] through [[G1223]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] if, [[G1487]] when we were [[G5607]] enemies, [[G2190]] we were reconciled [[G2644]] to [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] death of [[G2288]] his [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] much [[G4183]] more, [[G3123]] being reconciled, [[G2644]] we shall be saved [[G4982]] by [[G1722]] his [[G846]] life. [[G2222]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] we [[G2744]] joy [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] we have received [[G2983]] now [[G3568]] the [[G3588]] atonement. [[G2643]]

### 12
Wherefore, [[G1223]] as [[G5618]] by [[G1223]] one [[G1520]] man [[G444]] sin [[G266]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] death [[G2288]] by [[G1223]] sin; [[G266]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] death [[G2288]] passed [[G1330]] upon [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] men, [[G444]] for [[G1909]] that [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] have sinned: [[G264]]

### 13
(For [[G1063]] until [[G891]] the law [[G3551]] sin [[G266]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the world: [[G2889]] but [[G1161]] sin [[G266]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1677]] imputed [[G1677]] when there is [[G5607]] no [[G3361]] law. [[G3551]]

### 14
Nevertheless [[G235]] death [[G2288]] reigned [[G936]] from [[G575]] Adam [[G76]] to [[G3360]] Moses, [[G3475]] even [[G2532]] over [[G1909]] them that [[G3588]] had not [[G3361]] sinned [[G264]] after [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] similitude [[G3667]] of [[G76]] Adam's [[G76]] transgression, [[G3847]] who [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the figure [[G5179]] of him that [[G3588]] was to come. [[G3195]]

### 15
But [[G235]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] offence, [[G3900]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] free gift. [[G5486]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] through the [[G3588]] offence [[G3900]] of one [[G1520]] many [[G4183]] be dead, [[G599]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] by [[G1722]] grace, [[G5485]] by one [[G1520]] man, [[G444]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] hath abounded [[G4052]] unto [[G1519]] many. [[G4183]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] by [[G1223]] one [[G1520]] that sinned, [[G264]] the [[G3588]] gift: [[G1434]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2917]] by [[G1537]] one [[G1520]] to [[G1519]] condemnation, [[G2631]] but [[G1161]] the free [[G3588]] gift [[G5486]] of [[G1537]] many [[G4183]] offences [[G3900]] unto [[G1519]] justification. [[G1345]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] by [[G3900]] one man's [[G1520]] offence [[G3900]] death [[G2288]] reigned [[G936]] by [[G1223]] one; [[G1520]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] they which receive [[G2983]] abundance [[G4050]]  of [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1431]] gift [[G1431]] of shall [[G1343]] righteousness [[G1343]] reign [[G936]] in [[G1722]] life [[G2222]] by [[G1223]] one, [[G1520]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ.) [[G5547]]

### 18
Therefore [[G686]] as [[G5613]] by [[G1223]] the offence [[G3900]] of one [[G1520]] upon [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] to [[G1519]] condemnation; [[G2631]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] by [[G1223]] the righteousness [[G1345]] of one [[G1520]] upon [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] unto [[G1519]] justification [[G1347]] of life. [[G2222]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] by [[G1223]] one [[G1520]] man's [[G444]] disobedience [[G3588]] many [[G4183]] were made [[G2525]] sinners, [[G268]] so [[G3779]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] obedience of [[G5218]] one [[G1520]] shall be [[G2525]] many [[G4183]] made [[G2525]] righteous. [[G1342]]

### 20
Moreover [[G1161]] the law [[G3551]] entered, [[G3922]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] offence [[G3900]] might abound. [[G4121]] But [[G1161]] where [[G3757]] sin [[G266]] abounded, [[G4121]] grace did much more [[G5485]] abound: [[G5248]]

### 21
That [[G2443]] as [[G5618]] sin [[G266]] hath reigned [[G936]] unto [[G1722]] death, [[G2288]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] might [[G936]] grace [[G5485]] reign [[G936]] through [[G1223]] righteousness [[G1343]] unto [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Lord.
