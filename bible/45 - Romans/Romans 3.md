### 1
What [[G5101]] advantage [[G4053]] then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] hath [[G2453]] Jew? [[G2453]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] profit [[G5622]] of [[G4061]] circumcision? [[G4061]]

### 2
Much [[G4183]] every [[G3956]] way: [[G5158]] chiefly, [[G4412]] because [[G1063]] that [[G3754]] unto them were committed [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] oracles [[G3051]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] if [[G1487]] some [[G5100]] did not believe? [[G569]] their [[G846]] shall without effect? [[G2673]] unbelief [[G570]] make [[G2673]]  the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]]

### 4
God forbid: [[G1096]] yea, [[G1161]] let [[G1096]] God [[G2316]] be [[G1096]] true, [[G227]] but [[G1161]] every [[G3956]] man [[G444]] a liar; [[G5583]] as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] That [[G3704]] thou mightest be justified [[G1344]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] sayings, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] mightest overcome [[G3528]] when [[G1722]] thou [[G4571]] art judged. [[G2919]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] our [[G2257]] unrighteousness [[G93]] commend [[G4921]] the righteousness [[G1343]] of God, [[G2316]] what [[G5101]] shall we say? [[G2046]] God [[G2316]] unrighteous [[G94]] who [[G3588]] taketh [[G2018]] vengeance? [[G3709]] (I speak [[G3004]] as [[G2596]] a man) [[G444]]

### 6
God forbid: [[G1096]]  for [[G3361]] then [[G1893]] how [[G4459]] shall [[G2919]] God [[G2316]] judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world? [[G2889]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] hath more abounded [[G4052]] through [[G1722]] my [[G1699]] lie [[G5582]] unto [[G1519]] his [[G846]] glory; [[G1391]] why [[G5101]] yet [[G2089]] am I also [[G2504]] judged [[G2919]] as [[G5613]] a sinner? [[G268]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] (as [[G2531]] we be slanderously reported, [[G987]] and [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] affirm that [[G5346]] we [[G2248]] say,) [[G3004]] Let us do [[G4160]] evil, [[G2556]] that [[G2443]] good [[G18]] may come? [[G2064]] whose [[G3739]] damnation [[G2917]] is [[G2076]] just. [[G1738]]

### 9
What [[G5101]] then? [[G3767]] are we better [[G4284]] No, [[G3756]] in no wise: [[G3843]] for [[G1063]] we have before proved [[G4256]] both [[G2532]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G5037]] Gentiles, [[G1672]] that they are [[G1511]] all [[G3956]] under [[G5259]] sin; [[G266]]

### 10
As [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] There is [[G2076]] none [[G3756]] righteous, [[G1342]] no, not [[G3761]] one: [[G1520]]

### 11
There is [[G2076]] none [[G3756]] that understandeth, [[G4920]] there is [[G2076]] none [[G3756]] that seeketh after [[G1567]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
They are all [[G3956]] gone out of the way, [[G1578]] together [[G260]] they are become [[G889]] unprofitable; [[G889]] there is [[G2076]] none [[G3756]] that doeth [[G4160]] good, [[G5544]] no, [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] one. [[G1520]]

### 13
Their [[G846]] throat [[G2995]] an open [[G455]] sepulchre; [[G5028]] with [[G1100]] their [[G846]] tongues [[G1100]] they have used deceit; [[G1387]] the poison [[G2447]] of asps [[G785]] under [[G5259]] their [[G846]] lips: [[G5491]]

### 14
Whose [[G3739]] mouth [[G4750]] full [[G1073]] of cursing [[G685]] and [[G2532]] bitterness: [[G4088]]

### 15
Their [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] swift [[G3691]] to shed [[G1632]] blood: [[G129]]

### 16
Destruction [[G4938]] and [[G2532]] misery [[G5004]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] ways: [[G3598]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] the way [[G3598]] of peace [[G1515]] not [[G3756]] have they [[G1097]] known: [[G1097]]

### 18
There is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] fear [[G5401]] of God [[G2316]] before [[G561]] their [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]]

### 19
Now [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] what things soever [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] saith, [[G3004]] it saith [[G2980]] to them [[G3588]] before [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] who are under [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law: [[G3551]] that [[G2443]] every [[G3956]] mouth [[G4750]] may be stopped, [[G5420]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] world [[G2889]] may become [[G1096]] guilty [[G5267]] God. [[G2316]]

### 20
Therefore [[G1360]] by [[G1537]] the deeds [[G2041]] of the law [[G3551]] no [[G3756]] there shall be [[G1344]] flesh [[G4561]] justified [[G1344]] in [[G1799]] his [[G846]] sight: [[G1799]] for [[G1063]] by [[G1223]] the law [[G3551]] the knowledge [[G1922]] of sin. [[G266]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] the righteousness [[G1343]] of God [[G2316]] without [[G5565]] the law [[G3551]] is manifested, [[G5319]] being witnessed [[G3140]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets; [[G4396]]

### 22
Even [[G1161]] the righteousness [[G1343]] of God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] unto [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] them that believe: [[G4100]] for [[G1063]] there is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] difference: [[G1293]]

### 23
For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] have sinned, [[G264]] and [[G2532]] come short [[G5302]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]]

### 24
Being justified [[G1344]] freely [[G1432]] his [[G846]] by [[G5485]] grace [[G5485]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] redemption [[G629]] that [[G3588]] is [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus: [[G2424]]

### 25
Whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath set forth [[G4388]] a propitiation [[G2435]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] blood, [[G129]] to [[G1519]] declare [[G1732]] his [[G846]] righteousness [[G1343]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] remission of [[G3929]] sins [[G265]] that are past, [[G4266]] through [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] forbearance [[G463]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]]

### 26
To [[G4314]] declare, [[G1732]] at [[G1722]] this [[G3568]] time [[G2540]] his [[G846]] righteousness: [[G1343]] that [[G1519]] he [[G846]] might be [[G1511]] just, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] the justifier [[G1344]] of [[G1537]] him which [[G3588]] believeth [[G4102]] in Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 27
Where [[G4226]] boasting [[G2746]] then? [[G3767]] It is excluded. [[G1576]] By [[G1223]] what [[G4169]] law? [[G3551]] of [[G2041]] works? [[G2041]] Nay: [[G3780]] but [[G235]] by [[G1223]] the law [[G3551]] of faith. [[G4102]]

### 28
Therefore [[G3767]] we conclude that [[G3049]] a man [[G444]] is justified [[G1344]] by faith [[G4102]] without [[G5565]] the deeds [[G2041]] of the law. [[G3551]]

### 29
the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of the Jews [[G2453]] only? [[G3440]] not [[G3780]] also [[G2532]] of the Gentiles? [[G1484]] Yes, [[G3483]] of the Gentiles [[G1484]] also: [[G2532]]

### 30
Seeing [[G1897]] one [[G1520]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] shall justify [[G1344]] the circumcision [[G4061]] by [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] uncircumcision [[G203]] through [[G1223]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 31
then [[G3767]] Do we make [[G2673]] void [[G2673]] the law [[G3551]] through [[G1223]] faith? [[G4102]] God forbid: [[G1096]] yea, [[G235]] we establish [[G2476]] the law. [[G3551]]
