### 1
Therefore [[G1352]] thou art [[G1488]] inexcusable, [[G379]] O [[G5599]] man, [[G444]] whosoever thou art [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] judgest: [[G2919]] for [[G1063]] wherein [[G1722]] thou judgest [[G2919]] another, [[G2087]] thou condemnest [[G2632]] thyself; [[G4572]] for [[G1063]] thou that [[G3588]] judgest [[G2919]] doest [[G4238]] the [[G3588]] same things. [[G846]]

### 2
But [[G1161]] we are sure [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2917]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] according to [[G2596]] truth [[G225]] against [[G1909]] them which commit [[G4238]] such things. [[G5108]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] thinkest thou [[G3049]] this, [[G5124]] O [[G5599]] man, [[G444]] that judgest [[G2919]] them which do [[G4238]] such things, [[G5108]] and [[G2532]] doest [[G4160]] the same, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] shalt escape [[G1628]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2917]] of [[G2316]] God? [[G2316]]

### 4
Or [[G2228]] despisest thou [[G2706]] the [[G3588]] riches [[G4149]] of his [[G846]] goodness [[G5544]] and [[G2532]] forbearance [[G463]] and [[G2532]] longsuffering; [[G3115]] not knowing [[G50]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] goodness [[G5543]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] leadeth [[G71]] thee [[G4571]] to [[G1519]] repentance? [[G3341]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] after [[G2596]] thy [[G4675]] hardness [[G4643]] and [[G2532]] impenitent [[G279]] heart [[G2588]] treasurest up [[G2343]] unto thyself [[G4572]] wrath [[G3709]] against [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] of wrath [[G3709]] and [[G2532]] revelation [[G602]] of the righteous judgment [[G1341]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]]

### 6
Who [[G3739]] will render [[G591]] to every man [[G1538]] according to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] deeds: [[G2041]]

### 7
To them [[G3588]] who [[G3303]] by [[G2596]] patient continuance [[G5281]] in well [[G18]] doing [[G2041]] seek for [[G2212]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honour [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] immortality, [[G861]] eternal [[G166]] life: [[G2222]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] them [[G3588]] unto that are [[G2052]] contentious, [[G2052]] and [[G2532]] do not obey [[G544]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] but [[G1161]] obey [[G3982]] unrighteousness, [[G93]] indignation [[G2372]] and [[G2532]] wrath, [[G3709]]

### 9
Tribulation [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] anguish, [[G4730]] upon [[G1909]] every [[G3956]] soul [[G5590]] of man [[G444]] that doeth [[G2716]] evil, [[G2556]] of the Jew [[G2453]] first, [[G4412]] and [[G5037]] also [[G2532]] of the Gentile; [[G1672]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] glory, [[G1391]] honour, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] peace, [[G1515]] to every man [[G3956]] that worketh [[G2038]] good, [[G18]] to the Jew [[G2453]] first, [[G4412]] and [[G5037]] also [[G2532]] to the Gentile: [[G1672]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] there is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] respect of persons [[G4382]] with [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] as many as [[G3745]] have sinned [[G264]] without law [[G460]] also [[G2532]] shall [[G622]] perish [[G622]] without law: [[G460]] and [[G2532]] as many as [[G3745]] have sinned [[G264]] in [[G1722]] the law [[G3551]] shall be judged [[G2919]] by [[G1223]] the law; [[G3551]]

### 13
(For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] hearers [[G202]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] just [[G1342]] before [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] doers [[G4163]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] shall be justified. [[G1344]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] which have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] do [[G4160]] by nature [[G5449]] the things [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] contained in [[G3551]] law, [[G3551]] these, [[G3778]] having [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] the law, [[G3551]] are [[G1526]] a law [[G3551]] unto themselves: [[G1438]]

### 15
Which [[G3748]] shew [[G1731]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] written [[G1123]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] their [[G846]] conscience [[G4893]] also bearing witness, [[G4828]] and [[G2532]] thoughts [[G3053]] the mean while [[G3342]] accusing [[G2723]] or else [[G2228]] excusing [[G626]] one another;) [[G240]]

### 16
In [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] when [[G3753]] God [[G2316]] shall judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] secrets [[G2927]] of [[G444]] men [[G444]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] according to [[G2596]] my [[G3450]] gospel. [[G2098]]

### 17
Behold, [[G1492]] thou [[G4771]] art called [[G2028]] a Jew, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] restest [[G1879]] in [[G3551]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] makest thy boast [[G2744]] of [[G1722]] God, [[G2316]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] knowest [[G1097]] will, [[G2307]] and [[G2532]] approvest [[G1381]] the [[G3588]] things that are more excellent, [[G1308]] being instructed [[G2727]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] law; [[G3551]]

### 19
And [[G5037]] art confident that [[G3982]] thou thyself [[G4572]] art [[G1511]] a guide [[G3595]] of the blind, [[G5185]] a light [[G5457]] them [[G3588]] of which are [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] darkness, [[G4655]]

### 20
An instructor [[G3810]] of the foolish, [[G878]] a teacher [[G1320]] of babes, [[G3516]] which hast [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] form [[G3446]] of [[G1108]] knowledge [[G1108]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G225]] truth [[G225]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law. [[G3551]]

### 21
Thou [[G3767]] therefore [[G3767]] which teachest [[G1321]] another, [[G2087]] teachest thou [[G1321]] not [[G3756]] thyself? [[G4572]] thou that preachest [[G2784]] a man should not [[G3361]] steal, [[G2813]] dost thou steal? [[G2813]]

### 22
Thou that sayest [[G3004]] a man should not [[G3361]] commit adultery, [[G3431]] dost thou commit adultery? [[G3431]] thou that abhorrest [[G948]] idols, [[G1497]] dost thou commit sacrilege? [[G2416]]

### 23
Thou that [[G3739]] makest thy boast [[G2744]] of [[G1722]] the law, [[G3551]] through [[G1223]] breaking [[G3847]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] dishonourest thou [[G818]] God? [[G2316]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is blasphemed [[G987]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] through [[G1223]] you, [[G5209]] as [[G2531]] it is written. [[G1125]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] circumcision [[G4061]] verily [[G3303]] profiteth, [[G5623]] if [[G1437]] thou keep [[G4238]] the law: [[G3551]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] thou be [[G1510]] a breaker [[G3848]] of the law, [[G3551]] thy [[G4675]] circumcision is [[G4061]] made [[G1096]] uncircumcision. [[G203]]

### 26
Therefore [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] uncircumcision [[G203]] keep [[G5442]] the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1345]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law, [[G3551]] shall not [[G3780]] his [[G846]] uncircumcision be [[G203]] counted [[G3049]] for [[G1519]] circumcision? [[G4061]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] shall not [[G2919]] uncircumcision [[G203]] which is by [[G1537]] nature, [[G5449]] if it fulfil [[G5055]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] judge [[G2919]] thee, [[G4571]] who [[G3588]] by [[G1223]] the letter [[G1121]] and [[G2532]] circumcision [[G4061]] dost transgress [[G3848]] the law? [[G3551]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] he [[G3588]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] a Jew, [[G2453]] which is one [[G3588]] outwardly; [[G5318]] neither [[G3761]] circumcision, [[G4061]] which is [[G3588]] outward [[G5318]] in [[G1722]] the flesh: [[G4561]]

### 29
But [[G235]] he [[G3588]] a Jew, [[G2453]] which is one [[G3588]] inwardly; [[G2927]] and [[G2532]] circumcision [[G4061]] of the heart, [[G2588]] in [[G1722]] the spirit, [[G4151]] not [[G3756]] in the letter; [[G1121]] whose [[G3739]] praise [[G1868]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] of [[G1537]] God.
