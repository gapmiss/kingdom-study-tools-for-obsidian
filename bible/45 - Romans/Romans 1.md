### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] a servant [[G1401]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] called [[G2822]] an apostle, [[G652]] separated [[G873]] unto [[G1519]] the gospel [[G2098]] of God, [[G2316]]

### 2
(Which [[G3739]] he had promised afore [[G4279]] by [[G1223]] his [[G846]] prophets [[G4396]] in [[G1722]] the holy [[G40]] scriptures,) [[G1124]]

### 3
Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] Lord, [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Concerning [[G4012]] his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] which [[G3588]] was made [[G1096]] of [[G1537]] the seed [[G4690]] of David [[G1138]] according to [[G2596]] the flesh; [[G4561]]

### 4
And declared [[G3724]] the Son [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] with [[G1722]] power, [[G1411]] according to [[G2596]] the spirit [[G4151]] of holiness, [[G42]] by [[G1537]] the resurrection [[G386]] from the dead: [[G3498]]

### 5
By [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] we have received [[G2983]] grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] apostleship, [[G651]] for [[G1519]] obedience [[G5218]] to the faith [[G4102]] among [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] nations, [[G1484]] for [[G5228]] his [[G846]] name: [[G3686]]

### 6
Among [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] are [[G2075]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] the called [[G2822]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 7
To all [[G3956]] that be [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] Rome, [[G4516]] beloved [[G27]] of God, [[G2316]] called [[G2822]] saints: [[G40]] Grace [[G5485]] to you [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 8
First, [[G4412]] I [[G3303]] thank [[G2168]] my [[G3450]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] for [[G5228]] you [[G5216]] all, [[G3956]] that [[G3754]] your [[G5216]] faith is spoken [[G4102]] of [[G2605]] throughout [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world. [[G2889]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] witness, [[G3144]] whom [[G3739]] I serve [[G3000]] with [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] spirit [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of his [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] that [[G5613]] without ceasing [[G89]] I make [[G4160]] mention [[G3417]] of you [[G5216]] always [[G3842]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] prayers; [[G4335]]

### 10
Making request, [[G1189]] if by any means [[G1513]] now [[G2235]] at length [[G4218]] I might have a prosperous journey [[G2137]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] I long [[G1971]] to see [[G1492]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G2443]] I may impart [[G3330]] unto you [[G5213]] some [[G5100]] spiritual [[G4152]] gift, [[G5486]] to the end [[G1519]] ye [[G5209]] may be established; [[G4741]]

### 12
That [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] that I may be comforted together [[G4837]] with [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] mutual [[G240]] faith [[G4102]] both [[G2532]] of you [[G5216]] and [[G5037]] me. [[G1700]]

### 13
Now [[G1161]] I would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] you [[G5209]] have [[G50]] ignorant, [[G50]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] oftentimes [[G4178]] I purposed [[G4388]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] (but [[G2532]] was let [[G2967]] hitherto,) [[G891]] that [[G2443]] I might have [[G2192]] some [[G5100]] fruit [[G2590]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] also, [[G2532]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] among [[G1722]] other [[G3062]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 14
I am [[G1510]] debtor [[G3781]] both [[G2532]] to the Greeks, [[G1672]] and [[G5037]] to the Barbarians; [[G915]] both [[G2532]] to the wise, [[G4680]] and [[G5037]] to the unwise. [[G453]]

### 15
So, as much as [[G3779]] in [[G2596]] is, [[G1691]] me I am [[G1691]] ready [[G4289]] to preach the gospel [[G2097]] to you [[G5213]] that [[G3588]] are [[G1722]] at [[G1722]] Rome [[G4516]] also. [[G2532]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] I am [[G1870]] ashamed [[G1870]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ: [[G5547]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] the power [[G1411]] of God [[G2316]] unto [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] to every one [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] believeth; [[G4100]] to the Jew [[G2453]] first, [[G4412]] and [[G5037]] also [[G2532]] to the Greek. [[G1672]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] therein [[G1722]] the righteousness [[G1343]] is [[G601]] of God [[G2316]] revealed [[G601]] from [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] to [[G1519]] faith: [[G4102]] as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] The [[G3588]] just [[G1342]] shall live [[G2198]] by [[G1537]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] the wrath [[G3709]] of God [[G2316]] is revealed [[G601]] from [[G575]] heaven [[G3772]] against [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] ungodliness [[G763]] and [[G2532]] unrighteousness [[G93]] of men, [[G444]] who [[G3588]] hold [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] in [[G1722]] unrighteousness; [[G93]]

### 19
Because [[G1360]] that which may be known [[G1110]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] manifest [[G5318]] in [[G1722]] them; [[G846]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] hath shewed [[G5319]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] things [[G517]] invisible by [[G3588]] of him [[G846]] from [[G575]] the creation [[G2937]] of the world [[G2889]] are clearly seen, [[G2529]] being understood [[G3539]] the [[G3588]] things that are made, [[G4161]] his [[G846]] eternal [[G126]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] Godhead; [[G2305]] so that [[G1519]] they [[G846]] are [[G1511]] without excuse: [[G379]]

### 21
Because that, [[G1360]] when they knew [[G1097]] God, [[G2316]] they glorified [[G1392]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] God, [[G2316]] neither [[G2228]] were thankful; [[G2168]] but [[G235]] became vain [[G3154]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] imaginations, [[G1261]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] foolish [[G801]] heart [[G2588]] was darkened. [[G4654]]

### 22
Professing themselves [[G5335]] to be [[G1511]] wise, [[G4680]] they became fools, [[G3471]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] changed [[G236]] the [[G3588]] glory of [[G1391]] the [[G3588]] uncorruptible [[G862]] God [[G2316]] into [[G1722]] an image [[G1504]] made like to [[G3667]] corruptible [[G5349]] man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] to birds, [[G4071]] and [[G2532]] fourfooted beasts, [[G5074]] and [[G2532]] creeping things. [[G2062]]

### 24
Wherefore [[G1352]] God [[G2316]] also [[G2532]] gave up [[G3860]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] uncleanness [[G167]] through [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] lusts [[G1939]] of their own [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] to dishonour [[G818]] their own [[G846]] bodies [[G4983]] between [[G1722]] themselves: [[G1438]]

### 25
Who [[G3748]] changed [[G3337]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] into [[G1722]]  a [[G3588]] lie, [[G5579]] and [[G2532]] worshipped [[G4573]] and [[G2532]] served [[G3000]] the [[G3588]] creature [[G2937]] more than [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Creator, [[G2936]] who [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] blessed [[G2128]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 26
For [[G1223]] this cause [[G5124]] God [[G2316]] gave up [[G3860]] them [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] vile [[G819]] affections: [[G3806]] for [[G1063]] even [[G5037]] their [[G846]] women [[G2338]] did change [[G3337]] the [[G3588]] natural [[G5446]] use [[G5540]] into [[G1519]] that which is [[G3588]] against [[G3844]] nature: [[G5449]]

### 27
And [[G5037]] likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] men, [[G730]] leaving [[G863]] the [[G3588]] natural [[G5446]] the [[G3588]] use [[G5540]] of [[G2338]] woman, [[G2338]] burned [[G1572]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] lust [[G3715]] toward [[G1519]] one [[G240]] another; [[G240]] men [[G730]] with [[G1722]] men [[G730]] working [[G2716]] that [[G3588]] which is unseemly, [[G808]] and [[G2532]] receiving [[G618]] in [[G1722]] themselves [[G1438]] that [[G489]] recompence [[G489]] of [[G4106]] their [[G846]] error [[G4106]] which [[G3739]] was meet. [[G1163]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] even as [[G2531]] not [[G3756]] they did [[G1381]] like [[G1381]] to retain [[G2192]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] knowledge, [[G1922]] God over [[G2316]] gave [[G3860]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] a reprobate [[G96]] mind, [[G3563]] to do [[G4160]] those things [[G3588]] not [[G3361]] which are [[G2520]] convenient; [[G2520]]

### 29
Being filled with [[G4137]] all [[G3956]] unrighteousness, [[G93]] fornication, [[G4202]] wickedness, [[G4189]] covetousness, [[G4124]] maliciousness; [[G2549]] full [[G3324]] of envy, [[G5355]] murder, [[G5408]] debate, [[G2054]] deceit, [[G1388]] malignity; [[G2550]] whisperers, [[G5588]]

### 30
Backbiters, [[G2637]] haters of God, [[G2319]] despiteful, [[G5197]] proud, [[G5244]] boasters, [[G213]] inventors [[G2182]] of evil things, [[G2556]] disobedient [[G545]] to parents, [[G1118]]

### 31
Without understanding, [[G801]] covenantbreakers, [[G802]] without natural [[G794]] affection, [[G794]] implacable, [[G786]] unmerciful: [[G415]]

### 32
Who [[G3748]] knowing [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G1345]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] they which [[G3588]] commit [[G4238]] such things [[G5108]] are [[G1526]] worthy [[G514]] of death, [[G2288]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] do [[G4160]] the same, [[G846]] but [[G235]] have pleasure in [[G4909]] them that [[G3588]] do them. [[G4238]]
