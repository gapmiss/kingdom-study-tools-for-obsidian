### 1
every [[G3956]] Let be unto [[G5293]] soul [[G5590]] subject [[G5293]] the higher [[G5242]] powers. [[G1849]] For [[G1063]] there is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] power [[G1849]] but [[G3361]] of [[G575]] God: [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] powers [[G1849]] that be [[G5607]] are [[G1526]] ordained [[G5021]] of [[G5259]] God. [[G2316]]

### 2
Whosoever [[G3588]] therefore [[G5620]] resisteth [[G498]] the [[G3588]] power, [[G1849]] resisteth [[G436]] the [[G3588]] ordinance [[G1296]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] they that [[G3588]] resist [[G436]] shall receive [[G2983]] to themselves [[G1438]] damnation. [[G2917]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] rulers [[G758]] are [[G1526]] not [[G3756]] a terror [[G5401]] to [[G2041]] good [[G18]] works, [[G2041]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2556]] evil. [[G2556]] Wilt thou [[G2309]] then [[G1161]] not [[G3361]] be afraid of [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] power? [[G1849]] do [[G4160]] that which is good, [[G18]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt have [[G2192]] praise [[G1868]] of [[G1537]] the same: [[G846]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] he is [[G2076]] the minister [[G1249]] of God [[G2316]] to thee [[G4671]] for [[G1519]] good. [[G18]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] thou do [[G4160]] that which is [[G3588]] evil, [[G2556]] be afraid; [[G5399]] for [[G1063]] he beareth [[G5409]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] sword [[G3162]] upon him that [[G3588]] in [[G1500]] vain: [[G1500]] for [[G1063]] he is [[G2076]] the minister [[G1249]] of God, [[G2316]] a revenger [[G1558]] to [[G1519]] wrath [[G3709]] doeth [[G4238]] evil. [[G2556]]

### 5
Wherefore [[G1352]] must needs [[G318]] be subject, [[G5293]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] for [[G1223]] wrath, [[G3709]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] for [[G1223]]  conscience sake. [[G3588]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] for [[G1223]] this cause [[G5124]] pay ye [[G5055]] tribute [[G5411]] also: [[G2532]] for [[G1063]] they are [[G1526]] God's [[G2316]] ministers, [[G3011]] attending continually [[G4342]] upon [[G1519]] this [[G5124]] very thing. [[G846]]

### 7
Render [[G591]] therefore [[G3767]] to all [[G3956]] their [[G3588]] dues: [[G3782]] tribute [[G5411]] whom [[G3588]] to [[G5411]] tribute [[G5411]] custom [[G5056]] whom [[G3588]] to [[G5056]] custom; [[G5056]] fear [[G5401]] whom [[G3588]] to [[G5401]] fear; [[G5401]] honour [[G5092]] whom [[G3588]] to [[G5092]] honour. [[G5092]]

### 8
Owe [[G3784]] no man [[G3367]] any thing, [[G3367]] but [[G3361]] to love [[G25]] one another: [[G240]] for [[G1063]] he that loveth [[G25]] another [[G2087]] hath fulfilled [[G4137]] the law. [[G3551]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] this, [[G3588]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt commit [[G3431]] adultery, [[G3431]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G5407]] kill, [[G5407]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G2813]] steal, [[G2813]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt bear false [[G5576]] witness, [[G5576]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G1937]] covet; [[G1937]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] other [[G2087]] commandment, [[G1785]] it is briefly comprehended [[G346]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] saying, [[G3056]] namely, [[G1722]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] thy [[G4675]] neighbour [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] thyself. [[G1438]]

### 10
Love [[G26]] worketh [[G2038]] no [[G3756]] ill [[G2556]] his [[G3588]] to [[G4139]] neighbour: [[G4139]] therefore [[G3767]] love [[G26]] the fulfilling [[G4138]] of the law. [[G3551]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] that, [[G5124]] knowing [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] time, [[G2540]] that [[G3754]] now [[G2235]] high time [[G5610]] to awake [[G1453]] out of [[G1537]] sleep: [[G5258]] for [[G1063]] now [[G3568]] our [[G2257]] salvation [[G4991]] nearer [[G1452]] than [[G2228]] when [[G3753]] we believed. [[G4100]]

### 12
The [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] is far spent, [[G4298]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] is at hand: [[G1448]] let us cast [[G659]] therefore [[G3767]] off [[G659]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G4655]] darkness, [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] let us put on [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] armour [[G3696]] of [[G5457]] light. [[G5457]]

### 13
Let us walk [[G4043]] honestly, [[G2156]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] the day; [[G2250]] not [[G3361]] in rioting [[G2970]] and [[G2532]] drunkenness, [[G3178]] not [[G3361]] in chambering [[G2845]] and [[G2532]] wantonness, [[G766]] not [[G3361]] in strife [[G2054]] and [[G2532]] envying. [[G2205]]

### 14
But [[G235]] put ye on [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] make [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] provision [[G4307]] the [[G3588]] for [[G4561]] flesh, [[G4561]] to [[G1519]] the lusts [[G1939]]
