### 1
What [[G5101]] shall we say [[G2046]] then [[G3767]] that Abraham [[G11]] our [[G2257]] father, [[G3962]] as pertaining to [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] hath found? [[G2147]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] Abraham [[G11]] were justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] works, [[G2041]] he hath [[G2192]] to glory; [[G2745]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] before [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] scripture? [[G1124]] Abraham [[G11]] believed [[G4100]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] it was counted [[G3049]] unto him [[G846]] for [[G1519]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 4
Now [[G1161]] to him that worketh [[G2038]] the [[G3588]] is [[G3049]] reward [[G3408]] not [[G3756]] reckoned [[G3049]] of [[G2596]] grace, [[G5485]] but [[G235]] of [[G2596]] debt. [[G3783]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] to him that worketh [[G2038]] not, [[G3361]] but [[G1161]] believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] him [[G3588]] that justifieth [[G1344]] the [[G3588]] ungodly, [[G765]] his [[G846]] faith is [[G4102]] counted [[G3049]] for [[G1519]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 6
Even as [[G2509]] David [[G1138]] also [[G2532]] describeth [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] blessedness [[G3108]] the [[G3588]] of [[G444]] man, [[G444]] unto whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] imputeth [[G3049]] righteousness [[G1343]] without [[G5565]] works, [[G2041]]

### 7
Blessed [[G3107]] they whose [[G3739]] iniquities [[G458]] are forgiven, [[G863]] and [[G2532]] whose [[G3739]] sins are [[G266]] covered. [[G1943]]

### 8
Blessed [[G3107]] the man [[G435]] to whom [[G3739]] the Lord [[G2962]] will [[G3049]] not [[G3361]] impute [[G3049]] sin. [[G266]]

### 9
this [[G3778]] blessedness [[G3108]] then [[G3767]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] circumcision [[G4061]] or [[G2228]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] uncircumcision [[G203]] also? [[G2532]] for [[G1063]] we say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] faith [[G4102]] was reckoned [[G3049]] to Abraham [[G11]] for [[G1519]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 10
How [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] was it [[G3049]] reckoned? [[G3049]] when he was [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] circumcision, [[G4061]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] uncircumcision? [[G203]] Not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] circumcision, [[G4061]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] uncircumcision. [[G203]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] he received [[G2983]] the sign [[G4592]] of circumcision, [[G4061]] a seal [[G4973]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1343]] righteousness [[G1343]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4102]] faith [[G4102]] which [[G3588]]  being [[G1722]] uncircumcised: [[G203]] that [[G1519]] them that [[G3588]] he [[G846]] might be [[G1511]] the father [[G3962]] of all [[G3956]] believe, [[G4100]] though they be [[G1223]] not circumcised; [[G203]] that [[G1519]] might be [[G3049]] righteousness [[G1343]] imputed [[G3049]] unto them [[G846]] also: [[G2532]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] the father [[G3962]] of circumcision [[G4061]] to them who [[G3588]] are not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the circumcision [[G4061]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] who [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] walk [[G4748]] in the [[G3588]] steps [[G2487]] of [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of [[G3962]] our [[G2257]] father [[G3962]] Abraham, [[G11]] which being [[G1722]] that [[G3588]] uncircumcised. [[G203]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] promise, [[G1860]] that he [[G846]] should be [[G1511]] the [[G3588]] heir [[G2818]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] not [[G3756]] to Abraham, [[G11]] or [[G2228]] to [[G4690]] his [[G846]] seed, [[G4690]] through [[G1223]] the law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] through [[G1223]] the righteousness [[G1343]] of faith. [[G4102]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] they which [[G3588]] are of [[G1537]] the law [[G3551]] heirs, [[G2818]] faith [[G4102]] is made void, [[G2758]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] promise made of none [[G1860]] effect: [[G2673]]

### 15
Because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] worketh [[G2716]] wrath: [[G3709]] for [[G1063]] where [[G3757]] no [[G3756]] law [[G3551]] is, [[G2076]] no [[G3761]] transgression. [[G3847]]

### 16
Therefore [[G1223]] of [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] that [[G2443]] by [[G2596]] grace; [[G5485]] to the end [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] might be [[G1511]] sure [[G949]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] seed; [[G4690]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3588]] to [[G3440]] only [[G3440]] which is of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] to [[G2532]] that [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] which is of [[G1537]] the faith [[G4102]] of Abraham; [[G11]] who [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the father [[G3962]] of us [[G2257]] all, [[G3956]]

### 17
(As [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] I have made [[G5087]] thee [[G4571]] a father [[G3962]] of many [[G4183]] nations,) [[G1484]] before [[G2713]] him whom [[G3739]] he believed, [[G4100]] God, [[G2316]] who quickeneth [[G2227]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] calleth [[G2564]] those things which be [[G5607]] not [[G3361]] as [[G5613]] though they [[G5607]] were. [[G5607]]

### 18
Who [[G3739]] against [[G3844]] hope [[G1680]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] hope, [[G1680]] that [[G1519]] he [[G846]] might become [[G1096]] the father [[G3962]] of many [[G4183]] nations, [[G1484]] according to [[G2596]] that which was spoken, [[G2046]] So [[G3779]] shall [[G2071]] thy [[G4675]] seed [[G4690]] be. [[G2071]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] being [[G770]] weak [[G770]]  in [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] he considered [[G2657]] not [[G3756]] his [[G1438]] own [[G1438]] body [[G4983]] now [[G2235]] dead, [[G3499]] when he was [[G5225]] about [[G4225]] an hundred years old, [[G1541]] neither yet [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] deadness [[G3500]] of [[G3388]] Sarah's [[G4564]] womb: [[G3388]]

### 20
He staggered [[G1252]] not [[G3756]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of through [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] unbelief; [[G570]] but [[G235]] was strong [[G1743]]  in [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] giving [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] to [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] being fully persuaded [[G4135]] that, [[G3754]] what [[G3739]] he had promised, [[G1861]] he was [[G2076]] able [[G1415]] also [[G2532]] to perform. [[G4160]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] therefore [[G1352]] it was imputed [[G3049]] to him [[G846]] for [[G1519]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 23
Now [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] it was [[G1125]] written [[G1125]] for sake [[G1223]] his [[G846]] alone, [[G3440]] that [[G3754]] it was imputed [[G3049]] to him; [[G846]]

### 24
But [[G235]] for [[G1223]] us [[G2248]] also, [[G2532]] to whom [[G3739]] it shall [[G3195]] be imputed, [[G3049]]  if [[G3588]] we [[G4100]] believe [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] him [[G3588]] that raised up [[G1453]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] from [[G1537]] the dead; [[G3498]]

### 25
Who [[G3739]] was delivered [[G3860]] for [[G1223]] our [[G2257]] offences, [[G3900]] and [[G2532]] was raised again [[G1453]] for [[G1223]] our [[G2257]] justification. [[G1347]]
