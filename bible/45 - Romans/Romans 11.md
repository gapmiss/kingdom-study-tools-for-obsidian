### 1
I say [[G3004]] then, [[G3767]] Hath [[G3361]] God [[G2316]] cast away [[G683]] his [[G846]] people? [[G2992]] God forbid. [[G1096]] For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] also [[G2532]] am [[G1510]] an Israelite, [[G2475]] of [[G1537]] the seed [[G4690]] of Abraham, [[G11]] the tribe [[G5443]] of Benjamin. [[G958]]

### 2
God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] hath cast [[G683]] away [[G683]] his [[G846]] people [[G2992]] which [[G3739]] he foreknew. [[G4267]] Wot ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] saith [[G3004]] of [[G1722]] Elias? [[G2243]] how [[G5613]] he maketh intercession [[G1793]] to [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] against [[G2596]] Israel, [[G2474]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 3
Lord, [[G2962]] they have killed [[G615]] thy [[G4675]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] digged down [[G2679]] thine [[G4675]] altars; [[G2379]] and I [[G2504]] am left [[G5275]] alone, [[G3441]] and [[G2532]] they seek [[G2212]] my [[G3450]] life. [[G5590]]

### 4
But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] answer of God [[G5538]] unto him? [[G846]] I have reserved [[G2641]] to myself [[G1683]] seven thousand [[G2035]] men, [[G435]] who [[G3748]] not [[G3756]] have [[G2578]] bowed [[G2578]] the knee [[G1119]] to Baal. [[G896]]

### 5
Even so [[G3779]] then [[G3767]] at [[G1722]] this present [[G3568]] time [[G2540]] also [[G2532]] there is [[G1096]] a remnant [[G3005]] according to [[G2596]] the election [[G1589]] of grace. [[G5485]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] by grace, [[G5485]] then no more [[G3765]] of [[G1537]] works: [[G2041]] otherwise [[G1893]] grace [[G5485]] is [[G1096]] no more [[G3765]] grace. [[G5485]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] of [[G1537]] works, [[G2041]] then no [[G3765]] is it [[G2076]] more [[G3765]] grace: [[G5485]] otherwise [[G1893]] work [[G2041]] is [[G2076]] no more [[G3765]] work. [[G2041]]

### 7
What [[G5101]] then? [[G3767]] Israel [[G2474]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G2013]] obtained [[G2013]] that [[G5127]] which [[G3739]] he seeketh for; [[G1934]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] election [[G1589]] hath obtained it, [[G2013]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] were blinded [[G4456]]

### 8
(According as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] God [[G2316]] hath given [[G1325]] them [[G846]] the spirit [[G4151]] of slumber, [[G2659]] eyes [[G3788]] not [[G3361]] that they should [[G991]] see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] ears [[G3775]] that they should [[G191]] not [[G3361]] hear;) [[G191]] unto [[G2193]] this [[G4594]] day. [[G2250]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] David [[G1138]] saith, [[G3004]] Let be [[G1096]] their [[G846]] table [[G5132]] made [[G1096]] a [[G1519]] snare, [[G3803]] and [[G2532]] a [[G1519]] trap, [[G2339]] and [[G2532]] a [[G1519]] stumblingblock, [[G4625]] and [[G2532]] a [[G1519]] recompence [[G468]] unto them: [[G846]]

### 10
their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] Let be darkened, [[G4654]] that they may [[G991]] not [[G3361]] see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] bow down [[G4781]] their [[G846]] back [[G3577]] alway. [[G1275]]

### 11
I say [[G3004]] then, [[G3767]] Have they stumbled [[G4417]] that [[G2443]] they should fall? [[G4098]] God forbid: [[G1096]] but [[G235]] through [[G3900]] their [[G846]] fall [[G3900]] salvation [[G4991]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1484]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] for [[G1519]] to provoke to jealousy. [[G3863]] them [[G846]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] fall [[G3900]] of them [[G846]] the riches [[G4149]] of the world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] diminishing [[G2275]] of them [[G846]] the riches [[G4149]] of the Gentiles; [[G1484]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] their [[G846]] fulness? [[G4138]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] I speak [[G3004]] to you [[G5213]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] inasmuch [[G1909]] as [[G3745]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the apostle [[G652]] of the Gentiles, [[G1484]] I magnify [[G1392]] mine [[G3450]] office: [[G1248]]

### 14
If [[G1487]] by any means [[G4459]] I may provoke to emulation [[G3863]] my [[G3450]] flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] might save [[G4982]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them. [[G846]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the casting [[G3588]] away [[G580]] of them [[G846]] the reconciling [[G2643]] of the world, [[G2889]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] receiving [[G4356]] but [[G3361]] life [[G2222]] from [[G1537]] the dead? [[G3498]]

### 16
For [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] firstfruit [[G536]] holy, [[G40]] the [[G3588]] lump [[G5445]] also [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] holy, [[G40]] so [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] branches. [[G2798]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] some [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2798]] branches [[G2798]] be broken off, [[G1575]] and [[G1161]] thou, [[G4771]] being [[G5607]] a wild olive tree, [[G65]] wert graffed [[G1461]] in [[G1722]] among them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] with them [[G1096]] partakest [[G4791]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4491]] root [[G4491]] and [[G2532]] fatness [[G4096]] the [[G3588]] of olive [[G1636]] tree; [[G1636]]

### 18
Boast [[G2620]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] against [[G2798]] branches. [[G2798]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] thou boast, [[G2620]] thou [[G4771]] bearest [[G941]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] root, [[G4491]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 19
Thou wilt say [[G2046]] then, [[G3767]] The [[G3588]] branches [[G2798]] were broken off, [[G1575]] that [[G2443]] I [[G1473]] might be graffed in. [[G1461]]

### 20
Well; [[G2573]]  because of [[G3588]] unbelief [[G570]] they were broken off, [[G1575]] and [[G1161]] thou [[G4771]] standest [[G2476]]  by [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] not [[G3361]] Be [[G5309]] highminded, [[G5309]] but [[G235]] fear: [[G5399]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] spared [[G5339]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] natural [[G2596]] branches, [[G2798]] lest [[G3381]] also not [[G3761]] he [[G5339]] spare [[G5339]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 22
Behold [[G1492]] therefore [[G3767]] the goodness [[G5544]] and [[G2532]] severity [[G663]] of God: [[G2316]] on [[G1909]] them which [[G3588]] fell, [[G4098]] severity; [[G663]] but [[G1161]] toward [[G1909]] thee, [[G4571]] goodness, [[G5544]] if [[G1437]] thou continue in [[G1961]] goodness: [[G5544]] otherwise [[G1893]] thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] shalt be cut off. [[G1581]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] they [[G1565]] also, [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] they abide still [[G1961]] not [[G3361]]  in [[G3588]] unbelief, [[G570]] shall be graffed in: [[G1461]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] able [[G1415]] to graff in [[G1461]] them [[G846]] again. [[G3825]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] thou [[G4771]] wert cut out [[G1581]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] olive tree which is wild [[G65]] by [[G2596]] nature, [[G5449]] and [[G2532]] wert graffed [[G1461]] contrary to [[G3844]] nature [[G5449]] into [[G1519]] a good olive tree: [[G2565]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] these, [[G3778]] shall be into [[G1461]] which [[G3588]]  be [[G2596]] the natural [[G5449]] graffed [[G1461]] their own [[G2398]] olive tree? [[G1636]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] I would that [[G2309]] not, [[G3756]] brethren, [[G80]] ye [[G5209]] should be ignorant of [[G50]] this [[G5124]] mystery, [[G3466]] lest [[G2443]] ye should be [[G5600]] wise [[G5429]] in [[G3844]] your own conceits; [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] blindness [[G4457]] in [[G575]] part [[G3313]] is happened [[G1096]] to Israel, [[G2474]] until [[G891]] the [[G3588]] fulness [[G4138]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] Gentiles [[G1484]] be come in. [[G1525]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] all [[G3956]] Israel [[G2474]] shall be saved: [[G4982]] as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] There shall come [[G2240]] out of [[G1537]] Sion [[G4622]] the [[G3588]] Deliverer, [[G4506]] and [[G2532]] shall turn away [[G654]] ungodliness [[G763]] from [[G575]] Jacob: [[G2384]]

### 27
For [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] my [[G1700]] covenant [[G1242]] unto them, [[G846]] when [[G3752]] I shall take away [[G851]] their [[G846]] sins. [[G266]]

### 28
As concerning [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] enemies [[G2190]] for sakes: [[G1223]] your [[G5209]] but [[G1161]] as touching [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] election, [[G1589]] beloved [[G27]] for fathers' sakes. [[G1223]] the [[G3588]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] gifts [[G5486]] and [[G2532]] calling [[G2821]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] without repentance. [[G278]]

### 30
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] ye [[G5210]] in times past [[G4218]] have not believed [[G544]] God, [[G2316]] yet [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] have obtained [[G1653]] mercy [[G1653]] through [[G543]] their [[G5130]] unbelief: [[G543]]

### 31
Even so [[G3779]] these [[G3778]] have not [[G544]] also [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] believed, [[G544]] that [[G2443]] through your [[G5212]] mercy [[G1656]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] may obtain mercy. [[G1653]]

### 32
For [[G1063]] God hath [[G2316]] concluded [[G4788]] them all [[G3956]] in [[G1519]] unbelief, [[G543]] that [[G2443]] he might have mercy upon [[G1653]] all. [[G3956]]

### 33
O [[G5599]] the depth [[G899]] of the riches [[G4149]] both [[G2532]] of the wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] knowledge [[G1108]] of God! [[G2316]] how [[G5613]] unsearchable [[G419]] his [[G846]] judgments, [[G2917]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] ways past finding [[G3598]] out! [[G421]]

### 34
For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] hath known [[G1097]] the mind [[G3563]] of the Lord? [[G2962]] or [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] hath been [[G1096]] his [[G846]] counseller? [[G4825]]

### 35
Or [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] hath first given [[G4272]] to him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] it shall be recompensed again? [[G467]] unto him [[G846]]

### 36
For [[G3754]] of [[G1537]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] all things: [[G3956]] to whom [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
