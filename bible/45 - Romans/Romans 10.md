### 1
Brethren, [[G80]] my [[G1699]] heart's [[G2588]] desire [[G2107]] and [[G2532]] prayer [[G1162]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] Israel [[G2474]] is, [[G2076]] that [[G1519]] they might be saved. [[G4991]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] I bear record [[G3140]] them [[G846]] that [[G3754]] they have [[G2192]] a zeal [[G2205]] of God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] according to [[G2596]] knowledge. [[G1922]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] they being ignorant of [[G50]] God's [[G2316]] righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] going about [[G2212]] to establish [[G2476]] their [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] righteousness, [[G1343]] not [[G3756]] have themselves [[G5293]] submitted [[G5293]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1343]] righteousness [[G1343]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] Christ [[G5547]] the end [[G5056]] of the law [[G3551]] for [[G1519]] righteousness [[G1343]] to every one [[G3956]] that believeth. [[G4100]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] Moses [[G3475]] describeth [[G1125]] the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] which is [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] That [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] which doeth [[G4160]] those things [[G846]] shall live [[G2198]] by [[G1722]] them. [[G846]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] which is of [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] speaketh [[G3004]] on this wise, [[G3779]] Say [[G2036]] not [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] thine [[G4675]] heart, [[G2588]] Who [[G5101]] shall ascend [[G305]] into [[G1519]] heaven? [[G3772]] (that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] to bring down [[G2609]] Christ [[G5547]]

### 7
Or, [[G2228]] Who [[G5101]] shall descend [[G2597]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] deep? [[G12]] (that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] to bring up again [[G321]] Christ [[G5547]] from [[G1537]] the dead.) [[G3498]]

### 8
But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] saith it? [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] is [[G2076]] nigh [[G1451]] thee, [[G4675]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] mouth, [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] heart: [[G2588]] that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] of [[G4102]] faith, [[G4102]] which [[G3739]] we preach; [[G2784]]

### 9
That [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] thou shalt confess [[G3670]] with [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] mouth [[G4750]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] shalt believe [[G4100]] in [[G1722]] thine [[G4675]] heart [[G2588]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] hath raised [[G1453]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] thou shalt be saved. [[G4982]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] with the heart [[G2588]] man believeth [[G4100]] unto [[G1519]] righteousness; [[G1343]] and [[G1161]] with the mouth [[G4750]] confession is made [[G3670]] unto [[G1519]] salvation. [[G4991]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] saith, [[G3004]] Whosoever [[G3956]] believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G2617]] ashamed. [[G2617]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] there is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] difference [[G1293]] between [[G5037]] the Jew [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] the Greek: [[G1672]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Lord [[G2962]] over all [[G3956]] is rich [[G4147]] unto [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] that call upon [[G1941]] him. [[G846]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3956]]  shall call [[G3739]] upon [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the Lord [[G2962]] shall be saved. [[G4982]]

### 14
How [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] shall they call on him [[G1941]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] they have [[G4100]] believed? [[G4100]] and [[G1161]] how [[G4459]] shall they believe [[G4100]] in him of whom [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] they have [[G191]] heard? [[G191]] and [[G1161]] how [[G4459]] shall they hear [[G191]] without [[G5565]] a preacher? [[G2784]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] how [[G4459]] shall they preach, [[G2784]] except [[G3361]] they be sent? [[G649]] as [[G2531]] it is [[G1125]] written, [[G1125]] How [[G5613]] beautiful [[G5611]] are the [[G3588]] feet of them that preach [[G4228]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2097]] of peace, [[G1515]] and bring glad tidings [[G2097]] of good things! [[G18]]

### 16
But [[G235]] not [[G3756]] they have [[G5219]] all [[G3956]] obeyed [[G5219]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]] For [[G1063]] Esaias [[G2268]] saith, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G5101]] hath believed [[G4100]] our [[G2257]] report? [[G189]]

### 17
So then [[G686]] faith [[G4102]] by [[G1537]] hearing, [[G189]] and [[G1161]] hearing [[G189]] by [[G1223]] the word [[G4487]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 18
But [[G235]] I say, [[G3004]] Have they [[G191]] not [[G3756]] heard? [[G191]] Yes verily, [[G3304]] their [[G846]] sound [[G5353]] went [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] words [[G4487]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ends [[G4009]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3625]] world. [[G3625]]

### 19
But [[G235]] I say, [[G3004]] Did [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] Israel [[G2474]] know? [[G1097]] First [[G4413]] Moses [[G3475]] saith, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] will provoke to jealousy [[G3863]] you [[G5209]] by [[G1909]] no [[G3756]] people, [[G1484]] by [[G1909]] a foolish [[G801]] nation [[G1484]] I will anger [[G3949]] you. [[G5209]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] Esaias [[G2268]] is very bold, [[G662]] and [[G2532]] saith, [[G3004]] I was found [[G2147]] them [[G3588]] of that [[G2212]] sought [[G2212]] me [[G1691]] not; [[G3361]] I was made [[G1096]] manifest [[G1717]] them [[G3588]] unto that after [[G1905]] asked [[G1905]] not [[G3361]] me. [[G1691]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] to [[G4314]] Israel [[G2474]] he saith, [[G3004]] All [[G3650]] day [[G2250]] long I have stretched [[G1600]] forth [[G1600]] my [[G3450]] hands [[G5495]] unto [[G4314]] a disobedient [[G544]] and [[G2532]] gainsaying [[G483]] people. [[G2992]]
