### 1
I say [[G3004]] the truth [[G225]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] I lie [[G5574]] not, [[G3756]] my [[G3450]] conscience also witness [[G4893]] bearing [[G4828]] me [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]]

### 2
That [[G3754]] I [[G3427]] have [[G2076]] great [[G3173]] heaviness [[G3077]] and [[G2532]] continual [[G88]] sorrow [[G3601]] in [[G2588]] my [[G3450]] heart. [[G2588]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] could wish that [[G2172]] myself [[G846]] were [[G1511]] accursed [[G331]] from [[G575]] Christ [[G5547]] for [[G5228]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] my [[G3450]] kinsmen [[G4773]] according to [[G2596]] the flesh: [[G4561]]

### 4
Who [[G3748]] are [[G1526]] Israelites; [[G2475]] to whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] adoption, [[G5206]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] covenants, [[G1242]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] giving of the law, [[G3548]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] service [[G2999]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] promises; [[G1860]]

### 5
Whose [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] fathers, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] as concerning [[G2596]] the [[G4561]] flesh [[G4561]] Christ [[G5547]] who [[G3588]] is [[G5607]] over [[G1909]] all, [[G3956]] God [[G2316]] blessed [[G2128]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 6
Not [[G3756]] as though [[G3634]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] hath taken none effect. [[G1601]] For [[G1063]] they [[G3778]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] Israel, [[G2474]] which [[G3588]] are of [[G1537]] Israel: [[G2474]]

### 7
Neither, [[G3761]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1526]] the seed [[G4690]] of Abraham, [[G11]] all [[G3956]] children: [[G5043]] but, [[G235]] In [[G1722]] Isaac [[G2464]] shall be [[G2564]] thy [[G4671]] seed [[G4690]] called. [[G2564]]

### 8
That [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] They which are the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh, [[G4561]] these [[G5023]] not [[G3756]] the children [[G5043]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1860]] promise [[G1860]] are counted [[G3049]] for [[G1519]] the seed. [[G4690]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] word of [[G3056]] promise, [[G1860]] At [[G2596]] this [[G5126]] time [[G2540]] will I come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] Sarah [[G4564]] shall have [[G2071]] a son. [[G5207]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] but [[G235]] Rebecca [[G4479]] when [[G2192]] also [[G2532]] had [[G2192]] conceived [[G2845]] by [[G1537]] one, [[G1520]] by [[G3962]] our [[G2257]] father [[G3962]] Isaac; [[G2464]]

### 11
(For [[G1063]] not yet [[G3380]] being [[G1080]] born, [[G1080]] neither [[G3366]] having done [[G4238]] any [[G5100]] good [[G18]] or [[G2228]] evil, [[G2556]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] purpose [[G4286]] of to [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] according [[G2596]] election [[G1589]] might stand, [[G3306]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] works, [[G2041]] but [[G235]] of [[G1537]] him [[G3588]] that calleth;) [[G2564]]

### 12
It was said [[G4483]] unto her, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] elder [[G3187]] shall serve [[G1398]] the [[G3588]] younger. [[G1640]]

### 13
As [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] Jacob [[G2384]] have I loved, [[G25]] but [[G1161]] Esau [[G2269]] have I hated. [[G3404]]

### 14
What [[G5101]] shall we say [[G2046]] then? [[G3767]] unrighteousness [[G93]] with [[G3844]] God? [[G2316]] God forbid. [[G1096]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] he saith [[G3004]] to Moses, [[G3475]] I will have mercy on [[G1653]] whom [[G3739]] I will have mercy, [[G1653]] and [[G2532]] I will have compassion on [[G3627]] whom [[G3739]] I will have compassion. [[G3627]]

### 16
So [[G686]] then [[G3767]] not [[G3756]] him [[G3588]] of that [[G2309]] willeth, [[G2309]] nor [[G3761]] him [[G3588]] of that [[G5143]] runneth, [[G5143]] but [[G235]] of God [[G2316]] that sheweth mercy. [[G1653]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] saith [[G3004]] unto Pharaoh, [[G5328]] Even for [[G1519]] this purpose [[G5124]] same [[G846]] have I raised up, [[G1825]] thee [[G4571]] that [[G3704]] I might shew [[G1731]] my [[G3450]] power [[G1411]] in [[G1722]] thee, [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3704]] my [[G3450]] name [[G3686]] might be declared [[G1229]] throughout [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 18
Therefore [[G686]]  hath he on [[G3767]] mercy [[G1653]] whom [[G3739]] he will [[G2309]] and [[G1161]] whom [[G3739]] he will [[G2309]] he hardeneth. [[G4645]]

### 19
Thou wilt say [[G2046]] then [[G3767]] unto me, [[G3427]] Why [[G5101]] yet [[G2089]] doth he find [[G3201]] fault? [[G3201]] For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] hath resisted [[G436]] his [[G846]] will? [[G1013]]

### 20
Nay but, [[G3304]] O [[G5599]] man, [[G444]] who [[G5101]] art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] that repliest against [[G470]] God? [[G2316]] Shall [[G3361]] the thing [[G3588]] formed [[G4110]] say [[G2046]] him [[G3588]] to that [[G4111]] formed [[G4111]] Why [[G5101]] hast thou made [[G4160]] me [[G3165]] thus? [[G3779]]

### 21
Hath [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] potter [[G2763]] power [[G1849]] the [[G3588]] over [[G4081]] clay, [[G4081]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] lump [[G5445]] to make [[G4160]] one [[G3739]] vessel [[G4632]] unto [[G1519]] honour, [[G5092]] and [[G1161]] another [[G3739]] unto [[G1519]] dishonour? [[G819]]

### 22
if [[G1487]] God, [[G2316]] willing [[G2309]] to shew [[G1731]] wrath, [[G3709]] and [[G2532]] to make known, [[G1107]] his [[G846]] power [[G1415]] endured [[G5342]] with [[G1722]] much [[G4183]] longsuffering [[G3115]] the vessels [[G4632]] of wrath [[G3709]] fitted [[G2675]] to [[G1519]] destruction: [[G684]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] he might make known [[G1107]] the [[G3588]] riches [[G4149]] of his [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] on [[G1909]] the vessels [[G4632]] of mercy, [[G1656]] which [[G3739]] he had afore prepared [[G4282]] unto [[G1519]] glory, [[G1391]]

### 24
Even [[G2532]] us, [[G2248]] whom [[G3739]] he hath called, [[G2564]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the Jews [[G2453]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] the Gentiles? [[G1484]]

### 25
As [[G5613]] he saith [[G3004]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Osee, [[G5617]] I will call [[G2564]] them [[G3588]] my [[G3450]] people, [[G2992]] which [[G3588]] were not [[G3756]] my [[G3450]] people; [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] her which [[G3588]] beloved, [[G25]] was not [[G3756]] beloved. [[G25]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] it shall come to pass, [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3739]] it was said [[G4483]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye [[G5210]] not [[G3756]] my [[G3450]] people; [[G2992]] there [[G1563]] shall they be called [[G2564]] the children [[G5207]] of the [[G2316]] living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]]

### 27
Esaias [[G2268]] also [[G1161]] crieth [[G2896]] concerning [[G5228]] Israel, [[G2474]] Though [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] children [[G5207]] of Israel [[G2474]] be [[G5600]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sand [[G285]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea, [[G2281]] a [[G2640]] remnant [[G2640]] shall be saved: [[G4982]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] he will finish [[G4931]] the work, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] cut short [[G4932]] in [[G1722]] righteousness: [[G1343]] because [[G3754]] a [[G3056]] short [[G4932]] work [[G3056]] will [[G4160]] the Lord [[G2962]] make [[G4160]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] Esaias [[G2268]] said before, [[G4280]] Except [[G3361]] the Lord [[G2962]] of Sabaoth [[G4519]] had left [[G1459]] us [[G2254]] a seed, [[G4690]] we had been [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] Sodoma, [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] been made like [[G3666]] unto [[G5613]] Gomorrha. [[G1116]]

### 30
What [[G5101]] shall we say [[G2046]] then? [[G3767]] That [[G3754]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] which [[G3588]] followed after [[G1377]] not [[G3361]] righteousness, [[G1343]] have attained to [[G2638]] righteousness, [[G1343]] even [[G1161]] the righteousness [[G1343]] which [[G3588]] is of [[G1537]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] Israel, [[G2474]] which followed after [[G1377]] the law [[G3551]] of righteousness, [[G1343]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G5348]] attained [[G5348]] to [[G1519]] the law [[G3551]] of righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 32
Wherefore? [[G1302]] Because [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] but [[G235]] as it were [[G5613]] by [[G1537]] the works [[G2041]] of the law. [[G3551]] For [[G1063]] they stumbled at [[G4350]] that [[G3588]] stumblingstone; [[G3037]]

### 33
As [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] Behold, [[G2400]] I lay [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] Sion [[G4622]] stumblingstone [[G3037]] a [[G4348]] and [[G2532]] rock [[G4073]] of offence: [[G4625]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3956]] believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G2617]] ashamed. [[G2617]]
