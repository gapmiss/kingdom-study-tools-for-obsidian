### 1
What [[G5101]] shall we say [[G2046]] then? [[G3767]] Shall we continue [[G1961]]  in [[G3588]] sin, [[G266]] that [[G2443]] grace [[G5485]] may abound? [[G4121]]

### 2
God forbid. [[G1096]] How [[G4459]] that [[G3748]] shall we, [[G2198]] are dead [[G599]] to [[G266]] sin, [[G266]] live [[G2198]] any longer [[G2089]] therein? [[G1722]]

### 3
Know ye not, [[G50]] that [[G3754]] so many of us as [[G3745]] were baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] were baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] death? [[G2288]]

### 4
Therefore [[G3767]] we are buried with [[G4916]] him [[G846]] by [[G1223]] baptism [[G908]] into [[G1519]] death: [[G2288]] that [[G2443]] like as [[G5618]] Christ [[G5547]] was raised up [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead [[G3498]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3962]] Father, [[G3962]] even so [[G3779]] we [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] should walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] newness [[G2538]] of life. [[G2222]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] we have been [[G1096]] planted together [[G4854]] in the [[G3588]] likeness [[G3667]] of his [[G846]] death, [[G2288]] we shall be [[G2071]] also [[G2532]] of [[G386]] resurrection: [[G386]]

### 6
Knowing [[G1097]] this, [[G5124]] that [[G3754]] our [[G2257]] old [[G3820]] man [[G444]] is crucified with [[G4957]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of [[G266]] sin [[G266]] might be destroyed, [[G2673]] that [[G3588]] henceforth not [[G3371]] we [[G2248]] should serve [[G1398]] sin. [[G266]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] he that is dead [[G599]] is freed [[G1344]] from [[G575]] sin. [[G266]]

### 8
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] we be dead [[G599]] with [[G4862]] Christ, [[G5547]] we believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] also [[G2532]] we shall with [[G4800]] live [[G4800]] him: [[G846]]

### 9
Knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] being raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead [[G3498]] dieth [[G599]] no more; [[G3765]] death [[G2288]] no more [[G3765]] hath [[G2961]] over [[G846]] dominion [[G2961]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] in that [[G3739]] he died, [[G599]] he died [[G599]] unto [[G266]] sin [[G266]] once: [[G2178]] but [[G1161]] in that [[G3739]] he liveth, [[G2198]] he liveth [[G2198]] unto [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 11
Likewise [[G3779]] reckon [[G3049]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] yourselves [[G1438]] to be [[G1511]] dead [[G3498]] indeed [[G3303]] unto [[G266]] sin, [[G266]] but [[G1161]] alive [[G2198]] unto [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 12
not [[G3361]] Let [[G936]] sin [[G266]] therefore [[G3767]] reign [[G936]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] mortal [[G2349]] body, [[G4983]] that ye should [[G1519]] obey [[G5219]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] lusts [[G1939]] thereof. [[G846]]

### 13
Neither [[G3366]] yield ye [[G3936]] your [[G5216]] members [[G3196]] instruments [[G3696]] of unrighteousness [[G93]] unto [[G266]] sin: [[G266]] but [[G235]] yield [[G3936]] yourselves [[G1438]] unto [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] as [[G5613]] those that are alive [[G2198]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] members [[G3196]] instruments [[G3696]] of righteousness [[G1343]] unto [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] sin [[G266]] not [[G3756]] shall have over [[G2961]] dominion [[G2961]] you: [[G5216]] for [[G1063]] ye are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] under [[G5259]] the law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] under [[G5259]] grace. [[G5485]]

### 15
What [[G5101]] then? [[G3767]] shall we sin, [[G264]] because [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] not [[G3756]] under [[G5259]] the law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] under [[G5259]] grace? [[G5485]] God forbid. [[G1096]]

### 16
Know ye [[G1492]] not, [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] to whom [[G3739]] ye yield [[G3936]] yourselves [[G1438]] servants [[G1401]] to [[G1519]] obey, [[G5218]] his servants [[G1401]] ye are [[G2075]] to whom [[G3739]] ye obey; [[G5219]] whether [[G2273]] of sin [[G266]] unto [[G1519]] death, [[G2288]] or [[G2228]] of obedience [[G5218]] unto [[G1519]] righteousness? [[G1343]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] be thanked, [[G5485]] that [[G3754]] ye were [[G2258]] the servants [[G1401]] of [[G266]] sin, [[G266]] but [[G1161]] ye have obeyed [[G5219]] from [[G1537]] the heart [[G2588]] that form [[G5179]] of doctrine [[G1322]] which [[G3739]] was delivered you. [[G3860]]

### 18
Being made [[G1659]] then [[G1161]] free [[G1659]] from [[G575]] sin, [[G266]] ye became the servants [[G1402]] of [[G1343]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 19
I speak [[G3004]] after the manner of men [[G442]] because of [[G1223]] the to [[G3588]] infirmity [[G769]] of your [[G5216]] flesh: [[G4561]] for [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] ye have yielded [[G3936]] your [[G5216]] members [[G3196]] servants [[G1401]] uncleanness [[G167]] and [[G2532]] to [[G458]] iniquity [[G458]] unto [[G1519]] iniquity; [[G458]] even so [[G3779]] now [[G3568]] yield [[G3936]] your [[G5216]] members [[G3196]] servants [[G1401]]  to [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] unto [[G1519]] holiness. [[G38]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] when [[G3753]] ye were [[G2258]] the servants [[G1401]] of [[G266]] sin, [[G266]] ye were [[G2258]] free [[G1658]]  from [[G3588]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 21
What [[G5101]] fruit [[G2590]] had ye [[G2192]] then [[G5119]] in [[G1909]] those things whereof [[G3739]] now [[G3568]] ye are [[G1870]] ashamed? [[G1870]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] of those things [[G1565]] death. [[G2288]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] being made free [[G1659]] from [[G575]] sin, [[G266]] and [[G1161]] become servants [[G1402]] to [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] ye have [[G2192]] your [[G5216]] fruit [[G2590]] unto [[G1519]] holiness, [[G38]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] everlasting [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 23
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] wages [[G3800]] of [[G266]] sin [[G266]] death; [[G2288]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G5486]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] through [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Lord. [[G2962]]
