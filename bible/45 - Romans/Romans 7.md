### 1
Know ye not, [[G50]] brethren, [[G80]] (for [[G1063]] I speak [[G2980]] to them that know [[G1097]] the law,) [[G3551]] how that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] hath dominion over [[G2961]] a as [[G444]] man [[G444]] as [[G3745]] long [[G5550]] he liveth? [[G2198]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] which hath an husband [[G5220]] is bound [[G1210]] by the law [[G3551]] to husband [[G435]] he [[G3588]] so long as [[G2198]] liveth; [[G2198]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] be dead, [[G599]] she is loosed [[G2673]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of [[G435]] husband. [[G435]]

### 3
So [[G686]] then [[G3767]] if, [[G1437]] while [[G2198]] husband [[G435]] liveth, [[G2198]] she be married [[G1096]] to [[G435]] another [[G2087]] man, [[G435]] she shall be called [[G5537]] an adulteress: [[G3428]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]]  her [[G3588]] husband be [[G435]] dead, [[G599]] she is [[G2076]] free [[G1658]] from [[G575]] that [[G3588]] law; [[G3551]] so that [[G3588]] she [[G846]] is [[G1511]] no [[G3361]] adulteress, [[G3428]] though she be married [[G1096]] to [[G435]] another [[G2087]] man. [[G435]]

### 4
Wherefore, [[G5620]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] are become dead [[G2289]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of [[G5547]] Christ; [[G5547]] that [[G1519]] ye [[G5209]] should be married [[G1096]] to another, [[G2087]] to him who is raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] that [[G2443]] we should bring forth fruit [[G2592]] unto [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] when [[G3753]] we were [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] the [[G3588]] motions [[G3804]] of [[G266]] sins, [[G266]] which [[G3588]] were by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] did work [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] members [[G3196]] to [[G1519]] bring forth fruit [[G2592]] unto [[G2288]] death. [[G2288]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] we are delivered [[G2673]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] that being dead [[G599]] wherein [[G1722]] we were held; [[G2722]] that [[G5620]] we [[G2248]] should serve [[G1398]] in [[G1722]] newness [[G2538]] of spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] the oldness [[G3821]] of the letter. [[G1121]]

### 7
What [[G5101]] shall we say [[G2046]] then? [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] sin? [[G266]] God forbid. [[G1096]] Nay, [[G235]] not [[G3756]] I had [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] sin, [[G266]] but [[G3361]] by [[G1223]] the law: [[G3551]] for [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] I had [[G1492]] known [[G1492]] lust, [[G1939]] except [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] had said, [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G1937]] covet. [[G1937]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] sin, [[G266]] taking [[G2983]] occasion [[G874]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] commandment, [[G1785]] wrought [[G2716]] in [[G1722]] me [[G1698]] all manner of [[G3956]] concupiscence. [[G1939]] For [[G1063]] without [[G5565]] the law [[G3551]] sin [[G266]] dead. [[G3498]]

### 9
For [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] was alive [[G2198]] without [[G5565]] the law [[G3551]] once: [[G4218]] but [[G1161]] when [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] came, [[G2064]] sin [[G266]] revived, [[G326]] and [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] died. [[G599]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] commandment, [[G1785]] which [[G3588]] to [[G1519]] life, [[G2222]] I [[G3427]] found [[G2147]] unto [[G1519]] death. [[G2288]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] sin, [[G266]] taking [[G2983]] occasion [[G874]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] commandment, [[G1785]] deceived [[G1818]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] it [[G846]] slew [[G615]]

### 12
Wherefore [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] holy, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] holy, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] just, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] good. [[G18]]

### 13
Was [[G1096]] then [[G3767]] that which is good [[G18]] made [[G1096]] death [[G2288]] unto me? [[G1698]] God forbid. [[G1096]] But [[G235]] sin, [[G266]] that [[G2443]] it might appear [[G5316]] sin, [[G266]] working [[G2716]] death [[G2288]] in me [[G3427]] by [[G1223]] that which is good; [[G18]] that [[G2443]] sin [[G266]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] commandment might [[G1785]] become [[G1096]] exceeding [[G2596]] sinful. [[G268]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] is [[G2076]] spiritual: [[G4152]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] carnal, [[G4559]] sold [[G4097]] under [[G5259]] sin. [[G266]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] that which [[G3739]] I do [[G2716]] I allow [[G1097]] not: [[G3756]] for [[G1063]] what [[G3739]] I would, [[G2309]] that [[G5124]] do I [[G4238]] not; [[G3756]] but [[G235]] what [[G3739]] I hate, [[G3404]] that [[G5124]] do I. [[G4160]]

### 16
If [[G1487]] then [[G1161]] I do [[G4160]] that [[G5124]] which [[G3739]] I would [[G2309]] not, [[G3756]] I consent unto [[G4852]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] that [[G3754]] good. [[G2570]]

### 17
Now [[G3570]] then [[G1161]] it is no more that [[G3765]] I [[G1473]] do [[G2716]] it, [[G846]] but [[G235]] sin [[G266]] that dwelleth [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] me [[G1698]] (that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] flesh,) [[G4561]] dwelleth [[G3611]] no [[G3756]] good thing: [[G18]] for [[G1063]] to will [[G2309]] is present [[G3873]] with me; [[G3427]] but [[G1161]] to perform [[G2716]] that which is good [[G2570]] I find [[G2147]] not. [[G3756]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] the good [[G18]] that [[G3739]] I would [[G2309]] I do [[G4160]] not: [[G3756]] but [[G235]] the evil [[G2556]] which [[G3739]] I would [[G2309]] not, [[G3756]] that [[G5124]] I do. [[G4238]]

### 20
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I do [[G4160]] that [[G5124]] I [[G1473]] would [[G2309]] not, [[G3756]] it is no more [[G3765]] I [[G1473]] that do [[G2716]] it, [[G846]] but [[G235]] sin [[G266]] that dwelleth [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]

### 21
I find [[G2147]] then [[G686]]  a [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] that, [[G3754]] when [[G2309]] I [[G1698]] would [[G2309]] do [[G4160]] good, [[G2570]] evil [[G2556]] is present [[G3873]] with me. [[G1698]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] I delight [[G4913]] in the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] inward [[G2080]] man: [[G444]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] I see [[G991]] another [[G2087]] law [[G3551]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] members, [[G3196]] warring against [[G497]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of [[G3588]] my [[G3450]] mind, [[G3563]] and [[G2532]] bringing into captivity [[G163]] me [[G3165]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] of [[G266]] sin [[G266]] which [[G3588]] is [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] members. [[G3196]]

### 24
wretched [[G5005]] O [[G444]] man [[G444]] that I am! [[G1473]] who [[G5101]] shall deliver [[G4506]] me [[G3165]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of [[G2288]] this [[G5127]] death? [[G2288]]

### 25
I thank [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Lord. [[G2962]] So [[G686]] then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] with [[G3563]] mind [[G3563]] I [[G1473]] myself [[G846]] serve [[G1398]] the law [[G3551]] of God; [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] with [[G4561]] flesh [[G4561]] the law [[G3551]] of sin.
