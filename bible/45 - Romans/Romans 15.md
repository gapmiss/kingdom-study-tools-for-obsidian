### 1
We [[G2249]] then [[G1161]] that are strong [[G1415]] ought [[G3784]] to bear [[G941]] the [[G3588]] infirmities of [[G771]] the [[G3588]] weak, [[G102]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] to please [[G700]] ourselves. [[G1438]]

### 2
every one [[G1538]] Let [[G700]] of us [[G2257]] please [[G700]] neighbour [[G4139]] for [[G1519]] good [[G18]] to [[G4314]] edification. [[G3619]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] pleased [[G700]] not [[G3756]] himself; [[G1438]] but, [[G235]] as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] The [[G3588]] reproaches of them that [[G3680]] reproached [[G3679]] thee [[G4571]] fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] me. [[G1691]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] whatsoever things [[G3745]] aforetime [[G4270]] were written were [[G4270]] written [[G4270]] for [[G1519]] our [[G2251]] learning, [[G1319]] that [[G2443]] through [[G1223]] we might [[G2192]] patience [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] comfort [[G3874]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1124]] scriptures [[G1124]] have [[G2192]] hope. [[G1680]]

### 5
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G5281]] patience [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] consolation [[G3874]] grant [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] to be likeminded [[G5426]] toward [[G1722]] one [[G240]] another [[G240]] according to [[G2596]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus: [[G2424]]

### 6
That [[G2443]] with [[G1722]] ye may [[G1392]] one mind [[G3661]] one [[G1520]] mouth [[G4750]] glorify [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] even [[G2532]] the Father [[G3962]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 7
Wherefore [[G1352]] receive ye [[G4355]] one another, [[G240]] as [[G2531]] Christ [[G5547]] also [[G2532]] received [[G4355]] us [[G2248]] to [[G1519]] the glory [[G1391]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 8
Now [[G1161]] I say that [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] was [[G1096]] a minister [[G1249]] of the circumcision [[G4061]] for [[G5228]] the truth [[G225]] of God, [[G2316]] to [[G1519]] confirm [[G950]] the [[G3588]] promises [[G1860]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3962]] fathers: [[G3962]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] that might [[G1392]] Gentiles [[G1484]] glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] mercy; [[G1656]] as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] For [[G1223]] this cause [[G5124]] I will confess [[G1843]] to thee [[G4671]] among [[G1722]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] sing [[G5567]] unto [[G4675]] thy [[G4675]] name. [[G3686]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he saith, [[G3004]] Rejoice, [[G2165]] ye Gentiles, [[G1484]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] people. [[G2992]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] Praise [[G134]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] all [[G3956]]  ye [[G3588]] Gentiles; [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] laud [[G1867]] him, [[G846]] all [[G3956]]  ye [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] Esaias [[G2268]] saith, [[G3004]] There shall be [[G2071]] a [[G3588]]  root [[G3588]]  of [[G4491]] Jesse, [[G2421]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that shall rise [[G450]] to reign over [[G757]] the Gentiles; [[G1484]] in [[G1909]] him [[G846]] the Gentiles [[G1484]] shall [[G1679]] trust. [[G1679]]

### 13
Now [[G1161]] the of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] hope [[G1680]] fill [[G4137]] you [[G5209]] all [[G3956]] with [[G5479]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] in [[G1722]] believing, [[G4100]] that [[G1519]] ye [[G5209]] may abound [[G4052]] in [[G1722]] hope, [[G1680]] through [[G1722]] the power [[G1411]] of the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] myself [[G846]] also [[G2532]] am persuaded [[G3982]] of [[G4012]] you, [[G5216]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] also [[G2532]] ye [[G2075]] are [[G2075]] full [[G3324]] of goodness, [[G19]] filled [[G4137]] all [[G3956]] with [[G1108]] knowledge, [[G1108]] able [[G1410]] also [[G2532]] to admonish [[G3560]] one another. [[G240]]

### 15
Nevertheless, [[G1161]] brethren, [[G80]] I have written [[G1125]] the more boldly [[G5112]] unto you [[G5213]] in [[G575]] some sort, [[G3313]] as [[G5613]] putting in mind, [[G1878]] you [[G5209]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] that [[G3588]] is given [[G1325]] to me [[G3427]] of [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]]

### 16
That [[G1519]] I [[G3165]] should be [[G1511]] the minister [[G3011]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] ministering [[G2418]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] the offering [[G3588]] up [[G4376]] the [[G3588]] of might [[G1484]] Gentiles [[G1484]] be [[G1096]] acceptable, [[G2144]] being sanctified [[G37]] by [[G1722]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 17
I have [[G2192]] therefore [[G3767]] whereof I may glory in [[G2746]] through [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]]  those things which [[G3588]] pertain [[G4314]] to [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] I will [[G5111]] dare [[G5111]] to speak [[G2980]] of any of those things [[G5100]] which [[G3739]] Christ [[G5547]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G2716]] wrought [[G2716]] by [[G1223]] me, [[G1700]] to make [[G1519]] the Gentiles [[G1484]] obedient, [[G5218]] by word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] deed, [[G2041]]

### 19
Through [[G1722]] mighty [[G1411]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders, [[G5059]] by [[G1722]] the power [[G1411]] of the Spirit [[G4151]] of God; [[G2316]] so that [[G5620]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] round about [[G2945]] unto [[G3360]] Illyricum, [[G2437]] I have fully [[G3165]] preached [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 20
Yea, [[G1161]] so [[G3779]] have I strived [[G5389]] to preach the gospel, [[G2097]] not [[G3756]] where [[G3699]] Christ [[G5547]] was named, [[G3687]] lest [[G3361]] I should build [[G3618]] upon [[G1909]] another man's [[G245]] foundation: [[G2310]]

### 21
But [[G235]] as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] To whom [[G3739]] he [[G846]] not [[G3756]] was [[G312]] spoken [[G312]] of, [[G4012]] they shall see: [[G3700]] and [[G2532]] they that have [[G191]] not [[G3756]] heard [[G191]] shall understand. [[G4920]]

### 22
For which cause [[G1352]] also [[G2532]] I have been [[G1465]] much [[G4183]] hindered [[G1465]] from coming [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] having [[G2192]] no more [[G3371]] place [[G5117]] in [[G1722]] these [[G5125]] parts, [[G2824]] and [[G1161]] having [[G2192]] a great desire [[G1974]] these [[G575]] many [[G4183]] years [[G2094]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you; [[G5209]]

### 24
Whensoever [[G5613]]  I take my [[G1437]] journey [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] Spain, [[G4681]] I will come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you: [[G5209]] for [[G1063]] I trust [[G1679]] to see [[G2300]] you [[G5209]] in my journey, [[G1279]] and [[G2532]] to be brought on my way [[G4311]] thitherward [[G1563]] by [[G5259]] you, [[G5216]] if [[G1437]] first [[G4412]] with [[G3313]] I be [[G1705]] somewhat [[G3313]] filled [[G1705]] your [[G5216]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] I go [[G4198]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to minister [[G1247]] unto [[G40]] the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] it hath pleased them [[G2106]] of Macedonia [[G3109]] and [[G2532]] Achaia [[G882]] to make [[G4160]] a [[G2842]] certain [[G5100]] contribution [[G2842]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] saints [[G40]] which [[G3588]] are [[G1722]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 27
It hath pleased them [[G2106]] verily; [[G1063]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] debtors [[G3781]] they are. [[G1526]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] have been made partakers of [[G2841]] their [[G846]] spiritual things, [[G4152]] their duty is [[G3784]] also [[G2532]] to minister [[G3008]] unto them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] carnal things. [[G4559]]

### 28
therefore [[G3767]] When I have [[G2005]] performed [[G2005]] this, [[G5124]] and [[G2532]] have sealed [[G4972]] to them [[G846]] this [[G5126]] fruit, [[G2590]] I will come [[G565]] by [[G1223]] you [[G5216]] into [[G1519]] Spain. [[G4681]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] I am sure [[G1492]] that, [[G3754]] when I come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] I shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the fulness [[G4138]] of the blessing [[G2129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 30
Now [[G1161]] I beseech [[G3870]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] for sake, [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ's [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit, [[G4151]] that ye strive together [[G4865]] with [[G3427]] me [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] prayers [[G4335]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] me; [[G1700]]

### 31
That [[G2443]] I may be delivered [[G4506]] from [[G575]] them that do not believe [[G544]] in [[G1722]] Judaea; [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] my [[G3450]] service [[G1248]] which [[G3588]] for [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] may be [[G1096]] accepted [[G2144]] the [[G3588]] of [[G40]] saints; [[G40]]

### 32
That [[G2443]] I may come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] joy [[G5479]] by [[G1223]] the will [[G2307]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] may with be [[G4875]] you [[G5213]] refreshed. [[G4875]]

### 33
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G1515]] peace [[G1515]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]] Amen. [[G281]]
