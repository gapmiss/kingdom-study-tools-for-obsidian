### 1
therefore [[G686]] now [[G3568]] no [[G3762]] condemnation [[G2631]] to them which [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who walk [[G4043]] not [[G3361]] after [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G235]] after [[G2596]] the Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G2222]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] hath made free [[G1659]] me [[G3165]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of [[G266]] sin [[G266]] and [[G2532]] death. [[G2288]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] what [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] could not do, [[G102]] in [[G1722]] that [[G3739]] it was weak [[G770]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] God [[G2316]] sending [[G3992]] his own [[G1438]] Son [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] the likeness [[G3667]] of sinful [[G266]] flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] for [[G4012]] sin, [[G266]] condemned [[G2632]] sin [[G266]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] flesh: [[G4561]]

### 4
That [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1345]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] might be fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] who walk [[G4043]] not [[G3361]] after [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G235]] after [[G2596]] the Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] they that are [[G5607]] after [[G2596]] the flesh [[G4561]] do mind [[G5426]] the things [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh; [[G4561]] but [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] that [[G3588]] are after [[G2596]] the Spirit [[G4151]] the things [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] to be [[G5427]] carnally [[G4561]] minded [[G5427]] death; [[G2288]] but [[G1161]] to be [[G5427]] spiritually [[G4151]] minded [[G5427]] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] peace. [[G1515]]

### 7
Because [[G1360]] the [[G3588]] carnal [[G4561]] mind [[G5427]] enmity [[G2189]] against [[G1519]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] it is [[G5293]] subject [[G5293]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] neither [[G3761]] indeed [[G1063]] can be. [[G1410]]

### 8
So then [[G1161]] they that are [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] the flesh [[G4561]] cannot [[G1410]] please [[G700]] God. [[G2316]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] the flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] the Spirit, [[G4151]] if so be that [[G1512]] the Spirit [[G4151]] of God [[G2316]] dwell [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]] Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] the Spirit [[G4151]] of Christ, [[G5547]] he [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] none [[G3756]] of his. [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] dead [[G3498]] because of [[G1223]] sin; [[G266]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] life [[G2222]] because of [[G1223]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] him [[G3588]] of that raised [[G1453]] up [[G1453]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G1537]] the dead [[G3498]] dwell [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] he [[G3588]] that raised up [[G1453]] Christ [[G5547]] from [[G1537]] the dead [[G3498]] shall [[G2227]] also [[G2532]] quicken [[G2227]] your [[G5216]] mortal [[G2349]] bodies [[G4983]] by [[G1223]] his [[G846]] Spirit [[G4151]] that dwelleth [[G1774]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 12
Therefore, [[G686]] brethren, [[G80]] we are [[G2070]] debtors, [[G3781]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4561]] flesh, [[G4561]] to live [[G2198]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] flesh. [[G4561]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] ye live [[G2198]] after [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] ye shall [[G3195]] die: [[G599]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] through the Spirit [[G4151]] ye do [[G2289]] mortify [[G2289]] the [[G3588]] deeds [[G4234]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4983]] body, [[G4983]] ye shall live. [[G2198]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] as many as [[G3745]] are led [[G71]] by the Spirit [[G4151]] of God, [[G2316]] they [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] the sons [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G2983]] received [[G2983]] the spirit [[G4151]] of bondage [[G1397]] again [[G3825]] to [[G1519]] fear; [[G5401]] but [[G235]] ye have received [[G2983]] the Spirit [[G4151]] of adoption, [[G5206]] whereby [[G1722]]  we [[G3739]] cry, [[G2896]] Abba, [[G5]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 16
The [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] itself [[G846]] beareth witness with [[G4828]] our [[G2257]] spirit, [[G4151]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] the children [[G5043]] of God: [[G2316]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] children, [[G5043]] then [[G2532]] heirs; [[G2818]] heirs [[G2818]] of [[G3303]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] joint-heirs [[G4789]] with Christ; [[G5547]] if so be that [[G1512]] we suffer with [[G4841]] that [[G2443]] also [[G2532]] we may be glorified [[G4888]] together. [[G4888]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] I reckon [[G3049]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] sufferings [[G3804]] of [[G2540]] this [[G3588]] present [[G3568]] time [[G2540]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] with [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] which shall [[G3195]] be revealed [[G601]] in [[G1519]] us. [[G2248]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] earnest expectation [[G603]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2937]] creature [[G2937]] waiteth for [[G553]] the [[G3588]] manifestation [[G602]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] sons [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] creature [[G2937]] was made subject [[G5293]] to vanity, [[G3153]] not [[G3756]] willingly, [[G1635]] but [[G235]] by reason of [[G1223]] him [[G3588]] who hath subjected [[G5293]] in [[G1909]] hope, [[G1680]]

### 21
Because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] creature [[G2937]] itself [[G846]] also [[G2532]] shall be delivered [[G1659]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] bondage [[G1397]] of [[G5356]] corruption [[G5356]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] glorious [[G1391]] liberty [[G1657]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5043]] children [[G5043]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the whole [[G3956]] creation [[G2937]] groaneth [[G4959]] and [[G2532]] travaileth in pain together [[G4944]] until [[G891]] now. [[G3568]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] but [[G235]] ourselves [[G846]] also, [[G2532]] which have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] firstfruits [[G536]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit, [[G4151]] even [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] ourselves [[G846]] groan [[G4727]] within [[G1722]] ourselves, [[G1438]] waiting for [[G553]] the adoption, [[G5206]] the [[G3588]] redemption [[G629]] of [[G4983]] our [[G2257]] body. [[G4983]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] we are saved [[G4982]] by hope: [[G1680]] but [[G1161]] hope [[G1680]] that is seen [[G991]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] hope: [[G1680]] for [[G1063]] what [[G3739]] a man [[G5100]] seeth, [[G991]] why [[G5101]] yet [[G2532]] doth he for? [[G1679]] hope [[G1679]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] we hope for [[G1679]] that [[G3739]] we see [[G991]] not, [[G3756]] with [[G1223]] do we for [[G553]] patience [[G5281]] wait [[G553]]

### 26
Likewise [[G5615]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] also [[G2532]] helpeth [[G4878]] our [[G2257]] infirmities: [[G769]] for [[G1063]] we know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] we should pray for [[G4336]] as [[G2526]] we ought: [[G1163]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] itself [[G846]] maketh intercession [[G5241]] for [[G5228]] us [[G2257]] with groanings [[G4726]] which cannot be uttered. [[G215]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] he that searcheth [[G2045]] the [[G3588]] hearts [[G2588]] knoweth [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] mind [[G5427]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit, [[G4151]] because [[G3754]] he maketh intercession [[G1793]] for [[G5228]] the saints [[G40]] according to [[G2596]] God. [[G2316]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] all things [[G3956]] work together [[G4903]] for [[G1519]] good [[G18]] to them that love [[G25]] God, [[G2316]] to them who [[G4286]] are [[G5607]] the [[G3588]] called [[G2822]] according to [[G2596]] purpose. [[G4286]]

### 29
For [[G3754]] whom [[G3739]] he did foreknow, [[G4267]] also [[G2532]] he did [[G4309]] predestinate [[G4309]] conformed to [[G4832]] the [[G3588]] image [[G1504]] of [[G5207]] his [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] that [[G1519]] he [[G846]] might be [[G1511]] the firstborn [[G4416]] among [[G1722]] many [[G4183]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 30
Moreover [[G1161]] whom [[G3739]] he did predestinate, [[G4309]] them [[G5128]] also [[G2532]] he [[G2564]] called: [[G2564]] and [[G2532]] whom [[G3739]] he called, [[G2564]] them [[G5128]] also [[G2532]] he [[G1344]] justified: [[G1344]] and [[G1161]] whom [[G3739]] he justified, [[G1344]] them [[G5128]] also [[G2532]] he [[G1392]] glorified. [[G1392]]

### 31
What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] shall we [[G2046]] say [[G2046]] to [[G4314]] these things? [[G5023]] If [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] us, [[G2257]] who [[G5101]] against [[G2596]] us? [[G2257]]

### 32
He that [[G3739]] spared [[G5339]] not [[G3756]] his own [[G2398]] Son, [[G5207]] but [[G235]] delivered up [[G3860]] him [[G846]] for [[G5228]] us [[G2257]] all, [[G3956]] how [[G4459]] not [[G3780]] shall he freely [[G5483]] with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] also [[G2532]] give [[G5483]] us [[G2254]] all things? [[G3956]]

### 33
Who [[G5101]] shall lay any thing to the charge [[G1458]] of [[G1588]] God's [[G2316]] elect? [[G1588]] God [[G2316]] that justifieth. [[G1344]]

### 34
Who [[G5101]] he [[G3588]] that condemneth? [[G2632]] Christ [[G5547]] that died, [[G599]] yea [[G1161]] rather, [[G3123]] that is [[G2532]] risen again, [[G1453]] who [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] even [[G2532]] at [[G1722]] the right hand [[G1188]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] maketh intercession [[G1793]] for [[G5228]] us. [[G2257]]

### 35
Who [[G5101]] shall separate [[G5563]] us [[G2248]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G5547]] Christ? [[G5547]] tribulation, [[G2347]] or [[G2228]] distress, [[G4730]] or [[G2228]] persecution, [[G1375]] or [[G2228]] famine, [[G3042]] or [[G2228]] nakedness, [[G1132]] or [[G2228]] peril, [[G2794]] or [[G2228]] sword? [[G3162]]

### 36
As [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] For [[G3754]] thy [[G4675]] sake [[G1752]] we are killed [[G2289]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] day long; [[G2250]] we are accounted [[G3049]] as [[G5613]] sheep [[G4263]] for the slaughter. [[G4967]]

### 37
Nay, [[G235]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5125]] we are more than conquerors [[G5245]] through [[G1223]] him [[G3588]] that loved [[G25]] us. [[G2248]]

### 38
For [[G1063]] I am persuaded, [[G3982]] that [[G3754]] neither [[G3777]] death, [[G2288]] nor [[G3777]] life, [[G2222]] nor [[G3777]] angels, [[G32]] nor [[G3777]] principalities, [[G746]] nor [[G3777]] powers, [[G1411]] nor [[G3777]] things present, [[G1764]] nor [[G3777]] things to come, [[G3195]]

### 39
Nor [[G3777]] height, [[G5313]] nor [[G3777]] depth, [[G899]] nor [[G3777]] any [[G5100]] other [[G2087]] creature, [[G2937]] shall be able [[G1410]] to separate [[G5563]] us [[G2248]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G2257]] Lord. [[G2962]]
