### 1
Him that is weak [[G770]] in the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] receive ye, [[G4355]] not [[G3361]] to [[G1519]] doubtful [[G1261]] disputations. [[G1253]]

### 2
one [[G3739]] For [[G3303]] believeth [[G4100]] that he may eat [[G5315]] all things: [[G3956]]  another, [[G1161]] who is weak, [[G770]] eateth [[G2068]] herbs. [[G3001]]

### 3
not [[G3361]] Let [[G1848]] him [[G3588]] that eateth [[G2068]] despise [[G1848]] him that eateth [[G2068]] not; [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] let [[G2919]] him which eateth [[G2068]] not [[G3361]] judge [[G2919]] him [[G3588]] that eateth: [[G2068]] for [[G1063]] God hath [[G2316]] received [[G4355]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
Who [[G5101]] art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] that judgest [[G2919]] another man's [[G245]] servant? [[G3610]] to his own [[G2398]] master [[G2962]] he standeth [[G4739]] or [[G2228]] falleth. [[G4098]] Yea, [[G1161]] he shall be holden up: [[G2476]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] able [[G1415]] to make [[G2476]] him [[G846]] stand. [[G2476]]

### 5
One man [[G3739]] esteemeth [[G2919]] one day [[G2250]] above [[G3844]] another: [[G2250]] another [[G3739]] esteemeth [[G2919]] every [[G3956]] day [[G2250]] every man [[G1538]] Let be fully [[G4135]] persuaded [[G4135]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G2398]] mind. [[G3563]]

### 6
He [[G3588]] that regardeth [[G5426]] the [[G3588]] day, [[G2250]] regardeth [[G5426]] unto the Lord; [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] he that regardeth [[G5426]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] day, [[G2250]] to the Lord [[G2962]] not [[G3756]] he doth [[G5426]] regard [[G5426]] He [[G3588]] that eateth, [[G2068]] eateth [[G2068]] to the Lord, [[G2962]] for [[G1063]] he giveth [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] thanks; [[G2168]] and [[G2532]] he that eateth [[G2068]] not, [[G3361]] to the Lord [[G2962]] he eateth [[G2068]] not, [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] giveth [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] thanks. [[G2168]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] none [[G3762]] of us [[G2257]] liveth [[G2198]] to himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] dieth [[G599]] to himself. [[G1438]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] whether [[G1437]] we live, [[G2198]] we live [[G2198]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord; [[G2962]] and [[G5037]] whether [[G1437]] we die, [[G599]] we die [[G599]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord: [[G2962]] whether [[G1437]] we live [[G2198]] therefore, [[G3767]] or [[G5037]] die, [[G599]] we are [[G2070]] the [[G3588]] Lord's. [[G2962]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] to [[G1519]] this end [[G5124]] Christ [[G5547]] both [[G2532]] died, [[G599]] and [[G2532]] rose, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] revived, [[G326]] that [[G2443]] he might be Lord [[G2961]] both [[G2532]] of the dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] living. [[G2198]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] why [[G5101]] thou [[G4771]] dost [[G2919]] judge [[G2919]] thy [[G4675]] brother? [[G80]] or [[G2228]] why [[G5101]] thou [[G4771]] dost set at [[G1848]] nought [[G1848]] thy [[G4675]] brother? [[G80]] for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] we shall [[G3936]] stand [[G3936]] before the judgment [[G3588]] seat [[G968]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] I [[G1473]] live, [[G2198]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord, [[G2962]] every [[G3956]] knee [[G1119]] shall bow [[G2578]] to me, [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] tongue [[G1100]] shall confess [[G1843]] to [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
So [[G686]] then [[G3767]] every one [[G1538]] of us [[G2257]] shall give [[G1325]] account [[G3056]] of [[G4012]] himself [[G1438]] to [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 13
not any [[G3371]] therefore [[G3767]] Let us [[G2919]] judge [[G2919]] one another [[G240]] more: [[G3371]] but [[G235]] judge [[G2919]] this [[G5124]] rather, [[G3123]] that [[G3588]] no man [[G3361]] put in [[G5087]] a stumblingblock [[G4348]] or [[G2228]] an occasion to fall [[G4625]] brother's way. [[G80]]

### 14
I know, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] am persuaded [[G3982]] by [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] that [[G3754]] nothing [[G3762]] unclean [[G2839]] of [[G1223]] itself: [[G1438]] but [[G3361]] him [[G3588]] to that [[G3049]] esteemeth [[G3049]] any thing [[G5100]] to be [[G1511]] unclean, [[G2839]] to him [[G1565]] unclean. [[G2839]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] thy [[G4675]] brother be [[G80]] grieved [[G3076]] with [[G1223]] meat, [[G1033]] now [[G3765]] walkest thou [[G4043]] not [[G3765]] charitably. [[G26]] Destroy [[G622]] not [[G3361]] him [[G1565]] with [[G4675]] thy [[G4675]] meat, [[G1033]] for [[G5228]] whom [[G3739]] Christ [[G5547]] died. [[G599]]

### 16
not [[G3361]] Let be spoken of: [[G987]] then [[G3767]] your [[G5216]] good [[G18]] evil [[G987]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] meat [[G1035]] and [[G2532]] drink; [[G4213]] but [[G235]] righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] peace, [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] joy [[G5479]] in [[G1722]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] he that [[G1398]] these things [[G5125]] serveth [[G1398]] Christ [[G5547]] acceptable [[G2101]] to [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] approved [[G1384]] of [[G444]] men. [[G444]]

### 19
Let us follow [[G1377]] therefore [[G3767]] after [[G1377]] the things [[G3588]] which make for peace, [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] things [[G3588]] wherewith may [[G3619]] one [[G240]] edify [[G3619]] another. [[G240]]

### 20
For [[G1752]] meat [[G1033]] destroy [[G2647]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]] All things [[G3956]] indeed [[G3303]] pure; [[G2513]] but [[G235]] evil [[G2556]] for that [[G3588]]  man who [[G444]] eateth [[G2068]] with [[G1223]] offence. [[G4348]]

### 21
good [[G2570]] neither [[G3361]] to eat [[G5315]] flesh, [[G2907]] nor [[G3366]] to drink [[G4095]] wine, [[G3631]] nor [[G3366]] whereby [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] brother [[G80]] stumbleth, [[G4350]] or [[G2228]] is offended, [[G4624]] or [[G2228]] is made weak. [[G770]]

### 22
Hast [[G2192]] thou [[G4771]] faith? [[G4102]] have [[G2192]] to [[G2596]] thyself [[G4572]] before [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]] Happy [[G3107]] he that condemneth [[G2919]] not [[G3361]] himself [[G1438]] in [[G1722]] that thing which [[G3739]] he alloweth. [[G1381]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] he that doubteth [[G1252]] is damned [[G2632]] if [[G1437]] he eat, [[G5315]] because [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] faith: [[G4102]] for [[G1161]] whatsoever [[G3956]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] is [[G2076]] sin. [[G266]]
