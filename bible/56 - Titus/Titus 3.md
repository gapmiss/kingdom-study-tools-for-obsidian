Put in [[G5279]] them [[G846]] mind [[G5279]] to be subject to [[G5293]] principalities [[G746]] and [[G2532]] powers, [[G1849]] to obey magistrates, [[G3980]] to be [[G1511]] ready [[G2092]] to [[G4314]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work, [[G2041]]

### 2
To speak evil of [[G987]] no man, [[G3367]] to be [[G1511]] no brawlers, [[G269]] gentle, [[G1933]] shewing [[G1731]] all [[G3956]] meekness [[G4236]] unto [[G4314]] all [[G3956]] men. [[G444]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] we ourselves [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] were [[G1510]] sometimes [[G4218]] foolish, [[G453]] disobedient, [[G545]] deceived, [[G4105]] serving [[G1398]] divers [[G4164]] lusts [[G1939]] and [[G2532]] pleasures, [[G2237]] living [[G1236]] in [[G1722]] malice [[G2549]] and [[G2532]] envy, [[G5355]] hateful, [[G4767]] hating [[G3404]] one another.

But [[G1161]] after that [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] kindness [[G5544]] and [[G2532]] love toward man [[G5363]] of God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Saviour [[G4990]] appeared, [[G2014]]

### 5
Not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] of [[G1722]] righteousness [[G1343]] which [[G3739]] we [[G2249]] have done, [[G4160]] but [[G235]] according to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] mercy [[G1656]] he saved [[G4982]] us, [[G2248]] by [[G1223]] the washing [[G3067]] of regeneration, [[G3824]] and [[G2532]] renewing [[G342]] of the Holy [[G40]] Ghost; [[G4151]]

### 6
Which [[G3739]] he shed [[G1632]] on [[G1909]] us [[G2248]] abundantly [[G4146]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Saviour; [[G4990]]

### 7
That [[G2443]] being justified [[G1344]] by his [[G1565]] grace, [[G5485]] we should be made [[G1096]] heirs [[G2818]] according to [[G2596]] the hope [[G1680]] of eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

a faithful [[G4103]] saying, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] these things [[G5130]] I will [[G1014]] thou [[G4571]] that affirm [[G1226]] constantly, [[G1226]] that [[G2443]] they which have believed [[G4100]]  in [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] might be careful [[G5431]] to maintain [[G4291]] good [[G2570]] works. [[G2041]] These things [[G5023]] are [[G2076]] good [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] profitable [[G5624]] unto [[G444]] men. [[G444]]

### 10
A man [[G444]] that is an heretick [[G141]] after [[G3326]] the first [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] second [[G1208]] admonition [[G3559]] reject; [[G3868]]

### 11
Knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he [[G3588]] that is such [[G5108]] is subverted, [[G1612]] and [[G2532]] sinneth, [[G264]] being [[G5607]] condemned of himself. [[G843]]

### 12
When [[G3752]] I shall send [[G3992]] Artemas [[G734]] unto [[G4314]] thee, [[G4571]] or [[G2228]] Tychicus, [[G5190]] be diligent [[G4704]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me [[G3165]] to [[G1519]] Nicopolis: [[G3533]] for [[G1063]] I have determined [[G2919]] there [[G1563]] to winter. [[G3914]]

### 13
Bring on their journey [[G4311]] Zenas [[G2211]] the [[G3588]] lawyer [[G3544]] and [[G2532]] Apollos [[G625]] diligently, [[G4709]] that [[G2443]] nothing [[G3367]] be wanting [[G3007]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 15
All are [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] salute [[G782]] thee. [[G4571]] Greet [[G782]] them that love [[G5368]] us [[G2248]] in [[G1722]] the faith. [[G4102]] Grace [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]] Amen. [[G281]]
