Paul, [[G3972]] a servant [[G1401]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] an apostle [[G652]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] according to [[G2596]] the faith [[G4102]] of [[G1588]] God's [[G2316]] elect, [[G1588]] and [[G2532]] the acknowledging [[G1922]] of the truth [[G225]] which is [[G3588]] after [[G2596]] godliness; [[G2150]]

### 2
In [[G1909]] hope [[G1680]] of eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] which [[G3739]] God, [[G2316]] that cannot lie, [[G893]] promised [[G1861]] before [[G4253]] the world [[G5550]] began; [[G166]]

But [[G1161]] hath [[G5319]] in due [[G2398]] times [[G2540]] manifested [[G5319]] his [[G846]] word [[G3056]] through [[G1722]] preaching, [[G2782]] which [[G3739]] is committed unto [[G4100]] me [[G1473]] according to [[G2596]] the commandment [[G2003]] of God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Saviour; [[G4990]]

To Titus, [[G5103]] own [[G1103]] son [[G5043]] after [[G2596]] the common [[G2839]] faith: [[G4102]] Grace, [[G5485]] mercy, [[G1656]] peace, [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] the Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G2257]] Saviour. [[G4990]]

### 5
For this [[G5127]] cause [[G5484]] left I [[G2641]] thee [[G4571]] in [[G1722]] Crete, [[G2914]] that [[G2443]] thou shouldest set in order [[G1930]] the things [[G3588]] that are wanting, [[G3007]] and [[G2532]] ordain [[G2525]] elders [[G4245]] in every [[G2596]] city, [[G4172]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] had appointed [[G1299]] thee: [[G4671]]

### 6
If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] be [[G2076]] blameless, [[G410]] the husband [[G435]] of one [[G1520]] wife, [[G1135]] having [[G2192]] faithful [[G4103]] children [[G5043]] not [[G3361]] accused [[G1722]]  of [[G2724]] riot [[G810]] or [[G2228]] unruly. [[G506]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] a [[G3588]] bishop [[G1985]] must [[G1163]] be [[G1511]] blameless, [[G410]] as [[G5613]] the steward [[G3623]] of God; [[G2316]] not [[G3361]] selfwilled, [[G829]] not [[G3361]] soon angry, [[G3711]] not [[G3361]] given to wine, [[G3943]] no [[G3361]] striker, [[G4131]] not [[G3361]] given to filthy lucre; [[G146]]

### 8
But [[G235]] a lover of hospitality, [[G5382]] a lover of good men, [[G5358]] sober, [[G4998]] just, [[G1342]] holy, [[G3741]] temperate; [[G1468]]

### 9
Holding fast [[G472]] the [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] word [[G3056]] as [[G2596]] he hath been taught, [[G1322]] that [[G2443]] he may be [[G5600]] able [[G1415]] by [[G1722]] sound [[G5198]] doctrine [[G1319]] both [[G2532]] to exhort [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] to convince [[G1651]] the [[G3588]] gainsayers. [[G483]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] there are [[G1526]] many [[G4183]] unruly [[G506]] and [[G2532]] vain talkers [[G3151]] and [[G2532]] deceivers, [[G5423]] specially [[G3122]] they [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] the circumcision: [[G4061]]

Whose [[G3739]] must [[G1163]] mouths be [[G1993]] stopped, [[G1993]] who [[G3748]] subvert [[G396]] whole [[G3650]] houses, [[G3624]] teaching [[G1321]] things which [[G3739]] they ought [[G1163]] not, [[G3361]] for sake. [[G5484]] filthy [[G150]] lucre's [[G2771]]

### 12
One [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] themselves, [[G846]] a prophet [[G4396]] of their [[G846]] own, [[G2398]] said, [[G2036]] The Cretians [[G2912]] alway [[G104]] liars, [[G5583]] evil [[G2556]] beasts, [[G2342]] slow [[G692]] bellies. [[G1064]]

### 13
This [[G3778]] witness [[G3141]] is [[G2076]] true. [[G227]] Wherefore [[G1223]] rebuke [[G1651]] them [[G846]] sharply, [[G664]] that [[G2443]] they may be sound [[G5198]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] faith; [[G4102]]

### 14
Not [[G3361]] giving heed to [[G4337]] Jewish [[G2451]] fables, [[G3454]] and [[G2532]] commandments [[G1785]] of men, [[G444]] that turn from [[G654]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

### 15
the [[G3588]] Unto [[G2513]] pure [[G2513]] all things [[G3956]] pure: [[G2513]] but [[G1161]] unto them that are [[G3588]] defiled [[G3392]] and [[G2532]] unbelieving [[G571]] nothing [[G3762]] pure; [[G2513]] but [[G235]] even [[G2532]] their [[G846]] mind [[G3563]] and [[G2532]] conscience is [[G4893]] defiled. [[G3392]]

### 16
They profess [[G3670]] that they know [[G1492]] God; [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] in works [[G2041]] they deny [[G720]] being [[G5607]] abominable, [[G947]] and [[G2532]] disobedient, [[G545]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G4314]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work [[G2041]] reprobate. [[G96]]
