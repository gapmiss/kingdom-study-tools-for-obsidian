### 1
Be not [[H408]] thou envious [[H7065]] against evil [[H7451]] men, [[H376]] neither [[H408]] desire [[H183]] to be [[H1961]] with [[H854]] them. [[H854]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] their heart [[H3820]] studieth [[H1897]] destruction, [[H7701]] and their lips [[H8193]] talk [[H1696]] of mischief. [[H5999]]

### 3
Through wisdom [[H2451]] is an house [[H1004]] builded; [[H1129]] and by understanding [[H8394]] it is established: [[H3559]]

### 4
And by knowledge [[H1847]] shall the chambers [[H2315]] be filled [[H4390]] with all [[H3605]] precious [[H3368]] and pleasant [[H5273]] riches. [[H1952]]

### 5
A wise [[H2450]] man [[H1397]] strong; [[H5797]] yea, a man [[H376]] of knowledge [[H1847]] increaseth [[H553]] strength. [[H3581]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] by wise counsel [[H8458]] thou shalt make [[H6213]] thy war: [[H4421]] and in multitude [[H7230]] of counsellers [[H3289]] safety. [[H8668]]

### 7
Wisdom [[H2454]] too high [[H7311]] for a fool: [[H191]] he openeth [[H6605]] not [[H3808]] his mouth [[H6310]] in the gate. [[H8179]]

### 8
He that deviseth [[H2803]] to do evil [[H7489]] shall be called [[H7121]] a mischievous [[H4209]] person. [[H1167]]

### 9
The thought [[H2154]] of foolishness [[H200]] sin: [[H2403]] and the scorner [[H3887]] an abomination [[H8441]] to men. [[H120]]

### 10
thou faint [[H7503]] in the day [[H3117]] of adversity, [[H6869]] thy strength [[H3581]] small. [[H6862]]

### 11
If [[H518]] thou forbear [[H2820]] to deliver [[H5337]] drawn [[H3947]] unto death, [[H4194]] and ready [[H4131]] to be slain; [[H2027]]

### 12
If [[H3588]] thou sayest, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] we knew [[H3045]] it [[H2088]] not; [[H3808]] doth not [[H3808]] he that pondereth [[H8505]] the heart [[H3826]] consider [[H995]] and he that keepeth [[H5341]] thy soul, [[H5315]] doth he [[H1931]] know [[H3045]] and shall he render [[H7725]] to man [[H120]] according to his works? [[H6467]]

### 13
My son, [[H1121]] eat [[H398]] thou honey, [[H1706]] because [[H3588]] good; [[H2896]] and the honeycomb, [[H5317]] sweet [[H4966]] to [[H5921]] thy taste: [[H2441]]

### 14
So [[H3651]] the knowledge [[H3045]] of wisdom [[H2451]] unto thy soul: [[H5315]] when [[H518]] thou hast found [[H4672]] then there shall be [[H3426]] a reward, [[H319]] and thy expectation [[H8615]] shall not [[H3808]] be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 15
Lay not wait, [[H693]] O wicked [[H7563]] against the dwelling [[H5116]] of the righteous; [[H6662]] spoil [[H7703]] not [[H408]] his resting place: [[H7258]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] a just [[H6662]] falleth [[H5307]] seven times, [[H7651]] and riseth up again: [[H6965]] but the wicked [[H7563]] shall fall [[H3782]] into mischief. [[H7451]]

### 17
Rejoice [[H8055]] not [[H408]] when thine enemy [[H341]] falleth, [[H5307]] and let not [[H408]] thine heart [[H3820]] be glad [[H1523]] when he stumbleth: [[H3782]]

### 18
Lest [[H6435]] the Lord [[H3068]] see [[H7200]] and it displease [[H7489]] him, and he turn away [[H7725]] his wrath [[H639]] from [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 19
Fret [[H2734]] not thyself [[H408]] because of evil [[H7489]] neither [[H408]] be thou envious [[H7065]] at the wicked; [[H7563]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] reward [[H319]] to the evil [[H7451]] the candle [[H5216]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be put out. [[H1846]]

### 21
My son, [[H1121]] fear [[H3372]]  thou [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] and the king: [[H4428]] meddle [[H6148]] not [[H408]] with [[H5973]] them that are given to change: [[H8138]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] their calamity [[H343]] shall rise [[H6965]] suddenly; [[H6597]] and who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] the ruin [[H6365]] of them both? [[H8147]]

### 23
These [[H428]] also [[H1571]] to the wise. [[H2450]] not [[H1077]] good [[H2896]] to have respect [[H5234]] of persons [[H6440]] in judgment. [[H4941]]

### 24
He that saith [[H559]] unto the wicked, [[H7563]] Thou [[H859]] righteous; [[H6662]] him shall the people [[H5971]] curse, [[H5344]] nations [[H3816]] shall abhor [[H2194]] him: [[H2194]]

### 25
But to them that rebuke [[H3198]] shall be delight, [[H5276]] and a good [[H2896]] blessing [[H1293]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 26
shall kiss [[H5401]] lips [[H8193]] that giveth [[H7725]] a right [[H5228]] answer. [[H1697]]

### 27
Prepare [[H3559]] thy work [[H4399]] without, [[H2351]] and make it fit [[H6257]] for thyself in the field; [[H7704]] and afterwards [[H310]] build [[H1129]] thine house. [[H1004]]

### 28
Be [[H1961]] not [[H408]] a witness [[H5707]] against thy neighbour [[H7453]] without cause; [[H2600]] and deceive [[H6601]] with thy lips. [[H8193]]

### 29
Say [[H559]] not, [[H408]] I will do [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] to him as [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] to me: I will render [[H7725]] to the man [[H376]] according to his work. [[H6467]]

### 30
I went [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] the field [[H7704]] of the slothful, [[H376]] and by [[H5921]] the vineyard [[H3754]] of the man [[H120]] void [[H2638]] of understanding; [[H3820]]

### 31
And, lo, [[H2009]] it was all [[H3605]] grown over [[H5927]] with thorns, [[H7063]] nettles [[H2738]] had covered [[H3680]] the face [[H6440]] thereof, and the stone [[H68]] wall [[H1444]] thereof was broken down. [[H2040]]

### 32
Then I [[H595]] saw, [[H2372]] considered well: [[H7896]] I looked [[H7200]] upon received [[H3947]] instruction. [[H4148]]

### 33
a little [[H4592]] sleep, [[H8142]] a little [[H4592]] slumber, [[H8572]] a little [[H4592]] folding [[H2264]] of the hands [[H3027]] to sleep: [[H7901]]

### 34
So shall thy poverty [[H7389]] come [[H935]] one that travelleth; [[H1980]] and thy want [[H4270]] as an armed [[H4043]] man. [[H376]]
