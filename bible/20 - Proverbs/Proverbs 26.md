# Proverbs 26

[[Proverbs 25|←]] • [[Proverbs 27|→]]

---

### 1
As snow [[H7950]] in summer, [[H7019]] and as rain [[H4306]] in harvest, [[H7105]] so [[H3651]] honour [[H3519]] is not [[H3808]] seemly [[H5000]] for a fool. [[H3684]]

### 2
As the bird [[H6833]] by wandering, [[H5110]] as the swallow [[H1866]] by flying, [[H5774]] so [[H3651]] the curse [[H7045]] causeless [[H2600]] shall not [[H3808]] come. [[H935]]

### 3
A whip [[H7752]] for the horse, [[H5483]] a bridle [[H4964]] for the ass, [[H2543]] and a rod [[H7626]] for the fool's [[H3684]] back. [[H1460]]

### 4
Answer [[H6030]] not [[H408]] a fool [[H3684]] according to his folly, [[H200]] lest [[H6435]] thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] be like [[H7737]] unto him. [[H7737]]

### 5
Answer [[H6030]] a fool [[H3684]] according to his folly, [[H200]] lest [[H6435]] he be [[H1961]] wise [[H2450]] in his own conceit. [[H5869]]

### 6
He that sendeth [[H7971]] a message [[H1697]] by the hand [[H3027]] of a fool [[H3684]] cutteth off [[H7096]] the feet, [[H7272]] drinketh [[H8354]] damage. [[H2555]]

### 7
The legs [[H7785]] of the lame [[H6455]] are not equal: [[H1809]] so a parable [[H4912]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of fools. [[H3684]]

### 8
As he that bindeth [[H6887]] a stone [[H68]] in a sling, [[H4773]] so [[H3651]] he that giveth [[H5414]] honour [[H3519]] to a fool. [[H3684]]

### 9
a thorn [[H2336]] goeth up [[H5927]] into the hand [[H3027]] of a drunkard, [[H7910]] so a parable [[H4912]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of fools. [[H3684]]

### 10
The great [[H7227]] that formed [[H2342]] all [[H3605]] both rewardeth [[H7936]] the fool, [[H3684]] and rewardeth [[H7936]] transgressors. [[H5674]]

### 11
As a dog [[H3611]] returneth [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] his vomit, [[H6892]] a fool [[H3684]] returneth [[H8138]] to his folly. [[H200]]

### 12
Seest [[H7200]] thou a man [[H376]] wise [[H2450]] in his own conceit? [[H5869]] more hope [[H8615]] of a fool [[H3684]] than of [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 13
The slothful [[H6102]] saith, [[H559]] a lion [[H7826]] in the way; [[H1870]] a lion [[H738]] in [[H996]] the streets. [[H7339]]

### 14
the door [[H1817]] turneth [[H5437]] upon [[H5921]] his hinges, [[H6735]] so the slothful [[H6102]] upon [[H5921]] his bed. [[H4296]]

### 15
The slothful [[H6102]] hideth [[H2934]] his hand [[H3027]] in bosom; [[H6747]] it grieveth [[H3811]] him to bring it again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 16
The sluggard [[H6102]] wiser [[H2450]] in his own conceit [[H5869]] than seven [[H7651]] men that can render [[H7725]] a reason. [[H2940]]

### 17
He that passeth by, [[H5674]] meddleth [[H5674]] with [[H5921]] strife [[H7379]] not [[H3808]] to him, one that taketh [[H2388]] a dog [[H3611]] by the ears. [[H241]]

### 18
As a mad [[H3856]] who casteth [[H3384]] firebrands, [[H2131]] arrows, [[H2671]] and death, [[H4194]]

### 19
So [[H3651]] the man [[H376]] deceiveth [[H7411]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] and saith, [[H559]] Am not [[H3808]] I [[H589]] in sport? [[H7832]]

### 20
Where no [[H657]] wood [[H6086]] is, the fire [[H784]] goeth out: [[H3518]] so where no [[H369]] talebearer, [[H5372]] the strife [[H4066]] ceaseth. [[H8367]]

### 21
coals [[H6352]] to burning coals, [[H1513]] and wood [[H6086]] to fire; [[H784]] so a contentious [[H4066]] man [[H376]] to kindle [[H2787]] strife. [[H7379]]

### 22
The words [[H1697]] of a talebearer [[H5372]] as wounds, [[H3859]] and they [[H1992]] go down [[H3381]] into the innermost parts [[H2315]] of the belly. [[H990]]

### 23
Burning [[H1814]] lips [[H8193]] and a wicked [[H7451]] heart [[H3820]] a potsherd [[H2789]] covered [[H6823]] with silver [[H3701]] dross. [[H5509]]

### 24
He that hateth [[H8130]] dissembleth [[H5234]] with his lips, [[H8193]] and layeth up [[H7896]] deceit [[H4820]] within [[H7130]] him; [[H7130]]

### 25
When [[H3588]] he speaketh [[H6963]] fair, [[H2603]] believe [[H539]] him not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] seven [[H7651]] abominations [[H8441]] in his heart. [[H3820]]

### 26
hatred [[H8135]] is covered [[H3680]] by deceit, [[H4860]] his wickedness [[H7451]] shall be shewed [[H1540]] before the congregation. [[H6951]]

### 27
Whoso diggeth [[H3738]] a pit [[H7845]] shall fall [[H5307]] therein: and he that rolleth [[H1556]] a stone, [[H68]] it will return [[H7725]] upon [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 28
A lying [[H8267]] tongue [[H3956]] hateth [[H8130]] afflicted [[H1790]] by it; and a flattering [[H2509]] mouth [[H6310]] worketh [[H6213]] ruin. [[H4072]]
