### 1
A wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] his father's [[H1]] instruction: [[H4148]] but a scorner [[H3887]] heareth [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] rebuke. [[H1606]]

### 2
A man [[H376]] shall eat [[H398]] good [[H2896]] by the fruit [[H6529]] of mouth: [[H6310]] but the soul [[H5315]] of the transgressors [[H898]] violence. [[H2555]]

### 3
He that keepeth [[H5341]] his mouth [[H6310]] keepeth [[H8104]] his life: [[H5315]] he that openeth wide [[H6589]] his lips [[H8193]] shall have destruction. [[H4288]]

### 4
The soul [[H5315]] of the sluggard [[H6102]] desireth, [[H183]] and nothing: [[H369]] but the soul [[H5315]] of the diligent [[H2742]] shall be made fat. [[H1878]]

### 5
A righteous [[H6662]] hateth [[H8130]] lying: [[H1697]] but a wicked [[H7563]] is loathsome, [[H887]] and cometh to shame. [[H2659]]

### 6
Righteousness [[H6666]] keepeth [[H5341]] upright [[H8537]] in the way: [[H1870]] but wickedness [[H7564]] overthroweth [[H5557]] the sinner. [[H2403]]

### 7
There is [[H3426]] that maketh himself rich, [[H6238]] yet nothing: [[H369]] that maketh himself poor, [[H7326]] yet [[H3605]] great [[H7227]] riches. [[H1952]]

### 8
The ransom [[H3724]] of a man's [[H376]] life [[H5315]] his riches: [[H6239]] but the poor [[H7326]] heareth [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] rebuke. [[H1606]]

### 9
The light [[H216]] of the righteous [[H6662]] rejoiceth: [[H8055]] but the lamp [[H5216]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be put out. [[H1846]]

### 10
Only [[H7535]] by pride [[H2087]] cometh [[H5414]] contention: [[H4683]] but with [[H854]] the well advised [[H3289]] wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 11
Wealth [[H1952]] by vanity [[H1892]] shall be diminished: [[H4591]] but he that gathereth [[H6908]] by [[H5921]] labour [[H3027]] shall increase. [[H7235]]

### 12
Hope [[H8431]] deferred [[H4900]] maketh the heart [[H3820]] sick: [[H2470]] but the desire [[H8378]] cometh, [[H935]] a tree [[H6086]] of life. [[H2416]]

### 13
Whoso despiseth [[H936]] the word [[H1697]] shall be destroyed: [[H2254]] but he [[H1931]] that feareth [[H3373]] the commandment [[H4687]] shall be rewarded. [[H7999]]

### 14
The law [[H8451]] of the wise [[H2450]] a fountain [[H4726]] of life, [[H2416]] to depart [[H5493]] from the snares [[H4170]] of death. [[H4194]]

### 15
Good [[H2896]] understanding [[H7922]] giveth [[H5414]] favour: [[H2580]] but the way [[H1870]] of transgressors [[H898]] hard. [[H386]]

### 16
Every [[H3605]] prudent [[H6175]] dealeth [[H6213]] with knowledge: [[H1847]] but a fool [[H3684]] layeth open [[H6566]] folly. [[H200]]

### 17
A wicked [[H7563]] messenger [[H4397]] falleth [[H5307]] into mischief: [[H7451]] but a faithful [[H529]] ambassador [[H6735]] health. [[H4832]]

### 18
Poverty [[H7389]] and shame [[H7036]] him that refuseth [[H6544]] instruction: [[H4148]] but he that regardeth [[H8104]] reproof [[H8433]] shall be honoured. [[H3513]]

### 19
The desire [[H8378]] accomplished [[H1961]] is sweet [[H6149]] to the soul: [[H5315]] but abomination [[H8441]] to fools [[H3684]] to depart [[H5493]] from evil. [[H7451]]

### 20
He that walketh [[H1980]] with [[H854]] wise [[H2450]] shall be wise: [[H2449]] but a companion [[H7462]] of fools [[H3684]] shall be destroyed. [[H7321]]

### 21
Evil [[H7451]] pursueth [[H7291]] sinners: [[H2400]] but to the righteous [[H6662]] good [[H2896]] shall be repayed. [[H7999]]

### 22
A good [[H2896]] leaveth an inheritance [[H5157]] to his children's [[H1121]] children: [[H1121]] and the wealth [[H2428]] of the sinner [[H2398]] laid up [[H6845]] for the just. [[H6662]]

### 23
Much [[H7230]] food [[H400]] the tillage [[H5215]] of the poor: [[H7326]] but there is [[H3426]] destroyed [[H5595]] for want [[H3808]] of judgment. [[H4941]]

### 24
He that spareth [[H2820]] his rod [[H7626]] hateth [[H8130]] his son: [[H1121]] but he that loveth [[H157]] him chasteneth [[H4148]] him betimes. [[H7836]]

### 25
The righteous [[H6662]] eateth [[H398]] to the satisfying [[H7648]] of his soul: [[H5315]] but the belly [[H990]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall want. [[H2637]]
