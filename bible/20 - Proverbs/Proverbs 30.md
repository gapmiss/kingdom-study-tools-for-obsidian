### 1
The words [[H1697]] of Agur [[H94]] the son [[H1121]] of Jakeh, [[H3348]] the prophecy: [[H4853]] the man [[H1397]] spake [[H5002]] unto Ithiel, [[H384]] even unto Ithiel [[H384]] and Ucal, [[H401]]

### 2
Surely [[H3588]] I [[H595]] more brutish [[H1198]] than man, [[H376]] and have not [[H3808]] the understanding [[H998]] of a man. [[H120]]

### 3
I neither [[H3808]] learned [[H3925]] wisdom, [[H2451]] nor have [[H3045]] the knowledge [[H1847]] of the holy. [[H6918]]

### 4
Who [[H4310]] hath ascended up [[H5927]] into heaven, [[H8064]] or descended? [[H3381]] who [[H4310]] hath gathered [[H622]] the wind [[H7307]] in his fists? [[H2651]] who [[H4310]] hath bound [[H6887]] the waters [[H4325]] in a garment? [[H8071]] who [[H4310]] hath established [[H6965]] all [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth? [[H776]] what [[H4100]] his name, [[H8034]] and what [[H4100]] his son's [[H1121]] name, [[H8034]] if [[H3588]] thou canst tell? [[H3045]]

### 5
Every [[H3605]] word [[H565]] of God [[H433]] pure: [[H6884]] he [[H1931]] a shield [[H4043]] unto them that put their trust [[H2620]] in him. [[H2620]]

### 6
Add [[H3254]] thou not [[H408]] unto [[H5921]] his words, [[H1697]] lest [[H6435]] he reprove [[H3198]] thee, and thou be found a liar. [[H3576]]

### 7
Two [[H8147]] have I required [[H7592]] of [[H853]] thee; deny [[H4513]] me not [[H408]] before [[H2962]] I die: [[H4191]]

### 8
Remove far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me vanity [[H7723]] and lies: [[H1697]] give [[H5414]] me neither [[H408]] poverty [[H7389]] nor riches; [[H6239]] feed [[H2963]] me with food [[H3899]] convenient [[H2706]] for me: [[H2706]]

### 9
Lest [[H6435]] I be full, [[H7646]] and deny [[H3584]] and say, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] the Lord? [[H3068]] or lest [[H6435]] I be poor, [[H3423]] and steal, [[H1589]] and take [[H8610]] the name [[H8034]] of my God [[H430]]

### 10
Accuse [[H3960]] not [[H408]] a servant [[H5650]] unto [[H413]] his master, [[H113]] lest [[H6435]] he curse [[H7043]] thee, and thou be found guilty. [[H816]]

### 11
a generation [[H1755]] curseth [[H7043]] their father, [[H1]] and doth not [[H3808]] bless [[H1288]] their mother. [[H517]]

### 12
a generation [[H1755]] pure [[H2889]] in their own eyes, [[H5869]] and is not [[H3808]] washed [[H7364]] from their filthiness. [[H6675]]

### 13
a generation, [[H1755]] O how [[H4100]] lofty [[H7311]] are their eyes! [[H5869]] and their eyelids [[H6079]] are lifted up. [[H5375]]

### 14
a generation, [[H1755]] whose teeth [[H8127]] swords, [[H2719]] and their jaw teeth [[H4973]] knives, [[H3979]] to devour [[H398]] the poor [[H6041]] from off the earth, [[H776]] and the needy [[H34]] from men. [[H120]]

### 15
The horseleach [[H5936]] hath two [[H8147]] daughters, [[H1323]] Give, [[H3051]] give. [[H3051]] There are three [[H7969]] are never [[H3808]] satisfied, [[H7646]] four [[H702]] say [[H559]] not, [[H3808]] enough: [[H1952]]

### 16
The grave; [[H7585]] and the barren [[H6115]] womb; [[H7356]] the earth [[H776]] is not [[H3808]] filled [[H7646]] with water; [[H4325]] and the fire [[H784]] saith [[H559]] not, [[H3808]] enough. [[H1952]]

### 17
The eye [[H5869]] mocketh [[H3932]] at father, [[H1]] and despiseth [[H936]] to obey [[H3349]] mother, [[H517]] the ravens [[H6158]] of the valley [[H5158]] shall pick it out, [[H5365]] and the young [[H1121]] eagles [[H5404]] shall eat [[H398]] it. [[H398]]

### 18
There be three [[H7969]] are too wonderful [[H6381]] for [[H4480]] me, yea, four [[H702]] which I know [[H3045]] not: [[H3045]]

### 19
The way [[H1870]] of an eagle [[H5404]] in the air; [[H8064]] the way [[H1870]] of a serpent [[H5175]] upon [[H5921]] a rock; [[H6697]] the way [[H1870]] of a ship [[H591]] in the midst [[H3820]] of the sea; [[H3220]] and the way [[H1870]] of a man [[H1397]] with a maid. [[H5959]]

### 20
Such [[H3651]] the way [[H1870]] of an adulterous [[H5003]] woman; [[H802]] she eateth, [[H398]] and wipeth [[H4229]] her mouth, [[H6310]] and saith, [[H559]] I have done [[H6466]] no [[H3808]] wickedness. [[H205]]

### 21
For [[H8478]] three [[H7969]] the earth [[H776]] is disquieted, [[H7264]] and for [[H8478]] four [[H702]] it cannot [[H3201]] bear: [[H5375]]

### 22
For [[H8478]] a servant [[H5650]] when [[H3588]] he reigneth; [[H4427]] and a fool [[H5036]] when [[H3588]] he is filled [[H7646]] with meat; [[H3899]]

### 23
For [[H8478]] an odious [[H8130]] when [[H3588]] she is married; [[H1166]] and an handmaid [[H8198]] that [[H3588]] is heir [[H3423]] to her mistress. [[H1404]]

### 24
There be four [[H702]] little [[H6996]] upon the earth, [[H776]] but they [[H1992]] exceeding [[H2449]] wise: [[H2450]]

### 25
The ants [[H5244]] a people [[H5971]] not [[H3808]] strong, [[H5794]] yet they prepare [[H3559]] their meat [[H3899]] in the summer; [[H7019]]

### 26
The conies [[H8227]] a feeble [[H6099]] folk, [[H5971]] yet make [[H7760]] they their houses [[H1004]] in the rocks; [[H5553]]

### 27
The locusts [[H697]] have no [[H369]] king, [[H4428]] yet go they forth [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] of them by bands; [[H2686]]

### 28
The spider [[H8079]] taketh hold [[H8610]] with her hands, [[H3027]] and is in kings' [[H4428]] palaces. [[H1964]]

### 29
There be three [[H7969]] which go [[H6806]] well, [[H3190]] yea, four [[H702]] are comely [[H3190]] in going: [[H1980]]

### 30
A lion [[H3918]] strongest [[H1368]] among beasts, [[H929]] and turneth not away [[H7725]] for [[H6440]] any; [[H6440]]

### 31
A greyhound; [[H4975]] an he goat [[H8495]] also; [[H176]] and a king, [[H4428]] against [[H5973]] whom no rising up. [[H510]]

### 32
If [[H518]] thou hast done foolishly [[H5034]] in lifting up thyself, [[H5375]] or if [[H518]] thou hast thought evil, [[H2161]] thine hand [[H3027]] upon thy mouth. [[H6310]]

### 33
Surely [[H3588]] the churning [[H4330]] of milk [[H2461]] bringeth forth [[H3318]] butter, [[H2529]] and the wringing [[H4330]] of the nose [[H639]] bringeth forth [[H3318]] blood: [[H1818]] so the forcing [[H4330]] of wrath [[H639]] bringeth forth [[H3318]] strife. [[H7379]]
