# Proverbs 16

[[Proverbs 15|←]] • [[Proverbs 17|→]]

---

### 1
The preparations [[H4633]] of the heart [[H3820]] in man, [[H120]] and the answer [[H4617]] of the tongue, [[H3956]] from the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
All [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] of a man [[H376]] clean [[H2134]] in his own eyes; [[H5869]] but the Lord [[H3068]] weigheth [[H8505]] the spirits. [[H7307]]

### 3
Commit [[H1556]] thy works [[H4639]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and thy thoughts [[H4284]] shall be established. [[H3559]]

### 4
The Lord [[H3068]] hath made [[H6466]] all [[H3605]] for himself: [[H4617]] yea, even [[H1571]] the wicked [[H7563]] for the day [[H3117]] of evil. [[H7451]]

### 5
Every one [[H3605]] proud [[H1362]] in heart [[H3820]] an abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] in hand, [[H3027]] he shall not [[H3808]] be unpunished. [[H5352]]

### 6
By mercy [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] iniquity [[H5771]] is purged: [[H3722]] and by the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] depart [[H5493]] from evil. [[H7451]]

### 7
When a man's [[H376]] ways [[H1870]] please [[H7521]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he maketh even [[H1571]] his enemies [[H341]] to be at peace [[H7999]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 8
Better [[H2896]] a little [[H4592]] with righteousness [[H6666]] than great [[H7230]] revenues [[H8393]] without [[H3808]] right. [[H4941]]

### 9
A man's [[H120]] heart [[H3820]] deviseth [[H2803]] his way: [[H1870]] but the Lord [[H3068]] directeth [[H3559]] his steps. [[H6806]]

### 10
A divine sentence [[H7081]] in [[H5921]] the lips [[H8193]] of the king: [[H4428]] his mouth [[H6310]] transgresseth [[H4603]] not [[H3808]] in judgment. [[H4941]]

### 11
A just [[H4941]] weight [[H6425]] and balance [[H3976]] the Lord's: [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the weights [[H68]] of the bag [[H3599]] his work. [[H4639]]

### 12
an abomination [[H8441]] to kings [[H4428]] to commit [[H6213]] wickedness: [[H7562]] for [[H3588]] the throne [[H3678]] is established [[H3559]] by righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 13
Righteous [[H6664]] lips [[H8193]] the delight [[H7522]] of kings; [[H4428]] and they love [[H157]] him that speaketh [[H1696]] right. [[H3477]]

### 14
The wrath [[H2534]] of a king [[H4428]] messengers [[H4397]] of death: [[H4194]] but a wise [[H2450]] man [[H376]] will pacify [[H3722]] it. [[H3722]]

### 15
In the light [[H216]] of the king's [[H4428]] countenance [[H6440]] life; [[H2416]] and his favour [[H7522]] as a cloud [[H5645]] of the latter rain. [[H4456]]

### 16
How much [[H4100]] better [[H2896]] to get [[H7069]] wisdom [[H2451]] than gold! [[H2742]] and to get [[H7069]] understanding [[H998]] rather to be chosen [[H977]] than silver! [[H3701]]

### 17
The highway [[H4546]] of the upright [[H3477]] to depart [[H5493]] from evil: [[H7451]] he that keepeth [[H5341]] his way [[H1870]] preserveth [[H8104]] his soul. [[H5315]]

### 18
Pride [[H1347]] before [[H6440]] destruction, [[H7667]] and an haughty [[H1363]] spirit [[H7307]] before [[H6440]] a fall. [[H3783]]

### 19
Better [[H2896]] of an humble [[H8217]] spirit [[H7307]] with [[H854]] the lowly, [[H6035]] than to divide [[H2505]] the spoil [[H7998]] with [[H854]] the proud. [[H1343]]

### 20
He that handleth a matter [[H1697]] wisely [[H7919]] shall find [[H4672]] good: [[H2896]] and whoso trusteth [[H982]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] happy [[H835]] he. [[H835]]

### 21
The wise [[H2450]] in heart [[H3820]] shall be called [[H7121]] prudent: [[H995]] and the sweetness [[H4986]] of the lips [[H8193]] increaseth [[H3254]] learning. [[H3948]]

### 22
Understanding [[H7922]] a wellspring [[H4726]] of life [[H2416]] unto him that hath [[H1167]] it: but the instruction [[H4148]] of fools [[H191]] folly. [[H200]]

### 23
The heart [[H3820]] of the wise [[H2450]] teacheth [[H7919]] his mouth, [[H6310]] and addeth [[H3254]] learning [[H3948]] to [[H5921]] his lips. [[H8193]]

### 24
Pleasant [[H5278]] words [[H561]] an honeycomb, [[H6688]] sweet [[H4966]] to the soul, [[H5315]] and health [[H4832]] to the bones. [[H6106]]

### 25
There is [[H3426]] a way [[H1870]] that seemeth right [[H3477]] unto [[H6440]] a man, [[H376]] but the end [[H319]] thereof the ways [[H1870]] of death. [[H4194]]

### 26
He [[H5315]] that laboureth [[H6001]] laboureth [[H5998]] for himself; for [[H3588]] his mouth [[H6310]] craveth [[H404]] it of [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 27
An ungodly [[H1100]] man [[H376]] diggeth up [[H3738]] evil: [[H7451]] and in [[H5921]] his lips [[H8193]] as a burning [[H6867]] fire. [[H784]]

### 28
A froward [[H8419]] man [[H376]] soweth [[H7971]] strife: [[H4066]] and a whisperer [[H5372]] separateth [[H6504]] chief friends. [[H441]]

### 29
A violent [[H2555]] man [[H376]] enticeth [[H6601]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] and leadeth [[H1980]] him into the way [[H1870]] not [[H3808]] good. [[H2896]]

### 30
He shutteth [[H6095]] his eyes [[H5869]] to devise [[H2803]] froward things: [[H8419]] moving [[H7169]] his lips [[H8193]] he bringeth [[H3615]] evil [[H7451]] to pass. [[H7451]]

### 31
The hoary head [[H7872]] a crown [[H5850]] of glory, [[H8597]] it be found [[H4672]] in the way [[H1870]] of righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 32
slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] better [[H2896]] than the mighty; [[H1368]] and he that ruleth [[H4910]] his spirit [[H7307]] than he that taketh [[H3920]] a city. [[H5892]]

### 33
The lot [[H1486]] is cast [[H2904]] into the lap; [[H2436]] but the whole [[H3605]] disposing [[H4941]] thereof of the Lord. [[H3068]]
