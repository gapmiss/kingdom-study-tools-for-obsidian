[[Proverbs 27|←]] • [[Proverbs 29|→]]

---

### 1
The wicked [[H7563]] flee [[H5127]] when no [[H369]] man pursueth: [[H7291]] but the righteous [[H6662]] are bold [[H982]] as a lion. [[H3715]]

### 2
For the transgression [[H6588]] of a land [[H776]] many [[H7227]] the princes [[H8269]] thereof: but by a man [[H120]] of understanding [[H995]] knowledge [[H3045]] the state [[H3651]] shall be prolonged. [[H748]]

### 3
A poor [[H7326]] man [[H1397]] that oppresseth [[H6231]] the poor [[H1800]] a sweeping [[H5502]] rain [[H4306]] which leaveth no [[H369]] food. [[H3899]]

### 4
They that forsake [[H5800]] the law [[H8451]] praise [[H1984]] the wicked: [[H7563]] but such as keep [[H8104]] the law [[H8451]] contend [[H1624]] with them. [[H1624]]

### 5
Evil [[H7451]] men [[H582]] understand [[H995]] not [[H3808]] judgment: [[H4941]] but they that seek [[H1245]] the Lord [[H3068]] understand [[H995]] all [[H3605]]

### 6
Better [[H2896]] the poor [[H7326]] that walketh [[H1980]] in his uprightness, [[H8537]] than perverse [[H6141]] ways, [[H1870]] though he [[H1931]] rich. [[H6223]]

### 7
Whoso keepeth [[H5341]] the law [[H8451]] a wise [[H995]] son: [[H1121]] but he that is a companion [[H7462]] of riotous [[H2151]] shameth [[H3637]] his father. [[H1]]

### 8
He that by usury [[H5392]] and unjust gain [[H8636]] increaseth [[H7235]] his substance, [[H1952]] he shall gather [[H6908]] it for him that will pity [[H2603]] the poor. [[H1800]]

### 9
He that turneth away [[H5493]] his ear [[H241]] from hearing [[H8085]] the law, [[H8451]] even [[H1571]] his prayer [[H8605]] abomination. [[H8441]]

### 10
Whoso causeth the righteous [[H3477]] to go astray [[H7686]] in an evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] he shall fall [[H5307]] himself [[H1931]] into his own pit: [[H7816]] but the upright [[H8549]] shall have good [[H2896]] in possession. [[H5157]]

### 11
The rich [[H6223]] man [[H376]] wise [[H2450]] in his own conceit; [[H5869]] but the poor [[H1800]] that hath understanding [[H995]] searcheth him out. [[H2713]]

### 12
When righteous [[H6662]] do rejoice, [[H5970]] great [[H7227]] glory: [[H8597]] but when the wicked [[H7563]] rise, [[H6965]] a man [[H120]] is hidden. [[H2664]]

### 13
He that covereth [[H3680]] his sins [[H6588]] shall not [[H3808]] prosper: [[H6743]] but whoso confesseth [[H3034]] and forsaketh [[H5800]] shall have mercy. [[H7355]]

### 14
Happy [[H835]] the man [[H120]] that feareth [[H6342]] alway: [[H8548]] but he that hardeneth [[H7185]] his heart [[H3820]] shall fall [[H5307]] into mischief. [[H7451]]

### 15
a roaring [[H5098]] lion, [[H738]] and a ranging [[H8264]] bear; [[H1677]] a wicked [[H7563]] ruler [[H4910]] over [[H5921]] the poor [[H1800]] people. [[H5971]]

### 16
The prince [[H5057]] that wanteth [[H2638]] understanding [[H8394]] also a great [[H7227]] oppressor: [[H4642]] he that hateth [[H8130]] covetousness [[H1215]] shall prolong [[H748]] days. [[H3117]]

### 17
A man [[H120]] that doeth violence [[H6231]] to the blood [[H1818]] of person [[H5315]] shall flee [[H5127]] to [[H5704]] the pit; [[H953]] let no [[H408]] man stay [[H8551]] him. [[H8551]]

### 18
Whoso walketh [[H1980]] uprightly [[H8549]] shall be saved: [[H3467]] but perverse [[H6140]] ways [[H1870]] shall fall [[H5307]] at once. [[H259]]

### 19
He that tilleth [[H5647]] his land [[H127]] shall have plenty [[H7646]] of bread: [[H3899]] but he that followeth [[H7291]] after vain [[H7386]] shall have poverty enough. [[H7389]]

### 20
A faithful [[H530]] man [[H376]] shall abound [[H7227]] with blessings: [[H1293]] but he that maketh haste [[H213]] to be rich [[H6238]] shall not [[H3808]] be innocent. [[H5352]]

### 21
To have respect [[H5234]] of persons [[H6440]] not [[H3808]] good: [[H2896]] for for [[H5921]] a piece [[H6595]] of bread [[H3899]] man [[H1397]] will transgress. [[H6586]]

### 22
He [[H376]] that hasteth [[H926]] to be rich [[H1952]] an evil [[H7451]] eye, [[H5869]] and considereth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] poverty [[H2639]] shall come upon [[H935]] him. [[H935]]

### 23
He that rebuketh [[H3198]] a man [[H120]] afterwards [[H310]] shall find [[H4672]] more favour [[H2580]] than he that flattereth [[H2505]] with the tongue. [[H3956]]

### 24
Whoso robbeth [[H1497]] his father [[H1]] or his mother, [[H517]] and saith, [[H559]] no [[H369]] transgression; [[H6588]] the same [[H1931]] the companion [[H2270]] of a destroyer. [[H376]]

### 25
He that is of a proud [[H7342]] heart [[H5315]] stirreth up [[H1624]] strife: [[H4066]] but he that putteth his trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall be made fat. [[H1878]]

### 26
He [[H1931]] that trusteth [[H982]] in his own heart [[H3820]] is a fool: [[H3684]] but whoso walketh [[H1980]] wisely, [[H2451]] he [[H1931]] shall be delivered. [[H4422]]

### 27
He that giveth [[H5414]] unto the poor [[H7326]] shall not [[H369]] lack: [[H4270]] but he that hideth [[H5956]] his eyes [[H5869]] shall have many [[H7227]] a curse. [[H3994]]

### 28
When the wicked [[H7563]] rise, [[H6965]] men [[H120]] hide themselves: [[H5641]] but when they perish, [[H6]] the righteous [[H6662]] increase. [[H7235]]
