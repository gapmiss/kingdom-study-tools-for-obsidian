### 1
A name [[H8034]] rather to be chosen [[H977]] than great [[H7227]] riches, [[H6239]] loving [[H2896]] favour [[H2580]] rather than silver [[H3701]] and gold. [[H2091]]

### 2
The rich [[H6223]] and poor [[H7326]] meet together: [[H6298]] the Lord [[H3068]] the maker [[H6213]] of them all. [[H6213]]

### 3
A prudent [[H6175]] foreseeth [[H7200]] the evil, [[H7451]] and hideth himself: [[H5641]] but the simple [[H6612]] pass on, [[H5674]] and are punished. [[H6064]]

### 4
By [[H6118]] humility [[H6038]] the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] riches, [[H6239]] and honour, [[H3519]] and life. [[H2416]]

### 5
Thorns [[H6791]] snares [[H6341]] in the way [[H1870]] of the froward: [[H6141]] he that doth keep [[H8104]] his soul [[H5315]] shall be far [[H7368]] from them. [[H7368]]

### 6
Train up [[H2596]] a child [[H5288]] in [[H5921]] the way [[H1870]] he should go: [[H6310]] and [[H1571]] when [[H3588]] he is old, [[H2204]] he will not [[H3808]] depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]

### 7
The rich [[H6223]] ruleth [[H4910]] over the poor, [[H7326]] and the borrower [[H3867]] servant [[H5650]] to the lender. [[H376]]

### 8
He that soweth [[H2232]] iniquity [[H5766]] shall reap [[H7114]] vanity: [[H205]] and the rod [[H7626]] of his anger [[H5678]] shall fail. [[H3615]]

### 9
He [[H1931]] that hath a bountiful [[H2896]] eye [[H5869]] shall be blessed; [[H1288]] for [[H3588]] he giveth [[H5414]] of his bread [[H3899]] to the poor. [[H1800]]

### 10
Cast out [[H1644]] the scorner, [[H3887]] and contention [[H4066]] shall go out; [[H3318]] yea, strife [[H1779]] and reproach [[H7036]] shall cease. [[H7673]]

### 11
He that loveth [[H157]] pureness [[H2889]] of heart, [[H3820]] the grace [[H2580]] of his lips [[H8193]] the king [[H4428]] his friend. [[H7453]]

### 12
The eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] preserve [[H5341]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and he overthroweth [[H5557]] the words [[H1697]] of the transgressor. [[H898]]

### 13
The slothful [[H6102]] saith, [[H559]] a lion [[H738]] without, [[H2351]] I shall be slain [[H7523]] in [[H8432]] the streets. [[H7339]]

### 14
The mouth [[H6310]] of strange women [[H2114]] a deep [[H6013]] pit: [[H7745]] he that is abhorred [[H2194]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall fall [[H5307]] therein. [[H5307]]

### 15
Foolishness [[H200]] bound [[H7194]] in the heart [[H3820]] of a child; [[H5288]] the rod [[H7626]] of correction [[H4148]] shall drive it far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 16
He that oppresseth [[H6231]] the poor [[H1800]] to increase [[H7235]] his he that giveth [[H5414]] to the rich, [[H6223]] surely [[H389]] to want. [[H4270]]

### 17
Bow down [[H5186]] thine ear, [[H241]] and hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the wise, [[H2450]] and apply [[H7896]] thine heart [[H3820]] unto my knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] a pleasant thing [[H5273]] if [[H3588]] thou keep [[H8104]] them within [[H990]] thee; they shall withal [[H3162]] be fitted [[H3559]] in [[H5921]] thy lips. [[H8193]]

### 19
That thy trust [[H4009]] may be [[H1961]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] I have made known [[H3045]] to thee this day, [[H3117]] even [[H637]] to thee. [[H637]]

### 20
Have not [[H3808]] I written [[H3789]] to thee excellent things [[H8032]] in counsels [[H4156]] and knowledge, [[H1847]]

### 21
That I might make thee know [[H3045]] the certainty [[H7189]] of the words [[H561]] of truth; [[H571]] that thou mightest answer [[H7725]] the words [[H561]] of truth [[H571]] to them that send [[H7971]] unto thee? [[H7971]]

### 22
Rob [[H1497]] not [[H408]] the poor, [[H1800]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] poor: [[H1800]] neither [[H408]] oppress [[H1792]] the afflicted [[H6041]] in the gate: [[H8179]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will plead [[H7378]] their cause, [[H7379]] and spoil [[H6906]] the soul [[H5315]]  of [[H853]] those that spoiled [[H6906]] them. [[H6906]]

### 24
Make no [[H408]] friendship [[H7462]] with [[H854]] an angry [[H639]] man; [[H1167]] and with [[H854]] a furious [[H2534]] man [[H376]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] go: [[H935]]

### 25
Lest [[H6435]] thou learn [[H502]] his ways, [[H734]] and get [[H3947]] a snare [[H4170]] to thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 26
Be [[H1961]] not [[H408]] thou of them that strike [[H8628]] hands, [[H3709]] of them that are sureties [[H6148]] for debts. [[H4859]]

### 27
If [[H518]] thou hast nothing [[H369]] to pay, [[H7999]] why [[H4100]] should he take away [[H3947]] thy bed [[H4904]] from under [[H8478]] thee? [[H8478]]

### 28
Remove [[H5253]] not [[H408]] the ancient [[H5769]] landmark, [[H1366]] which [[H834]] thy fathers [[H1]] have set. [[H6213]]

### 29
Seest [[H2372]] thou a man [[H376]] diligent [[H4106]] in his business? [[H4399]] he shall stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] kings; [[H4428]] he shall not [[H1077]] stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] mean [[H2823]]
