### 1
My son, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] thou wilt receive [[H3947]] my words, [[H561]] and hide [[H6845]] my commandments [[H4687]] with [[H854]] thee; [[H854]]

### 2
So that thou incline [[H7181]] thine ear [[H241]] unto wisdom, [[H2451]] apply [[H5186]] thine heart [[H3820]] to understanding; [[H8394]]

### 3
Yea, [[H3588]] if [[H518]] thou criest [[H7121]] after knowledge, [[H998]] liftest up [[H5414]] thy voice [[H6963]] for understanding; [[H8394]]

### 4
If [[H518]] thou seekest [[H1245]] her as silver, [[H3701]] and searchest [[H2664]] for her as hid treasures; [[H4301]]

### 5
Then [[H227]] shalt thou understand [[H995]] the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and find [[H4672]] the knowledge [[H1847]] of God. [[H430]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] giveth [[H5414]] wisdom: [[H2451]] out of his mouth [[H6310]] knowledge [[H1847]] and understanding. [[H8394]]

### 7
He layeth up [[H6845]] sound wisdom [[H8454]] for the righteous: [[H3477]] a buckler [[H4043]] to them that walk [[H1980]] uprightly. [[H8537]]

### 8
He keepeth [[H5341]] the paths [[H734]] of judgment, [[H4941]] and preserveth [[H8104]] the way [[H1870]] of his saints. [[H2623]]

### 9
Then [[H227]] shalt thou understand [[H995]] righteousness, [[H6664]] and judgment, [[H4941]] and equity; [[H4339]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] path. [[H4570]]

### 10
When [[H3588]] wisdom [[H2451]] entereth [[H935]] into thine heart, [[H3820]] and knowledge [[H1847]] is pleasant [[H5276]] unto thy soul; [[H5315]]

### 11
Discretion [[H4209]] shall preserve [[H8104]] thee, understanding [[H8394]] shall keep [[H5341]] thee: [[H5341]]

### 12
To deliver [[H5337]] thee from the way [[H1870]] of the evil [[H7451]] from the man [[H376]] that speaketh [[H1696]] froward things; [[H8419]]

### 13
Who leave [[H5800]] the paths [[H734]] of uprightness, [[H3476]] to walk [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of darkness; [[H2822]]

### 14
Who rejoice [[H8056]] to do [[H6213]] evil, [[H7451]] delight in [[H1523]] the frowardness [[H8419]] of the wicked; [[H7451]]

### 15
Whose [[H834]] ways [[H734]] crooked, [[H6141]] and froward [[H3868]] in their paths: [[H4570]]

### 16
To deliver [[H5337]] thee from the strange [[H2114]] woman, [[H802]] from the stranger [[H5237]] flattereth [[H2505]] with her words; [[H561]]

### 17
Which forsaketh [[H5800]] the guide [[H441]] of her youth, [[H5271]] and forgetteth [[H7911]] the covenant [[H1285]] of her God. [[H430]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] her house [[H1004]] inclineth [[H7743]] unto [[H413]] death, [[H4194]] and her paths [[H4570]] unto [[H413]] the dead. [[H7496]]

### 19
None [[H3808]] that go unto [[H935]] her return again, [[H7725]] neither [[H3808]] take they hold [[H5381]] of the paths [[H734]] of life. [[H2416]]

### 20
That [[H4616]] thou mayest walk [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of good [[H2896]] and keep [[H8104]] the paths [[H734]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] the upright [[H3477]] shall dwell in [[H7931]] the land, [[H776]] and the perfect [[H8549]] shall remain [[H3498]] in it. [[H3498]]

### 22
But the wicked [[H7563]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from the earth, [[H776]] and the transgressors [[H898]] shall be rooted out [[H5255]] of [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]
