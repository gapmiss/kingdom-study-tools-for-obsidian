### 8
Scornful [[H3944]] men [[H376]] bring [[H6315]] a city [[H7151]] into a snare: but wise [[H2450]] turn away [[H7725]] wrath. [[H639]]

### 14
The king [[H4428]] that faithfully [[H571]] judgeth [[H8199]] the poor, [[H1800]] his throne [[H3678]] shall be established [[H3559]] for ever. [[H5703]]

### 15
The rod [[H7626]] and reproof [[H8433]] give [[H5414]] wisdom: [[H2451]] but a child [[H5288]] left [[H7971]] bringeth his mother [[H517]] to shame. [[H954]]

### 16
When the wicked [[H7563]] are multiplied, [[H7235]] transgression [[H6588]] increaseth: [[H7235]] but the righteous [[H6662]] shall see [[H7200]] their fall. [[H4658]]

### 21
He that delicately bringeth up [[H6445]] his servant [[H5650]] from a child [[H5290]] shall have him become [[H1961]] son [[H4497]] at the length. [[H319]]
