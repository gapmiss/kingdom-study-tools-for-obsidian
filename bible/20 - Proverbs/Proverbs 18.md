Through desire [[H8378]] a man, having separated himself, [[H6504]] seeketh [[H1245]] intermeddleth [[H1566]] with all [[H3605]] wisdom. [[H8454]]

### 2
A fool [[H3684]] hath no [[H3808]] delight [[H2654]] in understanding, [[H8394]] but [[H3588]] that his heart [[H3820]] may discover [[H1540]] itself. [[H1540]]

### 3
When the wicked [[H7563]] cometh, [[H935]] cometh [[H935]] also [[H1571]] contempt, [[H937]] and with [[H5973]] ignominy [[H7036]] reproach. [[H2781]]

### 4
The words [[H1697]] of a man's [[H376]] mouth [[H6310]] deep [[H6013]] waters, [[H4325]] the wellspring [[H4726]] of wisdom [[H2451]] a flowing [[H5042]] brook. [[H5158]]

### 6
A fool's [[H3684]] lips [[H8193]] enter [[H935]] into contention, [[H7379]] and his mouth [[H6310]] calleth [[H7121]] for strokes. [[H4112]]

### 7
A fool's [[H3684]] mouth [[H6310]] his destruction, [[H4288]] and his lips [[H8193]] the snare [[H4170]] of his soul. [[H5315]]

### 8
The words [[H1697]] of a talebearer [[H5372]] as wounds, [[H3859]] and they [[H1992]] go down [[H3381]] into the innermost parts [[H2315]] of the belly. [[H990]]

### 9
He [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] that is slothful [[H7503]] in his work [[H4399]] is brother [[H251]] to him that is a great [[H1167]] waster. [[H7843]]

### 10
The name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] a strong [[H5797]] tower: [[H4026]] the righteous [[H6662]] runneth [[H7323]] into it, and is safe. [[H7682]]

### 11
The rich man's [[H6223]] wealth [[H1952]] his strong [[H5797]] city, [[H7151]] and as an high [[H7682]] wall [[H2346]] in his own conceit. [[H4906]]

### 14
The spirit [[H7307]] of a man [[H376]] will sustain [[H3557]] his infirmity; [[H4245]] but a wounded [[H5218]] spirit [[H7307]] who [[H4310]] can bear? [[H5375]]

### 15
The heart [[H3820]] of the prudent [[H995]] getteth [[H7069]] knowledge; [[H1847]] and the ear [[H241]] of the wise [[H2450]] seeketh [[H1245]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 16
A man's [[H120]] gift [[H4976]] maketh room [[H7337]] for him, and bringeth [[H5148]] him before [[H6440]] great men. [[H1419]]

### 17
first [[H7223]] in his own cause [[H7379]] just; [[H6662]] but his neighbour [[H7453]] cometh [[H935]] and searcheth him. [[H2713]]

### 18
The lot [[H1486]] causeth contentions [[H4079]] to cease, [[H7673]] and parteth [[H6504]] between [[H996]] the mighty. [[H6099]]

### 19
A brother [[H251]] offended [[H6586]] than a strong [[H5797]] city: [[H7151]] and contentions [[H4066]] like the bars [[H1280]] of a castle. [[H759]]

### 20
A man's [[H376]] belly [[H990]] shall be satisfied [[H7646]] with the fruit [[H6529]] of his mouth; [[H6310]] with the increase [[H8393]] of his lips [[H8193]] shall he be filled. [[H7646]]

### 21
Death [[H4194]] and life [[H2416]] in the power [[H3027]] of the tongue: [[H3956]] and they that love [[H157]] it shall eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] thereof. [[H6529]]

### 22
findeth [[H4672]] a wife [[H802]] findeth [[H4672]] a good [[H2896]] and obtaineth [[H6329]] favour [[H7522]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
The poor [[H7326]] useth [[H1696]] intreaties; [[H8469]] but the rich [[H6223]] answereth [[H6030]] roughly. [[H5794]]

### 24
A man [[H376]] friends [[H7453]] must shew himself friendly: [[H7489]] and there is [[H3426]] a friend [[H157]] sticketh closer [[H1695]] than a brother. [[H251]]
