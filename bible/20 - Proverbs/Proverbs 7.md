### 1
My son, [[H1121]] keep [[H8104]] my words, [[H561]] and lay up [[H6845]] my commandments [[H4687]] with [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 2
Keep [[H8104]] my commandments, [[H4687]] and live; [[H2421]] and my law [[H8451]] as the apple [[H380]] of thine eye. [[H5869]]

### 3
Bind [[H7194]] them upon [[H5921]] thy fingers, [[H676]] write [[H3789]] them upon [[H5921]] the table [[H3871]] of thine heart. [[H3820]]

### 4
Say [[H559]] unto wisdom, [[H2451]] Thou [[H859]] my sister; [[H269]] and call [[H7121]] understanding [[H998]] kinswoman: [[H4129]]

### 5
That they may keep [[H8104]] thee from the strange [[H2114]] woman, [[H802]] from the stranger [[H5237]] flattereth [[H2505]] with her words. [[H561]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] at the window [[H2474]] of my house [[H1004]] I looked [[H8259]] through [[H1157]] my casement, [[H822]]

### 7
And beheld [[H7200]] among the simple ones, [[H6612]] I discerned [[H995]] among the youths, [[H1121]] a young man [[H5288]] void [[H2638]] of understanding, [[H3820]]

### 8
Passing through [[H5674]] the street [[H7784]] near [[H681]] her corner; [[H6438]] and he went [[H6805]] the way [[H1870]] to her house, [[H1004]]

### 9
In the twilight, [[H5399]] in the evening, [[H3117]] in the black [[H380]] and dark [[H653]] night: [[H3915]]

### 10
And, behold, [[H2009]] there met [[H7125]] him a woman [[H802]] the attire [[H7897]] of an harlot, [[H2181]] and subtil [[H5341]] of heart. [[H3820]]

### 11
(She [[H1931]] loud [[H1993]] and stubborn; [[H5637]] her feet [[H7272]] abide [[H7931]] not [[H3808]] in her house: [[H1004]]

### 12
Now [[H6471]] without, [[H2351]] now [[H6471]] in the streets, [[H7339]] and lieth in wait [[H693]] at [[H681]] every [[H3605]] corner.) [[H6438]]

### 13
So she caught [[H2388]] him, and kissed [[H5401]] him, with an impudent [[H5810]] face [[H6440]] said [[H559]] unto him, [[H559]]

### 14
peace [[H8002]] offerings [[H2077]] with [[H5921]] me; this day [[H3117]] have I payed [[H7999]] my vows. [[H5088]]

### 15
Therefore [[H5921]] came I forth [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] thee, diligently to seek [[H7836]] thy face, [[H6440]] and I have found [[H4672]] thee. [[H4672]]

### 16
I have decked [[H7234]] my bed [[H6210]] with coverings [[H4765]] of tapestry, with carved [[H2405]] with fine linen [[H330]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 17
I have perfumed [[H5130]] my bed [[H4904]] with myrrh, [[H4753]] aloes, [[H174]] and cinnamon. [[H7076]]

### 18
Come, [[H1980]] let us take our fill [[H7301]] of love [[H1730]] until [[H5704]] the morning: [[H1242]] let us solace ourselves [[H5965]] with loves. [[H159]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] the goodman [[H376]] not [[H369]] at home, [[H1004]] he is gone [[H1980]] a long [[H7350]] journey: [[H1870]]

### 20
He hath taken [[H3947]] a bag [[H6872]] of money [[H3701]] with him, [[H3027]] will come [[H935]] home [[H1004]] at the day [[H3117]] appointed. [[H3677]]

### 21
With her much [[H7230]] fair speech [[H3948]] she caused him to yield, [[H5186]] with the flattering [[H2506]] of her lips [[H8193]] she forced [[H5080]] him. [[H5080]]

### 22
He goeth [[H1980]] after [[H310]] her straightway, [[H6597]] as an ox [[H7794]] goeth [[H935]] to [[H413]] the slaughter, [[H2874]] or as a fool [[H191]] to [[H413]] the correction [[H4148]] of the stocks; [[H5914]]

### 23
Till [[H5704]] a dart [[H2671]] strike through [[H6398]] his liver; [[H3516]] as a bird [[H6833]] hasteth [[H4116]] to [[H413]] the snare, [[H6341]] and knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] for his life. [[H5315]]

### 24
Hearken [[H8085]] unto me now [[H6258]] therefore, O ye children, [[H1121]] and attend [[H7181]] to the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 25
Let not [[H408]] thine heart [[H3820]] decline [[H7847]] to [[H413]] her ways, [[H1870]] go not astray [[H8582]] in her paths. [[H5410]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] she hath cast down [[H5307]] many [[H7227]] wounded: [[H2491]] yea, many [[H3605]] strong [[H6099]] have been slain [[H2026]] by her. [[H2026]]

### 27
Her house [[H1004]] the way [[H1870]] to hell, [[H7585]] going down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the chambers [[H2315]] of death. [[H4194]]
