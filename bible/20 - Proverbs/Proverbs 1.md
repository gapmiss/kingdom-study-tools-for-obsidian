### 1
The proverbs [[H4912]] of Solomon [[H8010]] the son [[H1121]] of David, [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel; [[H3478]]

### 2
To know [[H3045]] wisdom [[H2451]] and instruction; [[H4148]] to perceive [[H995]] the words [[H561]] of understanding; [[H998]]

### 3
To receive [[H3947]] the instruction [[H4148]] of wisdom, [[H7919]] justice, [[H6664]] and judgment, [[H4941]] and equity; [[H4339]]

### 4
To give [[H5414]] subtilty [[H6195]] to the simple, [[H6612]] to the young man [[H5288]] knowledge [[H1847]] and discretion. [[H4209]]

### 5
A wise [[H2450]] will hear, [[H8085]] and will increase [[H3254]] learning; [[H3948]] and a man of understanding [[H995]] shall attain [[H7069]] unto wise counsels: [[H8458]]

### 6
To understand [[H995]] a proverb, [[H4912]] and the interpretation; [[H4426]] the words [[H1697]] of the wise, [[H2450]] and their dark sayings. [[H2420]]

### 7
The fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] the beginning [[H7225]] of knowledge: [[H1847]] fools [[H191]] despise [[H936]] wisdom [[H2451]] and instruction. [[H4148]]

### 8
My son, [[H1121]] hear [[H8085]] the instruction [[H4148]] of thy father, [[H1]] and forsake [[H5203]] not [[H408]] the law [[H8451]] of thy mother: [[H517]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] an ornament [[H3880]] of grace [[H2580]] unto thy head, [[H7218]] and chains [[H6060]] about thy neck. [[H1621]]

### 10
My son, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] sinners [[H2400]] entice [[H6601]] thee, consent [[H14]] thou not. [[H14]]

### 11
If [[H518]] they say, [[H559]] Come [[H1980]] with [[H854]] us, let us lay wait [[H693]] for blood, [[H1818]] let us lurk privily [[H6845]] for the innocent [[H5355]] without cause: [[H2600]]

### 12
Let us swallow them up [[H1104]] alive [[H2416]] as the grave; [[H7585]] and whole, [[H8549]] as those that go down [[H3381]] into the pit: [[H953]]

### 13
We shall find [[H4672]] all [[H3605]] precious [[H3368]] substance, [[H1952]] we shall fill [[H4390]] our houses [[H1004]] with spoil: [[H7998]]

### 14
Cast in [[H5307]] thy lot [[H1486]] among [[H8432]] us; let us all [[H3605]] have [[H1961]] one [[H259]] purse: [[H3599]]

### 15
My son, [[H1121]] walk [[H1980]] not [[H408]] thou in the way [[H1870]] with [[H854]] them; refrain [[H4513]] thy foot [[H7272]] from their path: [[H5410]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] their feet [[H7272]] run [[H7323]] to evil, [[H7451]] and make haste [[H4116]] to shed [[H8210]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 17
Surely [[H3588]] in vain [[H2600]] the net [[H7568]] is spread [[H2219]] in the sight [[H5869]] of any [[H3605]] bird. [[H1167]]

### 18
And they [[H1992]] lay wait [[H693]] for their blood; [[H1818]] they lurk privily [[H6845]] for their lives. [[H5315]]

### 19
So [[H3651]] the ways [[H734]] of every one [[H3605]] that is greedy [[H1214]] of gain; [[H1215]] taketh away [[H3947]] the life [[H5315]] of the owners [[H1167]] thereof. [[H1167]]

### 20
Wisdom [[H2454]] crieth [[H7442]] without; [[H2351]] she uttereth [[H5414]] her voice [[H6963]] in the streets: [[H7339]]

### 21
She crieth [[H7121]] in the chief place [[H7218]] of concourse, [[H1993]] in the openings [[H6607]] of the gates: [[H8179]] in the city [[H5892]] she uttereth [[H559]] her words, [[H561]]

### 22
How long, [[H5704]] ye simple ones, [[H6612]] will ye love [[H157]] simplicity? [[H6612]] and the scorners [[H3887]] delight [[H2530]] in their scorning, [[H3944]] and fools [[H3684]] hate [[H8130]] knowledge? [[H1847]]

### 23
Turn [[H7725]] you at my reproof: [[H8433]] behold, [[H2009]] I will pour out [[H5042]] my spirit [[H7307]] unto you, I will make known [[H3045]] my words [[H1697]] unto you. [[H1697]]

### 24
Because [[H3282]] I have called, [[H7121]] and ye refused; [[H3985]] I have stretched out [[H5186]] my hand, [[H3027]] and no man [[H369]] regarded; [[H7181]]

### 25
But ye have set at nought [[H6544]] all [[H3605]] my counsel, [[H6098]] and would [[H14]] none [[H3808]] of my reproof: [[H8433]]

### 26
I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] will laugh [[H7832]] at your calamity; [[H343]] I will mock [[H3932]] when your fear [[H6343]] cometh; [[H935]]

### 27
When your fear [[H6343]] cometh [[H935]] as desolation, [[H7584]] and your destruction [[H343]] cometh [[H857]] as a whirlwind; [[H5492]] when distress [[H6869]] and anguish [[H6695]] cometh [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 28
Then [[H227]] shall they call upon [[H7121]] me, but I will not [[H3808]] answer; [[H6030]] they shall seek me early, [[H7836]] but they shall not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] me: [[H4672]]

### 29
For that [[H8478]] they hated [[H8130]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and did not [[H3808]] choose [[H977]] the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 30
They would [[H14]] none [[H3808]] of my counsel: [[H6098]] they despised [[H5006]] all [[H3605]] my reproof. [[H8433]]

### 31
Therefore shall they eat [[H398]] of the fruit [[H6529]] of their own way, [[H1870]] and be filled [[H7646]] with their own devices. [[H4156]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] the turning away [[H4878]] of the simple [[H6612]] shall slay [[H2026]] them, and the prosperity [[H7962]] of fools [[H3684]] shall destroy [[H6]] them. [[H6]]

### 33
But whoso hearkeneth [[H8085]] unto me shall dwell [[H7931]] safely, [[H983]] and shall be quiet [[H7599]] from fear [[H6343]] of evil. [[H7451]]
