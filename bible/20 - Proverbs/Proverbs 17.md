# Proverbs 17

[[Proverbs 16|←]] • [[Proverbs 18|→]]

---

### 1
Better [[H2896]] a dry [[H2720]] morsel, [[H6595]] and quietness [[H7962]] therewith, than an house [[H1004]] full [[H4392]] of sacrifices [[H2077]] strife. [[H7379]]

### 2
A wise [[H7919]] servant [[H5650]] shall have rule [[H4910]] over a son [[H1121]] that causeth shame, [[H954]] and shall have part [[H2505]] of the inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] the brethren. [[H251]]

### 3
The fining pot [[H4715]] for silver, [[H3701]] and the furnace [[H3564]] for gold: [[H2091]] but the Lord [[H3068]] trieth [[H974]] the hearts. [[H3826]]

### 4
A wicked doer [[H7489]] giveth heed [[H7181]] to [[H5921]] false [[H205]] lips; [[H8193]] a liar [[H8267]] giveth ear [[H238]] to [[H5921]] a naughty [[H1942]] tongue. [[H3956]]

### 5
Whoso mocketh [[H3932]] the poor [[H7326]] reproacheth [[H2778]] his Maker: [[H6213]] he that is glad [[H8056]] at calamities [[H343]] shall not [[H3808]] be unpunished. [[H5352]]

### 6
Children's [[H1121]] children [[H1121]] the crown [[H5850]] of old men; [[H2205]] and the glory [[H8597]] of children [[H1121]] their fathers. [[H1]]

### 7
Excellent [[H3499]] speech [[H8193]] becometh [[H5000]] not [[H3808]] a fool: [[H5036]] much less [[H637]] do lying [[H8267]] lips [[H8193]] a prince. [[H5081]]

### 8
A gift [[H7810]] a precious [[H2580]] stone [[H68]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of him that hath [[H1167]] it: whithersoever [[H413]] it turneth, [[H6437]] it prospereth. [[H7919]]

### 9
He that covereth [[H3680]] a transgression [[H6588]] seeketh [[H1245]] love; [[H160]] but he that repeateth [[H8138]] a matter [[H1697]] separateth [[H6504]] friends. [[H441]]

### 10
A reproof [[H1606]] entereth more [[H5181]] into a wise man [[H995]] than an hundred [[H3967]] stripes [[H5221]] into a fool. [[H3684]]

### 11
An evil [[H7451]] seeketh [[H1245]] only [[H389]] rebellion: [[H4805]] therefore a cruel [[H394]] messenger [[H4397]] shall be sent [[H7971]] against him. [[H7971]]

### 12
Let a bear [[H1677]] robbed [[H7909]] of her whelps meet [[H6298]] a man, [[H376]] rather than [[H408]] a fool [[H3684]] in his folly. [[H200]]

### 13
Whoso rewardeth [[H7725]] evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good, [[H2896]] evil [[H7451]] shall not [[H3808]] depart [[H4185]] from his house. [[H1004]]

### 14
The beginning [[H7225]] of strife [[H4066]] when one letteth out [[H6362]] water: [[H4325]] therefore leave off [[H5203]] contention, [[H7379]] before [[H6440]] it be meddled [[H1566]] with. [[H1566]]

### 15
He that justifieth [[H6663]] the wicked, [[H7563]] and he that condemneth [[H7561]] the just, [[H6662]] even [[H1571]] they both [[H8147]] abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
Wherefore [[H4100]] a price [[H4242]] in the hand [[H3027]] of a fool [[H3684]] to get [[H7069]] wisdom, [[H2451]] seeing no [[H369]] heart [[H3820]]

### 17
A friend [[H7453]] loveth [[H157]] at all [[H3605]] times, [[H6256]] and a brother [[H251]] is born [[H3205]] for adversity. [[H6869]]

### 18
A man [[H120]] void [[H2638]] of understanding [[H3820]] striketh [[H8628]] hands, [[H3709]] becometh [[H6148]] surety [[H6161]] in the presence [[H6440]] of his friend. [[H7453]]

### 19
He loveth [[H157]] transgression [[H6588]] that loveth [[H157]] strife: [[H4683]] he that exalteth [[H1361]] his gate [[H6607]] seeketh [[H1245]] destruction. [[H7667]]

### 20
He that hath a froward [[H6141]] heart [[H3820]] findeth [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] good: [[H2896]] and he that hath a perverse [[H2015]] tongue [[H3956]] falleth [[H5307]] into mischief. [[H7451]]

### 21
He that begetteth [[H3205]] a fool [[H3684]] to his sorrow: [[H8424]] and the father [[H1]] of a fool [[H5036]] hath no [[H3808]] joy. [[H8055]]

### 22
A merry [[H8056]] heart [[H3820]] doeth good [[H3190]] a medicine: [[H1456]] but a broken [[H5218]] spirit [[H7307]] drieth [[H3001]] the bones. [[H1634]]

### 23
A wicked [[H7563]] taketh [[H3947]] a gift [[H7810]] out of the bosom [[H2436]] to pervert [[H5186]] the ways [[H734]] of judgment. [[H4941]]

### 24
Wisdom [[H2451]] before [[H854]] him that hath understanding; [[H6440]] but the eyes [[H5869]] of a fool [[H3684]] in the ends [[H7097]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 25
A foolish [[H3684]] son [[H1121]] a grief [[H3708]] to his father, [[H1]] and bitterness [[H4470]] to her that bare [[H3205]] him. [[H3205]]

### 26
Also [[H1571]] to punish [[H6064]] the just [[H6662]] not [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] to strike [[H5221]] princes [[H5081]] for [[H5921]] equity. [[H3476]]

### 27
He that hath [[H3045]] knowledge [[H1847]] spareth [[H2820]] his words: [[H561]] a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] is of an excellent [[H7119]] spirit. [[H7303]]

### 28
Even [[H1571]] a fool, [[H191]] when he holdeth his peace, [[H2790]] is counted [[H2803]] wise: [[H2450]] he that shutteth [[H331]] his lips [[H8193]] a man of understanding. [[H995]]
