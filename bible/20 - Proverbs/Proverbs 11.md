### 1
A false [[H4820]] balance [[H3976]] abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] but a just [[H8003]] weight [[H68]] his delight. [[H7522]]

### 2
pride [[H2087]] cometh, [[H935]] then cometh [[H935]] shame: [[H7036]] but with [[H854]] the lowly [[H6800]] wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 3
The integrity [[H8538]] of the upright [[H3477]] shall guide [[H5148]] them: but the perverseness [[H5558]] of transgressors [[H898]] shall destroy [[H7703]] them. [[H7703]]

### 4
Riches [[H1952]] profit [[H3276]] not [[H3808]] in the day [[H3117]] of wrath: [[H5678]] but righteousness [[H6666]] delivereth [[H5337]] from death. [[H4194]]

### 5
The righteousness [[H6666]] of the perfect [[H8549]] shall direct [[H3474]] his way: [[H1870]] but the wicked [[H7563]] shall fall [[H5307]] by his own wickedness. [[H7564]]

### 6
The righteousness [[H6666]] of the upright [[H3477]] shall deliver [[H5337]] them: but transgressors [[H898]] shall be taken [[H3920]] in naughtiness. [[H1942]]

### 7
When a wicked [[H7563]] man [[H120]] dieth, [[H4194]] expectation [[H8615]] shall perish: [[H6]] and the hope [[H8431]] of unjust [[H205]] perisheth. [[H6]]

### 8
The righteous [[H6662]] is delivered out [[H2502]] of trouble, [[H6869]] and the wicked [[H7563]] cometh [[H935]] in his stead. [[H935]]

### 9
An hypocrite [[H2611]] with mouth [[H6310]] destroyeth [[H7843]] his neighbour: [[H7453]] but through knowledge [[H1847]] shall the just [[H6662]] be delivered. [[H2502]]

### 10
When it goeth well [[H2898]] with the righteous, [[H6662]] the city [[H7151]] rejoiceth: [[H5970]] and when the wicked [[H7563]] perish, [[H6]] shouting. [[H7440]]

### 11
By the blessing [[H1293]] of the upright [[H3477]] the city [[H7176]] is exalted: [[H7311]] but it is overthrown [[H2040]] by the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 12
He that is void [[H2638]] of wisdom [[H3820]] despiseth [[H936]] his neighbour: [[H7453]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] holdeth his peace. [[H2790]]

### 13
A talebearer [[H1980]] revealeth [[H1540]] secrets: [[H5475]] but he that is of a faithful [[H539]] spirit [[H7307]] concealeth [[H3680]] the matter. [[H1697]]

### 14
Where no [[H369]] counsel [[H8458]] the people [[H5971]] fall: [[H5307]] but in the multitude [[H7230]] of counsellers [[H3289]] safety. [[H8668]]

### 15
He that is surety [[H6148]] for a stranger [[H2114]] shall smart [[H7489]] and he that hateth [[H8130]] suretiship [[H8628]] is sure. [[H982]]

### 16
A gracious [[H2580]] woman [[H802]] retaineth [[H8551]] honour: [[H3519]] and strong [[H6184]] retain [[H8551]] riches. [[H6239]]

### 17
The merciful [[H2617]] man [[H376]] doeth good [[H1580]] to his own soul: [[H5315]] but cruel [[H394]] troubleth [[H5916]] his own flesh. [[H7607]]

### 18
The wicked [[H7563]] worketh [[H6213]] a deceitful [[H8267]] work: [[H6468]] but to him that soweth [[H2232]] righteousness [[H6666]] a sure [[H571]] reward. [[H7938]]

### 19
As [[H3651]] righteousness [[H6666]] to life: [[H2416]] so he that pursueth [[H7291]] evil [[H7451]] to his own death. [[H4194]]

### 20
They that are of a froward [[H6141]] heart [[H3820]] abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] but upright [[H8549]] in way [[H1870]] his delight. [[H7522]]

### 21
hand [[H3027]] in hand, [[H3027]] the wicked [[H7451]] shall not [[H3808]] be unpunished: [[H5352]] but the seed [[H2233]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shall be delivered. [[H4422]]

### 22
a jewel [[H5141]] of gold [[H2091]] in a swine's [[H2386]] snout, [[H639]] a fair [[H3303]] woman [[H802]] which is without [[H5493]] discretion. [[H2940]]

### 23
The desire [[H8378]] of the righteous [[H6662]] only [[H389]] good: [[H2896]] the expectation [[H8615]] of the wicked [[H7563]] wrath. [[H5678]]

### 24
There is [[H3426]] that scattereth, [[H6340]] and yet [[H5750]] increaseth; [[H3254]] and that withholdeth [[H2820]] more than is meet, [[H3476]] but to poverty. [[H4270]]

### 25
The liberal [[H1293]] soul [[H5315]] shall be made fat: [[H1878]] and he that watereth [[H7301]] shall be watered [[H3384]] also [[H1571]] himself. [[H1571]]

### 26
He that withholdeth [[H4513]] corn, [[H1250]] the people [[H3816]] shall curse [[H5344]] him: but blessing [[H1293]] upon the head [[H7218]] of him that selleth [[H7666]]

### 27
He that diligently seeketh [[H7836]] good [[H2896]] procureth [[H1245]] favour: [[H7522]] but he that seeketh [[H1875]] mischief, [[H7451]] it shall come [[H935]] unto him. [[H935]]

### 28
He [[H1931]] that trusteth [[H982]] in his riches [[H6239]] shall fall: [[H5307]] but the righteous [[H6662]] shall flourish [[H6524]] as a branch. [[H5929]]

### 29
He that troubleth [[H5916]] his own house [[H1004]] shall inherit [[H5157]] the wind: [[H7307]] and the fool [[H191]] servant [[H5650]] to the wise [[H2450]] of heart. [[H3820]]

### 30
The fruit [[H6529]] of the righteous [[H6662]] a tree [[H6086]] of life; [[H2416]] and he that winneth [[H3947]] souls [[H5315]] wise. [[H2450]]

### 31
Behold, [[H2005]] the righteous [[H6662]] shall be recompensed [[H7999]] in the earth: [[H776]] much more [[H637]] the wicked [[H7563]] and the sinner. [[H2398]]
