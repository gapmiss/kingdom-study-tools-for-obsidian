[[Proverbs 20|←]] • [[Proverbs 22|→]]

---

### 1
The king's [[H4428]] heart [[H3820]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the rivers [[H6388]] of water: [[H4325]] he turneth [[H5186]] it whithersoever [[H5921]] he will. [[H2654]]

### 2
Every [[H3605]] way [[H1870]] of a man [[H376]] right [[H3477]] in his own eyes: [[H5869]] but the Lord [[H3068]] pondereth [[H8505]] the hearts. [[H3826]]

### 3
To do [[H6213]] justice [[H6666]] and judgment [[H4941]] more acceptable [[H977]] to the Lord [[H3068]] than sacrifice. [[H2077]]

### 4
An high [[H7312]] look, [[H5869]] and a proud [[H7342]] heart, [[H3820]] the plowing [[H5215]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] sin. [[H2403]]

### 5
The thoughts [[H4284]] of the diligent [[H2742]] only [[H389]] to plenteousness; [[H4195]] but of every one [[H3605]] hasty [[H213]] only [[H389]] to want. [[H4270]]

### 6
The getting [[H6467]] of treasures [[H214]] by a lying [[H8267]] tongue [[H3956]] a vanity [[H1892]] tossed to and fro [[H5086]] of them that seek [[H1245]] death. [[H4194]]

### 7
The robbery [[H7701]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall destroy [[H1641]] them; because [[H3588]] they refuse [[H3985]] to do [[H6213]] judgment. [[H4941]]

### 8
The way [[H1870]] of man [[H376]] froward [[H2019]] and strange: [[H2054]] but the pure, [[H2134]] his work [[H6467]] right. [[H3477]]

### 9
better [[H2896]] to dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] a corner [[H6438]] of the housetop, [[H1406]] than with a brawling [[H4079]] woman [[H802]] in a wide [[H2267]] house. [[H1004]]

### 10
The soul [[H5315]] of the wicked [[H7563]] desireth [[H183]] evil: [[H7451]] his neighbour [[H7453]] findeth no [[H3808]] favour [[H2603]] in his eyes. [[H5869]]

### 11
When the scorner [[H3887]] is punished, [[H6064]] the simple [[H6612]] is made wise: [[H2449]] and when the wise [[H2450]] is instructed, [[H7919]] he receiveth [[H3947]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 12
The righteous [[H6662]] wisely considereth [[H7919]] the house [[H1004]] of the wicked: [[H7563]] overthroweth [[H5557]] the wicked [[H7563]] for wickedness. [[H7451]]

### 13
Whoso stoppeth [[H331]] his ears [[H241]] at the cry [[H2201]] of the poor, [[H1800]] he also [[H1571]] shall cry [[H7121]] himself, [[H1931]] but shall not [[H3808]] be heard. [[H6030]]

### 14
A gift [[H4976]] in secret [[H5643]] pacifieth [[H3711]] anger: [[H639]] and a reward [[H7810]] in the bosom [[H2436]] strong [[H5794]] wrath. [[H2534]]

### 15
joy [[H8057]] to the just [[H6662]] to do [[H6213]] judgment: [[H4941]] but destruction [[H4288]] to the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity. [[H205]]

### 16
The man [[H120]] that wandereth [[H8582]] out of the way [[H1870]] of understanding [[H7919]] shall remain [[H5117]] in the congregation [[H6951]] of the dead. [[H7496]]

### 17
He that loveth [[H157]] pleasure [[H8057]] a poor [[H4270]] man: [[H376]] he that loveth [[H157]] wine [[H3196]] and oil [[H8081]] shall not [[H3808]] be rich. [[H6238]]

### 18
The wicked [[H7563]] a ransom [[H3724]] for the righteous, [[H6662]] and the transgressor [[H898]] for [[H8478]] the upright. [[H3477]]

### 19
better [[H2896]] to dwell [[H3427]] in the wilderness, [[H776]] than with a contentious [[H4066]] and an angry [[H3708]] woman. [[H802]]

### 20
treasure [[H214]] to be desired [[H2530]] and oil [[H8081]] in the dwelling [[H5116]] of the wise; [[H2450]] but a foolish [[H3684]] man [[H120]] spendeth it up. [[H1104]]

### 21
He that followeth [[H7291]] after righteousness [[H6666]] and mercy [[H2617]] findeth [[H4672]] life, [[H2416]] righteousness, [[H6666]] and honour. [[H3519]]

### 22
A wise [[H2450]] scaleth [[H5927]] the city [[H5892]] of the mighty, [[H1368]] and casteth down [[H3381]] the strength [[H5797]] of the confidence [[H4009]] thereof. [[H4009]]

### 23
Whoso keepeth [[H8104]] his mouth [[H6310]] and his tongue [[H3956]] keepeth [[H8104]] his soul [[H5315]] from troubles. [[H6869]]

### 24
Proud [[H2086]] haughty [[H3093]] scorner [[H3887]] his name, [[H8034]] who dealeth [[H6213]] in proud [[H2087]] wrath. [[H5678]]

### 25
The desire [[H8378]] of the slothful [[H6102]] killeth [[H4191]] him; for [[H3588]] his hands [[H3027]] refuse [[H3985]] to labour. [[H6213]]

### 26
He coveteth [[H183]] greedily [[H8378]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long: but the righteous [[H6662]] giveth [[H5414]] and spareth [[H2820]] not. [[H2820]]

### 27
The sacrifice [[H2077]] of the wicked [[H7563]] abomination: [[H8441]] how much more, [[H637]] he bringeth [[H935]] it with a wicked mind? [[H2154]]

### 28
A false [[H3577]] witness [[H5707]] shall perish: [[H6]] but the man [[H376]] that heareth [[H8085]] speaketh [[H1696]] constantly. [[H5331]]

### 29
A wicked [[H7563]] man [[H376]] hardeneth [[H5810]] his face: [[H6440]] but the upright, [[H3477]] he [[H1931]] directeth [[H3559]] his way. [[H1870]]

### 30
no [[H369]] wisdom [[H2451]] nor [[H369]] understanding [[H8394]] nor [[H369]] counsel [[H6098]] against [[H5048]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 31
The horse [[H5483]] prepared [[H3559]] against the day [[H3117]] of battle: [[H4421]] but safety [[H8668]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
