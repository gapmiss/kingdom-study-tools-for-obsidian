[[Proverbs 26|←]] • [[Proverbs 28|→]]

---

### 1
Boast [[H1984]] not thyself [[H408]] of to morrow; [[H4279]] for [[H3588]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] a day [[H3117]] may bring forth. [[H3205]]

### 2
Let another man [[H2114]] praise [[H1984]] thee, and not [[H3808]] thine own mouth; [[H6310]] a stranger, [[H5237]] and not [[H408]] thine own lips. [[H8193]]

### 3
A stone [[H68]] heavy, [[H3514]] and the sand [[H2344]] weighty; [[H5192]] but a fool's [[H191]] wrath [[H3708]] heavier [[H3515]] than them both. [[H8147]]

### 4
Wrath [[H2534]] cruel, [[H395]] and anger [[H639]] outrageous; [[H7858]] but who [[H4310]] able to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] envy? [[H7068]]

### 5
Open [[H1540]] rebuke [[H8433]] better [[H2896]] than secret [[H5641]] love. [[H160]]

### 6
Faithful [[H539]] the wounds [[H6482]] of a friend; [[H157]] but the kisses [[H5390]] of an enemy [[H8130]] deceitful. [[H6280]]

### 7
The full [[H7649]] soul [[H5315]] loatheth [[H947]] an honeycomb; [[H5317]] but to the hungry [[H7457]] soul [[H5315]] every [[H3605]] bitter thing [[H4751]] is sweet. [[H4966]]

### 8
As a bird [[H6833]] that wandereth [[H5074]] from [[H4480]] her nest, [[H7064]] so [[H3651]] a man [[H376]] that wandereth [[H5074]] from his place. [[H4725]]

### 9
Ointment [[H8081]] and perfume [[H7004]] rejoice [[H8055]] the heart: [[H3820]] so the sweetness [[H4986]] of a man's friend [[H7453]] by hearty [[H5315]] counsel. [[H6098]]

### 10
Thine own friend, [[H7453]] and thy father's [[H1]] friend, [[H7453]] forsake [[H5800]] not; [[H408]] neither [[H408]] go [[H935]] into thy brother's [[H251]] house [[H1004]] in the day [[H3117]] of thy calamity: [[H343]] better [[H2896]] a neighbour [[H7934]] near [[H7138]] than a brother [[H251]] far off. [[H7350]]

### 11
My son, [[H1121]] be wise, [[H2449]] and make my heart [[H3820]] glad, [[H8056]] that I may answer [[H7725]] him that reproacheth [[H2778]] me. [[H2778]]

### 12
A prudent [[H6175]] foreseeth [[H7200]] the evil, [[H7451]] hideth himself; [[H5641]] the simple [[H6612]] pass on, [[H5674]] are punished. [[H6064]]

### 13
Take [[H3947]] his garment [[H899]] that [[H3588]] is surety [[H6148]] for a stranger, [[H2114]] and take a pledge [[H2254]] of him for [[H1157]] a strange woman. [[H5237]]

### 14
He that blesseth [[H1288]] his friend [[H7453]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] rising early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] it shall be counted [[H2803]] a curse [[H7045]] to him. [[H7045]]

### 15
A continual [[H2956]] dropping [[H1812]] in a very rainy [[H5464]] day [[H3117]] and a contentious [[H4066]] woman [[H802]] are alike. [[H7737]]

### 16
Whosoever hideth [[H6845]] her hideth [[H6845]] the wind, [[H7307]] and the ointment [[H8081]] of his right hand, [[H3225]] bewrayeth [[H7121]]

### 17
Iron [[H1270]] sharpeneth [[H2300]] iron; [[H1270]] so a man [[H376]] sharpeneth [[H2300]] the countenance [[H6440]] of his friend. [[H7453]]

### 18
Whoso keepeth [[H5341]] the fig tree [[H8384]] shall eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] thereof: so he that waiteth [[H8104]] on his master [[H113]] shall be honoured. [[H3513]]

### 19
As in water [[H4325]] face [[H6440]] to face, [[H6440]] so [[H3651]] the heart [[H3820]] of man [[H120]] to man. [[H120]]

### 20
Hell [[H7585]] and destruction [[H10]] are never [[H3808]] full; [[H7646]] so the eyes [[H5869]] of man [[H120]] are never [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H7646]]

### 21
the fining pot [[H4715]] for silver, [[H3701]] and the furnace [[H3564]] for gold; [[H2091]] so a man [[H376]] to his praise. [[H4110]]

### 22
Though [[H518]] thou shouldest bray [[H3806]] a fool [[H191]] in a mortar [[H4388]] among [[H8432]] wheat [[H7383]] with a pestle, [[H5940]] will not [[H3808]] his foolishness [[H200]] depart [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 23
Be thou diligent [[H3045]] to know [[H3045]] the state [[H6440]] of thy flocks, [[H6629]] look [[H7896]] well [[H3820]] to thy herds. [[H5739]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] riches [[H2633]] not [[H3808]] for ever: [[H5769]] and doth [[H518]] the crown [[H5145]] to every [[H1755]] generation? [[H1755]]

### 25
The hay [[H2682]] appeareth, [[H1540]] and the tender grass [[H1877]] sheweth itself, [[H7200]] and herbs [[H6212]] of the mountains [[H2022]] are gathered. [[H622]]

### 26
The lambs [[H3532]] for thy clothing, [[H3830]] and the goats [[H6260]] the price [[H4242]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 27
And goats' [[H5795]] milk [[H2461]] enough [[H1767]] for thy food, [[H3899]] for the food [[H3899]] of thy household, [[H1004]] and the maintenance [[H2416]] for thy maidens. [[H5291]]
