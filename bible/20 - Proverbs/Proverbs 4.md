Hear, [[H8085]] ye children, [[H1121]] the instruction [[H4148]] of a father, [[H1]] and attend [[H7181]] to know [[H3045]] understanding. [[H998]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] I give [[H5414]] you good [[H2896]] doctrine, [[H3948]] forsake [[H5800]] ye not [[H408]] my law. [[H8451]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] I was [[H1961]] my father's [[H1]] son, [[H1121]] tender [[H7390]] and only [[H3173]] in the sight [[H6440]] of my mother. [[H517]]

He taught [[H3384]] me also, and said [[H559]] unto me, Let thine heart [[H3820]] retain [[H8551]] my words: [[H1697]] keep [[H8104]] my commandments, [[H4687]] and live. [[H2421]]

### 6
Forsake [[H5800]] her not, [[H408]] and she shall preserve [[H8104]] thee: love [[H157]] her, and she shall keep [[H5341]] thee. [[H5341]]

### 7
Wisdom [[H2451]] the principal thing; [[H7225]] get [[H7069]] wisdom: [[H2451]] and with all [[H3605]] thy getting [[H7075]] get [[H7069]] understanding. [[H998]]

She shall give [[H5414]] to thine head [[H7218]] an ornament [[H3880]] of grace: [[H2580]] a crown [[H5850]] of glory [[H8597]] shall she deliver [[H4042]] to thee. [[H4042]]

### 10
Hear, [[H8085]] O my son, [[H1121]] and receive [[H3947]] my sayings; [[H561]] and the years [[H8141]] of thy life [[H2416]] shall be many. [[H7235]]

### 11
I have taught [[H3384]] thee in the way [[H1870]] of wisdom; [[H2451]] I have led [[H1869]] thee in right [[H3476]] paths. [[H4570]]

### 12
When thou goest, [[H1980]] thy steps [[H6806]] shall not [[H3808]] be straitened; [[H3334]] and when [[H518]] thou runnest, [[H7323]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] stumble. [[H3782]]

Take fast hold [[H2388]] of instruction; [[H4148]] let not [[H408]] go: [[H7503]] keep [[H5341]] her; for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] thy life. [[H2416]]

### 14
Enter [[H935]] not [[H408]] into the path [[H734]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] and go [[H833]] not [[H408]] in the way [[H1870]] of evil [[H7451]]

### 15
Avoid [[H6544]] it, pass [[H5674]] not [[H408]] by it, turn [[H7847]] from [[H5921]] it, and pass away. [[H5674]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] they sleep [[H3462]] not, [[H3808]] except [[H518]] they have done mischief; [[H7489]] and their sleep [[H8142]] is taken away, [[H1497]] unless [[H518]] they cause to fall. [[H3782]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] they eat [[H3898]] the bread [[H3899]] of wickedness, [[H7562]] and drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] of violence. [[H2555]]

The way [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] as darkness: [[H653]] they know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] at what [[H4100]] they stumble. [[H3782]]

My son, [[H1121]] attend [[H7181]] to my words; [[H1697]] incline [[H5186]] thine ear [[H241]] unto my sayings. [[H561]]

### 21
Let them not [[H408]] depart [[H3868]] from thine eyes; [[H5869]] keep [[H8104]] them in the midst [[H8432]] of thine heart. [[H3824]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] life [[H2416]] unto those that find [[H4672]] them, and health [[H4832]] to all [[H3605]] their flesh. [[H1320]]

Keep [[H5341]] thy heart [[H3820]] with all [[H3605]] diligence; [[H4929]] for [[H3588]] out of [[H4480]] it the issues [[H8444]] of life. [[H2416]]

### 24
Put away [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] thee a froward [[H6143]] mouth, [[H6310]] and perverse [[H3891]] lips [[H8193]] put far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 25
Let thine eyes [[H5869]] look [[H5027]] right on, [[H5227]] and let thine eyelids [[H6079]] look straight [[H3474]] before [[H5048]] thee. [[H5048]]

### 26
Ponder [[H6424]] the path [[H4570]] of thy feet, [[H7272]] and let all [[H3605]] thy ways [[H1870]] be established. [[H3559]]

### 27
Turn [[H5186]] not [[H408]] to the right hand [[H3225]] nor to the left: [[H8040]] remove [[H5493]] thy foot [[H7272]] from evil. [[H7451]]
