[[Proverbs 18|←]] • [[Proverbs 20|→]]

---

### 1
Better [[H2896]] the poor [[H7326]] that walketh [[H1980]] in his integrity, [[H8537]] than perverse [[H6141]] in his lips, [[H8193]] and is a fool. [[H3684]]

### 2
Also, [[H1571]] the soul [[H5315]] without [[H3808]] knowledge, [[H1847]] not [[H3808]] good; [[H2896]] and he that hasteth [[H213]] with feet [[H7272]] sinneth. [[H2398]]

### 3
The foolishness [[H200]] of man [[H120]] perverteth [[H5557]] his way: [[H1870]] and his heart [[H3820]] fretteth [[H2196]] against [[H5921]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
Wealth [[H1952]] maketh [[H3254]] many [[H7227]] friends; [[H7453]] but the poor [[H1800]] is separated [[H6504]] from his neighbour. [[H7453]]

### 5
A false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] shall not [[H3808]] be unpunished, [[H5352]] and speaketh [[H6315]] lies [[H3577]] shall not [[H3808]] escape. [[H4422]]

### 6
Many [[H7227]] will intreat [[H2470]] the favour [[H6440]] of the prince: [[H5081]] and every man [[H3605]] a friend [[H7453]] to him [[H376]] that giveth gifts. [[H4976]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] the brethren [[H251]] of the poor [[H7326]] do hate [[H8130]] him: how much more [[H637]] do his friends [[H4828]] go far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] him? he pursueth [[H7291]] words, [[H561]] they [[H1992]] wanting [[H3808]]

### 8
He that getteth [[H7069]] wisdom [[H3820]] loveth [[H157]] his own soul: [[H5315]] he that keepeth [[H8104]] understanding [[H8394]] shall find [[H4672]] good. [[H2896]]

### 9
A false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] shall not [[H3808]] be unpunished, [[H5352]] and speaketh [[H6315]] lies [[H3577]] shall perish. [[H6]]

### 10
Delight [[H8588]] is not [[H3808]] seemly [[H5000]] for a fool; [[H3684]] much less [[H637]] for [[H3588]] a servant [[H5650]] to have rule [[H4910]] over princes. [[H8269]]

### 11
The discretion [[H7922]] of a man [[H120]] deferreth [[H748]] his anger; [[H639]] and his glory [[H8597]] to pass over [[H5674]] a transgression. [[H6588]]

### 12
The king's [[H4428]] wrath [[H2197]] as the roaring [[H5099]] of a lion; [[H3715]] but his favour [[H7522]] as dew [[H2919]] upon [[H5921]] the grass. [[H6212]]

### 13
A foolish [[H3684]] son [[H1121]] the calamity [[H1942]] of his father: [[H1]] and the contentions [[H4079]] of a wife [[H802]] a continual [[H2956]] dropping. [[H1812]]

### 14
House [[H1004]] and riches [[H1952]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of fathers: [[H1]] and a prudent [[H7919]] wife [[H802]] from the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
Slothfulness [[H6103]] casteth [[H5307]] into a deep sleep; [[H8639]] and an idle [[H7423]] soul [[H5315]] shall suffer hunger. [[H7456]]

### 16
He that keepeth [[H8104]] the commandment [[H4687]] keepeth [[H8104]] his own soul; [[H5315]] he that despiseth [[H959]] his ways [[H1870]] shall die. [[H4191]]

### 17
He that hath pity [[H2603]] upon the poor [[H1800]] lendeth [[H3867]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] and that which he hath given [[H1576]] will he pay him again. [[H7999]]

### 18
Chasten [[H3256]] thy son [[H1121]] while [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] hope, [[H8615]] and let not [[H408]] thy soul [[H5315]] spare [[H5375]] for [[H413]] his crying. [[H4191]]

### 19
A man of great [[H1632]] wrath [[H2534]] shall suffer [[H5375]] punishment: [[H6066]] for [[H3588]] if [[H518]] thou deliver [[H5337]] yet [[H5750]] thou must do it again. [[H3254]]

### 20
Hear [[H8085]] counsel, [[H6098]] and receive [[H6901]] instruction, [[H4148]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest be wise [[H2449]] in thy latter end. [[H319]]

### 21
many [[H7227]] devices [[H4284]] in a man's [[H376]] heart; [[H3820]] nevertheless the counsel [[H6098]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H1931]] shall stand. [[H6965]]

### 22
The desire [[H8378]] of a man [[H120]] his kindness: [[H2617]] and a poor man [[H7326]] better [[H2896]] than [[H376]] a liar. [[H3577]]

### 23
The fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to life: [[H2416]] and shall abide [[H3885]] satisfied; [[H7649]] he shall not [[H1077]] be visited [[H6485]] with evil. [[H7451]]

### 24
A slothful [[H6102]] hideth [[H2934]] his hand [[H3027]] in bosom, [[H6747]] and will not [[H3808]] so much [[H1571]] as bring [[H7725]] it to his mouth [[H6310]]  again. [[H413]]

### 25
Smite [[H5221]] a scorner, [[H3887]] and the simple [[H6612]] will beware: [[H6191]] and reprove [[H3198]] one that hath understanding, [[H995]] he will understand [[H995]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 26
He that wasteth [[H7703]] father, [[H1]] chaseth away [[H1272]] mother, [[H517]] a son [[H1121]] that causeth shame, [[H954]] and bringeth reproach. [[H2659]]

### 27
Cease, [[H2308]] my son, [[H1121]] to hear [[H8085]] the instruction [[H4148]] to err [[H7686]] from the words [[H561]] of knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 28
An ungodly [[H1100]] witness [[H5707]] scorneth [[H3887]] judgment: [[H4941]] and the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] devoureth [[H1104]] iniquity. [[H205]]

### 29
Judgments [[H8201]] are prepared [[H3559]] for scorners, [[H3887]] and stripes [[H4112]] for the back [[H1460]] of fools. [[H3684]]
