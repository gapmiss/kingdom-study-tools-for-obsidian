### 1
Wisdom [[H2454]] hath builded [[H1129]] her house, [[H1004]] she hath hewn out [[H2672]] her seven [[H7651]] pillars: [[H5982]]

### 2
She hath killed [[H2873]] her beasts; [[H2874]] she hath mingled [[H4537]] her wine; [[H3196]] she hath also [[H637]] furnished [[H6186]] her table. [[H7979]]

### 3
She hath sent forth [[H7971]] her maidens: [[H5291]] she crieth [[H7121]] upon [[H1610]] the highest places [[H4791]] of the city, [[H7176]]

### 4
Whoso [[H4310]] simple, [[H6612]] let him turn in [[H5493]] hither: [[H2008]] him that wanteth [[H2638]] understanding, [[H3820]] she saith [[H559]] to him, [[H559]]

### 5
Come, [[H1980]] eat [[H3898]] of my bread, [[H3899]] and drink [[H8354]] of the wine [[H3196]] I have mingled. [[H4537]]

### 6
Forsake [[H5800]] the foolish, [[H6612]] and live; [[H2421]] and go [[H833]] in the way [[H1870]] of understanding. [[H998]]

### 7
He that reproveth [[H3256]] a scorner [[H3887]] getteth [[H3947]] to himself shame: [[H7036]] and he that rebuketh [[H3198]] a wicked [[H7563]] himself a blot. [[H3971]]

### 8
Reprove [[H3198]] not [[H408]] a scorner, [[H3887]] lest [[H6435]] he hate [[H8130]] thee: rebuke [[H3198]] a wise man, [[H2450]] and he will love [[H157]] thee. [[H157]]

### 9
Give [[H5414]] to a wise [[H2450]] and he will be yet [[H5750]] wiser: [[H2449]] teach [[H3045]] a just [[H6662]] and he will increase [[H3254]] in learning. [[H3948]]

### 10
The fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] the beginning [[H8462]] of wisdom: [[H2451]] and the knowledge [[H1847]] of the holy [[H6918]] understanding. [[H998]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] by me thy days [[H3117]] shall be multiplied, [[H7235]] and the years [[H8141]] of thy life [[H2416]] shall be increased. [[H3254]]

### 12
If [[H518]] thou be wise, [[H2449]] thou shalt be wise [[H2449]] for thyself: but thou scornest, [[H3887]] thou alone [[H905]] shalt bear [[H5375]]

### 13
A foolish [[H3687]] woman [[H802]] clamorous: [[H1993]] simple, [[H6615]] and [[H1077]] knoweth [[H3045]] nothing. [[H4100]]

### 14
For she sitteth [[H3427]] at the door [[H6607]] of her house, [[H1004]] on [[H5921]] a seat [[H3678]] in the high places [[H4791]] of the city, [[H7176]]

### 15
To call [[H7121]] passengers [[H5674]] who go right [[H3474]] on their ways: [[H734]]

### 16
Whoso [[H4310]] simple, [[H6612]] let him turn in [[H5493]] hither: [[H2008]] and him that wanteth [[H2638]] understanding, [[H3820]] she saith [[H559]] to him, [[H559]]

### 17
Stolen [[H1589]] waters [[H4325]] are sweet, [[H4985]] and bread [[H3899]] in secret [[H5643]] is pleasant. [[H5276]]

### 18
But he knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] the dead [[H7496]] there; [[H8033]] her guests [[H7121]] in the depths [[H6012]] of hell. [[H7585]]
