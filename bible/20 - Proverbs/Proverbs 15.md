[[Proverbs 14|←]] • [[Proverbs 16|→]]

### 1
A soft [[H7390]] answer [[H4617]] turneth away [[H7725]] wrath: [[H2534]] but grievous [[H6089]] words [[H1697]] stir up [[H5927]] anger. [[H639]]

### 2
The tongue [[H3956]] of the wise [[H2450]] useth knowledge [[H1847]] aright: [[H3190]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of fools [[H3684]] poureth out [[H5042]] foolishness. [[H200]]

### 3
The eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in every [[H3605]] place, [[H4725]] beholding [[H6822]] the evil [[H7451]] and the good. [[H2896]]

### 4
A wholesome [[H4832]] tongue [[H3956]] a tree [[H6086]] of life: [[H2416]] but perverseness [[H5558]] therein a breach [[H7667]] in the spirit. [[H7307]]

### 5
A fool [[H191]] despiseth [[H5006]] his father's [[H1]] instruction: [[H4148]] but he that regardeth [[H8104]] reproof [[H8433]] is prudent. [[H6191]]

### 6
In the house [[H1004]] of the righteous [[H6662]] much [[H7227]] treasure: [[H2633]] but in the revenues [[H8393]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is trouble. [[H5916]]

### 7
The lips [[H8193]] of the wise [[H2450]] disperse [[H2219]] knowledge: [[H1847]] but the heart [[H3820]] of the foolish [[H3684]] not [[H3808]] so. [[H3808]]

### 8
The sacrifice [[H2077]] of the wicked [[H7563]] an abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] but the prayer [[H8605]] of the upright [[H3477]] his delight. [[H7522]]

### 9
The way [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] an abomination [[H8441]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] but he loveth [[H157]] him that followeth after [[H7291]] righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 10
Correction [[H4148]] grievous [[H7451]] unto him that forsaketh [[H5800]] the way: [[H734]] he that hateth [[H8130]] reproof [[H8433]] shall die. [[H4191]]

### 11
Hell [[H7585]] and destruction [[H11]] before [[H5048]] the Lord: [[H3068]] how much more then [[H637]] the hearts [[H3826]] of the children [[H1121]] of men? [[H120]]

### 12
A scorner [[H3887]] loveth [[H157]] not [[H3808]] one that reproveth [[H3198]] him: neither [[H3808]] will he go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] the wise. [[H2450]]

### 13
A merry [[H8056]] heart [[H3820]] maketh a cheerful [[H3190]] countenance: [[H6440]] but by sorrow [[H6094]] of the heart [[H3820]] the spirit [[H7307]] is broken. [[H5218]]

### 14
The heart [[H3820]] of him that hath understanding [[H995]] seeketh [[H1245]] knowledge: [[H1847]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of fools [[H3684]] feedeth on [[H7462]] foolishness. [[H200]]

### 15
All [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the afflicted [[H6041]] evil: [[H7451]] but he that is of a merry [[H2896]] heart [[H3820]] a continual [[H8548]] feast. [[H4960]]

### 16
Better [[H2896]] little [[H4592]] with the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] than great [[H7227]] treasure [[H214]] and trouble [[H4103]] therewith. [[H4103]]

### 17
Better [[H2896]] a dinner [[H737]] of herbs [[H3419]] where [[H8033]] love [[H160]] is, than a stalled [[H75]] ox [[H7794]] and hatred [[H8135]] therewith. [[H8135]]

### 18
A wrathful [[H2534]] man [[H376]] stirreth up [[H1624]] strife: [[H4066]] but slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] appeaseth [[H8252]] strife. [[H7379]]

### 19
The way [[H1870]] of the slothful [[H6102]] as an hedge [[H4881]] of thorns: [[H2312]] but the way [[H734]] of the righteous [[H3477]] made plain. [[H5549]]

### 20
A wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] maketh a glad [[H8055]] father: [[H1]] but a foolish [[H3684]] man [[H120]] despiseth [[H959]] his mother. [[H517]]

### 21
Folly [[H200]] joy [[H8057]] to destitute [[H2638]] of wisdom: [[H3820]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] walketh [[H1980]] uprightly. [[H3474]]

### 22
Without [[H369]] counsel [[H5475]] purposes [[H4284]] are disappointed: [[H6565]] but in the multitude [[H7230]] of counsellers [[H3289]] they are established. [[H6965]]

### 23
A man [[H376]] hath joy [[H8057]] by the answer [[H4617]] of his mouth: [[H6310]] and a word [[H1697]] in due season, [[H6256]] how [[H4100]] good [[H2896]]

### 24
The way [[H734]] of life [[H2416]] above [[H4605]] to the wise, [[H7919]] that [[H4616]] he may depart [[H5493]] from hell [[H7585]] beneath. [[H4295]]

### 25
The Lord [[H3068]] will destroy [[H5255]] the house [[H1004]] of the proud: [[H1343]] but he will establish [[H5324]] the border [[H1366]] of the widow. [[H490]]

### 26
The thoughts [[H4284]] of the wicked [[H7451]] an abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] but of the pure [[H2889]] pleasant [[H5278]] words. [[H561]]

### 27
He that is greedy [[H1214]] of gain [[H1215]] troubleth [[H5916]] his own house; [[H1004]] but he that hateth [[H8130]] gifts [[H4979]] shall live. [[H2421]]

### 28
The heart [[H3820]] of the righteous [[H6662]] studieth [[H1897]] to answer: [[H6030]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] poureth out [[H5042]] evil things. [[H7451]]

### 29
The Lord [[H3068]] far [[H7350]] from the wicked: [[H7563]] but he heareth [[H8085]] the prayer [[H8605]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 30
The light [[H3974]] of the eyes [[H5869]] rejoiceth [[H8055]] the heart: [[H3820]] a good [[H2896]] report [[H8052]] maketh the bones [[H6106]] fat. [[H1878]]

### 31
The ear [[H241]] that heareth [[H8085]] the reproof [[H8433]] of life [[H2416]] abideth [[H3885]] among [[H7130]] the wise. [[H2450]]

### 32
He that refuseth [[H6544]] instruction [[H4148]] despiseth [[H3988]] his own soul: [[H5315]] but he that heareth [[H8085]] reproof [[H8433]] getteth [[H7069]] understanding. [[H3820]]

### 33
The fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] the instruction [[H4148]] of wisdom; [[H2451]] and before [[H6440]] honour [[H3519]] humility. [[H6038]]
