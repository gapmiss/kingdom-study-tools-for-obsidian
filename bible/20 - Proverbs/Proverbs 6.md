### 1
My son, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] thou be surety [[H6148]] for thy friend, [[H7453]] thou hast stricken [[H8628]] thy hand [[H3709]] with a stranger, [[H2114]]

### 2
Thou art snared [[H3369]] with the words [[H561]] of thy mouth, [[H6310]] thou art taken [[H3920]] with the words [[H561]] of thy mouth. [[H6310]]

### 3
Do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] now, [[H645]] my son, [[H1121]] and deliver thyself, [[H5337]] when [[H3588]] thou art come [[H935]] into the hand [[H3709]] of thy friend; [[H7453]] go, [[H1980]] humble thyself, [[H7511]] and make sure [[H7292]] thy friend. [[H7453]]

### 4
Give [[H5414]] not [[H408]] sleep [[H8142]] to thine eyes, [[H5869]] nor slumber [[H8572]] to thine eyelids. [[H6079]]

### 5
Deliver thyself [[H5337]] as a roe [[H6643]] from the hand [[H3027]] and as a bird [[H6833]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the fowler. [[H3353]]

### 6
Go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the ant, [[H5244]] thou sluggard; [[H6102]] consider [[H7200]] her ways, [[H1870]] and be wise: [[H2449]]

### 7
Which [[H834]] having no [[H369]] guide, [[H7101]] overseer, [[H7860]] or ruler, [[H4910]]

### 8
Provideth [[H3559]] her meat [[H3899]] in the summer, [[H7019]] gathereth [[H103]] her food [[H3978]] in the harvest. [[H7105]]

### 9
How long [[H5704]] wilt thou sleep, [[H7901]] O sluggard? [[H6102]] when [[H4970]] wilt thou arise [[H6965]] out of thy sleep? [[H8142]]

### 10
a little [[H4592]] sleep, [[H8142]] a little [[H4592]] slumber, [[H8572]] a little [[H4592]] folding [[H2264]] of the hands [[H3027]] to sleep: [[H7901]]

### 11
So shall thy poverty [[H7389]] come [[H935]] as one that travelleth, [[H1980]] and thy want [[H4270]] as an armed [[H4043]] man. [[H376]]

### 12
A naughty [[H1100]] person, [[H120]] a wicked [[H205]] man, [[H376]] walketh [[H1980]] with a froward [[H6143]] mouth. [[H6310]]

### 13
He winketh [[H7169]] with his eyes, [[H5869]] he speaketh [[H4448]] with his feet, [[H7272]] he teacheth [[H3384]] with his fingers; [[H676]]

### 14
Frowardness [[H8419]] in his heart, [[H3820]] he deviseth [[H2790]] mischief [[H7451]] continually; [[H6256]] he soweth [[H7971]] discord. [[H4066]]

### 15
Therefore [[H5921]] shall his calamity [[H343]] come [[H935]] suddenly; [[H6597]] suddenly [[H6621]] shall he be broken [[H7665]] without [[H369]] remedy. [[H4832]]

### 16
These [[H2007]] six [[H8337]] doth the Lord [[H3068]] hate: [[H8130]] yea, seven [[H7651]] an abomination [[H8441]] unto him: [[H5315]]

### 17
A proud [[H7311]] look, [[H5869]] a lying [[H8267]] tongue, [[H3956]] and hands [[H3027]] that shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]]

### 18
An heart [[H3820]] that deviseth [[H2790]] wicked [[H205]] imaginations, [[H4284]] feet [[H7272]] that be swift [[H4116]] in running [[H7323]] to mischief, [[H7451]]

### 19
A false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] speaketh [[H6315]] lies, [[H3577]] and he that soweth [[H7971]] discord [[H4090]] among [[H996]] brethren. [[H251]]

### 20
My son, [[H1121]] keep [[H5341]] thy father's [[H1]] commandment, [[H4687]] and forsake [[H5203]] not [[H408]] the law [[H8451]] of thy mother: [[H517]]

### 21
Bind [[H7194]] them continually [[H8548]] upon [[H5921]] thine heart, [[H3820]] tie [[H6029]] them about [[H5921]] thy neck. [[H1621]]

### 22
When thou goest, [[H1980]] it shall lead [[H5148]] thee; [[H853]] when thou sleepest, [[H7901]] it shall keep [[H8104]] thee; and thou awakest, [[H6974]] it [[H1931]] shall talk [[H7878]] with thee. [[H7878]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] the commandment [[H4687]] a lamp; [[H5216]] and the law [[H8451]] light; [[H216]] and reproofs [[H8433]] of instruction [[H4148]] the way [[H1870]] of life: [[H2416]]

### 24
To keep [[H8104]] thee from the evil [[H7451]] woman, [[H802]] from the flattery [[H2513]] of the tongue [[H3956]] of a strange woman. [[H5237]]

### 25
Lust [[H2530]] not [[H408]] after her beauty [[H3308]] in thine heart; [[H3824]] neither [[H408]] let her take [[H3947]] thee with her eyelids. [[H6079]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] by means of [[H1157]] a whorish [[H2181]] woman [[H802]] to [[H5704]] a piece [[H3603]] of bread: [[H3899]] and the adulteress [[H802]] will hunt [[H6679]] for the precious [[H3368]] life. [[H5315]]

### 27
Can a man [[H376]] take [[H2846]] fire [[H784]] in his bosom, [[H2436]] and his clothes [[H899]] not [[H3808]] be burned? [[H8313]]

### 28
Can [[H518]] one [[H376]] go [[H1980]] upon [[H5921]] hot coals, [[H1513]] and his feet [[H7272]] not [[H3808]] be burned? [[H3554]]

### 29
So [[H3651]] he that goeth in [[H935]] to [[H413]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife; [[H802]] whosoever [[H3605]] toucheth [[H5060]] her shall not [[H3808]] be innocent. [[H5352]]

### 30
do not [[H3808]] despise [[H936]] a thief, [[H1590]] if [[H3588]] he steal [[H1589]] to satisfy [[H4390]] his soul [[H5315]] when [[H3588]] he is hungry; [[H7456]]

### 31
But he be found, [[H4672]] he shall restore [[H7999]] sevenfold; [[H7659]] he shall give [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the substance [[H1952]] of his house. [[H1004]]

### 32
whoso committeth adultery [[H5003]] with a woman [[H802]] lacketh [[H2638]] understanding: [[H3820]] he [[H1931]] doeth [[H6213]] it destroyeth [[H7843]] his own soul. [[H5315]]

### 33
A wound [[H5061]] and dishonour [[H7036]] shall he get; [[H4672]] and his reproach [[H2781]] shall not [[H3808]] be wiped away. [[H4229]]

### 34
For [[H3588]] jealousy [[H7068]] the rage [[H2534]] of a man: [[H1397]] therefore he will not [[H3808]] spare [[H2550]] in the day [[H3117]] of vengeance. [[H5359]]

### 35
He will not [[H3808]] regard [[H5375]] any [[H3605]] ransom; [[H3724]] neither [[H3808]] will he rest content, [[H14]] though [[H3588]] thou givest many [[H7235]] gifts. [[H7810]]
