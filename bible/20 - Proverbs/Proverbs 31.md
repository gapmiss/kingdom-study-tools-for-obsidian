The words [[H1697]] of king [[H4428]] Lemuel, [[H3927]] the prophecy [[H4853]] that [[H834]] his mother [[H517]] taught [[H3256]] him. [[H3256]]

### 2
What, [[H4100]] my son? [[H1248]] and what, [[H4100]] the son [[H1248]] of my womb? [[H990]] and what, [[H4100]] the son [[H1248]] of my vows? [[H5088]]

### 3
Give [[H5414]] not [[H408]] thy strength [[H2428]] unto women, [[H802]] nor thy ways [[H1870]] to that which destroyeth [[H4229]] kings. [[H4428]]

### 4
not [[H408]] for kings, [[H4428]] O Lemuel, [[H3927]] not [[H408]] for kings [[H4428]] to drink [[H8354]] wine; [[H3196]] nor [[H176]] for princes [[H7336]] strong drink: [[H7941]]

### 5
Lest [[H6435]] they drink, [[H8354]] and forget [[H7911]] the law, [[H2710]] and pervert [[H8138]] the judgment [[H1779]] of any [[H3605]] of the afflicted. [[H1121]]

### 7
Let him drink, [[H8354]] and forget [[H7911]] his poverty, [[H7389]] and remember [[H2142]] his misery [[H5999]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H3808]]

### 8
Open [[H6605]] thy mouth [[H6310]] for the dumb [[H483]] in [[H413]] the cause [[H1779]] of all [[H3605]] such as are appointed [[H1121]] to destruction. [[H2475]]

Open [[H6605]] thy mouth, [[H6310]] judge [[H8199]] righteously, [[H6664]] and plead [[H1777]] the cause of the poor [[H6041]] and needy. [[H34]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] can find [[H4672]] a virtuous [[H2428]] woman? [[H802]] for her price [[H4377]] far [[H7350]] above rubies. [[H6443]]

### 11
The heart [[H3820]] of her husband [[H1167]] doth safely trust [[H982]] in her, so that he shall have no [[H3808]] need [[H2637]] of spoil. [[H7998]]

### 12
She will do [[H1580]] him good [[H2896]] and not [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of her life. [[H2416]]

### 13

### 15
She riseth [[H6965]] also while it is yet [[H5750]] night, [[H3915]] and giveth [[H5414]] meat [[H2964]] to her household, [[H1004]] and a portion [[H2706]] to her maidens. [[H5291]]

### 17
She girdeth [[H2296]] her loins [[H4975]] with strength, [[H5797]] and strengtheneth [[H553]] her arms. [[H2220]]

### 18
She perceiveth [[H2938]] that [[H3588]] her merchandise [[H5504]] good: [[H2896]] her candle [[H5216]] goeth not out [[H3518]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 19
She layeth [[H7971]] her hands [[H3027]] to the spindle, [[H3601]] and her hands [[H3709]] hold [[H8551]] the distaff. [[H6418]]

She stretcheth out [[H6566]] her hand [[H3709]] to the poor; [[H6041]] yea, she reacheth forth [[H7971]] her hands [[H3027]] to the needy. [[H34]]

### 21
She is not [[H3808]] afraid [[H3372]] of the snow [[H7950]] for her household: [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] her household [[H1004]] clothed [[H3847]] with scarlet. [[H8144]]

### 22
She maketh [[H6213]] herself coverings of tapestry; [[H4765]] her clothing [[H3830]] silk [[H8336]] and purple. [[H713]]

### 23
Her husband [[H1167]] is known [[H3045]] in the gates, [[H8179]] when he sitteth [[H3427]] among [[H5973]] the elders [[H2205]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 24
She maketh [[H6213]] fine linen, [[H5466]] and selleth [[H4376]] and delivereth [[H5414]] girdles [[H2289]] unto the merchant. [[H3669]]

### 25
Strength [[H5797]] and honour [[H1926]] her clothing; [[H3830]] and she shall rejoice [[H7832]] in time [[H3117]] to come. [[H314]]

### 26
She openeth [[H6605]] her mouth [[H6310]] with wisdom; [[H2451]] and in [[H5921]] her tongue [[H3956]] the law [[H8451]] of kindness. [[H2617]]

She looketh well [[H6822]] to the ways [[H1979]] of her household, [[H1004]] and eateth [[H398]] not [[H3808]] the bread [[H3899]] of idleness. [[H6104]]

### 28
Her children [[H1121]] arise up, [[H6965]] and call her blessed; [[H833]] her husband [[H1167]] and he praiseth [[H1984]] her. [[H1984]]

Many [[H7227]] daughters [[H1323]] have done [[H6213]] virtuously, [[H2428]] but thou [[H859]] excellest [[H5927]] them all. [[H5921]]

### 30
Favour [[H2580]] deceitful, [[H8267]] and beauty [[H3308]] vain: [[H1892]] a woman [[H802]] feareth [[H3373]] the Lord, [[H3068]] she [[H1931]] shall be praised. [[H1984]]

### 31
Give [[H5414]] her of the fruit [[H6529]] of her hands; [[H3027]] and let her own works [[H4639]] praise [[H1984]] her in the gates. [[H8179]]
