### 1
The proverbs [[H4912]] of Solomon. [[H8010]] A wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] maketh a glad [[H8055]] father: [[H1]] but a foolish [[H3684]] son [[H1121]] the heaviness [[H8424]] of his mother. [[H517]]

### 2
Treasures [[H214]] of wickedness [[H7562]] profit [[H3276]] nothing: [[H3808]] but righteousness [[H6666]] delivereth [[H5337]] from death. [[H4194]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] suffer the soul [[H5315]] of the righteous [[H6662]] to famish: [[H7456]] but he casteth away [[H1920]] the substance [[H1942]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 4
He becometh poor [[H7326]] that dealeth [[H6213]] a slack [[H7423]] hand: [[H3709]] but the hand [[H3027]] of the diligent [[H2742]] maketh rich. [[H6238]]

### 5
He that gathereth [[H103]] in summer [[H7019]] a wise [[H7919]] son: [[H1121]] he that sleepeth [[H7290]] in harvest [[H7105]] a son [[H1121]] that causeth shame. [[H954]]

### 6
Blessings [[H1293]] upon the head [[H7218]] of the just: [[H6662]] but violence [[H2555]] covereth [[H3680]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 7
The memory [[H2143]] of the just [[H6662]] blessed: [[H1293]] but the name [[H8034]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall rot. [[H7537]]

### 8
The wise [[H2450]] in heart [[H3820]] will receive [[H3947]] commandments: [[H4687]] but a prating [[H8193]] fool [[H191]] shall fall. [[H3832]]

### 9
He that walketh [[H1980]] uprightly [[H8537]] walketh [[H1980]] surely: [[H983]] but he that perverteth [[H6140]] his ways [[H1870]] shall be known. [[H3045]]

### 10
He that winketh [[H7169]] with the eye [[H5869]] causeth [[H5414]] sorrow: [[H6094]] but a prating [[H8193]] fool [[H191]] shall fall. [[H3832]]

### 11
The mouth [[H6310]] of a righteous [[H6662]] a well [[H4726]] of life: [[H2416]] but violence [[H2555]] covereth [[H3680]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 12
Hatred [[H8135]] stirreth up [[H5782]] strifes: [[H4090]] but love [[H160]] covereth [[H3680]] all [[H3605]] sins. [[H6588]]

### 13
In the lips [[H8193]] of him that hath understanding [[H995]] wisdom [[H2451]] is found: [[H4672]] but a rod [[H7626]] for the back [[H1460]] of him that is void [[H2638]] of understanding. [[H3820]]

### 14
Wise [[H2450]] lay up [[H6845]] knowledge: [[H1847]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the foolish [[H191]] near [[H7138]] destruction. [[H4288]]

### 15
The rich man's [[H6223]] wealth [[H1952]] his strong [[H5797]] city: [[H7151]] the destruction [[H4288]] of the poor [[H1800]] their poverty. [[H7389]]

### 16
The labour [[H6468]] of the righteous [[H6662]] to life: [[H2416]] the fruit [[H8393]] of the wicked [[H7563]] to sin. [[H2403]]

### 17
He the way [[H734]] of life [[H2416]] that keepeth [[H8104]] instruction: [[H4148]] but he that refuseth [[H5800]] reproof [[H8433]] erreth. [[H8582]]

### 18
He that hideth [[H3680]] hatred [[H8135]] lying [[H8267]] lips, [[H8193]] and he that uttereth [[H3318]] a slander, [[H1681]] a fool. [[H3684]]

### 19
In the multitude [[H7230]] of words [[H1697]] there wanteth [[H2308]] not [[H3808]] sin: [[H6588]] but he that refraineth [[H2820]] his lips [[H8193]] wise. [[H7919]]

### 20
The tongue [[H3956]] of the just [[H6662]] choice [[H977]] silver: [[H3701]] the heart [[H3820]] of the wicked [[H7563]] little worth. [[H4592]]

### 21
The lips [[H8193]] of the righteous [[H6662]] feed [[H7462]] many: [[H7227]] but fools [[H191]] die [[H4191]] for want [[H2638]] of wisdom. [[H3820]]

### 22
The blessing [[H1293]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] it [[H1931]] maketh rich, [[H6238]] and he addeth [[H3254]] no [[H3808]] sorrow [[H6089]] with [[H5973]] it. [[H5973]]

### 23
as sport [[H7814]] to a fool [[H3684]] to do [[H6213]] mischief: [[H2154]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] hath wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 24
The fear [[H4034]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] it [[H1931]] shall come upon [[H935]] him: but the desire [[H8378]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shall be granted. [[H5414]]

### 25
As the whirlwind [[H5492]] passeth, [[H5674]] so the wicked [[H7563]] no [[H369]] but the righteous [[H6662]] an everlasting [[H5769]] foundation. [[H3247]]

### 26
As vinegar [[H2558]] to the teeth, [[H8127]] and as smoke [[H6227]] to the eyes, [[H5869]] so [[H3651]] the sluggard [[H6102]] to them that send [[H7971]] him. [[H7971]]

### 27
The fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] prolongeth [[H3254]] days: [[H3117]] but the years [[H8141]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be shortened. [[H7114]]

### 28
The hope [[H8431]] of the righteous [[H6662]] gladness: [[H8057]] but the expectation [[H8615]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall perish. [[H6]]

### 29
The way [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H3068]] strength [[H4581]] to the upright: [[H8537]] but destruction [[H4288]] to the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity. [[H205]]

### 30
The righteous [[H6662]] shall never [[H5769]] be removed: [[H4131]] but the wicked [[H7563]] shall not [[H3808]] inhabit [[H7931]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 31
The mouth [[H6310]] of the just [[H6662]] bringeth forth [[H5107]] wisdom: [[H2451]] but the froward [[H8419]] tongue [[H3956]] shall be cut out. [[H3772]]

### 32
The lips [[H8193]] of the righteous [[H6662]] know [[H3045]] what is acceptable: [[H7522]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] frowardness. [[H8419]]
