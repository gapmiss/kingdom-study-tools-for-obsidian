[[Proverbs 11|←]] • [[Proverbs 13|→]]

---

### 1
Whoso loveth [[H157]] instruction [[H4148]] loveth [[H157]] knowledge: [[H1847]] but he that hateth [[H8130]] reproof [[H8433]] brutish. [[H1198]]

### 2
A good [[H2896]] obtaineth [[H6329]] favour [[H7522]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] but a man [[H376]] of wicked devices [[H4209]] will he condemn. [[H7561]]

### 3
A man [[H120]] shall not [[H3808]] be established [[H3559]] by wickedness: [[H7562]] but the root [[H8328]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shall not [[H1077]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 4
A virtuous [[H2428]] woman [[H802]] a crown [[H5850]] to her husband: [[H1167]] but she that maketh ashamed [[H954]] as rottenness [[H7538]] in his bones. [[H6106]]

### 5
The thoughts [[H4284]] of the righteous [[H6662]] right: [[H4941]] the counsels [[H8458]] of the wicked [[H7563]] deceit. [[H4820]]

### 6
The words [[H1697]] of the wicked [[H7563]] to lie in wait [[H693]] for blood: [[H1818]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the upright [[H3477]] shall deliver [[H5337]] them. [[H5337]]

### 7
The wicked [[H7563]] are overthrown, [[H2015]] and not: [[H369]] but the house [[H1004]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shall stand. [[H5975]]

### 8
A man [[H376]] shall be commended [[H1984]] according [[H6310]] to his wisdom: [[H7922]] but he that is of a perverse [[H5753]] heart [[H3820]] shall be [[H1961]] despised. [[H937]]

### 9
despised, [[H7034]] and hath a servant, [[H5650]] better [[H2896]] than he that honoureth [[H3513]] himself, and lacketh [[H2638]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 10
A righteous [[H6662]] regardeth [[H3045]] the life [[H5315]] of his beast: [[H929]] but the tender mercies [[H7356]] of the wicked [[H7563]] cruel. [[H394]]

### 11
He that tilleth [[H5647]] his land [[H127]] shall be satisfied [[H7646]] with bread: [[H3899]] but he that followeth [[H7291]] vain [[H7386]] void [[H2638]] of understanding. [[H3820]]

### 12
The wicked [[H7563]] desireth [[H2530]] the net [[H4685]] of evil [[H7451]] but the root [[H8328]] of the righteous [[H6662]] yieldeth [[H5414]]

### 13
The wicked [[H7451]] is snared [[H4170]] by the transgression [[H6588]] of lips: [[H8193]] but the just [[H6662]] shall come out [[H3318]] of trouble. [[H6869]]

### 14
A man [[H376]] shall be satisfied [[H7646]] with good [[H2896]] by the fruit [[H6529]] of mouth: [[H6310]] and the recompence [[H1576]] of a man's [[H120]] hands [[H3027]] shall be rendered [[H7725]] unto him. [[H7725]]

### 15
The way [[H1870]] of a fool [[H191]] right [[H3477]] in his own eyes: [[H5869]] but he that hearkeneth [[H8085]] unto counsel [[H6098]] wise. [[H2450]]

### 16
A fool's [[H191]] wrath [[H3708]] is presently [[H3117]] known: [[H3045]] but a prudent [[H6175]] covereth [[H3680]] shame. [[H7036]]

### 17
speaketh [[H6315]] truth [[H530]] sheweth forth [[H5046]] righteousness: [[H6664]] but a false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] deceit. [[H4820]]

### 18
There is [[H3426]] that speaketh [[H981]] like the piercings [[H4094]] of a sword: [[H2719]] but the tongue [[H3956]] of the wise [[H2450]] health. [[H4832]]

### 19
The lip [[H8193]] of truth [[H571]] shall be established [[H3559]] for ever: [[H5703]] but [[H5704]] a lying [[H8267]] tongue [[H3956]] but for a moment. [[H7280]]

### 20
Deceit [[H4820]] in the heart [[H3820]] of them that imagine [[H2790]] evil: [[H7451]] but to the counsellers [[H3289]] of peace [[H7965]] joy. [[H8057]]

### 21
There shall no [[H3808]] evil [[H205]] happen [[H579]] to the just: [[H6662]] but the wicked [[H7563]] shall be filled [[H4390]] with mischief. [[H7451]]

### 22
Lying [[H8267]] lips [[H8193]] abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] but they that deal [[H6213]] truly [[H530]] his delight. [[H7522]]

### 23
A prudent [[H6175]] man [[H120]] concealeth [[H3680]] knowledge: [[H1847]] but the heart [[H3820]] of fools [[H3684]] proclaimeth [[H7121]] foolishness. [[H200]]

### 24
The hand [[H3027]] of the diligent [[H2742]] shall bear rule: [[H4910]] but the slothful [[H7423]] shall be [[H1961]] under tribute. [[H4522]]

### 25
Heaviness [[H1674]] in the heart [[H3820]] of man [[H376]] maketh it stoop: [[H7812]] but a good [[H2896]] word [[H1697]] maketh it glad. [[H8055]]

### 26
The righteous [[H6662]] more excellent [[H8446]] than his neighbour: [[H7453]] but the way [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] seduceth [[H8582]] them. [[H8582]]

### 27
The slothful [[H7423]] roasteth [[H2760]] not [[H3808]] that which he took in hunting: [[H6718]] but the substance [[H1952]] of a diligent [[H2742]] man [[H120]] precious. [[H3368]]

### 28
In the way [[H734]] of righteousness [[H6666]] life; [[H2416]] and the pathway [[H5410]] no [[H408]] death. [[H4194]]
