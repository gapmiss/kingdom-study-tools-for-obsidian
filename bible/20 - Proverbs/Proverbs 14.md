### 1
Every wise [[H2454]] woman [[H802]] buildeth [[H1129]] her house: [[H1004]] but the foolish [[H200]] plucketh it down [[H2040]] with her hands. [[H3027]]

### 2
He that walketh [[H1980]] in his uprightness [[H3476]] feareth [[H3373]] the Lord: [[H3068]] but perverse [[H3868]] in his ways [[H1870]] despiseth [[H959]] him. [[H959]]

### 3
In the mouth [[H6310]] of the foolish [[H191]] a rod [[H2415]] of pride: [[H1346]] but the lips [[H8193]] of the wise [[H2450]] shall preserve [[H8104]] them. [[H8104]]

### 4
Where no [[H369]] oxen [[H504]] the crib [[H18]] clean: [[H1249]] but much [[H7230]] increase [[H8393]] by the strength [[H3581]] of the ox. [[H7794]]

### 5
A faithful [[H529]] witness [[H5707]] will not [[H3808]] lie: [[H3577]] but a false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] will utter [[H6315]] lies. [[H3576]]

### 6
A scorner [[H3887]] seeketh [[H1245]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and not: [[H369]] but knowledge [[H1847]] easy [[H7043]] unto him that understandeth. [[H995]]

### 7
Go [[H1980]] from the presence [[H5048]] of a foolish [[H3684]] man, [[H376]] when thou perceivest [[H3045]] not [[H1077]] the lips [[H8193]] of knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 8
The wisdom [[H2451]] of the prudent [[H6175]] to understand [[H995]] his way: [[H1870]] but the folly [[H200]] of fools [[H3684]] deceit. [[H4820]]

### 9
Fools [[H191]] make a mock [[H3887]] at sin: [[H817]] but among [[H996]] the righteous [[H3477]] favour. [[H7522]]

### 10
The heart [[H3820]] knoweth [[H3045]] his own [[H5315]] bitterness; [[H4787]] and a stranger [[H2114]] doth not [[H3808]] intermeddle [[H6148]] with his joy. [[H8057]]

### 11
The house [[H1004]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be overthrown: [[H8045]] but the tabernacle [[H168]] of the upright [[H3477]] shall flourish. [[H6524]]

### 12
There is [[H3426]] a way [[H1870]] which seemeth right [[H3477]] unto [[H6440]] a man, [[H376]] but the end [[H319]] thereof the ways [[H1870]] of death. [[H4194]]

### 13
Even [[H1571]] in laughter [[H7814]] the heart [[H3820]] is sorrowful; [[H3510]] and the end [[H319]] of that mirth [[H8057]] heaviness. [[H8424]]

### 14
The backslider [[H5472]] in heart [[H3820]] shall be filled [[H7646]] with his own ways: [[H1870]] and a good [[H2896]] man [[H376]] from [[H5921]] himself. [[H5921]]

### 15
The simple [[H6612]] believeth [[H539]] every [[H3605]] word: [[H1697]] but the prudent [[H6175]] looketh well [[H995]] to his going. [[H838]]

### 16
A wise [[H2450]] feareth, [[H3373]] and departeth [[H5493]] from evil: [[H7451]] but the fool [[H3684]] rageth, [[H5674]] and is confident. [[H982]]

### 17
soon [[H7116]] angry [[H639]] dealeth [[H6213]] foolishly: [[H200]] and a man [[H376]] of wicked devices [[H4209]] is hated. [[H8130]]

### 18
The simple [[H6612]] inherit [[H5157]] folly: [[H200]] but the prudent [[H6175]] are crowned [[H3803]] with knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 19
The evil [[H7451]] bow [[H7817]] before [[H6440]] the good; [[H2896]] and the wicked [[H7563]] at [[H5921]] the gates [[H8179]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 20
The poor [[H7326]] is hated [[H8130]] even [[H1571]] of his own neighbour: [[H7453]] but the rich [[H6223]] many [[H7227]] friends. [[H157]]

### 21
He that despiseth [[H936]] his neighbour [[H7453]] sinneth: [[H2398]] but he that hath mercy on [[H2603]] the poor, [[H6035]] happy he. [[H835]]

### 22
Do they not [[H3808]] err [[H8582]] that devise [[H2790]] evil? [[H7451]] but mercy [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] to them that devise [[H2790]] good. [[H2896]]

### 23
In all [[H3605]] labour [[H6089]] there is [[H1961]] profit: [[H4195]] but the talk [[H1697]] of the lips [[H8193]] only [[H389]] to penury. [[H4270]]

### 24
The crown [[H5850]] of the wise [[H2450]] their riches: [[H6239]] the foolishness [[H200]] of fools [[H3684]] folly. [[H200]]

### 25
A true [[H571]] witness [[H5707]] delivereth [[H5337]] souls: [[H5315]] but a deceitful [[H4820]] speaketh [[H6315]] lies. [[H3577]]

### 26
In the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] strong [[H5797]] confidence: [[H4009]] and his children [[H1121]] shall have [[H1961]] a place of refuge. [[H4268]]

### 27
The fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] a fountain [[H4726]] of life, [[H2416]] to depart [[H5493]] from the snares [[H4170]] of death. [[H4194]]

### 28
In the multitude [[H7230]] of people [[H5971]] the king's [[H4428]] honour: [[H1927]] but in the want [[H657]] of people [[H3816]] the destruction [[H4288]] of the prince. [[H7333]]

### 29
slow [[H750]] to wrath [[H639]] of great [[H7227]] understanding: [[H8394]] but hasty [[H7116]] of spirit [[H7307]] exalteth [[H7311]] folly. [[H200]]

### 30
A sound [[H4832]] heart [[H3820]] the life [[H2416]] of the flesh: [[H1320]] but envy [[H7068]] the rottenness [[H7538]] of the bones. [[H6106]]

### 31
He that oppresseth [[H6231]] the poor [[H1800]] reproacheth [[H2778]] his Maker: [[H6213]] but he that honoureth [[H3513]] him hath mercy [[H2603]] on the poor. [[H34]]

### 32
The wicked [[H7563]] is driven away [[H1760]] in his wickedness: [[H7451]] but the righteous [[H6662]] hath hope [[H2620]] in his death. [[H4194]]

### 33
Wisdom [[H2451]] resteth [[H5117]] in the heart [[H3820]] of him that hath understanding: [[H995]] but in the midst [[H7130]] of fools [[H3684]] is made known. [[H3045]]

### 34
Righteousness [[H6666]] exalteth [[H7311]] a nation: [[H1471]] but sin [[H2403]] a reproach [[H2617]] to any people. [[H3816]]

### 35
The king's [[H4428]] favour [[H7522]] toward a wise [[H7919]] servant: [[H5650]] but his wrath [[H5678]] is [[H1961]] him that causeth shame. [[H954]]
