### 1
When [[H3588]] thou sittest [[H3427]] to eat [[H3898]] with [[H854]] a ruler, [[H4910]] consider [[H995]] diligently [[H995]] what [[H834]] before [[H6440]] thee: [[H6440]]

### 2
And put [[H7760]] a knife [[H7915]] to thy throat, [[H3930]] if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] a man given [[H1167]] to appetite. [[H5315]]

### 3
Be not [[H408]] desirous [[H183]] of his dainties: [[H4303]] for they [[H1931]] deceitful [[H3577]] meat. [[H3899]]

### 4
Labour [[H3021]] not [[H408]] to be rich: [[H6238]] cease [[H2308]] from thine own wisdom. [[H998]]

### 5
Wilt thou set [[H5774]] thine eyes [[H5869]] upon that which is not? [[H369]] for [[H3588]] certainly [[H6213]] make [[H6213]] themselves wings; [[H3671]] they fly away [[H5774]] as an eagle [[H5404]] toward heaven. [[H8064]]

### 6
Eat [[H3898]] thou not [[H408]] the bread [[H3899]] of an evil [[H7451]] eye, [[H5869]] neither [[H408]] desire [[H183]] thou his dainty meats: [[H4303]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] as [[H3644]] he thinketh [[H8176]] in his heart, [[H5315]] so [[H3651]] he: [[H1931]] Eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] saith [[H559]] he to thee; but his heart [[H3820]] not [[H1077]] with thee. [[H1077]]

### 8
The morsel [[H6595]] thou hast eaten [[H398]] shalt thou vomit up, [[H6958]] and lose [[H7843]] thy sweet [[H5273]] words. [[H1697]]

### 9
Speak [[H1696]] not [[H408]] in the ears [[H241]] of a fool: [[H3684]] for [[H3588]] he will despise [[H936]] the wisdom [[H7922]] of thy words. [[H4405]]

### 10
Remove [[H5253]] not [[H408]] the old [[H5769]] landmark; [[H1366]] and enter [[H935]] not [[H408]] into the fields [[H7704]] of the fatherless: [[H3490]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] their redeemer [[H1350]] mighty; [[H2389]] he [[H1931]] shall plead [[H7378]] their cause [[H7379]] with [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 12
Apply [[H935]] thine heart [[H3820]] unto instruction, [[H4148]] and thine ears [[H241]] to the words [[H561]] of knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 13
Withhold [[H4513]] not [[H408]] correction [[H4148]] from the child: [[H5288]] for [[H3588]] thou beatest [[H5221]] him with the rod, [[H7626]] he shall not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 14
Thou [[H859]] shalt beat [[H5221]] him with the rod, [[H7626]] and shalt deliver [[H5337]] his soul [[H5315]] from hell. [[H7585]]

### 15
My son, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] thine heart [[H3820]] be wise, [[H2449]] my heart [[H3820]] shall rejoice, [[H8055]] even [[H1571]] mine. [[H589]]

### 16
Yea, my reins [[H3629]] shall rejoice, [[H5937]] when thy lips [[H8193]] speak [[H1696]] right things. [[H4339]]

### 17
Let not [[H408]] thine heart [[H3820]] envy [[H7065]] sinners: [[H2400]] but [[H3588]] in the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long. [[H3117]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] surely [[H518]] there is [[H3426]] an end; [[H319]] and thine expectation [[H8615]] shall not [[H3808]] be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 19
Hear [[H8085]] thou, [[H859]] my son, [[H1121]] and be wise, [[H2449]] and guide [[H833]] thine heart [[H3820]] in the way. [[H1870]]

### 20
Be [[H1961]] not [[H408]] among winebibbers; [[H3196]] among riotous eaters [[H2151]] of flesh: [[H1320]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] the drunkard [[H5433]] and the glutton [[H2151]] shall come to poverty: [[H3423]] and drowsiness [[H5124]] shall clothe [[H3847]] with rags. [[H7168]]

### 22
Hearken [[H8085]] unto thy father [[H1]] that [[H2088]] begat [[H3205]] thee, and despise [[H936]] not [[H408]] thy mother [[H517]] when [[H3588]] she is old. [[H2204]]

### 23
Buy [[H7069]] the truth, [[H571]] and sell [[H4376]] not; [[H408]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and instruction, [[H4148]] and understanding. [[H998]]

### 24
The father [[H1]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shall greatly [[H1524]] rejoice: [[H1523]] and he that begetteth [[H3205]] a wise [[H2450]] shall have joy [[H8055]] of him. [[H8055]]

### 25
Thy father [[H1]] and thy mother [[H517]] shall be glad, [[H8055]] and she that bare [[H3205]] thee shall rejoice. [[H1523]]

### 26
My son, [[H1121]] give [[H5414]] me thine heart, [[H3820]] and let thine eyes [[H5869]] observe [[H7521]] my ways. [[H1870]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] a whore [[H2181]] a deep [[H6013]] ditch; [[H7745]] and a strange woman [[H5237]] a narrow [[H6862]] pit. [[H875]]

### 28
She [[H1931]] also [[H637]] lieth in wait [[H693]] as a prey, [[H2863]] and increaseth [[H3254]] the transgressors [[H898]] among men. [[H120]]

### 29
Who [[H4310]] hath woe? [[H188]] who [[H4310]] hath sorrow? [[H17]] who [[H4310]] hath contentions? [[H4066]] who [[H4310]] hath babbling? [[H7879]] who [[H4310]] hath wounds [[H6482]] without cause? [[H2600]] who [[H4310]] hath redness [[H2448]] of eyes? [[H5869]]

### 30
They that tarry long [[H309]] at [[H5921]] the wine; [[H3196]] they that go [[H935]] to seek [[H2713]] mixed wine. [[H4469]]

### 31
Look [[H7200]] not [[H408]] thou upon the wine [[H3196]] when [[H3588]] it is red, [[H119]] when [[H3588]] it giveth [[H5414]] his colour [[H5869]] in the cup, [[H3563]] it moveth itself [[H1980]] aright. [[H4339]]

### 32
At the last [[H319]] it biteth [[H5391]] like a serpent, [[H5175]] and stingeth [[H6567]] like an adder. [[H6848]]

### 33
Thine eyes [[H5869]] shall behold [[H7200]] strange women, [[H2114]] and thine heart [[H3820]] shall utter [[H1696]] perverse things. [[H8419]]

### 34
Yea, thou shalt be [[H1961]] as he that lieth down [[H7901]] in the midst [[H3820]] of the sea, [[H3220]] or as he that lieth [[H7901]] upon the top [[H7218]] of a mast. [[H2260]]

### 35
They have stricken [[H5221]] me, I was not [[H1077]] sick; [[H2470]] they have beaten [[H1986]] me, I felt [[H3045]] not: [[H1077]] when [[H4970]] shall I awake? [[H6974]] I will seek [[H1245]] it yet [[H3254]] again. [[H3254]]
