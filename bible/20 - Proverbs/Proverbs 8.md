### 1
Doth not [[H3808]] wisdom [[H2451]] cry? [[H7121]] and understanding [[H8394]] put forth [[H5414]] her voice? [[H6963]]

### 2
She standeth [[H5324]] in the top [[H7218]] of high places, [[H4791]] by [[H5921]] the way [[H1870]] in the places [[H1004]] of the paths. [[H5410]]

### 3
She crieth [[H7442]] at [[H3027]] the gates, [[H8179]] at the entry [[H6310]] of the city, [[H7176]] at the coming [[H3996]] in at the doors. [[H6607]]

### 4
Unto [[H413]] you, O men, [[H376]] I call; [[H7121]] and my voice [[H6963]] to [[H413]] the sons [[H1121]] of man. [[H120]]

### 5
O ye simple, [[H6612]] understand [[H995]] wisdom: [[H6195]] and, ye fools, [[H3684]] be ye of an understanding [[H995]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 6
Hear; [[H8085]] for [[H3588]] I will speak [[H1696]] of excellent things; [[H5057]] and the opening [[H4669]] of my lips [[H8193]] right things. [[H4339]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] my mouth [[H2441]] shall speak [[H1897]] truth; [[H571]] and wickedness [[H7562]] an abomination [[H8441]] to my lips. [[H8193]]

### 8
All [[H3605]] the words [[H561]] of my mouth [[H6310]] in righteousness; [[H6664]] nothing [[H369]] froward [[H6617]] or perverse [[H6141]] in them. [[H6141]]

### 9
They all [[H3605]] plain [[H5228]] to him that understandeth, [[H995]] and right [[H3477]] to them that find [[H4672]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 10
Receive [[H3947]] my instruction, [[H4148]] and not [[H408]] silver; [[H3701]] and knowledge [[H1847]] rather than choice [[H977]] gold. [[H2742]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] wisdom [[H2451]] better [[H2896]] than rubies; [[H6443]] and all [[H3605]] the things that may be desired [[H2656]] are not [[H3808]] to be compared [[H7737]] to it. [[H7737]]

### 12
I [[H589]] wisdom [[H2451]] dwell [[H7931]] with prudence, [[H6195]] and find out [[H4672]] knowledge [[H1847]] of witty inventions. [[H4209]]

### 13
The fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to hate [[H8130]] evil: [[H7451]] pride, [[H1344]] and arrogancy, [[H1347]] and the evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] and the froward [[H8419]] mouth, [[H6310]] do I hate. [[H8130]]

### 14
Counsel [[H6098]] mine, and sound wisdom: [[H8454]] I [[H589]] understanding; [[H998]] I have strength. [[H1369]]

### 15
By me kings [[H4428]] reign, [[H4427]] and princes [[H7336]] decree [[H2710]] justice. [[H6664]]

### 16
By me princes [[H8269]] rule, [[H8323]] and nobles, [[H5081]] all [[H3605]] the judges [[H8199]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
I [[H589]] love [[H157]] them that love [[H157]] me; and those that seek me early [[H7836]] shall find [[H4672]] me. [[H4672]]

### 18
Riches [[H6239]] and honour [[H3519]] with [[H854]] me; durable [[H6276]] riches [[H1952]] and righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 19
My fruit [[H6529]] better [[H2896]] than gold, [[H2742]] yea, than fine gold; [[H6337]] and my revenue [[H8393]] than choice [[H977]] silver. [[H3701]]

### 20
I lead [[H1980]] in the way [[H734]] of righteousness, [[H6666]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the paths [[H5410]] of judgment: [[H4941]]

### 21
That I may cause those that love [[H157]] me to inherit [[H5157]] substance; [[H3426]] and I will fill [[H4390]] their treasures. [[H214]]

### 22
The Lord [[H3068]] possessed [[H7069]] me in the beginning [[H7225]] of his way, [[H1870]] before [[H6924]] his works [[H4659]] of old. [[H4659]]

### 23
I was set up [[H5258]] from everlasting, [[H5769]] from the beginning, [[H7218]] or ever [[H6924]] the earth [[H776]] was. [[H776]]

### 24
When no [[H369]] depths, [[H8415]] I was brought forth; [[H2342]] when no [[H369]] fountains [[H4599]] abounding [[H3513]] with water. [[H4325]]

### 25
Before [[H2962]] the mountains [[H2022]] were settled, [[H2883]] before [[H6440]] the hills [[H1389]] was I brought forth: [[H2342]]

### 26
While as yet [[H5704]] he had not [[H3808]] made [[H6213]] the earth, [[H776]] nor the fields, [[H2351]] nor the highest part [[H7218]] of the dust [[H6083]] of the world. [[H8398]]

### 27
When he prepared [[H3559]] the heavens, [[H8064]] I [[H589]] there: [[H8033]] when he set [[H2710]] a compass [[H2329]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the depth: [[H8415]]

### 28
When he established [[H553]] the clouds [[H7834]] above: [[H4605]] when he strengthened [[H5810]] the fountains [[H5869]] of the deep: [[H8415]]

### 29
When he gave [[H7760]] to the sea [[H3220]] his decree, [[H2706]] that the waters [[H4325]] should not [[H3808]] pass [[H5674]] his commandment: [[H6310]] when he appointed [[H2710]] the foundations [[H4144]] of the earth: [[H776]]

### 30
Then I was [[H1961]] by him, [[H681]] one brought up [[H525]] and I was [[H1961]] daily [[H3117]] delight, [[H8191]] rejoicing [[H7832]] always [[H6256]] before [[H6440]] him; [[H6440]]

### 31
Rejoicing [[H7832]] in the habitable part [[H8398]] of his earth; [[H776]] and my delights [[H8191]] with [[H854]] the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 32
Now [[H6258]] therefore hearken [[H8085]] unto me, O ye children: [[H1121]] for blessed [[H835]] keep [[H8104]] my ways. [[H1870]]

### 33
Hear [[H8085]] instruction, [[H4148]] and be wise, [[H2449]] and refuse [[H6544]] it not. [[H6544]]

### 34
Blessed [[H835]] the man [[H120]] that heareth [[H8085]] me, watching [[H8245]] daily [[H3117]] at [[H5921]] my gates, [[H1817]] waiting [[H8104]] at the posts [[H4201]] of my doors. [[H6607]]

### 35
For [[H3588]] whoso findeth [[H4672]] me findeth [[H4672]] life, [[H2416]] and shall obtain [[H6329]] favour [[H7522]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 36
But he that sinneth against [[H2398]] me wrongeth [[H2554]] his own soul: [[H5315]] all [[H3605]] they that hate [[H8130]] me love [[H157]] death. [[H4194]]
