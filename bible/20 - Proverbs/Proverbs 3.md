### 1
My son, [[H1121]] forget [[H7911]] not [[H408]] my law; [[H8451]] but let thine heart [[H3820]] keep [[H5341]] my commandments: [[H4687]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] length [[H753]] of days, [[H3117]] and long [[H8141]] life, [[H2416]] and peace, [[H7965]] shall they add [[H3254]] to thee. [[H3254]]

### 3
Let not [[H408]] mercy [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] forsake [[H5800]] thee: bind [[H7194]] them about [[H5921]] thy neck; [[H1621]] write [[H3789]] them upon [[H5921]] the table [[H3871]] of thine heart: [[H3820]]

### 4
So shalt thou find [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] and good [[H2896]] understanding [[H7922]] in the sight [[H5869]] of God [[H430]] and man. [[H120]]

### 5
Trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] thine heart; [[H3820]] and lean [[H8172]] not [[H408]] unto [[H413]] thine own understanding. [[H998]]

### 6
In all [[H3605]] thy ways [[H1870]] acknowledge [[H3045]] him, and he [[H1931]] shall direct [[H3474]] thy paths. [[H734]]

### 7
Be [[H1961]] not [[H408]] wise [[H2450]] in thine own eyes: [[H5869]] fear [[H3372]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and depart [[H5493]] from evil. [[H7451]]

### 8
It shall be [[H1961]] health [[H7500]] to thy navel, [[H8270]] and marrow [[H8250]] to thy bones. [[H6106]]

### 9
Honour [[H3513]] the Lord [[H3068]] with thy substance, [[H1952]] and with the firstfruits [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] thine increase: [[H8393]]

### 10
So shall thy barns [[H618]] be filled [[H4390]] with plenty, [[H7647]] and thy presses [[H3342]] shall burst out [[H6555]] with new wine. [[H8492]]

### 11
My son, [[H1121]] despise [[H3988]] not [[H408]] the chastening [[H4148]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] neither [[H408]] be weary [[H6973]] of his correction: [[H8433]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] loveth [[H157]] he correcteth; [[H3198]] even as a father [[H1]] the son [[H1121]] he delighteth. [[H7521]]

### 13
Happy [[H835]] the man [[H120]] findeth [[H4672]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and the man [[H120]] getteth [[H6329]] understanding. [[H8394]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] the merchandise [[H5504]] of it better [[H2896]] than the merchandise [[H5505]] of silver, [[H3701]] and the gain [[H8393]] thereof than fine gold. [[H2742]]

### 15
She [[H1931]] more precious [[H3368]] than rubies: [[H6443]] and all [[H3605]] the things thou canst desire [[H2656]] are not [[H3808]] to be compared [[H7737]] unto her. [[H7737]]

### 16
Length [[H753]] of days [[H3117]] in her right hand; [[H3225]] in her left hand [[H8040]] riches [[H6239]] and honour. [[H3519]]

### 17
Her ways [[H1870]] ways [[H1870]] of pleasantness, [[H5278]] and all [[H3605]] her paths [[H5410]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 18
She [[H1931]] a tree [[H6086]] of life [[H2416]] to them that lay hold [[H2388]] upon her: and happy [[H833]] that retaineth [[H8551]] her. [[H8551]]

### 19
The Lord [[H3068]] by wisdom [[H2451]] hath founded [[H3245]] the earth; [[H776]] by understanding [[H8394]] hath he established [[H3559]] the heavens. [[H8064]]

### 20
By his knowledge [[H1847]] the depths [[H8415]] are broken up, [[H1234]] and the clouds [[H7834]] drop down [[H7491]] the dew. [[H2919]]

### 21
My son, [[H1121]] let not [[H408]] them depart [[H3868]] from thine eyes: [[H5869]] keep [[H5341]] sound wisdom [[H8454]] and discretion: [[H4209]]

### 22
So shall they be [[H1961]] life [[H2416]] unto thy soul, [[H5315]] and grace [[H2580]] to thy neck. [[H1621]]

### 23
Then [[H227]] shalt thou walk [[H1980]] in thy way [[H1870]] safely, [[H983]] and thy foot [[H7272]] shall not [[H3808]] stumble. [[H5062]]

### 24
When [[H518]] thou liest down, [[H7901]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] be afraid: [[H6342]] yea, thou shalt lie down, [[H7901]] and thy sleep [[H8142]] shall be sweet. [[H6149]]

### 25
Be not [[H408]] afraid [[H3372]] of sudden [[H6597]] fear, [[H6343]] neither of the desolation [[H7722]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] when [[H3588]] it cometh. [[H935]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall be [[H1961]] thy confidence, [[H3689]] and shall keep [[H8104]] thy foot [[H7272]] from being taken. [[H3921]]

### 27
Withhold [[H4513]] not [[H408]] good [[H2896]] from them to whom it is due, [[H1167]] when it is [[H1961]] in the power [[H410]] of thine hand [[H3027]] to do [[H6213]]

### 28
Say [[H559]] not [[H408]] unto thy neighbour, [[H7453]] Go, [[H1980]] and come again, [[H7725]] and to morrow [[H4279]] I will give; [[H5414]] when thou hast [[H3426]] it by [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 29
Devise [[H2790]] not [[H408]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] thy neighbour, [[H7453]] seeing he [[H1931]] dwelleth [[H3427]] securely [[H983]] by [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 30
Strive [[H7378]] not [[H408]] with [[H5973]] a man [[H120]] without cause, [[H2600]] if [[H518]] he have done [[H1580]] thee no [[H3808]] harm. [[H7451]]

### 31
Envy [[H7065]] thou not [[H408]] the oppressor, [[H376]] and choose [[H977]] none [[H408]] of his ways. [[H1870]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] the froward [[H3868]] abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] but his secret [[H5475]] with [[H853]] the righteous. [[H3477]]

### 33
The curse [[H3994]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the house [[H1004]] of the wicked: [[H7563]] but he blesseth [[H1288]] the habitation [[H5116]] of the just. [[H6662]]

### 34
Surely [[H518]] he [[H1931]] scorneth [[H3887]] the scorners: [[H3887]] but he giveth [[H5414]] grace [[H2580]] unto the lowly. [[H6035]]

### 35
The wise [[H2450]] shall inherit [[H5157]] glory: [[H3519]] but shame [[H7036]] shall be the promotion [[H7311]] of fools. [[H3684]]
