### 1
My son, [[H1121]] attend [[H7181]] unto my wisdom, [[H2451]] bow [[H5186]] thine ear [[H241]] to my understanding: [[H8394]]

### 2
That thou mayest regard [[H8104]] discretion, [[H4209]] and thy lips [[H8193]] may keep [[H5341]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the lips [[H8193]] of a strange woman [[H2114]] drop [[H5197]] an honeycomb, [[H5317]] and her mouth [[H2441]] smoother [[H2509]] than oil: [[H8081]]

### 4
But her end [[H319]] is bitter [[H4751]] as wormwood, [[H3939]] sharp [[H2299]] as a twoedged [[H6310]] sword. [[H2719]]

### 5
Her feet [[H7272]] go down [[H3381]] to death; [[H4194]] her steps [[H6806]] take hold [[H8551]] on hell. [[H7585]]

### 6
Lest [[H6435]] thou shouldest ponder [[H6424]] the path [[H734]] of life, [[H2416]] her ways [[H4570]] are moveable, [[H5128]] thou canst not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]]

### 7
Hear [[H8085]] me now [[H6258]] therefore, O ye children, [[H1121]] and depart [[H5493]] not [[H408]] from the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 8
Remove [[H7368]] thy way [[H1870]] far from [[H5921]] her, and come not nigh [[H7126]] the door [[H6607]] of her house: [[H1004]]

### 9
Lest [[H6435]] thou give [[H5414]] thine honour [[H1935]] unto others, [[H312]] and thy years [[H8141]] unto the cruel: [[H394]]

### 10
Lest [[H6435]] strangers [[H2114]] be filled [[H7646]] with thy wealth; [[H3581]] and thy labours [[H6089]] in the house [[H1004]] of a stranger; [[H5237]]

### 11
And thou mourn [[H5098]] at the last, [[H319]] when thy flesh [[H1320]] and thy body [[H7607]] are consumed, [[H3615]]

### 12
And say, [[H559]] How [[H349]] have I hated [[H8130]] instruction, [[H4148]] and my heart [[H3820]] despised [[H5006]] reproof; [[H8433]]

### 13
And have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of my teachers, [[H3384]] nor [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] mine ear [[H241]] to them that instructed [[H3925]] me! [[H3925]]

### 14
I was [[H1961]] almost [[H4592]] in all [[H3605]] evil [[H7451]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the congregation [[H6951]] and assembly. [[H5712]]

### 15
Drink [[H8354]] waters [[H4325]] out of thine own cistern, [[H953]] and running waters [[H5140]] out of [[H8432]] thine own well. [[H875]]

### 16
Let thy fountains [[H4599]] be dispersed [[H6327]] abroad, [[H2351]] rivers [[H6388]] of waters [[H4325]] in the streets. [[H7339]]

### 17
Let them be [[H1961]] only [[H905]] thine own, and not [[H369]] strangers' [[H2114]] with [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 18
Let thy fountain [[H4726]] be [[H1961]] blessed: [[H1288]] and rejoice [[H8055]] with the wife [[H802]] of thy youth. [[H5271]]

### 19
the loving [[H158]] hind [[H365]] and pleasant [[H2580]] roe; [[H3280]] let her breasts [[H1717]] satisfy [[H7301]] thee at all [[H3605]] times; [[H6256]] and be thou ravished [[H7686]] always [[H8548]] with her love. [[H160]]

### 20
And why [[H4100]] wilt thou, my son, [[H1121]] be ravished [[H7686]] with a strange woman, [[H2114]] and embrace [[H2263]] the bosom [[H2436]] of a stranger? [[H5237]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] the ways [[H1870]] of man [[H376]] before [[H5227]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and he pondereth [[H6424]] all [[H3605]] his goings. [[H4570]]

### 22
His own iniquities [[H5771]] shall take [[H3920]] the wicked [[H7563]] himself, and he shall be holden [[H8551]] with the cords [[H2256]] of his sins. [[H2403]]

### 23
He [[H1931]] shall die [[H4191]] without [[H369]] instruction; [[H4148]] and in the greatness [[H7230]] of his folly [[H200]] he shall go astray. [[H7686]]
