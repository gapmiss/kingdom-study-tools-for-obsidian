# Proverbs 20

[[Proverbs 19|←]] • [[Proverbs 21|→]]

---

### 1
Wine [[H3196]] a mocker, [[H3887]] strong drink [[H7941]] raging: [[H1993]] and whosoever [[H3605]] is deceived [[H7686]] thereby is not [[H3808]] wise. [[H2449]]

### 2
The fear [[H367]] of a king [[H4428]] as the roaring [[H5099]] of a lion: [[H3715]] provoketh him to anger [[H5674]] sinneth [[H2398]] his own soul. [[H5315]]

### 3
an honour [[H3519]] for a man [[H376]] to cease [[H7674]] from strife: [[H7379]] but every [[H3605]] fool [[H191]] will be meddling. [[H1566]]

### 4
The sluggard [[H6102]] will not [[H3808]] plow [[H2790]] by reason of the cold; [[H2779]] shall he beg [[H7592]] in harvest, [[H7105]] and nothing. [[H7105]]

### 5
Counsel [[H6098]] in the heart [[H3820]] of man [[H376]] deep [[H6013]] water; [[H4325]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] will draw it out. [[H1802]]

### 6
Most [[H7230]] men [[H120]] will proclaim [[H7121]] every one [[H376]] his own goodness: [[H2617]] but a faithful [[H529]] man [[H376]] who [[H4310]] can find? [[H4672]]

### 7
The just [[H6662]] walketh [[H1980]] in his integrity: [[H8537]] his children [[H1121]] blessed [[H835]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 8
A king [[H4428]] that sitteth in [[H3427]] the throne [[H3678]] of judgment [[H1779]] scattereth away [[H2219]] all [[H3605]] evil [[H7451]] with his eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
Who [[H4310]] can say, [[H559]] I have made my heart [[H3820]] clean, [[H2135]] I am pure [[H2891]] from my sin? [[H2403]]

### 10
Divers weights, [[H68]] divers measures, [[H374]] both [[H8147]] of them alike [[H1571]] abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
Even [[H1571]] a child [[H5288]] is known [[H5234]] by his doings, [[H4611]] whether [[H518]] his work [[H6467]] pure, [[H2134]] and whether [[H518]] right. [[H3477]]

### 12
The hearing [[H8085]] ear, [[H241]] and the seeing [[H7200]] eye, [[H5869]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath made [[H6213]] even [[H1571]] both [[H8147]] of them. [[H8147]]

### 13
Love [[H157]] not [[H408]] sleep, [[H8142]] lest [[H6435]] thou come to poverty; [[H3423]] open [[H6491]] thine eyes, [[H5869]] thou shalt be satisfied [[H7646]] with bread. [[H3899]]

### 14
naught, [[H7451]] naught, [[H7451]] saith [[H559]] the buyer: [[H7069]] but when he is gone [[H235]] his way, then [[H227]] he boasteth. [[H1984]]

### 15
There is [[H3426]] gold, [[H2091]] and a multitude [[H7230]] of rubies: [[H6443]] but the lips [[H8193]] of knowledge [[H1847]] a precious [[H3366]] jewel. [[H3627]]

### 16
Take [[H3947]] his garment [[H899]] that [[H3588]] is surety [[H6148]] a stranger: [[H2114]] and take a pledge [[H2254]] of him for [[H1157]] a strange woman. [[H5237]]

### 17
Bread [[H3899]] of deceit [[H8267]] sweet [[H6156]] to a man; [[H376]] but afterwards [[H310]] his mouth [[H6310]] shall be filled [[H4390]] with gravel. [[H2687]]

### 18
purpose [[H4284]] is established [[H3559]] by counsel: [[H6098]] and with good advice [[H8458]] make [[H6213]] war. [[H4421]]

### 19
He that goeth about [[H1980]] a talebearer [[H7400]] revealeth [[H1540]] secrets: [[H5475]] therefore meddle [[H6148]] not [[H3808]] with him that flattereth [[H6601]] with his lips. [[H8193]]

### 20
Whoso curseth [[H7043]] his father [[H1]] or his mother, [[H517]] his lamp [[H5216]] shall be put out [[H1846]] in obscure [[H380]] darkness. [[H2822]]

### 21
An inheritance [[H5159]] gotten hastily [[H973]] at the beginning; [[H7223]] but the end [[H319]] thereof shall not [[H3808]] be blessed. [[H1288]]

### 22
Say [[H559]] not [[H408]] thou, I will recompense [[H7999]] evil; [[H7451]] wait on [[H6960]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he shall save [[H3467]] thee. [[H3467]]

### 23
Divers weights [[H68]] an abomination [[H8441]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] and a false [[H4820]] balance [[H3976]] not [[H3808]] good. [[H2896]]

### 24
Man's [[H1397]] goings [[H4703]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] how [[H4100]] can a man [[H120]] then understand [[H995]] his own way? [[H1870]]

### 25
a snare [[H4170]] to the man [[H120]] devoureth [[H3216]] holy, [[H6944]] and after [[H310]] vows [[H5088]] to make inquiry. [[H1239]]

### 26
A wise [[H2450]] king [[H4428]] scattereth [[H2219]] the wicked, [[H7563]] and bringeth [[H7725]] the wheel [[H212]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 27
The spirit [[H5397]] of man [[H120]] the candle [[H5216]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] searching [[H2664]] all [[H3605]] the inward parts [[H2315]] of the belly. [[H990]]

### 28
Mercy [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] preserve [[H5341]] the king: [[H4428]] and his throne [[H3678]] is upholden [[H5582]] by mercy. [[H2617]]

### 29
The glory [[H8597]] of young men [[H970]] their strength: [[H3581]] and the beauty [[H1926]] of old men [[H2205]] the gray head. [[H7872]]

### 30
The blueness [[H2250]] of a wound [[H6482]] cleanseth away [[H8562]] evil: [[H7451]] so stripes [[H4347]] the inward parts [[H2315]] of the belly. [[H990]]
