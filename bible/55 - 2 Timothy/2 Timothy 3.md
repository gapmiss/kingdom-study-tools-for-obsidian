This [[G5124]] know [[G1097]] also, [[G1161]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] the last [[G2078]] days [[G2250]] perilous [[G5467]] times [[G2540]] shall come. [[G1764]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] men [[G444]] shall be [[G2071]] lovers of their own selves, [[G5367]] covetous, [[G5366]] boasters, [[G213]] proud, [[G5244]] blasphemers, [[G989]] disobedient [[G545]] to parents, [[G1118]] unthankful, [[G884]] unholy, [[G462]]

### 3
Without natural affection, [[G794]] trucebreakers, [[G786]] false accusers, [[G1228]] incontinent, [[G193]] fierce, [[G434]] despisers of those that are good, [[G865]]

### 4
Traitors, [[G4273]] heady, [[G4312]] highminded, [[G5187]] lovers of pleasures [[G5369]] more [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] lovers of God; [[G5377]]

### 5
Having [[G2192]] a form [[G3446]] of godliness, [[G2150]] but [[G1161]] denying [[G720]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] thereof: [[G846]] from turn [[G665]] such [[G5128]] away. [[G665]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] of [[G1537]] this sort [[G5130]] are [[G1526]] they which creep [[G1744]] into [[G1519]] houses, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] lead captive [[G162]]  silly [[G3588]] women [[G1133]] laden [[G4987]] with sins, [[G266]] led away [[G71]] with divers [[G4164]] lusts, [[G1939]]

### 7
Ever [[G3842]] learning, [[G3129]] and [[G2532]] never [[G3368]] able [[G1410]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the knowledge [[G1922]] of the truth. [[G225]]

### 8
Now [[G1161]] as [[G3739]] Jannes [[G2389]] and [[G2532]] Jambres [[G2387]] withstood [[G436]] Moses, [[G3475]] so [[G3779]] these [[G3778]] do [[G436]] also [[G2532]] resist [[G436]] the [[G3588]] truth: [[G225]] men [[G444]] of corrupt [[G2704]] minds, [[G3563]] reprobate [[G96]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 9
But [[G235]] they shall proceed [[G4298]] no [[G3756]] further: [[G1909]] for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] folly [[G454]] shall be [[G2071]] manifest [[G1552]] unto all [[G3956]] as [[G5613]] theirs [[G1565]] also [[G2532]] was. [[G1096]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] thou [[G4771]] hast fully known [[G3877]] my [[G3450]] doctrine, [[G1319]]  manner [[G3588]] of [[G72]] life, [[G72]] purpose, [[G4286]] faith, [[G4102]] longsuffering, [[G3115]] charity, [[G26]] patience, [[G5281]]

### 11
Persecutions, [[G1375]] afflictions, [[G3804]] which [[G3634]] came [[G1096]] unto me [[G3427]] at [[G1722]] Antioch, [[G490]] at [[G1722]] Iconium, [[G2430]] at [[G1722]] Lystra; [[G3082]] what [[G3634]] persecutions [[G1375]] I endured: [[G5297]] but [[G2532]] out of [[G1537]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] delivered [[G4506]] me. [[G3165]]

### 12
Yea, [[G1161]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that will [[G2309]] live [[G2198]] godly [[G2153]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] shall suffer persecution. [[G1377]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] evil [[G4190]] men [[G444]] and [[G2532]] seducers [[G1114]] shall wax [[G4298]] worse and worse, [[G5501]] deceiving, [[G4105]] and [[G2532]] being deceived. [[G4105]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] continue [[G3306]] thou [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] the things which [[G3739]] thou hast learned [[G3129]] and [[G2532]] hast been assured of, [[G4104]] knowing [[G1492]] of [[G3844]] whom [[G5101]] thou hast learned [[G3129]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] from [[G575]] a child [[G1025]] thou hast known [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G2413]] scriptures, [[G1121]] which are able [[G1410]] to make wise [[G4679]] thee [[G4571]] unto [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 16
All [[G3956]] scripture [[G1124]] given by inspiration of God, [[G2315]] and [[G2532]] profitable [[G5624]] for [[G4314]] doctrine, [[G1319]] for [[G4314]] reproof, [[G1650]] for [[G4314]] correction, [[G1882]] for [[G4314]] instruction [[G3809]] in [[G1722]] righteousness: [[G1343]]

### 17
That [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] of may [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] be [[G5600]] perfect, [[G739]] throughly furnished [[G1822]] unto [[G4314]] all [[G3956]] good [[G18]] works. [[G2041]]
