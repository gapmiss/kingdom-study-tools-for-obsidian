### 1
Thou [[G4771]] therefore, [[G3767]] my [[G3450]] son, [[G5043]] be strong [[G1743]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] that is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the things that [[G3739]] thou hast heard [[G191]] of [[G3844]] me [[G1700]] among [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] witnesses, [[G3144]] the same [[G5023]] commit thou [[G3908]] to faithful [[G4103]] men, [[G444]] who [[G3748]] shall be [[G2071]] able to [[G2425]] teach [[G1321]] others [[G2087]] also. [[G2532]]

### 3
Thou [[G4771]] therefore [[G3767]] endure hardness, [[G2553]] as [[G5613]] a good [[G2570]] soldier [[G4757]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 4
No man [[G3762]] that warreth [[G4754]] entangleth himself [[G1707]] the [[G3588]] with of [[G979]] affairs [[G4230]] life; [[G979]] that [[G2443]] he may please [[G700]] him [[G3588]] who hath chosen him to be a soldier. [[G4758]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] also [[G2532]] strive for masteries, [[G118]] not [[G3756]] is he [[G4737]] crowned, [[G4737]] except [[G3361]] he strive [[G118]] lawfully. [[G3545]]

### 6
The husbandman [[G1092]] that laboureth [[G2872]] must [[G1163]] first [[G4412]] be [[G3335]] partaker [[G3335]] of the [[G3588]] fruits. [[G2590]]

### 7
Consider [[G3539]] what [[G3739]] I say; [[G3004]] and [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] give [[G1325]] thee [[G4671]] understanding [[G4907]] in [[G1722]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 8
Remember [[G3421]] Jesus [[G2424]] that was [[G1453]] Christ [[G5547]] of [[G1537]] the seed [[G4690]] of David [[G1138]] raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead [[G3498]] according to [[G2596]] my [[G3450]] gospel: [[G2098]]

### 9
Wherein [[G3739]] I suffer trouble, [[G2553]] as [[G5613]] an evil doer, [[G2557]] unto [[G3360]] bonds; [[G1199]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1210]] bound. [[G1210]]

### 10
Therefore [[G1223]] I endure [[G5278]] all things [[G3956]] for sakes, [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] elect's [[G1588]] that [[G2443]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] may [[G5177]] obtain [[G5177]] the salvation [[G4991]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] with [[G3326]] eternal [[G166]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 11
a faithful [[G4103]] saying: [[G3056]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] we be dead with [[G4880]] also [[G2532]] we shall with [[G4800]] live [[G4800]]

### 12
If [[G1487]] we suffer, [[G5278]] also [[G2532]] we shall with [[G4821]] reign [[G4821]] if [[G1487]] we deny [[G720]] he also [[G2548]] will deny [[G720]] us: [[G2248]]

### 13
If [[G1487]] we believe not, [[G569]] he [[G1565]] abideth [[G3306]] faithful: [[G4103]] he cannot [[G1410]] deny [[G720]] himself. [[G1438]]

### 14
Of these things [[G5023]] put in remembrance, [[G5279]] charging [[G1263]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] that they strive about words [[G3054]] not [[G3361]] to [[G1519]] no [[G3762]] profit, [[G5539]] to [[G1909]] the subverting [[G2692]] the [[G3588]] of [[G191]] hearers. [[G191]]

### 15
Study [[G4704]] to shew [[G3936]] thyself [[G4572]] approved [[G1384]] unto [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] a workman [[G2040]] that needeth not to be ashamed, [[G422]] rightly dividing [[G3718]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G225]] truth. [[G225]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] shun [[G4026]] profane [[G952]] vain babblings: [[G2757]] for [[G1063]] they will increase [[G4298]] unto [[G1909]] more [[G4119]] ungodliness. [[G763]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] their [[G846]] word [[G3056]] will [[G2192]] eat [[G3542]] doth [[G5613]] as [[G5613]] a canker: [[G1044]] of whom [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] Hymenaeus [[G5211]] and [[G2532]] Philetus; [[G5372]]

### 18
Who [[G3748]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] have erred, [[G795]] saying [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] that is [[G1096]] resurrection [[G386]] past [[G1096]] already; [[G2235]] and [[G2532]] overthrow [[G396]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of some. [[G5100]]

### 19
Nevertheless [[G3305]] the [[G3588]] foundation [[G2310]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] standeth [[G2476]] sure, [[G4731]] having [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] seal, [[G4973]] The [[G1097]] Lord [[G2962]] knoweth [[G1097]] that are [[G5607]] his. [[G846]] And, [[G2532]] Let [[G868]] every [[G93]] one [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nameth [[G3687]] that [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Christ [[G5547]] depart [[G868]] from [[G575]] iniquity. [[G93]] them [[G3588]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] a great [[G3173]] house [[G3614]] there are [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] vessels [[G4632]] of gold [[G5552]] and [[G2532]] of silver, [[G693]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] of wood [[G3585]] and [[G2532]] of earth; [[G3749]] and [[G2532]] some [[G3739]] to [[G1519]] honour, [[G5092]] and [[G1161]] some [[G3739]] to [[G1519]] dishonour. [[G819]]

### 21
If [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] therefore [[G3767]] purge [[G1571]] himself [[G1438]] from [[G575]] these, [[G5130]] he shall be [[G2071]] a vessel [[G4632]] unto [[G1519]] honour, [[G5092]] sanctified, [[G37]] and [[G2532]] meet for use, [[G2173]] the [[G3588]] master's [[G1203]] prepared [[G2090]] unto [[G1519]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work. [[G2041]]

### 22
Flee [[G5343]] also [[G1161]] youthful [[G3512]] lusts: [[G1939]] but [[G1161]] follow [[G1377]] righteousness, [[G1343]] faith, [[G4102]] charity, [[G26]] peace, [[G1515]] with [[G3326]] them that call on [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] out of [[G1537]] a pure [[G2513]] heart. [[G2588]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] foolish [[G3474]] and [[G2532]] unlearned [[G521]] questions [[G2214]] avoid, [[G3868]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] they do gender [[G1080]] strifes. [[G3163]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] the servant [[G1401]] of the Lord [[G2962]] must [[G1163]] not [[G3756]] strive; [[G3164]] but [[G235]] be [[G1511]] gentle [[G2261]] unto [[G4314]] all [[G3956]] apt to teach, [[G1317]] patient, [[G420]]

### 25
In [[G1722]] meekness [[G4236]] instructing [[G3811]] those that oppose themselves; [[G475]] if peradventure [[G3379]] God [[G2316]] will give [[G1325]] them [[G846]] repentance [[G3341]] to [[G1519]] the acknowledging [[G1922]] of the truth; [[G225]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] they may recover themselves [[G366]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] snare [[G3803]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1228]] devil, [[G1228]] who are taken captive [[G2221]] by [[G5259]] him [[G846]] at [[G1519]] his [[G1565]] will. [[G2307]]
