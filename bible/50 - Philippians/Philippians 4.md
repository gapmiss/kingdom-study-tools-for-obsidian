### 1
Therefore, [[G5620]] my [[G3450]] brethren [[G80]] dearly beloved [[G27]] and [[G2532]] longed for, [[G1973]] my [[G3450]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] crown, [[G4735]] so [[G3779]] stand fast [[G4739]] in [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] dearly beloved. [[G27]]

### 2
I beseech [[G3870]] Euodias, [[G2136]] and [[G2532]] beseech [[G3870]] Syntyche, [[G4941]] the [[G3588]] that they be of [[G5426]] same [[G846]] mind [[G5426]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] I entreat [[G2065]] thee [[G4571]] also, [[G2532]] true [[G1103]] yokefellow, [[G4805]] help [[G4815]] those women [[G846]] which [[G3748]] laboured [[G4866]] with [[G3427]] me [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] with [[G3326]] Clement [[G2815]] also, [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] other [[G3062]] my [[G3450]] fellowlabourers, [[G4904]] whose [[G3739]] names [[G3686]] in [[G1722]] the book [[G976]] of life. [[G2222]]

### 4
Rejoice [[G5463]] in [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] alway: [[G3842]] again [[G3825]] I say, [[G2046]] Rejoice. [[G5463]]

### 5
your [[G5216]] Let be [[G1097]] moderation [[G1933]] known [[G1097]] all [[G3956]] unto [[G444]] men. [[G444]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] at hand. [[G1451]]

### 6
Be careful [[G3309]] for nothing; [[G3367]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] every thing [[G3956]]  by [[G3588]] prayer [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] supplication [[G1162]] with [[G3326]] thanksgiving [[G2169]] your [[G5216]] let be made [[G1107]] requests [[G155]] known [[G1107]] unto [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] peace [[G1515]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] which passeth [[G5242]] all [[G3956]] understanding, [[G3563]] shall keep [[G5432]] your [[G5216]] hearts [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] minds [[G5216]] through [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 8
Finally, [[G3063]] brethren, [[G80]] whatsoever things [[G3745]] are [[G2076]] true, [[G227]] whatsoever things [[G3745]] honest, [[G4586]] whatsoever things [[G3745]] just, [[G1342]] whatsoever things [[G3745]] pure, [[G53]] whatsoever things [[G3745]] lovely, [[G4375]] whatsoever things [[G3745]] of good report; [[G2163]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] virtue, [[G703]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] praise, [[G1868]] think on [[G3049]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 9
Those things, [[G5023]] which [[G3739]] both [[G2532]] ye have [[G3129]] learned, [[G3129]] and [[G2532]] received, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] heard, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] seen [[G1492]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] do: [[G4238]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G1515]] peace [[G1515]] shall be [[G2071]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G5216]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] I rejoiced [[G5463]] in [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] greatly, [[G3171]] that [[G3754]] now [[G2235]] at the last [[G4218]] your care [[G5426]] of [[G5228]] me [[G1700]] hath flourished again; [[G330]] wherein [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] ye were [[G5426]] careful, [[G5426]] but [[G1161]] ye lacked opportunity. [[G170]]

### 11
Not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] I speak [[G3004]] in respect of [[G2596]] want: [[G5304]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] have learned, [[G3129]] in [[G1722]] whatsoever state [[G3739]] I am, [[G1510]] to be [[G1511]] content. [[G842]]

### 12
I know how [[G1492]] both [[G2532]] to be abased, [[G5013]] and [[G2532]] I know how [[G1492]] to abound: [[G4052]] every where [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] all things [[G3956]] I am instructed [[G3453]] both [[G2532]] to be full [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] to be hungry, [[G3983]] both [[G2532]] to abound [[G4052]] and [[G2532]] to suffer need. [[G5302]]

### 13
I can do [[G2480]] all things [[G3956]] through [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] which [[G3588]] strengtheneth [[G1743]] me. [[G3165]]

### 14
Notwithstanding [[G4133]] well [[G2573]] ye have [[G4160]] done, [[G4160]] that ye did communicate [[G4790]] with [[G3450]] my [[G3450]] affliction. [[G2347]]

### 15
Now [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] Philippians [[G5374]] know [[G1492]] also, [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] the beginning [[G746]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel, [[G2098]] when [[G3753]] I departed [[G1831]] from [[G575]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] no [[G3762]] church [[G1577]] communicated with [[G2841]] me [[G3427]] as [[G1519]] concerning [[G3056]] giving [[G1394]] and [[G2532]] receiving, [[G3028]] but [[G3361]] ye [[G5210]] only. [[G3441]]

### 16
For [[G3754]] even [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Thessalonica [[G2332]] ye sent [[G3992]] once [[G530]] and [[G2532]] again [[G1364]] unto [[G1519]] my [[G3427]] necessity. [[G5532]]

### 17
Not [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] I desire [[G1934]]  a [[G3588]] gift: [[G1390]] but [[G235]] I desire [[G1934]] fruit [[G3588]]  that may [[G2590]] abound [[G4121]] to [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] account. [[G3056]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] I have [[G568]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] abound: [[G4052]] I am full, [[G4137]] having received [[G1209]] of [[G3844]] Epaphroditus [[G1891]] the things [[G3588]] from [[G3844]] you, [[G5216]] an odour [[G3744]] of a sweet smell, [[G2175]] a sacrifice [[G2378]] acceptable, [[G1184]] wellpleasing [[G2101]] to [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] my [[G3450]] God [[G2316]] shall supply [[G4137]] all [[G3956]] your [[G5216]] need [[G5532]] according to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] riches [[G4149]] in [[G1722]] glory [[G1391]] by [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 20
Now [[G1161]] unto God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Father [[G3962]] glory [[G1391]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G3588]]  and ever. [[G3588]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 21
Salute [[G782]] every [[G3956]] saint [[G40]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] The [[G3588]] brethren which are [[G80]] with [[G4862]] me [[G1698]] greet [[G782]] you. [[G5209]]

### 22
All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] salute [[G782]] you, [[G5209]] chiefly [[G3122]] they [[G3588]] that are of [[G1537]] Caesar's [[G2541]] household. [[G3614]]

### 23
The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]] Amen. [[G281]]
