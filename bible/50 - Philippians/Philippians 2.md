### 1
If [[G1487]] therefore [[G3767]] any [[G5100]] consolation [[G3874]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] comfort [[G3890]] of love, [[G26]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] fellowship [[G2842]] of the Spirit, [[G4151]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] bowels [[G4698]] and [[G2532]] mercies, [[G3628]]

### 2
Fulfil ye [[G4137]] my [[G3450]] joy, [[G5479]] that [[G2443]] ye be [[G5426]] likeminded, [[G5426]] having [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] love, [[G26]] of one accord, [[G4861]] of [[G5426]] one [[G1520]] mind. [[G5426]]

### 3
nothing [[G3367]] through [[G2596]] strife [[G2052]] or [[G2228]] vainglory; [[G2754]] but [[G235]]  in lowliness of [[G3588]] mind [[G5012]] each other [[G240]] let [[G2233]] esteem [[G2233]] better [[G5242]] than themselves. [[G1438]]

### 4
Look [[G4648]] not [[G3361]] every man [[G1538]] on his own things, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] every man [[G1538]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] on things of [[G2087]] others. [[G2087]]

### 5
Let [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] mind be [[G5426]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] which was [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus: [[G2424]]

### 6
Who, [[G3739]] being [[G5225]] in [[G1722]] the form [[G3444]] of God, [[G2316]] thought it [[G2233]] not [[G3756]] robbery [[G725]] to be [[G1511]] equal [[G2470]] with God: [[G2316]]

### 7
But [[G235]] himself [[G1438]] made of no [[G2758]] reputation, [[G2758]] and took upon him [[G2983]] the form [[G3444]] of a servant, [[G1401]] and was made [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the likeness [[G3667]] of men: [[G444]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] being found [[G2147]] in fashion [[G4976]] as [[G5613]] a man, [[G444]] he humbled [[G5013]] himself, [[G1438]] and became [[G1096]] obedient [[G5255]] unto [[G3360]] death, [[G2288]] even [[G1161]] the death [[G2288]] of the cross. [[G4716]]

### 9
Wherefore [[G1352]] God [[G2316]] also [[G2532]] hath highly exalted [[G5251]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] given [[G5483]] him [[G846]] a name [[G3686]] which [[G3588]] is [[G5228]] above [[G5228]] every [[G3956]] name: [[G3686]]

### 10
That [[G2443]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] every [[G3956]] knee [[G1119]] should bow, [[G2578]] of in heaven, [[G2032]] and [[G2532]] in earth, [[G1919]] and [[G2532]] under the earth; [[G2709]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] tongue [[G1100]] should confess [[G1843]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] Lord, [[G2962]] to [[G1519]] the glory [[G1391]] of God [[G2316]] the Father. [[G3962]]

### 12
Wherefore, [[G5620]] my [[G3450]] beloved, [[G27]] as [[G2531]] always [[G3842]] ye have [[G5219]] obeyed, [[G5219]] not [[G3361]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] presence [[G3952]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] now [[G3568]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] absence, [[G666]] work out [[G2716]] your own [[G1438]] salvation [[G4991]] with [[G3326]] fear [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] trembling. [[G5156]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] worketh [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] both [[G2532]] to will [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] to do [[G1754]] of [[G5228]] good pleasure. [[G2107]]

### 14
Do [[G4160]] all things [[G3956]] without [[G5565]] murmurings [[G1112]] and [[G2532]] disputings: [[G1261]]

### 15
That [[G2443]] ye may be [[G1096]] blameless [[G273]] and [[G2532]] harmless, [[G185]] the sons [[G5043]] of God, [[G2316]] without rebuke, [[G298]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of a [[G1074]] crooked [[G4646]] and [[G2532]] perverse [[G1294]] nation, [[G1074]] among [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] ye shine [[G5316]] as [[G5613]] lights [[G5458]] in [[G1722]] the world; [[G2889]]

### 16
Holding forth [[G1907]] the word [[G3056]] of life; [[G2222]] that [[G1519]] I [[G1698]] may rejoice [[G2745]] in [[G1519]] the day [[G2250]] of Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] I have [[G5143]] run [[G5143]] in [[G1519]] vain, [[G2756]] neither [[G3761]] laboured [[G2872]] in [[G1519]] vain. [[G2756]]

### 17
Yea, [[G235]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] I be offered [[G4689]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sacrifice [[G2378]] and [[G2532]] service [[G3009]] of [[G4102]] your [[G5216]] faith, [[G4102]] I joy, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] rejoice [[G4796]] with [[G5213]] you [[G5213]] all. [[G3956]]

### 18
For [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] same cause [[G846]] also [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] do [[G5463]] joy, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] rejoice with [[G4796]] me. [[G3427]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] I trust [[G1679]] in [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] to send [[G3992]] Timotheus [[G5095]] shortly [[G5030]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] I also [[G2504]] may be of good comfort, [[G2174]] when I know [[G1097]] your [[G5216]] state. [[G4012]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] I have [[G2192]] no man [[G3762]] likeminded, [[G2473]] who [[G3748]] naturally [[G1104]] will for [[G3309]] care [[G3309]] your [[G5216]] state. [[G4012]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] seek [[G2212]] their own, [[G1438]] not [[G3756]] things [[G3588]] the which [[G3588]] are [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ's. [[G5547]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] ye know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] proof [[G1382]] of him, [[G846]] that, [[G3754]] as [[G5613]] a son [[G5043]] with the father, [[G3962]] he hath served [[G1398]] with [[G4862]] me [[G1698]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]]

### 23
Him [[G5126]] therefore [[G3767]] I hope [[G1679]] to send [[G3992]] presently, [[G1824]] so soon as [[G5613]] I shall see [[G542]] how it will go with [[G4012]] me. [[G1691]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] I trust [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] that [[G3754]] also [[G2532]] I shall [[G2064]] myself [[G846]] come [[G2064]] shortly. [[G5030]]

### 25
Yet [[G1161]] I supposed it [[G2233]] necessary [[G316]] to send [[G3992]] to [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] Epaphroditus, [[G1891]] my [[G3450]] brother, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] companion in labour, [[G4904]] and [[G2532]] fellow soldier, [[G4961]] but [[G1161]] your [[G5216]] messenger, [[G652]] and [[G2532]] he that ministered [[G3011]] to [[G5532]] my [[G3450]] wants. [[G5532]]

### 26
For [[G1894]]  he [[G2258]] longed after [[G1971]] you [[G5209]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] was full of heaviness, [[G85]] because that [[G1360]] ye had heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] he had been sick. [[G770]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] indeed [[G2532]] he was sick [[G770]] nigh unto [[G3897]] death: [[G2288]] but [[G235]] God [[G2316]] had mercy on [[G1653]] him; [[G846]] and [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] on him [[G846]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] on me [[G1691]] also, [[G2532]] lest [[G3361]] I should have [[G2192]] sorrow [[G3077]] upon [[G1909]] sorrow. [[G3077]]

### 28
I sent [[G3992]] him [[G846]] therefore [[G3767]] the more carefully, [[G4708]] that, [[G2443]] when ye see [[G1492]] him [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] ye may rejoice, [[G5463]] and that I [[G2504]] may be [[G5600]] the less sorrowful. [[G253]]

### 29
Receive [[G4327]] him [[G846]] therefore [[G3767]] in [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] gladness; [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] hold [[G2192]] such [[G5108]] in reputation: [[G1784]]

### 30
Because [[G3754]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] of [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] he was nigh [[G1448]] unto [[G3360]] death, [[G2288]] not regarding [[G3851]]  his [[G3588]] life, [[G5590]] to [[G2443]] supply [[G378]] your [[G5216]] lack [[G5303]] of service [[G3009]] toward [[G4314]] me.
