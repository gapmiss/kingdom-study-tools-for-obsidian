### 1
Finally, [[G3063]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] rejoice [[G5463]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]] To write [[G1125]] the [[G3588]] same things [[G846]] to you, [[G5213]] to me [[G1698]] indeed [[G3303]] not [[G3756]] grievous, [[G3636]] but [[G1161]] for you [[G5213]] safe. [[G804]]

### 2
Beware [[G991]] of [[G2965]] dogs, [[G2965]] beware [[G991]] of [[G2040]] evil [[G2556]] workers, [[G2040]] beware [[G991]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2699]] concision. [[G2699]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] we [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] the [[G3588]] circumcision, [[G4061]] which worship [[G3000]] God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] rejoice [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] have [[G3982]] confidence [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] the flesh. [[G4561]]

### 4
Though [[G2539]] I [[G1473]] might [[G2192]] also [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] confidence [[G4006]] in [[G1722]] the flesh. [[G4561]] If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] other [[G243]] thinketh [[G1380]] that he hath whereof he might trust [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] the flesh, [[G4561]] I [[G1473]] more: [[G3123]]

### 5
Circumcised [[G4061]] the eighth day, [[G3637]] of [[G1537]] the stock [[G1085]] of Israel, [[G2474]] the tribe [[G5443]] of Benjamin, [[G958]] an Hebrew [[G1445]] of [[G1537]] the Hebrews; [[G1445]] as touching [[G2596]] the law, [[G3551]] a Pharisee; [[G5330]]

### 6
Concerning [[G2596]] zeal, [[G2205]] persecuting [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] church; [[G1577]] touching [[G2596]] the righteousness [[G1343]] which [[G3588]] is [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the law, [[G3551]] blameless. [[G273]]

### 7
But [[G235]] what things [[G3748]] were [[G2258]] gain [[G2771]] to me, [[G3427]] those [[G5023]] I counted [[G2233]] loss [[G2209]] for [[G1223]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 8
Yea [[G235]] doubtless, [[G3304]] and [[G2532]] I count [[G2233]] all things [[G3956]] loss [[G2209]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] excellency [[G5242]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1108]] knowledge [[G1108]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] my [[G3450]] Lord: [[G2962]] for [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] I have suffered the loss of [[G2210]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] do count them [[G2233]] dung, [[G4657]] that [[G2443]] I may win [[G2770]] Christ, [[G5547]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] be found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] not [[G3361]] having [[G2192]] mine own [[G1699]] righteousness, [[G1343]] which [[G3588]] is [[G1537]] of [[G1537]] the law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] that which [[G3588]] is [[G1223]] through [[G1223]] the faith [[G4102]] of Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] is [[G1537]] which [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1909]] faith: [[G4102]]

### 10
That [[G3588]] I may know [[G1097]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of [[G386]] his [[G846]] resurrection, [[G386]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fellowship [[G2842]] of [[G3804]] his [[G846]] sufferings, [[G3804]] being made conformable unto [[G4833]] his [[G846]] death; [[G2288]]

### 11
If [[G1487]] by any means [[G4459]] I might attain [[G2658]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] resurrection of [[G1815]] the [[G3588]] dead. [[G3498]]

### 12
Not [[G3756]] as though [[G3754]] already [[G2235]] I had [[G2983]] attained, [[G2983]] either [[G2228]] already [[G2235]] were [[G5048]] perfect: [[G5048]] but [[G1161]] I follow after, [[G1377]] if [[G1487]] that [[G2532]] I may apprehend [[G2638]] that for [[G1909]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] I am apprehended [[G2638]] of [[G5259]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 13
Brethren, [[G80]] I [[G1473]] count [[G3049]] not [[G3756]] myself [[G1683]] to have apprehended: [[G2638]] but [[G1161]] one thing [[G1520]] forgetting [[G1950]] those things which are [[G3588]] behind, [[G3694]] and [[G1161]] reaching forth [[G1901]]  unto those things which [[G3588]] are [[G1715]] before, [[G1715]]

### 14
I press [[G1377]] toward [[G2596]] the mark [[G4649]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] prize of [[G1017]] the [[G3588]] high [[G507]] calling [[G2821]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 15
therefore, [[G3767]] Let us be [[G5426]] as many as [[G3745]] be perfect, [[G5046]] thus [[G5124]] minded: [[G5426]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] in any thing [[G5100]] otherwise [[G2088]] ye be [[G5426]] minded, [[G5426]] God [[G2316]] shall reveal [[G601]] even [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 16
Nevertheless, [[G4133]] whereto [[G3739]] we have already attained, [[G5348]] let us walk [[G4748]] the [[G3588]] by [[G2583]] same [[G846]] rule, [[G2583]] let us mind [[G5426]] the [[G3588]] same thing. [[G846]]

### 17
Brethren, [[G80]] be [[G1096]] followers together [[G4831]] of me, [[G3450]] and [[G2532]] mark [[G4648]] them which walk [[G4043]] so as [[G3779]]  ye for [[G2531]] have [[G2192]] us [[G2248]] an ensample. [[G5179]]

### 18
(For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] walk, [[G4043]] of whom [[G3739]] I have told [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] often, [[G4178]] and [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] tell you [[G3004]] even [[G2532]] weeping, [[G2799]] the [[G3588]] enemies [[G2190]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4716]] cross [[G4716]] of [[G5547]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 19
Whose [[G3739]] end [[G5056]] destruction, [[G684]] whose [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] belly, [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] shame, [[G152]] who [[G3588]] mind [[G5426]] earthly things.) [[G1919]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] our [[G2257]] conversation [[G4175]] is [[G5225]] in [[G1722]] heaven; [[G3772]] from [[G1537]] whence [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] we for the [[G4990]] look [[G553]] Saviour, [[G4990]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 21
Who [[G3739]] shall change [[G3345]] our [[G2257]] vile [[G5014]] body, [[G4983]] that [[G1519]] it [[G846]] may be [[G1096]] fashioned like [[G4832]] unto [[G4832]] his [[G846]] glorious [[G1391]] body, [[G4983]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] working [[G1753]] whereby [[G846]] he [[G846]] is able [[G1410]] even [[G2532]] to subdue [[G5293]] all things [[G3956]] unto himself.
