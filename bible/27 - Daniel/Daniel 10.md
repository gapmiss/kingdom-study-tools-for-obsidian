### 1
In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia [[H6539]] a thing [[H1697]] was revealed [[H1540]] unto Daniel, [[H1840]] whose [[H834]] name [[H8034]] was called [[H7121]] Belteshazzar; [[H1095]] and the thing [[H1697]] true, [[H571]] but the time appointed [[H6635]] long: [[H1419]] and he understood [[H995]] the thing, [[H1697]] and had understanding [[H998]] of the vision. [[H4758]]

### 2
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] I [[H589]] Daniel [[H1840]] was [[H1961]] mourning [[H56]] three [[H7969]] full [[H3117]] weeks. [[H7620]]

### 3
I ate [[H398]] no [[H3808]] pleasant [[H2530]] bread, [[H3899]] neither [[H3808]] came [[H935]] flesh [[H1320]] nor wine [[H3196]] in [[H413]] my mouth, [[H6310]] neither [[H3808]] did I anoint [[H5480]] myself at all, [[H5480]] till [[H5704]] three [[H7969]] whole [[H3117]] weeks [[H7620]] were fulfilled. [[H4390]]

### 4
And in the four [[H702]] and twentieth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] as I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] by [[H5921]] the side [[H3027]] of the great [[H1419]] river, [[H5104]] which [[H1931]] Hiddekel; [[H2313]]

### 5
Then I lifted up [[H5375]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] a certain [[H259]] man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] whose loins [[H4975]] girded [[H2296]] with fine gold [[H3800]] of Uphaz: [[H210]]

### 6
His body [[H1472]] also like the beryl, [[H8658]] and his face [[H6440]] as the appearance [[H4758]] of lightning, [[H1300]] and his eyes [[H5869]] as lamps [[H3940]] of fire, [[H784]] and his arms [[H2220]] and his feet [[H4772]] like in colour [[H5869]] to polished [[H7044]] brass, [[H5178]] and the voice [[H6963]] of his words [[H1697]] like the voice [[H6963]] of a multitude. [[H1995]]

### 7
And I [[H589]] Daniel [[H1840]] alone [[H905]] saw [[H7200]] the vision: [[H4759]] for the men [[H582]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] me saw [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] the vision; [[H4759]] but [[H61]] a great [[H1419]] quaking [[H2731]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] them, so that they fled [[H1272]] to hide [[H2244]] themselves. [[H2244]]

### 8
Therefore I [[H589]] was left alone, [[H7604]] and saw [[H7200]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] vision, [[H4759]] and there remained [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] strength [[H3581]] in me: for my comeliness [[H1935]] was turned [[H2015]] in [[H5921]] me into corruption, [[H4889]] and I retained [[H6113]] no [[H3808]] strength. [[H3581]]

### 9
Yet heard [[H8085]]  I [[H853]] the voice [[H6963]] of his words: [[H1697]] and when I heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of his words, [[H1697]] then was [[H1961]] I [[H589]] in a deep sleep [[H7290]] on [[H5921]] my face, [[H6440]] and my face [[H6440]] toward the ground. [[H776]]

### 10
And, behold, [[H2009]] an hand [[H3027]] touched [[H5060]] me, which set [[H5128]] me upon [[H5921]] my knees [[H1290]] and the palms [[H3709]] of my hands. [[H3027]]

### 11
And he said [[H559]] unto me, [[H413]] O Daniel, [[H1840]] a man [[H376]] greatly beloved, [[H2530]] understand [[H995]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee, and stand [[H5975]] upright: [[H5977]] for [[H3588]] unto [[H413]] thee am I now [[H6258]] sent. [[H7971]] And when he had spoken [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] unto [[H5973]] me, I stood [[H5975]] trembling. [[H7460]]

### 12
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, Fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] Daniel: [[H1840]] for [[H3588]] from [[H4480]] the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] thou didst set [[H5414]] thine heart [[H3820]] to understand, [[H995]] and to chasten thyself [[H6031]] before [[H6440]] thy God, [[H430]] thy words [[H1697]] were heard, [[H8085]] and I [[H589]] am come [[H935]] for thy words. [[H1697]]

### 13
But the prince [[H8269]] of the kingdom [[H4438]] of Persia [[H6539]] withstood [[H5975]] me one [[H259]] and twenty [[H6242]] days: [[H3117]] but, lo, [[H2009]] Michael, [[H4317]] one [[H259]] of the chief [[H7223]] princes, [[H8269]] came [[H935]] to help [[H5826]] me; and I [[H589]] remained [[H3498]] there [[H8033]] with [[H681]] the kings [[H4428]] of Persia. [[H6539]]

### 14
Now I am come [[H935]] to make thee understand [[H995]] what [[H834]] shall befall [[H7136]] thy people [[H5971]] in the latter [[H319]] days: [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] yet [[H5750]] the vision [[H2377]] for days. [[H3117]]

### 15
And when he had spoken [[H1696]] such [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H5973]] me, I set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] toward the ground, [[H776]] and I became dumb. [[H481]]

### 16
And, behold, [[H2009]] like the similitude [[H1823]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] touched [[H5060]] my lips: [[H8193]] then I opened [[H6605]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and spake, [[H1696]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him that stood [[H5975]] before [[H5048]] me, O my lord, [[H113]] by the vision [[H4759]] my sorrows [[H6735]] are turned [[H2015]] upon [[H5921]] me, and I have retained [[H6113]] no [[H3808]] strength. [[H3581]]

### 17
For how [[H1963]] can [[H3201]] the servant [[H5650]] of this [[H2088]] my lord [[H113]] talk [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] this [[H2088]] my lord? [[H113]] for as for me, [[H589]] straightway [[H6258]] there remained [[H5975]] no [[H3808]] strength [[H3581]] in me, neither [[H3808]] is there breath [[H5397]] left [[H7604]] in me. [[H7604]]

### 18
Then there came again [[H3254]] and touched [[H5060]] me like the appearance [[H4758]] of a man, [[H120]] and he strengthened [[H2388]] me, [[H2388]]

### 19
And said, [[H559]] O man [[H376]] greatly beloved, [[H2530]] fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] peace [[H7965]] unto thee, be strong, [[H2388]] yea, be strong. [[H2388]] And when he had spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H5973]] me, I was strengthened, [[H2388]] and said, [[H559]] Let my lord [[H113]] speak; [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] thou hast strengthened [[H2388]] me. [[H2388]]

### 20
Then said [[H559]] he, Knowest [[H3045]] thou wherefore [[H4100]] I come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee? and now [[H6258]] will I return [[H7725]] to fight [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] the prince [[H8269]] of Persia: [[H6539]] and when I [[H589]] am gone forth, [[H3318]] lo, [[H2009]] the prince [[H8269]] of Grecia [[H3120]] shall come. [[H935]]

### 21
But [[H61]] I will shew [[H5046]]  thee [[H853]] that which is noted [[H7559]] in the scripture [[H3791]] of truth: [[H571]] and none [[H259]] that holdeth [[H2388]] with [[H5973]] me in [[H5921]] these things, [[H428]] but [[H3588]] Michael [[H4317]] your prince. [[H8269]]
