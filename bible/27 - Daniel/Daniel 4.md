### 1
Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king, [[H4430]] unto all [[H3606]] people, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and languages, [[H3961]] that [[H1768]] dwell [[H1753]] in all [[H3606]] the earth; [[H772]] Peace [[H8001]] be multiplied [[H7680]] unto you. [[H7680]]

### 2
I thought [[H6925]] it good [[H8232]] to shew [[H2324]] the signs [[H852]] and wonders [[H8540]] that [[H1768]] the high [[H5943]] God [[H426]] hath wrought [[H5648]] toward [[H5974]] me. [[H5974]]

### 3
How [[H4101]] great [[H7260]] his signs! [[H852]] and how [[H4101]] mighty [[H8624]] his wonders! [[H8540]] his kingdom [[H4437]] an everlasting [[H5957]] kingdom, [[H4437]] and his dominion [[H7985]] from [[H5974]] generation [[H1859]] to generation. [[H1859]]

### 4
I [[H576]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] was [[H1934]] at rest [[H7954]] in mine house, [[H1005]] and flourishing [[H7487]] in my palace: [[H1965]]

### 5
I saw [[H2370]] a dream [[H2493]] which made me afraid, [[H1763]] and the thoughts [[H2031]] upon [[H5922]] my bed [[H4903]] and the visions [[H2376]] of my head [[H7217]] troubled [[H927]] me. [[H927]]

### 6
Therefore [[H4481]] made I [[H7761]] a decree [[H2942]] to bring in [[H5954]] all [[H3606]] the wise [[H2445]] of Babylon [[H895]] before me, [[H6925]] that [[H1768]] they might make known [[H3046]] unto me the interpretation [[H6591]] of the dream. [[H2493]]

### 7
Then [[H116]] came in [[H5954]] the magicians, [[H2749]] the astrologers, [[H826]] the Chaldeans, [[H3779]] and the soothsayers: [[H1505]] and I [[H576]] told [[H560]] the dream [[H2493]] before [[H6925]] them; but they did not [[H3809]] make known [[H3046]] unto me the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof. [[H6591]]

### 8
But at [[H5705]] the last [[H318]] Daniel [[H1841]] came in [[H5954]] before me, [[H6925]] whose [[H1768]] name [[H8036]] Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] according to the name [[H8036]] of my god, [[H426]] and in whom [[H1768]] the spirit [[H7308]] of the holy [[H6922]] gods: [[H426]] and before [[H6925]] him I told [[H560]] the dream, [[H2493]]

### 9
O Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] master [[H7229]] of the magicians, [[H2749]] because [[H1768]] I [[H576]] know [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the spirit [[H7308]] of the holy [[H6922]] gods [[H426]] in thee, and no [[H3606]] secret [[H7328]] troubleth [[H598]] thee, tell [[H560]] me the visions [[H2376]] of my dream [[H2493]] that [[H1768]] I have seen, [[H2370]] and the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof. [[H6591]]

### 10
Thus the visions [[H2376]] of mine head [[H7217]] in [[H5922]] my bed; [[H4903]] I saw, [[H1934]] and behold [[H431]] a tree [[H363]] in the midst [[H1459]] of the earth, [[H772]] and the height [[H7314]] thereof great. [[H7690]]

### 11
The tree [[H363]] grew, [[H7236]] and was strong, [[H8631]] and the height [[H7314]] thereof reached [[H4291]] unto heaven, [[H8065]] and the sight [[H2379]] thereof to the end [[H5491]] of all [[H3606]] the earth: [[H772]]

### 12
The leaves [[H6074]] thereof fair, [[H8209]] and the fruit [[H4]] thereof much, [[H7690]] and in it meat [[H4203]] for all: [[H3606]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field [[H1251]] had shadow [[H2927]] under [[H8460]] it, and the fowls [[H6853]] of the heaven [[H8065]] dwelt [[H1753]] in the boughs [[H6056]] thereof, and all [[H3606]] flesh [[H1321]] was fed [[H2110]] of it. [[H4481]]

### 13
I saw [[H1934]] in the visions [[H2376]] of my head [[H7217]] upon [[H5922]] my bed, [[H4903]] and, behold, [[H431]] a watcher [[H5894]] and an holy one [[H6922]] came down [[H5182]] from [[H4481]] heaven; [[H8065]]

### 14
He cried [[H7123]] aloud, [[H2429]] and said [[H560]] thus, [[H3652]] Hew down [[H1414]] the tree, [[H363]] and cut off [[H7113]] his branches, [[H6056]] shake off [[H5426]] his leaves, [[H6074]] and scatter [[H921]] his fruit: [[H4]] let the beasts [[H2423]] get away [[H5111]] from [[H4481]] under it, [[H8479]] and the fowls [[H6853]] from [[H4481]] his branches: [[H6056]]

### 15
Nevertheless [[H1297]] leave [[H7662]] the stump [[H6136]] of his roots [[H8330]] in the earth, [[H772]] even with a band [[H613]] of [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] and brass, [[H5174]] in the tender grass [[H1883]] of [[H1768]] the field; [[H1251]] and let it be wet [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven, [[H8065]] and his portion [[H2508]] with [[H5974]] the beasts [[H2423]] in the grass [[H6211]] of the earth: [[H772]]

### 16
Let his heart [[H3825]] be changed [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] man's, [[H606]] and let a beast's [[H2423]] heart [[H3825]] be given [[H3052]] unto him; and let seven [[H7655]] times [[H5732]] pass [[H2499]] over [[H5922]] him. [[H5922]]

### 17
This matter [[H6600]] by the decree [[H1510]] of the watchers, [[H5894]] and the demand [[H7595]] by the word [[H3983]] of the holy ones: [[H6922]] to [[H5705]] the intent [[H1701]] that [[H1768]] the living [[H2417]] may know [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the most High [[H5943]] ruleth [[H7990]] in the kingdom [[H4437]] of men, [[H606]] and giveth [[H5415]] it to whomsoever [[H4479]] he will, [[H6634]] and setteth up [[H6966]] over [[H5922]] it the basest [[H8215]] of men. [[H606]]

### 18
This [[H1836]] dream [[H2493]] I [[H576]] king [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] have seen. [[H2370]] Now thou, [[H607]] O Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] declare [[H560]] the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof, forasmuch as [[H6903]] all [[H3606]] the wise [[H2445]] of my kingdom [[H4437]] are not [[H3809]] able [[H3202]] to make known [[H3046]] unto me the interpretation: [[H6591]] but thou [[H607]] able; [[H3546]] for [[H1768]] the spirit [[H7308]] of the holy [[H6922]] gods [[H426]] in thee. [[H426]]

### 19
Then [[H116]] Daniel, [[H1841]] whose [[H1768]] name [[H8036]] Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] was astonied [[H8075]] for one [[H2298]] hour, [[H8160]] and his thoughts [[H7476]] troubled [[H927]] him. The king [[H4430]] spake, [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] let not [[H409]] the dream, [[H2493]] or the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof, trouble [[H927]] thee. Belteshazzar [[H1096]] answered [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] My lord, [[H4756]] the dream [[H2493]] to them that hate [[H8131]] thee, and the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof to thine enemies. [[H6146]]

### 20
The tree [[H363]] that [[H1768]] thou sawest, [[H2370]] which [[H1768]] grew, [[H7236]] and was strong, [[H8631]] whose height [[H7314]] reached [[H4291]] unto the heaven, [[H8065]] and the sight [[H2379]] thereof to all [[H3606]] the earth; [[H772]]

### 21
Whose leaves [[H6074]] fair, [[H8209]] and the fruit [[H4]] thereof much, [[H7690]] and in it meat [[H4203]] for all; [[H3606]] under [[H8460]] which the beasts [[H2423]] of the field [[H1251]] dwelt, [[H1753]] and upon whose branches [[H6056]] the fowls [[H6853]] of the heaven [[H8065]] had their habitation: [[H7932]]

### 22
It [[H1932]] thou, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] art grown [[H7236]] and become strong: [[H8631]] for thy greatness [[H7238]] is grown, [[H7236]] and reacheth [[H4291]] unto heaven, [[H8065]] and thy dominion [[H7985]] to the end [[H5491]] of the earth. [[H772]]

### 23
And whereas [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] saw [[H2370]] a watcher [[H5894]] and an holy one [[H6922]] coming down [[H5182]] from [[H4481]] heaven, [[H8065]] and saying, [[H560]] Hew [[H1414]] the tree [[H363]] down, and destroy [[H2255]] it; yet [[H1297]] leave [[H7662]] the stump [[H6136]] of the roots [[H8330]] thereof in the earth, [[H772]] even with a band [[H613]] of [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] and brass, [[H5174]] in the tender grass [[H1883]] of [[H1768]] the field; [[H1251]] and let it be wet [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven, [[H8065]] and his portion [[H2508]] with [[H5974]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field, [[H1251]] till [[H5705]] seven [[H7655]] times [[H5732]] pass [[H2499]] over [[H5922]] him; [[H5922]]

### 24
This [[H1836]] the interpretation, [[H6591]] O king, [[H4430]] and this [[H1932]] the decree [[H1510]] of the most High, [[H5943]] which [[H1768]] is come [[H4291]] upon [[H5922]] my lord [[H4756]] the king: [[H4430]]

### 25
That they shall drive [[H2957]] thee from [[H4481]] men, [[H606]] and thy dwelling [[H4070]] shall be [[H1934]] with [[H5974]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field, [[H1251]] and they shall make thee to eat [[H2939]] grass [[H6211]] as oxen, [[H8450]] and they shall wet [[H6647]] thee with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven, [[H8065]] and seven [[H7655]] times [[H5732]] shall pass [[H2499]] over [[H5922]] thee, till [[H5705]] thou know [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the most High [[H5943]] ruleth [[H7990]] in the kingdom [[H4437]] of men, [[H606]] and giveth [[H5415]] it to whomsoever [[H4479]] he will. [[H6634]]

### 26
And whereas [[H1768]] they commanded [[H560]] to leave [[H7662]] the stump [[H6136]] of [[H1768]] the tree [[H363]] roots; [[H8330]] thy kingdom [[H4437]] shall be sure [[H7011]] unto thee, after that [[H4481]] thou shalt have known [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the heavens [[H8065]] do rule. [[H7990]]

### 27
Wherefore, [[H3861]] O king, [[H4430]] let my counsel [[H4431]] be acceptable [[H8232]] unto thee, [[H5922]] and break off [[H6562]] thy sins [[H2408]] by righteousness, [[H6665]] and thine iniquities [[H5758]] by shewing mercy [[H2604]] to the poor; [[H6033]] if [[H2006]] it may be [[H1934]] a lengthening [[H754]] of thy tranquillity. [[H7963]]

### 28
All this [[H3606]] came [[H4291]] upon [[H5922]] the king [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar. [[H5020]]

### 29
At the end [[H7118]] of twelve [[H8648]] months [[H3393]] he walked [[H1934]] in [[H5922]] the palace [[H1965]] of the kingdom [[H4437]] of [[H1768]] Babylon. [[H895]]

### 30
The king [[H4430]] spake, [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] Is not [[H3809]] this [[H1932]] great [[H7229]] Babylon, [[H895]] that [[H1768]] I [[H576]] have built [[H1124]] for the house [[H1005]] of the kingdom [[H4437]] by the might [[H8632]] of my power, [[H2632]] and for the honour [[H3367]] of my majesty? [[H1923]]

### 31
While [[H5751]] the word [[H4406]] in the king's [[H4430]] mouth, [[H6433]] there fell [[H5308]] a voice [[H7032]] from [[H4481]] heaven, [[H8065]] O king [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] to thee it is spoken; [[H560]] The kingdom [[H4437]] is departed [[H5709]] from [[H4481]] thee. [[H4481]]

### 32
And they shall drive [[H2957]] thee from [[H4481]] men, [[H606]] and thy dwelling [[H4070]] with [[H5974]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field: [[H1251]] they shall make thee to eat [[H2939]] grass [[H6211]] as oxen, [[H8450]] and seven [[H7655]] times [[H5732]] shall pass [[H2499]] over [[H5922]] thee, until [[H5705]] thou know [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the most High [[H5943]] ruleth [[H7990]] in the kingdom [[H4437]] of men, [[H606]] and giveth [[H5415]] it to whomsoever [[H4479]] he will. [[H6634]]

### 33
The same hour [[H8160]] was the thing [[H4406]] fulfilled [[H5487]] upon [[H5922]] Nebuchadnezzar: [[H5020]] and he was driven [[H2957]] from [[H4481]] men, [[H606]] and did eat [[H399]] grass [[H6211]] as oxen, [[H8450]] and his body [[H1655]] was wet [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven, [[H8065]] till [[H5705]] his hairs [[H8177]] were grown [[H7236]] like eagles' [[H5403]] and his nails [[H2953]] like birds' [[H6853]]

### 34
And at the end [[H7118]] of the days [[H3118]] I [[H576]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] lifted up [[H5191]] mine eyes [[H5870]] unto heaven, [[H8065]] and mine understanding [[H4486]] returned [[H8421]] unto me, [[H5922]] and I blessed [[H1289]] the most High, [[H5943]] and I praised [[H7624]] and honoured [[H1922]] him that liveth [[H2417]] for ever, [[H5957]] whose [[H1768]] dominion [[H7985]] an everlasting [[H5957]] dominion, [[H7985]] and his kingdom [[H4437]] from [[H5974]] generation [[H1859]] to generation: [[H1859]]

### 35
And all [[H3606]] the inhabitants [[H1753]] of the earth [[H772]] reputed [[H2804]] as nothing: [[H3809]] and he doeth [[H5648]] according to his will [[H6634]] in the army [[H2429]] of heaven, [[H8065]] and the inhabitants [[H1753]] of the earth: [[H772]] and none [[H3809]] can [[H383]] stay [[H4223]] his hand, [[H3028]] or say [[H560]] unto him, What [[H4101]] doest [[H5648]] thou? [[H5648]]

### 36
At the same time [[H2166]] my reason [[H4486]] returned [[H8421]] unto me; [[H5922]] and for the glory [[H3367]] of my kingdom, [[H4437]] mine honour [[H1923]] and brightness [[H2122]] returned [[H8421]] unto me; [[H5922]] and my counsellers [[H1907]] and my lords [[H7261]] sought [[H1156]] unto me; and I was established [[H8627]] in [[H5922]] my kingdom, [[H4437]] and excellent [[H3493]] majesty [[H7238]] was added [[H3255]] unto me. [[H3255]]

### 37
Now [[H3705]] I [[H576]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] praise [[H7624]] and extol [[H7313]] and honour [[H1922]] the King [[H4430]] of heaven, [[H8065]] all [[H3606]] whose [[H1768]] works [[H4567]] truth, [[H7187]] and his ways [[H735]] judgment: [[H1780]] and those [[H1768]] that walk [[H1981]] in pride [[H1467]] he is able [[H3202]] to abase. [[H8214]]
