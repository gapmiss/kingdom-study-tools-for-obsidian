### 1
In the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Darius [[H1867]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahasuerus, [[H325]] of the seed [[H2233]] of the Medes, [[H4074]] which [[H834]] was made king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] the realm [[H4438]] of the Chaldeans; [[H3778]]

### 2
In the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of his reign [[H4427]] I [[H589]] Daniel [[H1840]] understood [[H995]] by books [[H5612]] the number [[H4557]] of the years, [[H8141]] whereof [[H834]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] that he would accomplish [[H4390]] seventy [[H7657]] years [[H8141]] in the desolations [[H2723]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
And I set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H430]] to seek [[H1245]] by prayer [[H8605]] and supplications, [[H8469]] with fasting, [[H6685]] and sackcloth, [[H8242]] and ashes: [[H665]]

### 4
And I prayed [[H6419]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] and made my confession, [[H3034]] and said, [[H559]] O [[H577]] Lord, [[H136]] the great [[H1419]] and dreadful [[H3372]] God, [[H410]] keeping [[H8104]] the covenant [[H1285]] and mercy [[H2617]] to them that love [[H157]] him, and to them that keep [[H8104]] his commandments; [[H4687]]

### 5
We have sinned, [[H2398]] and have committed iniquity, [[H5753]] and have done wickedly, [[H7561]] and have rebelled, [[H4775]] even by departing [[H5493]] from thy precepts [[H4687]] and from thy judgments: [[H4941]]

### 6
Neither [[H3808]] have we hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] thy servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] which [[H834]] spake [[H1696]] in thy name [[H8034]] to [[H413]] our kings, [[H4428]] our princes, [[H8269]] and our fathers, [[H1]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 7
O Lord, [[H136]] righteousness [[H6666]] unto thee, but unto us confusion [[H1322]] of faces, [[H6440]] as at this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]] to the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and to the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and unto all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] near, [[H7138]] and far off, [[H7350]] through all [[H3605]] the countries [[H776]] whither [[H834]] thou hast driven [[H5080]] them, because of their trespass [[H4604]] that [[H834]] they have trespassed [[H4603]] against thee. [[H4603]]

### 8
O Lord, [[H136]] to us confusion [[H1322]] of face, [[H6440]] to our kings, [[H4428]] to our princes, [[H8269]] and to our fathers, [[H1]] because [[H834]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against thee. [[H2398]]

### 9
To the Lord [[H136]] our God [[H430]] mercies [[H7356]] and forgivenesses, [[H5547]] though [[H3588]] we have rebelled [[H4775]] against him; [[H4775]]

### 10
Neither [[H3808]] have we obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in his laws, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] he set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] us by [[H3027]] his servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]]

### 11
Yea, all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] have transgressed [[H5674]] thy law, [[H8451]] even by departing, [[H5493]] that they might not [[H1115]] obey [[H8085]] thy voice; [[H6963]] therefore the curse [[H423]] is poured [[H5413]] upon [[H5921]] us, and the oath [[H7621]] that [[H834]] written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] of Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of God, [[H430]] because [[H3588]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against him. [[H2398]]

### 12
And he hath confirmed [[H6965]] his words, [[H1697]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] us, and against [[H5921]] our judges [[H8199]] that [[H834]] judged [[H8199]] us, by bringing [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us a great [[H1419]] evil: [[H7451]] for [[H834]] under [[H8478]] the whole [[H3605]] heaven [[H8064]] hath not [[H3808]] been done [[H6213]] as [[H834]] hath been done [[H6213]] upon Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 13
As [[H834]] written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] is come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us: yet made we not [[H3808]] our prayer [[H2470]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] that we might turn [[H7725]] from our iniquities, [[H5771]] and understand [[H7919]] thy truth. [[H571]]

### 14
Therefore hath the Lord [[H3068]] watched [[H8245]] upon [[H5921]] the evil, [[H7451]] and brought [[H935]] it upon [[H5921]] us: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] righteous [[H6662]] in [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his works [[H4639]] which [[H834]] he doeth: [[H6213]] for we obeyed [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] his voice. [[H6963]]

### 15
And now, [[H6258]] O Lord [[H136]] our God, [[H430]] that [[H834]] hast brought [[H3318]] thy people [[H5971]]  forth [[H853]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and hast gotten [[H6213]] thee renown, [[H8034]] as at this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]] we have sinned, [[H2398]] we have done wickedly. [[H7561]]

### 16
O Lord, [[H136]] according to all [[H3605]] thy righteousness, [[H6666]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] let thine anger [[H639]] and thy fury [[H2534]] be turned away [[H7725]] from thy city [[H5892]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] thy holy [[H6944]] mountain: [[H2022]] because [[H3588]] for our sins, [[H2399]] and for the iniquities [[H5771]] of our fathers, [[H1]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and thy people [[H5971]] a reproach [[H2781]] to all [[H3605]] about [[H5439]] us. [[H5439]]

### 17
Now [[H6258]] therefore, O our God, [[H430]] hear [[H8085]] the prayer [[H8605]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] and his supplications, [[H8469]] and cause thy face [[H6440]] to shine [[H215]] upon [[H5921]] thy sanctuary [[H4720]] that is desolate, [[H8076]] for the Lord's [[H136]] sake. [[H4616]]

### 18
O my God, [[H430]] incline [[H5186]] thine ear, [[H241]] and hear; [[H8085]] open [[H6491]] thine eyes, [[H5869]] and behold [[H7200]] our desolations, [[H8074]] and the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] thy name: [[H8034]] for [[H3588]] we [[H587]] do not [[H3808]] present [[H5307]] our supplications [[H8469]] before [[H6440]] thee for [[H5921]] our righteousnesses, [[H6666]] but [[H3588]] for [[H5921]] thy great [[H7227]] mercies. [[H7356]]

### 19
O Lord, [[H136]] hear; [[H8085]] O Lord, [[H136]] forgive; [[H5545]] O Lord, [[H136]] hearken [[H7181]] and do; [[H6213]] defer [[H309]] not, [[H408]] for thine own sake, [[H4616]] O my God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] thy city [[H5892]] and thy people [[H5971]] are called [[H7121]] by thy name. [[H8034]]

### 20
And whiles [[H5750]] I [[H589]] speaking, [[H1696]] and praying, [[H6419]] and confessing [[H3034]] my sin [[H2403]] and the sin [[H2403]] of my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and presenting [[H5307]] my supplication [[H8467]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] for [[H5921]] the holy [[H6944]] mountain [[H2022]] of my God; [[H430]]

### 21
Yea, whiles [[H5750]] I [[H589]] speaking [[H1696]] in prayer, [[H8605]] even the man [[H376]] Gabriel, [[H1403]] whom [[H834]] I had seen [[H7200]] in the vision [[H2377]] at the beginning, [[H8462]] being caused to fly [[H3286]] swiftly, [[H3288]] touched [[H5060]] me about the time [[H6256]] of the evening [[H6153]] oblation. [[H4503]]

### 22
And he informed [[H995]] and talked [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] me, and said, [[H559]] O Daniel, [[H1840]] I am now [[H6258]] come forth [[H3318]] to give thee skill [[H7919]] and understanding. [[H998]]

### 23
At the beginning [[H8462]] of thy supplications [[H8469]] the commandment [[H1697]] came forth, [[H3318]] and I [[H589]] am come [[H935]] to shew [[H5046]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] greatly beloved: [[H2530]] therefore understand [[H995]] the matter, [[H1697]] and consider [[H995]] the vision. [[H4758]]

### 24
Seventy [[H7657]] weeks [[H7620]] are determined [[H2852]] upon [[H5921]] thy people [[H5971]] and upon [[H5921]] thy holy [[H6944]] city, [[H5892]] to finish [[H3607]] the transgression, [[H6588]] and to make an end [[H2856]] of sins, [[H2403]] and to make reconciliation [[H3722]] for iniquity, [[H5771]] and to bring in [[H935]] everlasting [[H5769]] righteousness, [[H6664]] and to seal up [[H2856]] the vision [[H2377]] and prophecy, [[H5030]] and to anoint [[H4886]] the most [[H6944]] Holy. [[H6944]]

### 25
Know [[H3045]] therefore and understand, [[H7919]] from [[H4480]] the going forth [[H4161]] of the commandment [[H1697]] to restore [[H7725]] and to build [[H1129]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto [[H5704]] the Messiah [[H4899]] the Prince [[H5057]] seven [[H7651]] weeks, [[H7620]] and threescore [[H8346]] and two [[H8147]] weeks: [[H7620]] the street [[H7339]] shall be built [[H1129]] again, [[H7725]] and the wall, [[H2742]] even in troublous [[H6695]] times. [[H6256]]

### 26
And after [[H310]] threescore [[H8346]] and two [[H8147]] weeks [[H7620]] shall Messiah [[H4899]] be cut off, [[H3772]] but not [[H369]] for himself: and the people [[H5971]] of the prince [[H5057]] that shall come [[H935]] shall destroy [[H7843]] the city [[H5892]] and the sanctuary; [[H6944]] and the end [[H7093]] thereof with a flood, [[H7858]] and unto [[H5704]] the end [[H7093]] of the war [[H4421]] desolations [[H8074]] are determined. [[H2782]]

### 27
And he shall confirm [[H1396]] the covenant [[H1285]] with many [[H7227]] for one [[H259]] week: [[H7620]] and in the midst [[H2677]] of the week [[H7620]] he shall cause the sacrifice [[H2077]] and the oblation [[H4503]] to cease, [[H7673]] and for [[H5921]] the overspreading [[H3671]] of abominations [[H8251]] he shall make desolate, [[H8074]] even until [[H5704]] the consummation, [[H3617]] and that determined [[H2782]] shall be poured [[H5413]] upon [[H5921]] the desolate. [[H8074]]
