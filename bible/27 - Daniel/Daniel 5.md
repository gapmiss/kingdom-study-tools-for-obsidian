### 1
Belshazzar [[H1113]] the king [[H4430]] made [[H5648]] a great [[H7229]] feast [[H3900]] to a thousand [[H506]] of his lords, [[H7261]] and drank [[H8355]] wine [[H2562]] before [[H6903]] the thousand. [[H506]]

### 2
Belshazzar, [[H1113]] whiles he tasted [[H2942]] the wine, [[H2562]] commanded [[H560]] to bring [[H858]] the golden [[H1722]] and silver [[H3702]] vessels [[H3984]] which [[H1768]] his father [[H2]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] had taken out [[H5312]] of [[H4481]] the temple [[H1965]] which [[H1768]] in Jerusalem; [[H3390]] that the king, [[H4430]] and his princes, [[H7261]] his wives, [[H7695]] and his concubines, [[H3904]] might drink [[H8355]] therein. [[H8355]]

### 3
Then [[H116]] they brought [[H858]] the golden [[H1722]] vessels [[H3984]] that [[H1768]] were taken out [[H5312]] of [[H4481]] the temple [[H1965]] of [[H1768]] the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] which [[H1768]] at Jerusalem; [[H3390]] and the king, [[H4430]] and his princes, [[H7261]] his wives, [[H7695]] and his concubines, [[H3904]] drank [[H8355]] in them. [[H8355]]

### 4
They drank [[H8355]] wine, [[H2562]] and praised [[H7624]] the gods [[H426]] of gold, [[H1722]] and of silver, [[H3702]] of brass, [[H5174]] of iron, [[H6523]] of wood, [[H636]] and of stone. [[H69]]

### 5
In the same hour [[H8160]] came forth [[H5312]] fingers [[H677]] of [[H1768]] a man's [[H606]] hand, [[H3028]] and wrote [[H3790]] over against [[H6903]] the candlestick [[H5043]] upon [[H5922]] the plaister [[H1528]] of [[H1768]] the wall [[H3797]] of [[H1768]] the king's [[H4430]] palace: [[H1965]] and the king [[H4430]] saw [[H2370]] the part [[H6447]] of the hand [[H3028]] that [[H1768]] wrote. [[H3790]]

### 6
Then [[H116]] the king's [[H4430]] countenance [[H2122]] was changed, [[H8133]] and his thoughts [[H7476]] troubled [[H927]] him, so that the joints [[H7001]] of his loins [[H2783]] were loosed, [[H8271]] and his knees [[H755]] smote [[H5368]] one [[H1668]] against another. [[H1668]]

### 7
The king [[H4430]] cried [[H7123]] aloud [[H2429]] to bring in [[H5954]] the astrologers, [[H826]] the Chaldeans, [[H3779]] and the soothsayers. [[H1505]] the king [[H4430]] spake, [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] to the wise [[H2445]] of Babylon, [[H895]] Whosoever [[H606]] shall read [[H7123]] this [[H1836]] writing, [[H3792]] and shew [[H2324]] me the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof, shall be clothed [[H3848]] with scarlet, [[H711]] and a chain [[H2002]] of [[H1768]] gold [[H1722]] about [[H5922]] his neck, [[H6676]] and shall be the third [[H8523]] ruler [[H7981]] in the kingdom. [[H4437]]

### 8
Then [[H116]] came in [[H5954]] all [[H3606]] the king's [[H4430]] wise [[H2445]] but they could [[H3546]] not [[H3809]] read [[H7123]] the writing, [[H3792]] nor make known [[H3046]] to the king [[H4430]] the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof. [[H6591]]

### 9
Then [[H116]] was king [[H4430]] Belshazzar [[H1113]] greatly [[H7690]] troubled, [[H927]] and his countenance [[H2122]] was changed [[H8133]] in him, [[H5922]] and his lords [[H7261]] were astonied. [[H7672]]

### 10
the queen, [[H4433]] by reason of [[H6903]] the words [[H4406]] of the king [[H4430]] and his lords, [[H7261]] came [[H5954]] into the banquet [[H4961]] house: [[H1005]] the queen [[H4433]] spake [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] O king, [[H4430]] live [[H2418]] for ever: [[H5957]] let not [[H409]] thy thoughts [[H7476]] trouble [[H927]] thee, nor [[H409]] let thy countenance [[H2122]] be changed: [[H8133]]

### 11
There is [[H383]] a man [[H1400]] in thy kingdom, [[H4437]] in whom [[H1768]] the spirit [[H7308]] of the holy [[H6922]] gods; [[H426]] and in the days [[H3118]] of thy father [[H2]] light [[H5094]] and understanding [[H7924]] and wisdom, [[H2452]] like the wisdom [[H2452]] of the gods, [[H426]] was found [[H7912]] in him; whom the king [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] thy father, [[H2]] the king, [[H4430]] thy father, [[H2]] made [[H6966]] master [[H7229]] of the magicians, [[H2749]] astrologers, [[H826]] Chaldeans, [[H3779]] soothsayers; [[H1505]]

### 12
Forasmuch as [[H6903]] an excellent [[H3493]] spirit, [[H7308]] and knowledge, [[H4486]] and understanding, [[H7924]] interpreting [[H6590]] of dreams, [[H2493]] and shewing [[H263]] of hard sentences, [[H280]] and dissolving [[H8271]] of doubts, [[H7001]] were found [[H7912]] in the same Daniel, [[H1841]] whom [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] named [[H7761]] Belteshazzar: [[H1096]] now [[H3705]] let Daniel [[H1841]] be called, [[H7123]] and he will shew [[H2324]] the interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 13
Then [[H116]] was Daniel [[H1841]] brought in [[H5954]] before [[H6925]] the king. [[H4430]] the king [[H4430]] spake [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] unto Daniel, [[H1841]] thou [[H607]] that [[H1932]] Daniel, [[H1841]] which [[H1768]] of [[H4481]] the children [[H1123]] of the captivity [[H1547]] of [[H1768]] Judah, [[H3061]] whom [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] my father [[H2]] brought out [[H858]] of [[H4481]] Jewry? [[H3061]]

### 14
I have even heard [[H8086]] of thee, [[H5922]] that [[H1768]] the spirit [[H7308]] of the gods [[H426]] in thee, and light [[H5094]] and understanding [[H7924]] and excellent [[H3493]] wisdom [[H2452]] is found [[H7912]] in thee. [[H7912]]

### 15
And now [[H3705]] the wise [[H2445]] the astrologers, [[H826]] have been brought in [[H5954]] before [[H6925]] me, that [[H1768]] they should read [[H7123]] this [[H1836]] writing, [[H3792]] and make known [[H3046]] unto me the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof: but they could [[H3546]] not [[H3809]] shew [[H2324]] the interpretation [[H6591]] of the thing: [[H4406]]

### 16
And I [[H576]] have heard [[H8086]] of thee, that [[H1768]] thou canst [[H3202]] make [[H6590]] interpretations, [[H6591]] and dissolve [[H8271]] doubts: [[H7001]] now [[H3705]] if [[H2006]] thou canst [[H3202]] read [[H7123]] the writing, [[H3792]] and make known [[H3046]] to me the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof, thou shalt be clothed [[H3848]] with scarlet, [[H711]] and a chain [[H2002]] of [[H1768]] gold [[H1722]] about [[H5922]] thy neck, [[H6676]] and shalt be the third [[H8531]] ruler [[H7981]] in the kingdom. [[H4437]]

### 17
Then [[H116]] Daniel [[H1841]] answered [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] before [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]] Let thy gifts [[H4978]] be [[H1934]] to thyself, and give [[H3052]] thy rewards [[H5023]] to another; [[H321]] yet [[H1297]] I will read [[H7123]] the writing [[H3792]] unto the king, [[H4430]] and make known [[H3046]] to him the interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 18
O thou [[H607]] king, [[H4430]] the most high [[H5943]] God [[H426]] gave [[H3052]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] thy father [[H2]] a kingdom, [[H4437]] and majesty, [[H7238]] and glory, [[H3367]] and honour: [[H1923]]

### 19
And for [[H4481]] the majesty [[H7238]] that [[H1768]] he gave [[H3052]] him, all [[H3606]] people, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and languages, [[H3961]] trembled [[H1934]] and feared [[H1763]] before [[H4481]] him: [[H6925]] whom [[H1768]] he would [[H1934]] he slew; [[H1934]] and whom [[H1768]] he would [[H1934]] he kept alive; [[H1934]] and whom [[H1768]] he would [[H1934]] he set up; [[H1934]] and whom [[H1768]] he would [[H1934]] he put down. [[H1934]]

### 20
But when [[H1768]] his heart [[H3825]] was lifted up, [[H7313]] and his mind [[H7308]] hardened [[H8631]] in pride, [[H2103]] he was deposed [[H5182]] from [[H4481]] his kingly [[H4437]] throne, [[H3764]] and they took [[H5709]] his glory [[H3367]] from him: [[H4481]]

### 21
And he was driven [[H2957]] from [[H4481]] the sons [[H1123]] of men; [[H606]] and his heart [[H3825]] was made [[H7739]] like [[H5974]] the beasts, [[H2423]] and his dwelling [[H4070]] with [[H5974]] the wild asses: [[H6167]] they fed [[H2939]] him with grass [[H6211]] like oxen, [[H8450]] and his body [[H1655]] was wet [[H6647]] with the dew [[H2920]] of heaven; [[H8065]] till [[H5705]] he knew [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the most high [[H5943]] God [[H426]] ruled [[H7990]] in the kingdom [[H4437]] of men, [[H606]] and he appointeth [[H6966]] over [[H5922]] it whomsoever [[H4479]] he will. [[H6634]]

### 22
And thou [[H607]] his son, [[H1247]] O Belshazzar, [[H1113]] hast not [[H3809]] humbled [[H8214]] thine heart, [[H3825]] though [[H6903]] thou knewest [[H3046]] all [[H3606]] this; [[H1836]]

### 23
But hast lifted up thyself [[H7313]] against [[H5922]] the Lord [[H4756]] of heaven; [[H8065]] and they have brought [[H858]] the vessels [[H3984]] of [[H1768]] his house [[H1005]] before [[H6925]] thee, and thou, [[H607]] and thy lords, [[H7261]] thy wives, [[H7695]] and thy concubines, [[H3904]] have drunk [[H8355]] wine [[H2562]] in them; and thou hast praised [[H7624]] the gods [[H426]] of silver, [[H3702]] and gold, [[H1722]] of brass, [[H5174]] iron, [[H6523]] wood, [[H636]] and stone, [[H69]] which [[H1768]] see [[H2370]] not, [[H3809]] nor [[H3809]] hear, [[H8086]] nor [[H3809]] know: [[H3046]] and the God [[H426]] in whose [[H1768]] hand [[H3028]] thy breath [[H5396]] and whose all [[H3606]] thy ways, [[H735]] hast thou not [[H3809]] glorified: [[H1922]]

### 24
Then [[H116]] was the part [[H6447]] of [[H1768]] the hand [[H3028]] sent [[H7972]] from [[H4481]] him; [[H6925]] and this [[H1836]] writing [[H3792]] was written. [[H7560]]

### 25
And this [[H1836]] the writing [[H3792]] that [[H1768]] was written, [[H7560]] MENE, [[H4484]] MENE, [[H4484]] TEKEL, [[H8625]] UPHARSIN. [[H6537]]

### 26
This [[H1836]] the interpretation [[H6591]] of the thing: [[H4406]] MENE; [[H4484]] God [[H426]] hath numbered [[H4483]] thy kingdom, [[H4437]] and finished [[H8000]] it. [[H8000]]

### 27
TEKEL; [[H8625]] Thou art weighed [[H8625]] in the balances, [[H3977]] and art found [[H7912]] wanting. [[H2627]]

### 28
PERES; [[H6537]] Thy kingdom [[H4437]] is divided, [[H6537]] and given [[H3052]] to the Medes [[H4076]] and Persians. [[H6540]]

### 29
Then [[H116]] commanded [[H560]] Belshazzar, [[H1113]] and they clothed [[H3848]] Daniel [[H1841]] with scarlet, [[H711]] and a chain [[H2002]] of [[H1768]] gold [[H1722]] about [[H5922]] his neck, [[H6676]] and made a proclamation [[H3745]] concerning [[H5922]] him, that [[H1768]] he should be [[H1934]] the third [[H8531]] ruler [[H7990]] in the kingdom. [[H4437]]

### 30
In that night [[H3916]] was Belshazzar [[H1113]] the king [[H4430]] of the Chaldeans [[H3779]] slain. [[H6992]]

### 31
And Darius [[H1868]] the Median [[H4077]] took [[H6902]] the kingdom, [[H4437]] about threescore [[H8361]] and two [[H8648]] years [[H8140]] old. [[H1247]]
