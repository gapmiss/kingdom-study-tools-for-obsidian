### 1
In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] came [[H935]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] unto Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and besieged [[H6696]] it. [[H5921]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H136]] gave [[H5414]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] into his hand, [[H3027]] with part [[H7117]] of the vessels [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of God: [[H430]] which he carried into [[H935]] the land [[H776]] of Shinar [[H8152]] to the house [[H1004]] of his god; [[H430]] and he brought [[H935]] the vessels [[H3627]] into the treasure [[H214]] house [[H1004]] of his god. [[H430]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] spake [[H559]] unto Ashpenaz [[H828]] the master [[H7227]] of his eunuchs, [[H5631]] that he should bring [[H935]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and of the king's [[H4410]] seed, [[H2233]] and of [[H4480]] the princes; [[H6579]]

### 4
Children [[H3206]] in whom [[H834]] no [[H369]] blemish, [[H3971]] but well [[H2896]] favoured, [[H4758]] and skilful [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and cunning [[H3045]] in knowledge, [[H1847]] and understanding [[H995]] science, [[H4093]] and such [[H834]] as ability [[H3581]] in them to stand [[H5975]] in the king's [[H4428]] palace, [[H1964]] and whom they might teach [[H3925]] the learning [[H5612]] and the tongue [[H3956]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 5
And the king [[H4428]] appointed [[H4487]] them a daily [[H3117]] provision [[H1697]] of the king's [[H4428]] meat, [[H6598]] and of the wine [[H3196]] which he drank: [[H4960]] so nourishing [[H1431]] them three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] that at the end [[H7117]] thereof they might stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 6
Now among these were [[H1961]] of the children [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Daniel, [[H1840]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] Mishael, [[H4332]] and Azariah: [[H5838]]

### 7
Unto whom the prince [[H8269]] of the eunuchs [[H5631]] gave [[H7760]] names: [[H8034]] for he gave [[H7760]] unto Daniel [[H1840]] of Belteshazzar; [[H1095]] and to Hananiah, [[H2608]] of Shadrach; [[H7714]] and to Mishael, [[H4332]] of Meshach; [[H4335]] and to Azariah, [[H5838]] of Abed-nego. [[H5664]]

### 8
But Daniel [[H1840]] purposed [[H7760]] in [[H5921]] his heart [[H3820]] that [[H834]] he would not [[H3808]] defile himself [[H1351]] with the portion of the king's [[H4428]] meat, [[H6598]] nor with the wine [[H3196]] which he drank: [[H4960]] therefore he requested [[H1245]] of the prince [[H8269]] of the eunuchs [[H5631]] that [[H834]] he might not [[H3808]] defile himself. [[H1351]]

### 9
Now God [[H430]] had brought [[H5414]] Daniel [[H1840]] into favour [[H2617]] and tender love [[H7356]] with [[H6440]] the prince [[H8269]] of the eunuchs. [[H5631]]

### 10
And the prince [[H8269]] of the eunuchs [[H5631]] said [[H559]] unto Daniel, [[H1840]] I [[H589]] fear [[H3373]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] who [[H834]] hath appointed [[H4487]] your meat [[H3978]] and your drink: [[H4960]] for [[H834]] why [[H4100]] should he see [[H7200]] your faces [[H6440]] worse liking [[H2196]] than [[H4480]] the children [[H3206]] which [[H834]] of your sort? [[H1524]] then shall ye make endanger [[H2325]] my head [[H7218]] to the king. [[H4428]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] Daniel [[H1840]] to [[H413]] Melzar, [[H4453]] whom [[H834]] the prince [[H8269]] of the eunuchs [[H5631]] had set [[H4487]] over [[H5921]] Daniel, [[H1840]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] Mishael, [[H4332]] and Azariah, [[H5838]]

### 12
Prove [[H5254]] thy servants, [[H5650]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] ten [[H6235]] days; [[H3117]] and let them give [[H5414]] us pulse [[H2235]] to eat, [[H398]] and water [[H4325]] to drink. [[H8354]]

### 13
Then let our countenances [[H4758]] be looked upon [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] thee, and the countenance [[H4758]] of the children [[H3206]] that eat [[H398]] of the portion of the king's [[H4428]] meat: [[H6598]] and as [[H834]] thou seest, [[H7200]] deal [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] thy servants. [[H5650]]

### 14
So he consented [[H8085]] to them in this [[H2088]] matter, [[H1697]] and proved [[H5254]] them ten [[H6235]] days. [[H3117]]

### 15
And at the end [[H7117]] of ten [[H6235]] days [[H3117]] their countenances [[H4758]] appeared [[H7200]] fairer [[H2896]] and fatter [[H1277]] in flesh [[H1320]] than [[H4480]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H3206]] which did eat [[H398]] the portion of the king's [[H4428]] meat. [[H6598]]

### 16
Thus Melzar [[H4453]] took away [[H5375]] the portion of their meat, [[H6598]] and the wine [[H3196]] that they should drink; [[H4960]] and gave [[H5414]] them pulse. [[H2235]]

### 17
As for these [[H428]] four [[H702]] children, [[H3206]] God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] them knowledge [[H4093]] and skill [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] learning [[H5612]] and wisdom: [[H2451]] and Daniel [[H1840]] had understanding [[H995]] in all [[H3605]] visions [[H2377]] and dreams. [[H2472]]

### 18
Now at the end [[H7117]] of the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] had said [[H559]] he should bring [[H935]] them in, then the prince [[H8269]] of the eunuchs [[H5631]] brought [[H935]] them in before [[H6440]] Nebuchadnezzar. [[H5019]]

### 19
And the king [[H4428]] communed [[H1696]] with [[H854]] them; and among them all [[H3605]] was found [[H4672]] none [[H3808]] like Daniel, [[H1840]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] Mishael, [[H4332]] and Azariah: [[H5838]] therefore stood [[H5975]] they before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 20
And in all [[H3605]] matters [[H1697]] of wisdom [[H2451]] understanding, [[H998]] that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] inquired [[H1245]] of them, he found [[H4672]] them ten times [[H6235]] better [[H3027]] than [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the magicians [[H2748]] astrologers [[H825]] that [[H834]] in all [[H3605]] his realm. [[H4438]]

### 21
And Daniel [[H1840]] continued [[H1961]] unto [[H5704]] the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Cyrus. [[H3566]]
