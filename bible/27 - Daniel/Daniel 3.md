### 1
Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king [[H4430]] made [[H5648]] an image [[H6755]] of [[H1768]] gold, [[H1722]] whose height [[H7314]] threescore [[H8361]] cubits, [[H521]] the breadth [[H6613]] thereof six [[H8353]] cubits: [[H521]] he set it up [[H6966]] in the plain [[H1236]] of Dura, [[H1757]] in the province [[H4083]] of Babylon. [[H895]]

### 2
Then Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king [[H4430]] sent [[H7972]] to gather together [[H3673]] the princes, [[H324]] the governors, [[H5460]] and the captains, [[H6347]] the judges, [[H148]] the treasurers, [[H1411]] the counsellers, [[H1884]] the sheriffs, [[H8614]] and all [[H3606]] the rulers [[H7984]] of the provinces, [[H4083]] to come [[H858]] to the dedication [[H2597]] of the image [[H6755]] which [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king [[H4430]] had set up. [[H6966]]

### 3
Then [[H116]] the princes, [[H324]] the governors, [[H5460]] and captains, [[H6347]] the judges, [[H148]] the treasurers, [[H1411]] the counsellers, [[H1884]] the sheriffs, [[H8614]] and all [[H3606]] the rulers [[H7984]] of the provinces, [[H4083]] were gathered together [[H3673]] unto the dedication [[H2597]] of the image [[H6755]] that [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king [[H4430]] had set up; [[H6966]] and they stood [[H6966]] before [[H6903]] the image [[H6755]] that [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] had set up. [[H6966]]

### 4
Then an herald [[H3744]] cried [[H7123]] aloud, [[H2429]] To you it is commanded, [[H560]] O people, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and languages, [[H3961]]

### 5
at what [[H1768]] time [[H5732]] ye hear [[H8086]] the sound [[H7032]] of the cornet, [[H7162]] flute, [[H4953]] harp, [[H7030]] sackbut, [[H5443]] psaltery, [[H6460]] dulcimer, [[H5481]] and all [[H3606]] kinds [[H2178]] of musick, [[H2170]] ye fall down [[H5308]] and worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] image [[H6755]] that [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king [[H4430]] hath set up: [[H6966]]

### 6
And whoso [[H4479]] falleth down [[H5308]] not [[H3809]] and worshippeth [[H5457]] shall the same hour [[H8160]] be cast [[H7412]] into the midst [[H1459]] of a burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 7
Therefore [[H6903]] at that time, [[H2166]] when [[H1768]] all [[H3606]] the people [[H5972]] heard [[H8086]] the sound [[H7032]] of the cornet, [[H7162]] flute, [[H4953]] harp, [[H7030]] sackbut, [[H5443]] psaltery, [[H6460]] and all [[H3606]] kinds [[H2178]] of musick, [[H2170]] all [[H3606]] the people, [[H5972]] the nations, [[H524]] and the languages, [[H3961]] fell down [[H5308]] worshipped [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] image [[H6755]] that [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king [[H4430]] had set up. [[H6966]]

### 8
Wherefore [[H6903]] at that [[H1836]] time [[H2166]] certain [[H1400]] Chaldeans [[H3779]] came near, [[H7127]] and accused [[H7170]] the Jews. [[H3062]]

### 9
They spake [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] to the king [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] O king, [[H4430]] live [[H2418]] for ever. [[H5957]]

### 10
Thou, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] hast made [[H7761]] a decree, [[H2942]] that [[H1768]] every [[H3606]] man [[H606]] that [[H1768]] shall hear [[H8086]] the sound [[H7032]] of the cornet, [[H7162]] flute, [[H4953]] harp, [[H7030]] sackbut, [[H5443]] psaltery, [[H6460]] and dulcimer, [[H5481]] and all [[H3606]] kinds [[H2178]] of musick, [[H2170]] shall fall down [[H5308]] and worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] image: [[H6755]]

### 11
And whoso [[H4479]] falleth down [[H5308]] not [[H3809]] and worshippeth, [[H5457]] he should be cast [[H7412]] into the midst [[H1459]] of a burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 12
There are [[H383]] certain [[H1400]] Jews [[H3062]] whom [[H3487]] thou hast set [[H4483]] over [[H5922]] the affairs [[H5673]] of the province [[H4083]] of Babylon, [[H895]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego; [[H5665]] these [[H479]] men, [[H1400]] O king, [[H4430]] have [[H7761]] not [[H3809]] regarded [[H2942]] thee: they serve [[H6399]] not [[H3809]] thy gods, [[H426]] nor [[H3809]] worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] image [[H6755]] which [[H1768]] thou hast set up. [[H6966]]

### 13
Then [[H116]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] in rage [[H7266]] and fury [[H2528]] commanded [[H560]] to bring [[H858]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego. [[H5665]] Then [[H116]] they brought [[H858]] these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] before [[H6925]] the king. [[H4430]]

### 14
Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] spake [[H6032]] and said unto them, [[H560]] true, [[H6656]] O Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] do [[H383]] not [[H3809]] ye serve [[H6399]] my gods, [[H426]] nor [[H3809]] worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] image [[H6755]] which [[H1768]] I have set up? [[H6966]]

### 15
Now [[H3705]] if [[H2006]] ye be [[H383]] ready [[H6263]] that [[H1768]] at what [[H1768]] time [[H5732]] ye hear [[H8086]] the sound [[H7032]] of the cornet, [[H7162]] flute, [[H4953]] harp, [[H7030]] sackbut, [[H5443]] psaltery, [[H6460]] and dulcimer, [[H5481]] and all [[H3606]] kinds [[H2178]] of musick, [[H2170]] ye fall down [[H5308]] and worship [[H5457]] the image [[H6755]] which [[H1768]] I have made; [[H5648]] but if [[H2006]] ye worship [[H5457]] not, [[H3809]] ye shall be cast [[H7412]] the same hour [[H8160]] into the midst [[H1459]] of a burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace; [[H861]] and who [[H4479]] that [[H1932]] God [[H426]] that [[H1768]] shall deliver [[H7804]] you out of [[H4481]] my hands? [[H3028]]

### 16
Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] answered [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] to the king, [[H4430]] O Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] we [[H586]] not [[H3809]] careful [[H2818]] to answer [[H8421]] thee in [[H5922]] this [[H1836]] matter. [[H6600]]

### 17
If [[H2006]] it be [[H383]] our God [[H426]] whom [[H1768]] we [[H586]] serve [[H6399]] is able [[H3202]] to deliver [[H7804]] us from [[H4481]] the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace, [[H861]] he will deliver [[H7804]] and out of [[H4481]] thine hand, [[H3028]] O king. [[H4430]]

### 18
But if [[H2006]] not, [[H3809]] be it [[H1934]] known [[H3046]] unto thee, O king, [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] we will [[H383]] not [[H3809]] serve [[H6399]] thy gods, [[H426]] nor [[H3809]] worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] image [[H6755]] which [[H1768]] thou hast set up. [[H6966]]

### 19
Then [[H116]] was Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] full [[H4391]] of fury, [[H2528]] and the form [[H6755]] of his visage [[H600]] was changed [[H8133]] against [[H5922]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego: [[H5665]] he spake, [[H6032]] and commanded [[H560]] that they should heat [[H228]] the furnace [[H861]] one [[H2298]] seven times [[H7655]] more [[H5922]] than [[H1768]] it was wont [[H2370]] to be heated. [[H228]]

### 20
And he commanded [[H560]] the most [[H2429]] mighty [[H1401]] men [[H1400]] that [[H1768]] in his army [[H2429]] to bind [[H3729]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] to cast [[H7412]] into the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 21
Then [[H116]] these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] were bound [[H3729]] in their coats, [[H5622]] their hosen, [[H6361]] and their hats, [[H3737]] and their garments, [[H3831]] and were cast [[H7412]] into the midst [[H1459]] of the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 22
Therefore [[H3606]] because [[H4481]] the king's [[H4430]] commandment [[H4406]] was urgent, [[H2685]] and the furnace [[H861]] exceeding [[H3493]] hot, [[H228]] the flame [[H7631]] of [[H1768]] the fire [[H5135]] slew [[H6992]] those [[H479]] men [[H1400]] that [[H1768]] took up [[H5267]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego. [[H5665]]

### 23
And these [[H479]] three [[H8532]] men, [[H1400]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] fell down [[H5308]] bound [[H3729]] into the midst [[H1459]] of the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 24
Then [[H116]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king [[H4430]] was astonied, [[H8429]] and rose up [[H6966]] in haste, [[H927]] spake, [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] unto his counsellers, [[H1907]] Did not [[H3809]] we cast [[H7412]] three [[H8532]] men [[H1400]] bound [[H3729]] into the midst [[H1459]] of the fire? [[H5135]] They answered [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] unto the king, [[H4430]] True, [[H3330]] O king. [[H4430]]

### 25
He answered [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] Lo, [[H1888]] I [[H576]] see [[H2370]] four [[H703]] men [[H1400]] loose, [[H8271]] walking [[H1981]] in the midst [[H1459]] of the fire, [[H5135]] and they have [[H383]] no [[H3809]] hurt; [[H2257]] and the form [[H7299]] of [[H1768]] the fourth [[H7244]] is like [[H1821]] the Son [[H1247]] of God. [[H426]]

### 26
Then [[H116]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] came near [[H7127]] to the mouth [[H8651]] of the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace, [[H861]] spake, [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] ye servants [[H5649]] of [[H1768]] the most high [[H5943]] God, [[H426]] come forth, [[H5312]] and come [[H858]] Then [[H116]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] came forth [[H5312]] of [[H4481]] the midst [[H1459]] of the fire. [[H5135]]

### 27
And the princes, [[H324]] governors, [[H5460]] and captains, [[H6347]] and the king's [[H4430]] counsellers, [[H1907]] being gathered together, [[H3673]] saw [[H2370]] these [[H479]] men, [[H1400]] upon whose [[H1768]] bodies [[H1655]] the fire [[H5135]] had no [[H3809]] power, [[H7981]] nor [[H3809]] was an hair [[H8177]] of their head [[H7217]] singed, [[H2761]] neither [[H3809]] were their coats [[H5622]] changed, [[H8133]] nor [[H3809]] the smell [[H7382]] of fire [[H5135]] had passed [[H5709]] on them. [[H5709]]

### 28
Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] spake, [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] Blessed [[H1289]] the God [[H426]] of [[H1768]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] who [[H1768]] hath sent [[H7972]] his angel, [[H4398]] and delivered [[H7804]] his servants [[H5649]] that [[H1768]] trusted [[H7365]] in him, [[H5922]] and have changed [[H8133]] the king's [[H4430]] word, [[H4406]] and yielded [[H3052]] their bodies, [[H1655]] that [[H1768]] they might not [[H3809]] serve [[H6399]] nor [[H3809]] worship [[H5457]] any [[H3606]] god, [[H426]] except [[H3861]] their own God. [[H426]]

### 29
Therefore I [[H4481]] make [[H7761]] a decree, [[H2942]] That [[H1768]] every [[H3606]] people, [[H5972]] nation, [[H524]] and language, [[H3961]] which [[H1768]] speak [[H560]] any thing amiss [[H7955]] against [[H5922]] the God [[H426]] of [[H1768]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] shall be cut [[H5648]] in pieces, [[H1917]] and their houses [[H1005]] shall be made [[H7739]] a dunghill: [[H5122]] because [[H6903]] there is [[H383]] no [[H3809]] other [[H321]] God [[H426]] that [[H1768]] can [[H3202]] deliver [[H5338]] after this [[H1836]] sort. [[H1836]]

### 30
Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] promoted [[H6744]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] in the province [[H4083]] of Babylon. [[H895]]
