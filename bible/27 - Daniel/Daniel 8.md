### 1
In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of king [[H4428]] Belshazzar [[H1112]] a vision [[H2377]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] me, me [[H589]] Daniel, [[H1840]] after that [[H310]] which appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] me at the first. [[H8462]]

### 2
And I saw [[H7200]] in a vision; [[H2377]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] when I saw, [[H7200]] that I [[H589]] at Shushan [[H7800]] the palace, [[H1002]] which [[H834]] in the province [[H4082]] of Elam; [[H5867]] and I saw [[H7200]] in a vision, [[H2377]] and I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H180]] of Ulai. [[H195]]

### 3
Then I lifted up [[H5375]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] and saw, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the river [[H180]] a [[H259]] ram [[H352]] which had horns: [[H7161]] and the horns [[H7161]] high; [[H1364]] but one [[H259]] higher [[H1364]] than [[H4480]] the other, [[H8145]] and the higher [[H1364]] came up [[H5927]] last. [[H314]]

### 4
I saw [[H7200]] the ram [[H352]] pushing [[H5055]] westward, [[H3220]] and northward, [[H6828]] and southward; [[H5045]] so that no [[H3808]] beasts [[H2416]] might stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him, neither [[H369]] that could deliver [[H5337]] out of his hand; [[H3027]] but he did [[H6213]] according to his will, [[H7522]] and became great. [[H1431]]

### 5
And as I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] considering, [[H995]] behold, [[H2009]] an he [[H5795]] goat [[H6842]] came [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the west [[H4628]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] and touched [[H5060]] not [[H369]] the ground: [[H776]] and the goat [[H6842]] a notable [[H2380]] horn [[H7161]] between [[H996]] his eyes. [[H5869]]

### 6
And he came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the ram [[H352]] that had [[H1167]] horns, [[H7161]] which [[H834]] I had seen [[H7200]] standing [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the river, [[H180]] and ran [[H7323]] unto [[H413]] him in the fury [[H2534]] of his power. [[H3581]]

### 7
And I saw [[H7200]] him come close [[H5060]] unto [[H681]] the ram, [[H352]] and he was moved with choler [[H4843]] against [[H413]] him, and smote [[H5221]] the ram, [[H352]] and brake [[H7665]] his two [[H8147]] horns: [[H7161]] and there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] power [[H3581]] in the ram [[H352]] to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him, but he cast him down [[H7993]] to the ground, [[H776]] and stamped upon [[H7429]] him: and there was [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] that could deliver [[H5337]] the ram [[H352]] out of his hand. [[H3027]]

### 8
Therefore the he [[H6842]] goat [[H5795]] waxed very [[H3966]] great: [[H1431]] and when he was strong, [[H6105]] the great [[H1419]] horn [[H7161]] was broken; [[H7665]] and for [[H8478]] it came up [[H5927]] four [[H702]] notable ones [[H2380]] toward the four [[H702]] winds [[H7307]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 9
And out of [[H4480]] one [[H259]] of them [[H1992]] came forth [[H3318]] a [[H259]] little [[H4704]] horn, [[H7161]] which waxed exceeding [[H3499]] great, [[H1431]] toward [[H413]] the south, [[H5045]] and toward [[H413]] the east, [[H4217]] and toward [[H413]] the pleasant [[H6643]]

### 10
And it waxed great, [[H1431]] to [[H5704]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven; [[H8064]] and it cast down [[H5307]] of [[H4480]] the host [[H6635]] and of [[H4480]] the stars [[H3556]] to the ground, [[H776]] and stamped upon [[H7429]] them. [[H7429]]

### 11
Yea, he magnified [[H1431]] even to [[H5704]] the prince [[H8269]] of the host, [[H6635]] and by [[H4480]] him the daily [[H8548]] was taken away, [[H7311]] and the place [[H4349]] of his sanctuary [[H4720]] was cast down. [[H7993]]

### 12
And an host [[H6635]] was given [[H5414]] against [[H5921]] the daily [[H8548]] by reason of transgression, [[H6588]] and it cast down [[H7993]] the truth [[H571]] to the ground; [[H776]] and it practised, [[H6213]] and prospered. [[H6743]]

### 13
Then I heard [[H8085]] one [[H259]] saint [[H6918]] speaking, [[H1696]] and another [[H259]] saint [[H6918]] said [[H559]] unto that certain [[H6422]] which spake, [[H1696]] How long [[H5704]] the vision [[H2377]] the daily [[H8548]] and the transgression [[H6588]] of desolation, [[H8074]] to give [[H5414]] both the sanctuary [[H6944]] and the host [[H6635]] to be trodden under foot? [[H4823]]

### 14
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Unto [[H5704]] two thousand [[H505]] and three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] days; [[H6153]] then shall the sanctuary [[H6944]] be cleansed. [[H6663]]

### 15
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when I, I [[H589]] Daniel, [[H1840]] had seen [[H7200]] the vision, [[H2377]] and sought [[H1245]] for the meaning, [[H998]] then, behold, [[H2009]] there stood [[H5975]] before [[H5048]] me as the appearance [[H4758]] of a man. [[H1397]]

### 16
And I heard [[H8085]] a man's [[H120]] voice [[H6963]] between [[H996]] Ulai, [[H195]] which called, [[H7121]] and said, [[H559]] Gabriel, [[H1403]] make this [[H1975]] to understand [[H995]] the vision. [[H4758]]

### 17
So he came [[H935]] near [[H681]] where I stood: [[H5977]] and when he came, [[H935]] I was afraid, [[H1204]] and fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] my face: [[H6440]] but he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Understand, [[H995]] O son [[H1121]] of man: [[H120]] for [[H3588]] at the time [[H6256]] of the end [[H7093]] the vision. [[H2377]]

### 18
Now as he was speaking [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] me, I was in a deep sleep [[H7290]] on [[H5921]] my face [[H6440]] toward the ground: [[H776]] but he touched [[H5060]] me, and set [[H5975]] me upright. [[H5977]]

### 19
And he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will make thee know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] shall be [[H1961]] in the last end [[H319]] of the indignation: [[H2195]] for [[H3588]] at the time appointed [[H4150]] the end [[H7093]]

### 20
The ram [[H352]] which [[H834]] thou sawest [[H7200]] having [[H1167]] horns [[H7161]] the kings [[H4428]] of Media [[H4074]] and Persia. [[H6539]]

### 21
And the rough [[H8163]] goat [[H6842]] the king [[H4428]] of Grecia: [[H3120]] and the great [[H1419]] horn [[H7161]] that [[H834]] between [[H996]] his eyes [[H5869]] the first [[H7223]] king. [[H4428]]

### 22
Now that being broken, [[H7665]] whereas four [[H702]] stood up [[H5975]] for [[H8478]] it, four [[H702]] kingdoms [[H4438]] shall stand up [[H5975]] out of the nation, [[H1471]] but not [[H3808]] in his power. [[H3581]]

### 23
And in the latter time [[H319]] of their kingdom, [[H4438]] when the transgressors [[H6586]] are come to the full, [[H8552]] a king [[H4428]] of fierce [[H5794]] countenance, [[H6440]] and understanding [[H995]] dark sentences, [[H2420]] shall stand up. [[H5975]]

### 24
And his power [[H3581]] shall be mighty, [[H6105]] but not [[H3808]] by his own power: [[H3581]] and he shall destroy [[H7843]] wonderfully, [[H6381]] and shall prosper, [[H6743]] and practise, [[H6213]] and shall destroy [[H7843]] the mighty [[H6099]] and the holy [[H6918]] people. [[H5971]]

### 25
And through [[H5921]] his policy [[H7922]] also he shall cause craft [[H4820]] to prosper [[H6743]] in his hand; [[H3027]] and he shall magnify [[H1431]] in his heart, [[H3824]] and by peace [[H7962]] shall destroy [[H7843]] many: [[H7227]] he shall also stand up [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] the Prince [[H8269]] of princes; [[H8269]] but he shall be broken [[H7665]] without [[H657]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 26
And the vision [[H4758]] of the evening [[H6153]] and the morning [[H1242]] which [[H834]] was told [[H559]] true: [[H571]] wherefore shut thou up [[H5640]] the vision; [[H2377]] for [[H3588]] it for many [[H7227]] days. [[H3117]]

### 27
And I [[H589]] Daniel [[H1840]] fainted, [[H1961]] and was sick [[H2470]] days; [[H3117]] afterward I rose up, [[H6965]] and did [[H6213]] the king's [[H4428]] business; [[H4399]] and I was astonished [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] the vision, [[H4758]] but none [[H369]] understood [[H995]]
