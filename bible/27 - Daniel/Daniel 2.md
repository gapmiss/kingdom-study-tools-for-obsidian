### 1
And in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] dreamed [[H2492]] dreams, [[H2472]] wherewith his spirit [[H7307]] was troubled, [[H6470]] and his sleep [[H8142]] brake [[H1961]] from [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 2
Then the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H559]] to call [[H7121]] the magicians, [[H2748]] and the astrologers, [[H825]] and the sorcerers, [[H3784]] and the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] for to shew [[H5046]] the king [[H4428]] his dreams. [[H2472]] So they came [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto them, I have dreamed [[H2492]] a dream, [[H2472]] and my spirit [[H7307]] was troubled [[H6470]] to know [[H3045]] the dream. [[H2472]]

### 4
Then spake [[H1696]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] to the king [[H4428]] in Syriack, [[H762]] O king, [[H4430]] live [[H2418]] for ever: [[H5957]] tell [[H560]] thy servants [[H5649]] the dream, [[H2493]] and we will shew [[H2324]] the interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 5
The king [[H4430]] answered [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] to the Chaldeans, [[H3779]] The thing [[H4406]] is gone [[H230]] from me: [[H4481]] if [[H2006]] ye will not [[H3809]] make known [[H3046]] unto me the dream, [[H2493]] with the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof, ye shall be cut [[H5648]] in pieces, [[H1917]] and your houses [[H1005]] shall be made [[H7761]] a dunghill. [[H5122]]

### 6
But if [[H2006]] ye shew [[H2324]] the dream, [[H2493]] and the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof, ye shall receive [[H6902]] of [[H4481]] me [[H6925]] gifts [[H4978]] and rewards [[H5023]] and great [[H7690]] honour: [[H3367]] therefore [[H3861]] shew [[H2324]] me the dream, [[H2493]] and the interpretation thereof. [[H6591]]

### 7
They answered [[H6032]] again [[H8579]] and said, [[H560]] Let the king [[H4430]] tell [[H560]] his servants [[H5649]] the dream, [[H2493]] and we will shew [[H2324]] the interpretation [[H6591]] of it. [[H6591]]

### 8
The king [[H4430]] answered [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] I [[H576]] know [[H3046]] of [[H4481]] certainty [[H3330]] that [[H1768]] ye [[H608]] would gain [[H2084]] the time, [[H5732]] because [[H6903]] ye see [[H2370]] the thing [[H4406]] is gone [[H230]] from [[H4481]] me. [[H4481]]

### 9
But [[H1768]] if [[H2006]] ye will not [[H3809]] make known [[H3046]] unto me the dream, [[H2493]] one [[H1932]] decree [[H1882]] for you: for ye have prepared [[H2164]] lying [[H3538]] and corrupt [[H7844]] words [[H4406]] to speak [[H560]] before [[H6925]] me, till [[H5705]] the time [[H5732]] be changed: [[H8133]] therefore [[H3861]] tell [[H560]] me the dream, [[H2493]] and I shall know [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] ye can shew [[H2324]] me the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof. [[H6591]]

### 10
The Chaldeans [[H3779]] answered [[H6032]] before [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]] and said, [[H560]] There is [[H383]] not [[H3809]] a man [[H606]] upon [[H5922]] the earth [[H3007]] that [[H1768]] can [[H3202]] shew [[H2324]] the king's [[H4430]] matter: [[H4406]] therefore [[H6903]] no [[H3809]] king, [[H4430]] lord, [[H7229]] nor ruler, [[H7990]] asked [[H7593]] such [[H1836]] things [[H4406]] at any [[H3606]] magician, [[H2749]] or astrologer, [[H826]] or Chaldean. [[H3779]]

### 11
And a rare [[H3358]] thing [[H4406]] that [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] requireth, [[H7593]] and there is [[H383]] none [[H3809]] other [[H321]] that [[H1768]] can shew [[H2324]] it before [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]] except [[H3861]] the gods, [[H426]] whose [[H1768]] dwelling [[H4070]] is [[H383]] not [[H3809]] with [[H5974]] flesh. [[H1321]]

### 12
For [[H6903]] this [[H1836]] cause [[H3606]] the king [[H4430]] was angry [[H1149]] and very [[H7690]] furious, [[H7108]] and commanded [[H560]] to destroy [[H7]] all [[H3606]] the wise [[H2445]] of Babylon. [[H895]]

### 13
And the decree [[H1882]] went forth [[H5312]] that the wise [[H2445]] should be slain; [[H6992]] and they sought [[H1156]] Daniel [[H1841]] and his fellows [[H2269]] to be slain. [[H6992]]

### 14
Then [[H116]] Daniel [[H1841]] answered [[H8421]] with counsel [[H5843]] and wisdom [[H2942]] to Arioch [[H746]] the captain [[H7229]] of [[H1768]] the king's [[H4430]] guard, [[H2877]] which [[H1768]] was gone forth [[H5312]] to slay [[H6992]] the wise [[H2445]] of Babylon: [[H895]]

### 15
He answered [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] to Arioch [[H746]] the king's [[H4430]] captain, [[H7990]] Why [[H4101]] the decree [[H1882]] hasty [[H2685]] from [[H4481]] the king? [[H4430]] Then [[H116]] Arioch [[H746]] made the thing [[H4406]] known [[H3046]] to Daniel. [[H1841]]

### 16
Then Daniel [[H1841]] went in, [[H5954]] and desired [[H1156]] of [[H4481]] the king [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] he would give [[H5415]] him time, [[H2166]] and that he would shew [[H2324]] the king [[H4430]] the interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 17
Then [[H116]] Daniel [[H1841]] went [[H236]] to his house, [[H1005]] and made the thing [[H4406]] known [[H3046]] to Hananiah, [[H2608]] Mishael, [[H4333]] and Azariah, [[H5839]] his companions: [[H2269]]

### 18
That they would desire [[H1156]] mercies [[H7359]] of [[H4481]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] concerning [[H5922]] this [[H1836]] secret; [[H7328]] that [[H1768]] Daniel [[H1841]] and his fellows [[H2269]] should not [[H3809]] perish [[H7]] with [[H5974]] the rest [[H7606]] of the wise [[H2445]] of Babylon. [[H895]]

### 19
Then [[H116]] was the secret [[H7328]] revealed [[H1541]] unto Daniel [[H1841]] in a night [[H3916]] vision. [[H2376]] Then [[H116]] Daniel [[H1841]] blessed [[H1289]] the God [[H426]] of heaven. [[H8065]]

### 20
Daniel [[H1841]] answered [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] Blessed [[H1289]] be [[H1934]] the name [[H8036]] of [[H1768]] God [[H426]] for [[H4481]] ever [[H5957]] and ever: [[H5705]] for [[H1768]] wisdom [[H2452]] and might [[H1370]] are [[H1932]] his: [[H1932]]

### 21
And he [[H1932]] changeth [[H8133]] the times [[H5732]] and the seasons: [[H2166]] he removeth [[H5709]] kings, [[H4430]] and setteth up [[H6966]] kings: [[H4430]] he giveth [[H3052]] wisdom [[H2452]] unto the wise, [[H2445]] and knowledge [[H4486]] to them that know [[H3046]] understanding: [[H999]]

### 22
He [[H1932]] revealeth [[H1541]] the deep [[H5994]] and secret things: [[H5642]] he knoweth [[H3046]] what [[H4101]] in the darkness, [[H2816]] and the light [[H5094]] dwelleth [[H8271]] with him. [[H5974]]

### 23
I [[H576]] thank [[H3029]] thee, and praise [[H7624]] thee, O thou God [[H426]] of my fathers, [[H2]] who [[H1768]] hast given [[H3052]] me wisdom [[H2452]] and might, [[H1370]] and hast made known [[H3046]] unto me now [[H3705]] what [[H1768]] we desired [[H1156]] of thee: [[H4481]] for [[H1768]] thou hast made known [[H3046]] unto us the king's [[H4430]] matter. [[H4406]]

### 24
Therefore [[H6903]] Daniel [[H1841]] went in [[H5954]] unto [[H5922]] Arioch, [[H746]] whom [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] had ordained [[H4483]] to destroy [[H7]] the wise [[H2445]] of Babylon: [[H895]] he went [[H236]] and said [[H560]] thus [[H3652]] unto him; Destroy [[H7]] not [[H409]] the wise [[H2445]] of Babylon: [[H895]] bring me in [[H5954]] before [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]] and I will shew [[H2324]] unto the king [[H4430]] the interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 25
Then [[H116]] Arioch [[H746]] brought in [[H5954]] Daniel [[H1841]] before [[H6925]] the king [[H4430]] in haste, [[H927]] and said [[H560]] thus [[H3652]] unto him, I have found [[H7912]] a man [[H1400]] of [[H4481]] the captives [[H1123]] of [[H1768]] Judah, [[H3061]] that [[H1768]] will make known [[H3046]] unto the king [[H4430]] the interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 26
The king [[H4430]] answered [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] to Daniel, [[H1841]] whose [[H1768]] name [[H8036]] Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] Art [[H383]] thou able [[H3546]] to make known [[H3046]] unto me the dream [[H2493]] which [[H1768]] I have seen, [[H2370]] and the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof? [[H6591]]

### 27
Daniel [[H1841]] answered [[H6032]] in the presence of [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]] and said, [[H560]] The secret [[H7328]] which [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] hath demanded [[H7593]] cannot [[H3202]] the wise [[H2445]] the astrologers, [[H826]] the magicians, [[H2749]] the soothsayers, [[H1505]] shew [[H2324]] unto the king; [[H4430]]

### 28
But [[H1297]] there is [[H383]] a God [[H426]] in heaven [[H8065]] that revealeth [[H1541]] secrets, [[H7328]] and maketh known [[H3046]] to the king [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] what [[H4101]] shall be [[H1934]] in the latter [[H320]] days. [[H3118]] Thy dream, [[H2493]] and the visions [[H2376]] of thy head [[H7217]] upon [[H5922]] thy bed, [[H4903]] are these; [[H1836]]

### 29
As for thee, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] thy thoughts [[H7476]] came [[H5559]] upon [[H5922]] thy bed, [[H4903]] what [[H4101]] should come to pass [[H1934]] hereafter: [[H311]] and he that revealeth [[H1541]] secrets [[H7328]] maketh known [[H3046]] to thee what [[H4101]] shall come to pass. [[H1934]]

### 30
But as for me, [[H576]] this [[H1836]] secret [[H7328]] is not [[H3809]] revealed [[H1541]] to me for wisdom [[H2452]] that [[H1768]] I have [[H383]] more than [[H4481]] any [[H3606]] living, [[H2417]] but [[H3861]] for sakes [[H1701]] that [[H5922]] shall make known [[H3046]] the interpretation [[H6591]] to the king, [[H4430]] and that thou mightest know [[H3046]] the thoughts [[H7476]] of thy heart. [[H3825]]

### 31
Thou, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] sawest, [[H1934]] and behold [[H431]] a [[H2298]] great [[H7690]] image. [[H6755]] This [[H1797]] great [[H7229]] image, [[H6755]] whose brightness [[H2122]] excellent, [[H3493]] stood [[H6966]] before [[H6903]] thee; and the form [[H7299]] thereof terrible. [[H1763]]

### 32
This [[H1932]] image's [[H6755]] head [[H7217]] of [[H1768]] fine [[H2869]] gold, [[H1722]] his breast [[H2306]] and his arms [[H1872]] of [[H1768]] silver, [[H3702]] his belly [[H4577]] and his thighs [[H3410]] of [[H1768]] brass, [[H5174]]

### 33
His legs [[H8243]] of [[H1768]] iron, [[H6523]] his feet [[H7271]] part [[H4481]] of [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] and part [[H4481]] of [[H1768]] clay. [[H2635]]

### 34
Thou sawest [[H2370]] till [[H5705]] that [[H1768]] a stone [[H69]] was cut out [[H1505]] without [[H3809]] hands, [[H3028]] which smote [[H4223]] the image [[H6755]] upon [[H5922]] his feet [[H7271]] of [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] and clay, [[H2635]] and brake pieces. [[H1855]] them [[H1994]] to [[H1994]]

### 35
Then [[H116]] was the iron, [[H6523]] the clay, [[H2635]] the brass, [[H5174]] the silver, [[H3702]] and the gold, [[H1722]] broken to pieces [[H1855]] together, [[H2298]] and became [[H1934]] like the chaff [[H5784]] of [[H4481]] the summer [[H7007]] threshingfloors; [[H147]] and the wind [[H7308]] carried away, [[H5376]] them [[H1994]] that [[H3606]] no [[H3809]] place [[H870]] was found [[H7912]] for them: and the stone [[H69]] that [[H1768]] smote [[H4223]] the image [[H6755]] became [[H1934]] a great [[H7229]] mountain, [[H2906]] and filled [[H4391]] the whole [[H3606]] earth. [[H772]]

### 36
This [[H1836]] the dream; [[H2493]] and we will tell [[H560]] the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof before [[H6925]] the king. [[H4430]]

### 37
Thou, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] a king [[H4430]] of kings: [[H4430]] for [[H1768]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] hath given [[H3052]] thee a kingdom, [[H4437]] power, [[H2632]] and strength, [[H8632]] and glory. [[H3367]]

### 38
And wheresoever [[H3606]] the children [[H1123]] of men [[H606]] dwell, [[H1753]] the beasts [[H2423]] of the field [[H1251]] and the fowls [[H5776]] of the heaven [[H8065]] hath he given [[H3052]] into thine hand, [[H3028]] and hath made thee ruler [[H7981]] over them all. [[H3606]] Thou [[H607]] this [[H1932]] head [[H7217]] of [[H1768]] gold. [[H1722]]

### 39
And after [[H870]] thee shall arise [[H6966]] another [[H317]] kingdom [[H4437]] inferior [[H772]] to thee, [[H4481]] and another [[H317]] third [[H8523]] kingdom [[H4437]] of [[H1768]] brass, [[H5174]] which [[H1768]] shall bear rule [[H7981]] over all [[H3606]] the earth. [[H772]]

### 40
And the fourth [[H7244]] kingdom [[H4437]] shall be [[H1934]] strong [[H8624]] as iron: [[H6523]] forasmuch as [[H3606]] iron [[H6523]] breaketh in pieces [[H1855]] and subdueth [[H2827]] all [[H3606]] and as [[H6903]] iron [[H6523]] that [[H1768]] breaketh [[H7490]] all [[H3606]] these, [[H459]] shall it break in pieces [[H1855]] and bruise. [[H7490]]

### 41
And whereas [[H1768]] thou sawest [[H2370]] the feet [[H7271]] and toes, [[H677]] part [[H4481]] of [[H1768]] potters' [[H6353]] clay, [[H2635]] and part [[H4481]] of iron, [[H6523]] the kingdom [[H4437]] shall be [[H1934]] divided; [[H6386]] but there shall be [[H1934]] in it of the strength [[H5326]] of [[H1768]] the iron, [[H6523]] forasmuch as [[H3606]] thou sawest [[H2370]] the iron [[H6523]] mixed [[H6151]] with miry [[H2917]] clay. [[H2635]]

### 42
And the toes [[H677]] of the feet [[H7271]] part [[H4481]] of iron, [[H6523]] and part [[H4480]] of clay, [[H2635]] the kingdom [[H4437]] shall be [[H1934]] partly [[H7118]] strong, [[H8624]] and partly [[H4481]] broken. [[H8406]]

### 43
And whereas [[H1768]] thou sawest [[H2370]] iron [[H6523]] mixed [[H6151]] with miry [[H2917]] clay, [[H2635]] they shall [[H1934]] mingle themselves [[H6151]] with the seed [[H2234]] of men: [[H606]] but they shall [[H1934]] not [[H3809]] cleave [[H1693]] one [[H1836]] to [[H5974]] another, [[H1836]] even [[H1888]] as [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] is not [[H3809]] mixed [[H6151]] with [[H5974]] clay. [[H2635]]

### 44
And in the days [[H3118]] of [[H1768]] these [[H581]] kings [[H4430]] shall the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] set up [[H6966]] a kingdom, [[H4437]] which [[H1768]] shall never [[H5957]] be destroyed: [[H2255]] and the kingdom [[H4437]] shall not [[H3809]] be left [[H7662]] to other [[H321]] people, [[H5972]] it shall break in pieces [[H1855]] and consume [[H5487]] all [[H3606]] these [[H459]] kingdoms, [[H4437]] and it [[H1932]] shall stand [[H6966]] for ever. [[H5957]]

### 45
Forasmuch as [[H3606]] thou sawest [[H2370]] that [[H1768]] the stone [[H69]] was cut out [[H1505]] of the mountain [[H2906]] without [[H3809]] hands, [[H3028]] and that it brake in pieces [[H1855]] the iron, [[H6523]] the brass, [[H5174]] the clay, [[H2635]] the silver, [[H3702]] and the gold; [[H1722]] the great [[H7229]] God [[H426]] hath made known [[H3046]] to the king [[H4430]] what [[H4101]] shall come to pass [[H1934]] hereafter: [[H311]] and the dream [[H2493]] certain, [[H3330]] and the interpretation [[H6591]] thereof sure. [[H540]]

### 46
Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] fell [[H5308]] upon [[H5922]] his face, [[H600]] and worshipped [[H5457]] Daniel, [[H1841]] and commanded [[H560]] that they should offer [[H5260]] an oblation [[H4504]] and sweet odours [[H5208]] unto him. [[H5208]]

### 47
The king [[H4430]] answered [[H6032]] unto Daniel, [[H1841]] and said, [[H560]] Of [[H4481]] a truth [[H7187]] that [[H1768]] your God [[H426]] a God [[H426]] of gods, [[H426]] and a Lord [[H4756]] of kings, [[H4430]] and a revealer [[H1541]] of secrets, [[H7328]] seeing [[H1768]] thou couldest [[H3202]] reveal [[H1541]] this [[H1836]] secret. [[H7328]]

### 48
Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] made man, [[H7236]] Daniel [[H1841]] a great and gave [[H3052]] him many [[H7690]] great [[H7260]] gifts, [[H4978]] and made him ruler [[H7981]] over [[H5922]] the whole [[H3606]] province [[H4083]] of Babylon, [[H895]] and chief [[H7229]] of the governors [[H5460]] over [[H5922]] all [[H3606]] the wise [[H2445]] of Babylon. [[H895]]

### 49
Then Daniel [[H1841]] requested [[H1156]] of [[H4481]] the king, [[H4430]] and he set [[H4483]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abed-nego, [[H5665]] over [[H5922]] the affairs [[H5673]] of [[H1768]] the province [[H4083]] of Babylon: [[H895]] but Daniel [[H1841]] in the gate [[H8651]] of the king. [[H4430]]
