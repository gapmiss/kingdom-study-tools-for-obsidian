### 1
It pleased [[H6925]] Darius [[H1868]] to set [[H6966]] over [[H5922]] the kingdom [[H4437]] an hundred [[H3969]] and twenty [[H6243]] princes, [[H324]] which [[H1768]] should be [[H1934]] over the whole [[H3606]] kingdom; [[H4437]]

### 2
And over [[H5924]] these [[H4481]] three [[H8532]] presidents; [[H5632]] of whom [[H4481]] Daniel [[H1841]] first: [[H2298]] that [[H459]] the princes [[H324]] might [[H1934]] give [[H3052]] accounts [[H2941]] unto them, and the king [[H4430]] should have [[H1934]] no [[H3809]] damage. [[H5142]]

### 3
Then [[H116]] this [[H1836]] Daniel [[H1841]] was [[H1934]] preferred [[H5330]] above [[H5922]] the presidents [[H5632]] and princes, [[H324]] because [[H3606]] an excellent [[H3493]] spirit [[H7308]] in him; and the king [[H4430]] thought [[H6246]] to set [[H6966]] him over [[H5922]] the whole [[H3606]] realm. [[H4437]]

### 4
Then [[H116]] the presidents [[H5632]] and princes [[H324]] sought [[H1934]] to find [[H7912]] occasion [[H5931]] against Daniel [[H1841]] concerning [[H6655]] the kingdom; [[H4437]] but [[H3606]] they could [[H3202]] find [[H7912]] none [[H3809]] occasion [[H5931]] nor fault; [[H7844]] forasmuch [[H6903]] as [[H3606]] he [[H1932]] faithful, [[H540]] neither [[H3809]] was there any [[H3606]] error [[H7960]] or fault [[H7844]] found [[H7912]] in him. [[H5922]]

### 5
Then [[H116]] said [[H560]] these [[H479]] men, [[H1400]] We shall not [[H3809]] find [[H7912]] any [[H3606]] occasion [[H5931]] against [[H5922]] this [[H1836]] Daniel, [[H1841]] except [[H3861]] we find [[H7912]] against him concerning the law [[H1882]] of his God. [[H426]]

### 6
Then [[H116]] these [[H459]] presidents [[H5632]] and princes [[H324]] assembled together [[H7284]] to [[H5922]] the king, [[H4430]] and said [[H560]] thus [[H3652]] unto him, King [[H4430]] Darius, [[H1868]] live [[H2418]] for ever. [[H5957]]

### 7
All [[H3606]] the presidents [[H5632]] of the kingdom, [[H4437]] the governors, [[H5460]] and the princes, [[H324]] the counsellers, [[H1907]] and the captains, [[H6347]] have consulted together [[H3272]] to establish [[H6966]] a royal [[H4430]] statute, [[H7010]] and to make a firm [[H8631]] decree, [[H633]] that [[H1768]] whosoever [[H3606]] shall ask [[H1156]] a petition [[H1159]] of [[H4481]] any [[H3606]] God [[H426]] or man [[H606]] for [[H5705]] thirty [[H8533]] days, [[H3118]] save [[H3861]] of thee, [[H4481]] O king, [[H4430]] he shall be cast [[H7412]] into the den [[H1358]] of lions. [[H744]]

### 8
Now, [[H3705]] O king, [[H4430]] establish [[H6966]] the decree, [[H633]] and sign [[H7560]] the writing, [[H3792]] that [[H1768]] it be not [[H3809]] changed, [[H8133]] according to the law [[H1882]] of the Medes [[H4076]] and Persians, [[H6540]] which [[H1768]] altereth [[H5709]] not. [[H3809]]

### 9
Wherefore [[H1836]] king [[H4430]] Darius [[H1868]] signed [[H7560]] the writing [[H3792]] and the decree. [[H633]]

### 10
Now when [[H1768]] Daniel [[H1841]] knew [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the writing [[H3792]] was signed, [[H7560]] he went [[H5954]] into his house; [[H1005]] and his windows [[H3551]] being open [[H6606]] in his chamber [[H5952]] toward [[H5049]] Jerusalem, [[H3390]] he [[H1932]] kneeled [[H1289]] upon [[H5922]] his knees [[H1291]] three [[H8532]] times [[H2166]] a day, [[H3118]] and prayed, [[H6739]] and gave thanks [[H3029]] before [[H6925]] his God, [[H426]] as [[H6903]] he did [[H1934]] aforetime. [[H1836]]

### 11
Then [[H116]] these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] assembled, [[H7284]] and found [[H7912]] Daniel [[H1841]] praying [[H1156]] and making supplication [[H2604]] before [[H6925]] his God. [[H426]]

### 12
Then [[H116]] they came near, [[H7127]] and spake [[H560]] before [[H6925]] the king [[H4430]] concerning [[H5922]] the king's [[H4430]] decree; [[H633]] Hast thou not [[H3809]] signed [[H7560]] a decree, [[H633]] that [[H1768]] every [[H3606]] man [[H606]] that [[H1768]] shall ask [[H1156]] of [[H4481]] any [[H3606]] God [[H426]] or man [[H606]] within [[H5705]] thirty [[H8533]] days, [[H3118]] save [[H3861]] of thee, [[H4481]] O king, [[H4430]] shall be cast [[H7412]] into the den [[H1358]] of lions? [[H744]] The king [[H4430]] answered [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] The thing [[H4406]] true, [[H3330]] according to the law [[H1882]] of the Medes [[H4076]] and Persians, [[H6540]] which [[H1768]] altereth [[H5709]] not. [[H3809]]

### 13
Then [[H116]] answered [[H6032]] they and said [[H560]] before [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]] That [[H1768]] Daniel, [[H1841]] which [[H1768]] of [[H4481]] the children [[H1123]] of the captivity [[H1547]] of [[H1768]] Judah, [[H3061]] regardeth [[H7761]] not [[H3809]] thee, [[H5922]] O king, [[H4430]] nor the decree [[H633]] that [[H1768]] thou hast signed, [[H7560]] but maketh [[H1156]] his petition [[H1159]] three [[H8532]] times [[H2166]] a day. [[H3118]]

### 14
Then [[H116]] the king, [[H4430]] when [[H1768]] he heard [[H8086]] words, [[H4406]] was sore [[H7690]] displeased [[H888]] with [[H5922]] himself, and set [[H7761]] heart [[H1079]] on [[H5922]] Daniel [[H1841]] to deliver [[H7804]] him: and he laboured [[H1934]] till [[H5705]] the going down [[H4606]] of the sun [[H8122]] to deliver [[H5338]] him. [[H5338]]

### 15
Then [[H116]] these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] assembled [[H7284]] unto [[H5922]] the king, [[H4430]] and said [[H560]] unto the king, [[H4430]] Know, [[H3046]] O king, [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] the law [[H1882]] of the Medes [[H4076]] and Persians [[H6540]] That [[H1768]] no [[H3606]] decree [[H633]] nor statute [[H7010]] which [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] establisheth [[H6966]] may be changed. [[H8133]]

### 16
Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] commanded, [[H560]] and they brought [[H858]] Daniel, [[H1841]] and cast [[H7412]] into the den [[H1358]] of [[H1768]] lions. [[H744]] the king [[H4430]] spake [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] unto Daniel, [[H1841]] Thy God [[H426]] whom [[H1768]] thou [[H607]] servest [[H6399]] continually, [[H8411]] he [[H1932]] will deliver [[H7804]] thee. [[H7804]]

### 17
And a [[H2298]] stone [[H69]] was brought, [[H858]] and laid [[H7761]] upon [[H5922]] the mouth [[H6433]] of the den; [[H1358]] and the king [[H4430]] sealed [[H2857]] it with his own signet, [[H5824]] and with the signet [[H5824]] of his lords; [[H7261]] that [[H1768]] the purpose [[H6640]] might not [[H3809]] be changed [[H8133]] concerning Daniel. [[H1841]]

### 18
Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] went [[H236]] to his palace, [[H1965]] and passed the night [[H956]] fasting: [[H2908]] neither [[H3809]] were instruments of musick [[H1761]] brought [[H5954]] before [[H6925]] him: and his sleep [[H8139]] went [[H5075]] from him. [[H5922]]

### 19
Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] arose [[H6966]] very early [[H8238]] in the morning, [[H5053]] and went [[H236]] in haste [[H927]] unto the den [[H1358]] of [[H1768]] lions. [[H744]]

### 20
And when he came [[H7127]] to the den, [[H1358]] he cried [[H2200]] with a lamentable [[H6088]] voice [[H7032]] unto Daniel: [[H1841]] the king [[H4430]] spake [[H6032]] and said [[H560]] to Daniel, [[H1841]] O Daniel, [[H1841]] servant [[H5649]] of the living [[H2417]] God, [[H426]] is thy God, [[H426]] whom [[H1768]] thou [[H607]] servest [[H6399]] continually, [[H8411]] able [[H3202]] to deliver [[H7804]] thee from [[H4481]] the lions? [[H744]]

### 21
Then [[H116]] said [[H4449]] Daniel [[H1841]] unto [[H5974]] the king, [[H4430]] O king, [[H4430]] live [[H2418]] for ever. [[H5957]]

### 22
My God [[H426]] hath sent [[H7972]] his angel, [[H4398]] and hath shut [[H5463]] the lions' [[H744]] mouths, [[H6433]] that they have not [[H3809]] hurt [[H2255]] me: forasmuch as [[H3606]] before [[H6925]] him innocency [[H2136]] was found [[H7912]] in me; and also [[H638]] before [[H6925]] thee, O king, [[H4430]] have I done [[H5648]] no [[H3809]] hurt. [[H2248]]

### 23
Then [[H116]] was the king [[H4430]] exceeding [[H7690]] glad [[H2868]] for him, [[H5922]] and commanded [[H560]] that they should take up [[H5267]] Daniel [[H1841]] out of [[H4481]] the den. [[H1358]] So Daniel [[H1841]] was taken up [[H5267]] out of [[H4481]] the den, [[H1358]] and no [[H3809]] manner [[H3606]] of hurt [[H2257]] was found [[H7912]] upon him, because [[H1768]] he believed [[H540]] in his God. [[H426]]

### 24
And the king [[H4430]] commanded, [[H560]] and they brought [[H858]] those [[H479]] men [[H1400]] which [[H1768]] had accused [[H399]] Daniel, [[H1841]] and they cast [[H7412]] into the den [[H1358]] of lions, [[H744]] them, [[H581]] their children, [[H1123]] and their wives; [[H5389]] and the lions [[H744]] had the mastery [[H5705]] of them, and brake pieces [[H1855]] all [[H3606]] their bones [[H1635]] in or ever [[H3809]] they came [[H4291]] at the bottom [[H773]] of the den. [[H1358]]

### 25
Then [[H116]] king [[H4430]] Darius [[H1868]] wrote [[H3790]] unto all [[H3606]] people, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and languages, [[H3961]] that [[H1768]] dwell [[H1753]] in all [[H3606]] the earth; [[H772]] Peace [[H8001]] be multiplied [[H7680]] unto you. [[H7680]]

### 26
I make [[H7761]] a decree, [[H2942]] That [[H1768]] in every [[H3606]] dominion [[H7985]] of my kingdom [[H4437]] men tremble [[H1934]] and fear [[H1763]] before [[H6925]] the God [[H426]] of [[H1768]] Daniel: [[H1841]] for [[H1768]] he [[H1932]] the living [[H2417]] God, [[H426]] and stedfast [[H7011]] for ever, [[H5957]] and his kingdom [[H4437]] which [[H1768]] shall not [[H3809]] be destroyed, [[H2255]] and his dominion [[H7985]] unto [[H5705]] the end. [[H5491]]

### 27
He delivereth [[H7804]] and rescueth, [[H5338]] and he worketh [[H5648]] signs [[H852]] and wonders [[H8540]] in heaven [[H8065]] and in earth, [[H772]] who [[H1768]] hath delivered [[H7804]] Daniel [[H1841]] from [[H4481]] the power [[H3028]] of the lions. [[H744]]

### 28
So this [[H1836]] Daniel [[H1841]] prospered [[H6744]] in the reign [[H4437]] of Darius, [[H1868]] and in the reign [[H4437]] of Cyrus [[H3567]] the Persian. [[H6543]]
