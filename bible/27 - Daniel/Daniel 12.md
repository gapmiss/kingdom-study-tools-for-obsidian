### 1
And at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] shall Michael [[H4317]] stand up, [[H5975]] the great [[H1419]] prince [[H8269]] which standeth [[H5975]] for [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of thy people: [[H5971]] and there shall be [[H1961]] a time [[H6256]] of trouble, [[H6869]] such as [[H834]] never [[H3808]] was [[H1961]] since there was [[H1961]] a nation [[H1471]] to [[H5704]] that same [[H1931]] time: [[H6256]] and at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] thy people [[H5971]] shall be delivered, [[H4422]] every one [[H3605]] that shall be found [[H4672]] written [[H3789]] in the book. [[H5612]]

### 2
And many [[H7227]] of them that sleep [[H3463]] in the dust [[H6083]] of the earth [[H127]] shall awake, [[H6974]] some [[H428]] to everlasting [[H5769]] life, [[H2416]] and some [[H428]] to shame [[H2781]] everlasting [[H5769]] contempt. [[H1860]]

### 3
And they that be wise [[H7919]] shall shine [[H2094]] as the brightness [[H2096]] of the firmament; [[H7549]] and they that turn many [[H7227]] to righteousness [[H6663]] as the stars [[H3556]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

### 4
But thou, [[H859]] O Daniel, [[H1840]] shut up [[H5640]] the words, [[H1697]] and seal [[H2856]] the book, [[H5612]] to [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] of the end: [[H7093]] many [[H7227]] shall run to and fro, [[H7751]] and knowledge [[H1847]] shall be increased. [[H7235]]

### 5
Then I [[H589]] Daniel [[H1840]] looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there stood [[H5975]] other [[H312]] two, [[H8147]] the one [[H259]] on this side [[H2008]] of the bank [[H8193]] of the river, [[H2975]] and the other [[H259]] on that side [[H2008]] of the bank [[H8193]] of the river. [[H2975]]

### 6
And said [[H559]] to the man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] which [[H834]] upon [[H4605]] the waters [[H4325]] of the river, [[H2975]] How long [[H5704]] the end [[H7093]] of these wonders? [[H6382]]

### 7
And I heard [[H8085]] the man [[H376]] clothed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] which [[H834]] upon [[H4605]] the waters [[H4325]] of the river, [[H2975]] when he held up [[H7311]] his right hand [[H3225]] and his left hand [[H8040]] unto [[H413]] heaven, [[H8064]] and sware [[H7650]] by him that liveth [[H2416]] for ever [[H5769]] that [[H3588]] for a time, [[H4150]] times, [[H4150]] and an half; [[H2677]] and when he shall have accomplished [[H3615]] to scatter [[H5310]] the power [[H3027]] of the holy [[H6944]] people, [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] shall be finished. [[H3615]]

### 8
And I [[H589]] heard, [[H8085]] but I understood [[H995]] not: [[H3808]] then said [[H559]] I, O my Lord, [[H113]] what [[H4100]] the end [[H319]] of these [[H428]]

### 9
And he said, [[H559]] Go thy way, [[H1980]] Daniel: [[H1840]] for [[H3588]] the words [[H1697]] closed up [[H5640]] and sealed [[H2856]] till [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] of the end. [[H7093]]

### 10
Many [[H7227]] shall be purified, [[H1305]] and made white, [[H3835]] and tried; [[H6884]] but the wicked [[H7563]] shall do wickedly: [[H7561]] and none [[H3808]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall understand; [[H995]] but the wise [[H7919]] shall understand. [[H995]]

### 11
And from the time [[H6256]] the daily [[H8548]] shall be taken away, [[H5493]] and the abomination [[H8251]] that maketh desolate [[H8074]] set up, [[H5414]] a thousand [[H505]] two hundred [[H3967]] and ninety [[H8673]] days. [[H3117]]

### 12
Blessed [[H835]] he that waiteth, [[H2442]] and cometh [[H5060]] to the thousand [[H505]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] and five [[H2568]] and thirty [[H7970]] days. [[H3117]]

### 13
But go thou thy way [[H859]] till the end [[H7093]] for thou shalt rest, [[H5117]] and stand [[H5975]] in thy lot [[H1486]] at the end [[H7093]] of the days. [[H3117]]
