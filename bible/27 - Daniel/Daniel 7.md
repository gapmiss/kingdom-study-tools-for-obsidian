### 1
In the first [[H2298]] year [[H8140]] of Belshazzar [[H1113]] king [[H4430]] of Babylon [[H895]] Daniel [[H1841]] had [[H2370]] a dream [[H2493]] and visions [[H2376]] of his head [[H7217]] upon [[H5922]] his bed: [[H4903]] then [[H116]] he wrote [[H3790]] the dream, [[H2493]] told [[H560]] the sum [[H7217]] of the matters. [[H4406]]

### 2
Daniel [[H1841]] spake [[H6032]] and said, [[H560]] I saw [[H2370]] in my vision [[H2376]] by [[H5974]] night, [[H3916]] and, behold, [[H718]] the four [[H703]] winds [[H7308]] of the heaven [[H8065]] strove [[H1519]] upon the great [[H7229]] sea. [[H3221]]

### 3
And four [[H703]] great [[H7260]] beasts [[H2423]] came up [[H5559]] from [[H4481]] the sea, [[H3221]] diverse [[H8133]] one [[H1668]] from [[H4481]] another. [[H1668]]

### 4
The first [[H6933]] like a lion, [[H744]] and had eagle's [[H5403]] wings: [[H1611]] I beheld [[H1934]] till [[H5705]] the wings [[H1611]] thereof were plucked, [[H4804]] and it was lifted up [[H5191]] from [[H4481]] the earth, [[H772]] and made stand [[H6966]] upon [[H5922]] the feet [[H7271]] as a man, [[H606]] and a man's [[H606]] heart [[H3825]] was given [[H3052]] to it. [[H3052]]

### 5
And behold [[H718]] another [[H317]] beast, [[H2423]] a second, [[H8578]] like [[H1821]] to a bear, [[H1678]] and it raised up [[H6966]] itself on one [[H2298]] side, [[H7859]] and three [[H8532]] ribs [[H5967]] in the mouth [[H6433]] of it between [[H997]] the teeth [[H8128]] of it: and they said [[H560]] thus [[H3652]] unto it, Arise, [[H6966]] devour [[H399]] much [[H7690]] flesh. [[H1321]]

### 6
After [[H870]] this [[H1836]] I beheld, [[H1934]] and lo [[H718]] another, [[H317]] like a leopard, [[H5245]] which had upon [[H5922]] the back [[H1355]] of it four [[H703]] wings [[H1611]] of [[H1768]] a fowl; [[H5776]] the beast [[H2423]] had also four [[H703]] heads; [[H7217]] and dominion [[H7985]] was given [[H3052]] to it. [[H3052]]

### 7
After [[H870]] this [[H1836]] I saw [[H1934]] in the night [[H3916]] visions, [[H2376]] and behold [[H718]] a fourth [[H7244]] beast, [[H2423]] dreadful [[H1763]] and terrible, [[H574]] and strong [[H8624]] exceedingly; [[H3493]] and it had great [[H7260]] iron [[H6523]] teeth: [[H8128]] it devoured [[H399]] and brake in pieces, [[H1855]] and stamped [[H7512]] the residue [[H7606]] with the feet [[H7271]] of it: and it [[H1932]] diverse [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] all [[H3606]] the beasts [[H2423]] that [[H1768]] before [[H6925]] it; and it had ten [[H6236]] horns. [[H7162]]

### 8
I considered [[H1934]] the horns, [[H7162]] and, behold, [[H431]] there came up [[H5559]] among [[H997]] them another [[H317]] little [[H2192]] horn, [[H7162]] before [[H6925]] whom there were three [[H8532]] of [[H4481]] the first [[H6933]] horns [[H7162]] plucked up by the roots: [[H6132]] and, behold, [[H431]] in this [[H1668]] horn [[H7162]] eyes [[H5870]] like the eyes [[H5870]] of man, [[H606]] and a mouth [[H6433]] speaking [[H4449]] great things. [[H7260]]

### 9
I beheld [[H1934]] till [[H5705]] the thrones [[H3764]] were cast down, [[H7412]] and the Ancient [[H6268]] of days [[H3118]] did sit, [[H3488]] whose garment [[H3831]] white [[H2358]] as snow, [[H8517]] and the hair [[H8177]] of his head [[H7217]] like the pure [[H5343]] wool: [[H6015]] his throne [[H3764]] the fiery [[H5135]] flame, [[H7631]] his wheels [[H1535]] burning [[H1815]] fire. [[H5135]]

### 10
A fiery [[H5135]] stream [[H5103]] issued [[H5047]] and came forth [[H5312]] from [[H4481]] before [[H6925]] him: thousand [[H506]] thousands [[H506]] ministered [[H8120]] unto him, and ten thousand [[H7240]] times ten thousand [[H7240]] stood [[H6966]] before [[H6925]] him: the judgment [[H1780]] was set, [[H3488]] and the books [[H5609]] were opened. [[H6606]]

### 11
I beheld [[H1934]] then [[H116]] because of [[H4481]] the voice [[H7032]] of the great [[H7260]] words [[H4406]] which [[H1768]] the horn [[H7162]] spake: [[H4449]] I beheld [[H1934]] till [[H5705]] the beast [[H2423]] was slain, [[H6992]] and his body [[H1655]] destroyed, [[H7]] and given [[H3052]] to the burning [[H3346]] flame. [[H785]]

### 12
As concerning the rest [[H7606]] of the beasts, [[H2423]] they had their dominion [[H7985]] taken away: [[H5709]] yet their lives [[H2417]] were prolonged [[H3052]] for [[H5705]] a season [[H2166]] and time. [[H5732]]

### 13
I saw [[H1934]] in the night [[H3916]] visions, [[H2376]] and, behold, [[H718]] like the Son [[H1247]] of man [[H606]] came [[H858]] with [[H5974]] the clouds [[H6050]] of heaven, [[H8065]] and came [[H4291]] to [[H5705]] the Ancient [[H6268]] of days, [[H3118]] and they brought him near [[H7127]] before [[H6925]] him. [[H6925]]

### 14
And there was given [[H3052]] him dominion, [[H7985]] and glory, [[H3367]] and a kingdom, [[H4437]] that all [[H3606]] people, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and languages, [[H3961]] should serve [[H6399]] him: his dominion [[H7985]] an everlasting [[H5957]] dominion, [[H7985]] which [[H1768]] shall not [[H3809]] pass away, [[H5709]] and his kingdom [[H4437]] which [[H1768]] shall not [[H3809]] be destroyed. [[H2255]]

### 15
I [[H576]] Daniel [[H1841]] was grieved [[H3735]] in my spirit [[H7308]] in the midst [[H1459]] of body, [[H5085]] and the visions [[H2376]] of my head [[H7217]] troubled [[H927]] me. [[H927]]

### 16
I came near [[H7127]] unto [[H5922]] one [[H2298]] of [[H4481]] them that stood by, [[H6966]] and asked [[H1156]] him [[H4481]] the truth [[H3330]] of [[H5922]] all [[H3606]] this. [[H1836]] So he told [[H560]] me, and made me know [[H3046]] the interpretation [[H6591]] of the things. [[H4406]]

### 17
These [[H459]] great [[H7260]] beasts, [[H2423]] which [[H581]] are four, [[H703]] four [[H703]] kings, [[H4430]] shall arise [[H6966]] out of [[H4481]] the earth. [[H772]]

### 18
But the saints [[H6922]] of the most High [[H5946]] shall take [[H6902]] the kingdom, [[H4437]] and possess [[H2631]] the kingdom [[H4437]] for [[H5705]] ever, [[H5957]] even for [[H5705]] ever [[H5957]] and ever. [[H5957]]

### 19
Then [[H116]] I would [[H6634]] know the truth [[H3321]] of [[H5922]] the fourth [[H7244]] beast, [[H2423]] which [[H1768]] was [[H1934]] diverse [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] all [[H3606]] the others, exceeding [[H3493]] dreadful, [[H1763]] whose teeth [[H8128]] iron, [[H6523]] and his nails [[H2953]] brass; [[H5174]] devoured, [[H399]] brake in pieces, [[H1855]] and stamped [[H7512]] the residue [[H7606]] with his feet; [[H7271]]

### 20
And of [[H5922]] the ten [[H6236]] horns [[H7162]] that [[H1768]] in his head, [[H7217]] and the other [[H317]] which [[H1768]] came up, [[H5559]] and before [[H6925]]  whom [[H4481]] three [[H8532]] fell; [[H5308]] even that [[H1797]] horn [[H7162]] that had eyes, [[H5870]] and a mouth [[H6433]] that spake [[H4449]] very great things, [[H7260]] whose look [[H2376]] more stout [[H7229]] than [[H4481]] his fellows. [[H2273]]

### 21
I beheld, [[H1934]] and the same [[H1797]] horn [[H7162]] made [[H5648]] war [[H7129]] with [[H5974]] the saints, [[H6922]] and prevailed [[H3202]] against them; [[H3202]]

### 22
Until [[H5705]] the Ancient [[H6268]] of days [[H3118]] came, [[H858]] and judgment [[H1780]] was given [[H3052]] to the saints [[H6922]] of the most High; [[H5946]] and the time [[H2166]] came [[H4291]] that the saints [[H6922]] possessed [[H2631]] the kingdom. [[H4437]]

### 23
Thus [[H3652]] he said, [[H560]] The fourth [[H7244]] beast [[H2423]] shall be [[H1934]] the fourth [[H7244]] kingdom [[H4437]] upon earth, [[H772]] which [[H1768]] shall be diverse [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] all [[H3606]] kingdoms, [[H4437]] and shall devour [[H399]] the whole [[H3606]] earth, [[H772]] and shall tread it down, [[H1759]] and break it in pieces. [[H1855]]

### 24
And the ten [[H6236]] horns [[H7162]] out of [[H4481]] this kingdom [[H4437]] ten [[H6236]] kings [[H4430]] shall arise: [[H6966]] and another [[H321]] shall rise [[H6966]] after [[H311]] them; and he [[H1932]] shall be diverse [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] the first, [[H6933]] and he shall subdue [[H8214]] three [[H8532]] kings. [[H4430]]

### 25
And he shall speak [[H4449]] words [[H4406]] against [[H6655]] the most High, [[H5943]] and shall wear out [[H1080]] the saints [[H6922]] of the most High, [[H5946]] and think [[H5452]] to change [[H8133]] times [[H2166]] and laws: [[H1882]] and they shall be given [[H3052]] into his hand [[H3028]] until [[H5705]] a time [[H5732]] and times [[H5732]] and the dividing [[H6387]] of time. [[H5732]]

### 26
But the judgment [[H1780]] shall sit, [[H3488]] and they shall take away [[H5709]] his dominion, [[H7985]] to consume [[H8046]] and to destroy [[H7]] unto [[H5705]] the end. [[H5491]]

### 27
And the kingdom [[H4437]] and dominion, [[H7985]] and the greatness [[H7238]] of [[H1768]] the kingdom [[H4437]] under [[H8460]] the whole [[H3606]] heaven, [[H8065]] shall be given [[H3052]] to the people [[H5972]] of the saints [[H6922]] of the most High, [[H5946]] whose kingdom [[H4437]] an everlasting [[H5957]] kingdom, [[H4437]] and all [[H3606]] dominions [[H7985]] shall serve [[H6399]] and obey [[H8086]] him. [[H8086]]

### 28
Hitherto [[H5705]] the end [[H5491]] of [[H1768]] the matter. [[H4406]] As for me [[H576]] Daniel, [[H1841]] my cogitations [[H7476]] much [[H7690]] troubled [[H927]] me, and my countenance [[H2122]] changed [[H8133]] in me: [[H5922]] but I kept [[H5202]] the matter [[H4406]] in my heart. [[H3821]]
