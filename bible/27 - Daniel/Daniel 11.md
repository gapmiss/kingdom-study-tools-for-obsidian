### 1
Also I [[H589]] in the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Darius [[H1867]] the Mede, [[H4075]] I, stood [[H5975]] to confirm [[H2388]] and to strengthen [[H4581]] him. [[H4581]]

### 2
And now [[H6258]] will I shew [[H5046]] thee the truth. [[H571]] Behold, [[H2009]] there shall stand up [[H5975]] yet [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] kings [[H4428]] in Persia; [[H6539]] and the fourth [[H7243]] shall be far [[H6239]] richer [[H6238]] than all: [[H1419]] and by his strength [[H2393]] through his riches [[H6239]] he shall stir up [[H5782]] all [[H3605]] against [[H853]] the realm [[H4438]] of Grecia. [[H3120]]

### 3
And a mighty [[H1368]] king [[H4428]] shall stand up, [[H5975]] that shall rule [[H4910]] with great [[H7227]] dominion, [[H4474]] and do [[H6213]] according to his will. [[H7522]]

### 4
And when he shall stand up, [[H5975]] his kingdom [[H4438]] shall be broken, [[H7665]] and shall be divided [[H2673]] toward the four [[H702]] winds [[H7307]] of heaven; [[H8064]] and not [[H3808]] to his posterity, [[H319]] nor [[H3808]] according to his dominion [[H4915]] which [[H834]] he ruled: [[H4910]] for [[H3588]] his kingdom [[H4438]] shall be plucked up, [[H5428]] even for others [[H312]] beside [[H905]] those. [[H905]]

### 5
And the king [[H4428]] of the south [[H5045]] shall be strong, [[H2388]] and of [[H4480]] his princes; [[H8269]] and he shall be strong [[H2388]] above [[H5921]] him, and have dominion; [[H4910]] his dominion [[H4474]] a great [[H7227]] dominion. [[H4475]]

### 6
And in the end [[H7093]] of years [[H8141]] they shall join themselves together; [[H2266]] for the king's [[H4428]] daughter [[H1323]] of the south [[H5045]] shall come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of the north [[H6828]] to make [[H6213]] an agreement: [[H4339]] but she shall not [[H3808]] retain [[H6113]] the power [[H3581]] of the arm; [[H2220]] neither [[H3808]] shall he stand, [[H5975]] nor his arm: [[H2220]] but she [[H1931]] shall be given up, [[H5414]] and they that brought [[H935]] her, and he that begat [[H3205]] her, and he that strengthened [[H2388]] her in times. [[H6256]]

### 7
But out of a branch [[H5342]] of her roots [[H8328]] shall stand up [[H5975]] in his estate, [[H3653]] which shall come [[H935]] with [[H413]] an army, [[H2428]] and shall enter [[H935]] into the fortress [[H4581]] of the king [[H4428]] of the north, [[H6828]] and shall deal [[H6213]] against them, and shall prevail: [[H2388]]

### 8
And shall also [[H1571]] carry [[H935]] captives [[H7628]] into Egypt [[H4714]] their gods, [[H430]] with [[H5973]] their princes, [[H5257]] with [[H5973]] their precious [[H2532]] vessels [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and of gold; [[H2091]] and he [[H1931]] shall continue [[H5975]] years [[H8141]] than the king [[H4428]] of the north. [[H6828]]

### 9
So the king [[H4428]] of the south [[H5045]] shall come [[H935]] into kingdom, [[H4438]] and shall return [[H7725]] into [[H413]] his own land. [[H127]]

### 10
But his sons [[H1121]] shall be stirred up, [[H1624]] and shall assemble [[H622]] a multitude [[H1995]] of great [[H7227]] forces: [[H2428]] and shall certainly [[H935]] come, [[H935]] and overflow, [[H7857]] and pass through: [[H5674]] then shall he return, [[H7725]] and be stirred up, [[H1624]] to [[H5704]] his fortress. [[H4581]]

### 11
And the king [[H4428]] of the south [[H5045]] shall be moved with choler, [[H4843]] and shall come forth [[H3318]] and fight [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] him, with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] of the north: [[H6828]] and he shall set forth [[H5975]] a great [[H7227]] multitude; [[H1995]] but the multitude [[H1995]] shall be given [[H5414]] into his hand. [[H3027]]

### 12
when he hath taken away [[H5375]] the multitude, [[H1995]] his heart [[H3824]] shall be lifted up; [[H7311]] and he shall cast down [[H5307]] ten thousands: [[H7239]] but he shall not [[H3808]] be strengthened [[H5810]]

### 13
For the king [[H4428]] of the north [[H6828]] shall return, [[H7725]] and shall set forth [[H5975]] a multitude [[H1995]] greater [[H7227]] than [[H4480]] the former, [[H7223]] and shall certainly [[H935]] come [[H935]] after [[H7093]] certain [[H6256]] years [[H8141]] with a great [[H1419]] army [[H2428]] and with much [[H7227]] riches. [[H7399]]

### 14
And in those [[H1992]] times [[H6256]] there shall many [[H7227]] stand up [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of the south: [[H5045]] also the robbers [[H1121]] of thy people [[H5971]] shall exalt themselves [[H5375]] to establish [[H5975]] the vision; [[H2377]] but they shall fall. [[H3782]]

### 15
So the king [[H4428]] of the north [[H6828]] shall come, [[H935]] and cast up [[H8210]] a mount, [[H5550]] and take [[H3920]] the most fenced [[H4013]] cities: [[H5892]] and the arms [[H2220]] of the south [[H5045]] shall not [[H3808]] withstand, [[H5975]] neither his chosen [[H4005]] people, [[H5971]] neither [[H369]] strength [[H3581]] to withstand. [[H5975]]

### 16
But he that cometh [[H935]] against [[H413]] him shall do [[H6213]] according to his own will, [[H7522]] and none [[H369]] shall stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him: and he shall stand [[H5975]] in the glorious [[H6643]] land, [[H776]] which by his hand [[H3027]] shall be consumed. [[H3615]]

### 17
He shall also set [[H7760]] his face [[H6440]] to enter [[H935]] with the strength [[H8633]] of his whole [[H3605]] kingdom, [[H4438]] and upright ones [[H3477]] with [[H5973]] him; thus shall he do: [[H6213]] and he shall give [[H5414]] him the daughter [[H1323]] of women, [[H802]] corrupting [[H7843]] her: but she shall not [[H3808]] stand [[H5975]] neither [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] for him. [[H1961]]

### 18
After this shall he turn [[H7725]] his face [[H6440]] unto the isles, [[H339]] and shall take [[H3920]] many: [[H7227]] but a prince [[H7101]] for his own behalf shall cause the reproach [[H2781]] offered by him to cease; [[H7673]] without [[H1115]] his own reproach [[H2781]] he shall cause to turn [[H7725]] upon him. [[H7725]]

### 19
Then he shall turn [[H7725]] his face [[H6440]] toward the fort [[H4581]] of his own land: [[H776]] but he shall stumble [[H3782]] and fall, [[H5307]] and not [[H3808]] be found. [[H4672]]

### 20
Then shall stand up [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] his estate [[H3653]] a raiser [[H5674]] of taxes [[H5065]] the glory [[H1925]] of the kingdom: [[H4438]] but within few [[H259]] days [[H3117]] he shall be destroyed, [[H7665]] neither [[H3808]] in anger, [[H639]] nor [[H3808]] in battle. [[H4421]]

### 21
And in [[H5921]] his estate [[H3653]] shall stand up [[H5975]] a vile person, [[H959]] to [[H5921]] whom they shall not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] the honour [[H1935]] of the kingdom: [[H4438]] but he shall come in [[H935]] peaceably, [[H7962]] and obtain [[H2388]] the kingdom [[H4438]] by flatteries. [[H2519]]

### 22
And with the arms [[H2220]] of a flood [[H7858]] shall they be overflown [[H7857]] from before [[H6440]] him, and shall be broken; [[H7665]] yea, also [[H1571]] the prince [[H5057]] of the covenant. [[H1285]]

### 23
And after [[H4480]] the league [[H2266]] with [[H413]] him he shall work [[H6213]] deceitfully: [[H4820]] for he shall come up, [[H5927]] and shall become strong [[H6105]] with a small [[H4592]] people. [[H1471]]

### 24
He shall enter [[H935]] peaceably [[H7962]] even upon the fattest places [[H4924]] of the province; [[H4082]] and he shall do [[H6213]] which [[H834]] his fathers [[H1]] have not [[H3808]] done, [[H6213]] nor his fathers' [[H1]] fathers; [[H1]] he shall scatter [[H967]] among them the prey, [[H961]] and spoil, [[H7998]] and riches: [[H7399]] and he shall forecast [[H2803]] his devices [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] the strong holds, [[H4013]] even for [[H5704]] a time. [[H6256]]

### 25
And he shall stir up [[H5782]] his power [[H3581]] and his courage [[H3824]] against [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of the south [[H5045]] with a great [[H1419]] army; [[H2428]] and the king [[H4428]] of the south [[H5045]] shall be stirred up [[H1624]] to battle [[H4421]] with a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] and mighty [[H6099]] army; [[H2428]] but he shall not [[H3808]] stand: [[H5975]] for [[H3588]] they shall forecast [[H2803]] devices [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 26
Yea, they that feed [[H398]] of the portion of his meat [[H6598]] shall destroy [[H7665]] him, and his army [[H2428]] shall overflow: [[H7857]] and many [[H7227]] shall fall down [[H5307]] slain. [[H2491]]

### 27
And both [[H8147]] these kings' [[H4428]] hearts [[H3824]] to do mischief, [[H4827]] and they shall speak [[H1696]] lies [[H3577]] at [[H5921]] one [[H259]] table; [[H7979]] but it shall not [[H3808]] prosper: [[H6743]] for [[H3588]] yet [[H5750]] the end [[H7093]] at the time appointed. [[H4150]]

### 28
Then shall he return [[H7725]] into his land [[H776]] with great [[H1419]] riches; [[H7399]] and his heart [[H3824]] against [[H5921]] the holy [[H6944]] covenant; [[H1285]] and he shall do [[H6213]] and return [[H7725]] to his own land. [[H776]]

### 29
At the time appointed [[H4150]] he shall return, [[H7725]] and come [[H935]] toward the south; [[H5045]] but it shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] as the former, [[H7223]] or as the latter. [[H314]]

### 30
For the ships [[H6716]] of Chittim [[H3794]] shall come [[H935]] against him: therefore he shall be grieved, [[H3512]] and return, [[H7725]] and have indignation [[H2194]] against [[H5921]] the holy [[H6944]] covenant: [[H1285]] so shall he do; [[H6213]] he shall even return, [[H7725]] and have intelligence [[H995]] with [[H5921]] them that forsake [[H5800]] the holy [[H6944]] covenant. [[H1285]]

### 31
And arms [[H2220]] shall stand [[H5975]] on his part, [[H4480]] and they shall pollute [[H2490]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] of strength, [[H4581]] and shall take away [[H5493]] the daily [[H8548]] and they shall place [[H5414]] the abomination [[H8251]] that maketh desolate. [[H8074]]

### 32
And such as do wickedly against [[H7561]] the covenant [[H1285]] shall he corrupt [[H2610]] by flatteries: [[H2514]] but the people [[H5971]] that do know [[H3045]] their God [[H430]] shall be strong, [[H2388]] and do [[H6213]]

### 33
And they that understand [[H7919]] among the people [[H5971]] shall instruct [[H995]] many: [[H7227]] yet they shall fall [[H3782]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and by flame, [[H3852]] by captivity, [[H7628]] and by spoil, [[H961]] days. [[H3117]]

### 34
Now when they shall fall, [[H3782]] they shall be holpen [[H5826]] with a little [[H4592]] help: [[H5828]] but many [[H7227]] shall cleave [[H3867]] to [[H5921]] them with flatteries. [[H2519]]

### 35
And of [[H4480]] them of understanding [[H7919]] shall fall, [[H3782]] to try [[H6884]] them, and to purge, [[H1305]] and to make white, [[H3835]] to [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] of the end: [[H7093]] because [[H3588]] yet [[H5750]] for a time appointed. [[H4150]]

### 36
And the king [[H4428]] shall do [[H6213]] according to his will; [[H7522]] and he shall exalt himself, [[H7311]] and magnify himself [[H1431]] above [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] god, [[H410]] and shall speak [[H1696]] marvellous things [[H6381]] against [[H5921]] the God [[H410]] of gods, [[H410]] and shall prosper [[H6743]] till [[H5704]] the indignation [[H2195]] be accomplished: [[H3615]] for [[H3588]] that that is determined [[H2782]] shall be done. [[H6213]]

### 37
Neither shall he regard [[H5921]] the God [[H430]] of his fathers, [[H1]] nor the desire [[H2532]] of women, [[H802]] nor regard [[H995]] any [[H3605]] god: [[H433]] for [[H3588]] he shall magnify himself [[H1431]] above [[H5921]] all. [[H5921]]

### 38
But in [[H5921]] his estate [[H3653]] shall he honour [[H3513]] the God [[H433]] of forces: [[H4581]] and a god [[H433]] whom [[H834]] his fathers [[H1]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] shall he honour [[H3513]] with gold, [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] and with precious [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] and pleasant things. [[H2530]]

### 39
Thus shall he do [[H6213]] in the most strong [[H4581]] holds [[H4013]] with [[H5973]] a strange [[H5236]] god, [[H433]] whom [[H834]] he shall acknowledge [[H5234]] increase [[H7235]] with glory: [[H3519]] and he shall cause them to rule [[H4910]] over many, [[H7227]] and shall divide [[H2505]] the land [[H127]] for gain. [[H4242]]

### 40
And at the time [[H6256]] of the end [[H7093]] shall the king [[H4428]] of the south [[H5045]] push [[H5055]] at [[H5973]] him: and the king [[H4428]] of the north [[H6828]] shall come against him like a whirlwind, [[H8175]] with chariots, [[H7393]] and with horsemen, [[H6571]] and with many [[H7227]] ships; [[H591]] and he shall enter [[H935]] into the countries, [[H776]] and shall overflow [[H7857]] and pass over. [[H5674]]

### 41
He shall enter [[H935]] also into the glorious [[H6643]] land, [[H776]] and many [[H7227]] shall be overthrown: [[H3782]] but these [[H428]] shall escape [[H4422]] out of his hand, [[H3027]] Edom, [[H123]] and Moab, [[H4124]] and the chief [[H7225]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 42
He shall stretch forth [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] also upon the countries: [[H776]] and the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall not [[H3808]] escape. [[H6413]]

### 43
But he shall have power [[H4910]] over the treasures [[H4362]] of gold [[H2091]] and of silver, [[H3701]] and over all [[H3605]] the precious things [[H2532]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] and the Libyans [[H3864]] and the Ethiopians [[H3569]] at his steps. [[H4703]]

### 44
But tidings [[H8052]] out of the east [[H4217]] and out of the north [[H6828]] shall trouble [[H926]] him: therefore he shall go forth [[H3318]] with great [[H1419]] fury [[H2534]] to destroy, [[H8045]] and utterly to make away [[H2763]] many. [[H7227]]

### 45
And he shall plant [[H5193]] the tabernacles [[H168]] of his palace [[H643]] between [[H996]] the seas [[H3220]] in the glorious [[H6643]] holy [[H6944]] mountain; [[H2022]] yet he shall come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] his end, [[H7093]] and none [[H369]] shall help [[H5826]] him. [[H5826]]
