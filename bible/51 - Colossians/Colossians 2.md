### 1
For [[G1063]] I would [[G2309]] ye [[G5209]] that [[G1492]] knew [[G1492]] what great [[G2245]] conflict [[G73]] I have [[G2192]] for [[G4012]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] at [[G1722]] Laodicea, [[G2993]] and [[G2532]] as many as [[G3745]] not [[G3756]] have [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] my [[G3450]] face [[G4383]] in [[G1722]] the flesh; [[G4561]]

### 2
That [[G2443]] their [[G846]] hearts might be [[G2588]] comforted, [[G3870]] being knit together [[G4822]] in [[G1722]] love, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] riches [[G4149]] the full [[G3588]] of [[G4136]] assurance [[G4136]] of [[G4907]] understanding, [[G4907]] to [[G1519]] the acknowledgement [[G1922]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3466]] mystery [[G3466]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of the Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] of [[G5547]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 3
In [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] are [[G1526]] hid [[G614]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] treasures [[G2344]]  of [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] knowledge. [[G1108]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] I say, [[G3004]] lest [[G3361]] any man [[G5100]] should beguile [[G3884]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] enticing words. [[G4086]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] though [[G1487]]  I be [[G2532]] absent [[G548]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4561]] flesh, [[G4561]] yet [[G235]] am I [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] joying [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] beholding [[G991]] your [[G5216]] order, [[G5010]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] stedfastness of [[G4733]] your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 6
As [[G5613]] therefore [[G3767]] ye have [[G3880]] received [[G3880]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] walk ye [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] him: [[G846]]

### 7
Rooted [[G4492]] and [[G2532]] built up [[G2026]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] stablished [[G950]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] as [[G2531]] ye have been taught, [[G1321]] abounding [[G4052]] therein [[G846]] with [[G1722]] thanksgiving. [[G2169]]

### 8
Beware [[G991]] lest [[G3361]] any man [[G5100]] spoil [[G4812]] you [[G5209]] through [[G1223]] philosophy [[G5385]] and [[G2532]] vain [[G2756]] deceit, [[G539]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] of [[G444]] men, [[G444]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] rudiments [[G4747]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] after [[G2596]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 9
For [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] dwelleth [[G2730]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] fulness [[G4138]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2320]] Godhead [[G2320]] bodily. [[G4985]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] ye are [[G2075]] complete [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of all [[G3956]] principality [[G746]] and [[G2532]] power: [[G1849]]

### 11
In [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] ye are circumcised [[G4059]] with the circumcision [[G4061]] made without hands, [[G886]] in [[G1722]] putting off [[G555]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] the [[G3588]] of [[G266]] sins [[G266]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh [[G4561]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] circumcision [[G4061]] of [[G5547]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 12
Buried with [[G4916]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] baptism, [[G908]] wherein [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] ye are risen with [[G4891]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of the [[G3588]] operation [[G1753]] of God, [[G2316]] hath raised [[G1453]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead. [[G3498]] who [[G3588]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] you, [[G5209]] being [[G5607]] dead [[G3498]] in [[G1722]] your [[G3588]] sins [[G3900]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] uncircumcision [[G203]] of your [[G5216]] flesh, [[G4561]] hath he quickened together [[G4806]] with [[G4862]] him, [[G846]] having forgiven [[G5483]] you [[G5213]] all [[G3956]] trespasses; [[G3900]]

### 14
Blotting out [[G1813]] the handwriting [[G5498]] of [[G1378]] ordinances [[G1378]] that was [[G3588]] against [[G2596]] us, [[G2257]] which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] contrary [[G5227]] to us, [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] took [[G142]] it [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3319]] nailing [[G4338]] it [[G846]] to his [[G4716]] cross; [[G4716]]

### 15
having spoiled [[G554]] principalities [[G746]] and [[G2532]] powers, [[G1849]] he made a shew of them [[G1165]] openly, [[G1722]]  triumphing [[G3954]] over [[G2358]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] it. [[G846]]

### 16
no [[G3361]] Let [[G2919]] man [[G5100]] therefore [[G3767]] judge [[G2919]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] meat, [[G1035]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] drink, [[G4213]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] respect [[G3313]] of an holyday, [[G1859]] or [[G2228]] of the new moon, [[G3561]] or [[G2228]] of the sabbath [[G4521]]

### 17
Which [[G3739]] are [[G2076]] a shadow [[G4639]] of things to come; [[G3195]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 18
no man [[G3367]] Let of your reward [[G2603]] beguile [[G2603]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] a voluntary [[G2309]] humility [[G5012]] and [[G2532]] worshipping [[G2356]] of [[G32]] angels, [[G32]] intruding into [[G1687]] those things which [[G3739]] not [[G3361]] he hath [[G3708]] seen, [[G3708]] vainly [[G1500]] puffed up [[G5448]] by [[G5259]] his [[G846]] fleshly [[G4561]] mind, [[G3563]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] holding [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] Head, [[G2776]] from [[G1537]] which [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] by [[G1223]] joints [[G860]] and [[G2532]] bands [[G4886]] having nourishment ministered, [[G2023]] and [[G2532]] knit together, [[G4822]] increaseth with [[G837]] the [[G3588]] increase [[G838]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 20
Wherefore [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] ye be dead [[G599]] with [[G4862]] Christ [[G5547]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] rudiments [[G4747]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world, [[G2889]] why, [[G5101]] as though [[G5613]] living [[G2198]] in [[G1722]] the world, [[G2889]] are ye subject to ordinances, [[G1379]]

### 21
(Touch [[G680]] not; [[G3361]] taste [[G1089]] not; [[G3366]] handle [[G2345]] not; [[G3366]]

### 22
Which [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] are [[G2076]] to [[G1519]] perish [[G5356]] the [[G3588]] with [[G671]] using;) [[G671]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] commandments [[G1778]] and [[G2532]] doctrines [[G1319]] of [[G444]] men? [[G444]]

### 23
Which [[G3748]] things [[G3056]] have [[G2076]]  a shew [[G2192]] indeed [[G3303]] of wisdom [[G4678]] in [[G1722]] will worship, [[G1479]] and [[G2532]] humility, [[G5012]] and [[G2532]] neglecting [[G857]] of the body; [[G4983]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] any [[G5100]] honour [[G5092]] to [[G4314]] the satisfying [[G4140]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh.
