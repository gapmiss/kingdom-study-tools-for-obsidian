### 1
Now [[G1161]] I say, [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] heir, [[G2818]] as long as [[G3745]] he is [[G2076]] a child, [[G3516]] differeth from [[G1308]] nothing [[G3762]] a servant, though [[G1401]] he be [[G5607]] lord [[G2962]] of all; [[G3956]]

### 2
But [[G235]] is [[G2076]] under [[G5259]] tutors [[G2012]] and [[G2532]] governors [[G3623]] until [[G891]] the time [[G3588]] appointed [[G4287]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3962]] father. [[G3962]]

### 3
Even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] we, [[G2249]] when [[G3753]] we were [[G1510]] children, [[G3516]] were [[G1510]] in bondage [[G1402]] under [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] elements [[G4747]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world: [[G2889]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] fulness [[G4138]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5550]] time [[G5550]] was come, [[G2064]] God [[G2316]] sent forth [[G1821]] his [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] made [[G1096]] of [[G1537]] a woman, [[G1135]] made [[G1096]] under [[G5259]] the law, [[G3551]]

### 5
To redeem [[G1805]] them [[G3588]] that [[G2443]] were under [[G5259]] the law, [[G3551]] that [[G2443]] we might receive [[G618]] the [[G3588]] adoption of sons. [[G5206]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] because [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] sons, [[G5207]] God [[G2316]] hath sent forth [[G1821]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] into [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] hearts, [[G2588]] crying, [[G2896]] Abba, [[G5]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 7
Wherefore [[G5620]] thou art [[G1488]] no more [[G3765]] a servant, [[G1401]] but [[G235]] a son; [[G5207]] and [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] a son, [[G5207]] then [[G2532]] an heir [[G2818]] of God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 8
Howbeit [[G235]] then, [[G5119]] when ye knew [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] God, [[G2316]] ye did service [[G1398]] unto them which [[G3588]] by nature [[G5449]] are [[G5607]] no [[G3361]] gods. [[G2316]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] now, [[G3568]] after that ye have known [[G1097]] God, [[G2316]] or [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] are known [[G1097]] of [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]] how [[G4459]] turn ye [[G1994]] again [[G3825]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] weak [[G772]] and [[G2532]] beggarly [[G4434]] elements, [[G4747]] whereunto [[G3739]] ye desire [[G2309]] again [[G3825]] to be in bondage? [[G1398]]

### 10
Ye observe [[G3906]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] months, [[G3376]] and [[G2532]] times, [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] years. [[G1763]]

### 11
I am afraid of [[G5399]] you, [[G5209]] lest [[G3381]] I have bestowed labour [[G2872]] upon in [[G1519]] you [[G5209]] vain. [[G1500]]

### 12
Brethren, [[G80]] I beseech [[G1189]] you, [[G5216]] be [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] for [[G3754]] I [[G2504]] as [[G5613]] ye [[G5210]] not at all. [[G3762]] ye have [[G91]] injured [[G91]] me [[G3165]]

### 13
Ye know [[G1492]] how [[G3754]] through [[G1223]] infirmity [[G769]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh [[G4561]] I preached the gospel [[G2097]] unto you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] at [[G4386]] first. [[G4386]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] temptation [[G3986]] which [[G3588]] was [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] flesh [[G4561]] ye despised [[G1848]] not, [[G3756]] nor [[G3761]] rejected; [[G1609]] but [[G235]] received [[G1209]] me [[G3165]] as [[G5613]] an angel [[G32]] of God, [[G2316]] as [[G5613]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 15
Where [[G5101]] is [[G2258]] then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] blessedness [[G3108]] ye spake of? [[G5216]] for [[G1063]] I bear record, [[G3140]] you [[G5213]] that, [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] possible, [[G1415]] ye would have plucked out [[G1846]] your own [[G5216]] eyes, [[G3788]] and have given them [[G1325]] to me. [[G3427]]

### 16
therefore [[G5620]] Am I [[G1096]] become [[G1096]] your [[G5216]] enemy, [[G2190]] because I tell the truth? [[G226]] you [[G5213]]

### 17
They zealously affect [[G2206]] you, [[G5209]] not [[G3756]] well; [[G2573]] yea, [[G235]] they would [[G2309]] exclude [[G1576]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G2443]] ye might affect [[G2206]] them. [[G846]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] good [[G2570]] to be zealously affected [[G2206]] always [[G3842]] in [[G1722]] good [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] only [[G3440]] when I [[G3165]] am present [[G3918]] with [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 19
My [[G3450]] little children, [[G5040]] of whom [[G3739]] I travail in birth [[G5605]] again [[G3825]] until [[G891]] Christ [[G5547]] be formed [[G3445]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]]

### 20
I desire [[G2309]] to be present [[G3918]] with [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] now, [[G737]] and [[G2532]] to change [[G236]] my [[G3450]] voice; [[G5456]] for [[G3754]] I stand in doubt [[G639]] of [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 21
Tell [[G3004]] me, [[G3427]] ye that [[G3588]] desire [[G2309]] to be [[G1511]] under [[G5259]] the law, [[G3551]] not [[G3756]] do ye [[G191]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] law? [[G3551]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] that [[G3754]] Abraham [[G11]] had [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] sons, [[G5207]] the one [[G1520]] by [[G1537]]  a [[G3588]] bondmaid, [[G3814]] the [[G2532]] other [[G1520]] by [[G1537]] a [[G3588]] freewoman. [[G1658]]

### 23
But [[G235]] he [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] bondwoman [[G3814]] was born [[G1080]] after [[G2596]] the flesh; [[G4561]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] freewoman [[G1658]] by [[G1223]] promise. [[G1860]]

### 24
Which things [[G3748]] are [[G2076]] an allegory: [[G238]] for [[G1063]] these [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] covenants; [[G1242]] the one [[G1520]] from [[G575]] the mount [[G3735]] Sinai, [[G4614]] which gendereth [[G1080]] to [[G1519]] bondage, [[G1397]] which [[G3748]] is [[G2076]] Agar. [[G28]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] this [[G3588]] Agar [[G28]] is [[G2076]] mount [[G3735]] Sinai [[G4614]] in [[G1722]] Arabia, [[G688]] and [[G1161]] answereth to [[G4960]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] which is, [[G3588]] now [[G3568]] and [[G1161]] is in bondage [[G1398]] with [[G3326]] her [[G846]] children. [[G5043]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] which [[G3588]] is above [[G507]] is [[G2076]] free, [[G1658]] which [[G3748]] is [[G2076]] the mother [[G3384]] of us [[G2257]] all. [[G3956]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] Rejoice, [[G2165]] barren [[G4723]] that [[G3588]] bearest [[G5088]] not; [[G3756]] break forth [[G4486]] and [[G2532]] cry, [[G994]] thou that [[G3588]] travailest [[G5605]] not: [[G3756]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] desolate hath [[G2048]] many [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] children [[G5043]] than [[G2228]] she which [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]]  an [[G3588]] husband. [[G435]]

### 28
Now [[G1161]] we, [[G2249]] brethren, [[G80]] as [[G2596]] Isaac was, [[G2464]] are [[G2070]] the children [[G5043]] of promise. [[G1860]]

### 29
But [[G235]] as [[G5618]] then [[G5119]] he that [[G3588]] was born [[G1080]] after [[G2596]] the flesh [[G4561]] persecuted [[G1377]] him [[G3588]] after [[G2596]] the Spirit, [[G4151]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] now. [[G3568]]

### 30
Nevertheless [[G235]] what [[G5101]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] scripture? [[G1124]] Cast out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] bondwoman [[G3814]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] son: [[G5207]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] shall be [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3814]] bondwoman [[G3814]] not [[G3756]] heir [[G2816]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] son of [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] freewoman. [[G1658]]

### 31
So then, [[G686]] brethren, [[G80]] we are [[G2070]] not [[G3756]] children [[G5043]] of the bondwoman, [[G3814]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1658]] free. [[G1658]]
