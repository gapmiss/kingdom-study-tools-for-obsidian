### 1
Stand fast [[G4739]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] in [[G1657]] liberty [[G1657]] wherewith [[G3739]] Christ [[G5547]] hath made free, [[G1659]] us [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] be [[G1758]] entangled [[G1758]] again [[G3825]] with the yoke [[G2218]] of bondage. [[G1397]]

### 2
Behold, [[G1492]] I [[G1473]] Paul [[G3972]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] ye be circumcised, [[G4059]] Christ [[G5547]] shall profit [[G5623]] you [[G5209]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 3
For [[G1161]] I testify [[G3143]] again [[G3825]] to every [[G3956]] man [[G444]] that is circumcised, [[G4059]] that [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] a debtor [[G3781]] to do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] law. [[G3551]]

### 4
Christ [[G5547]] is become no effect unto you, [[G2673]] of [[G575]] whosoever [[G3748]] of you are justified [[G1344]] by [[G1722]] the law; [[G3551]] ye are fallen from [[G1601]] grace. [[G5485]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] we [[G2249]] through the Spirit [[G4151]] wait for [[G553]] the hope [[G1680]] of righteousness [[G1343]] by [[G1537]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] neither [[G3777]] circumcision [[G4061]] availeth [[G2480]] any thing, [[G5100]] nor [[G3777]] uncircumcision; [[G203]] but [[G235]] faith [[G4102]] which worketh [[G1754]] by [[G1223]] love. [[G26]]

### 7
Ye did run [[G5143]] well; [[G2573]] who [[G5101]] did hinder [[G348]] you [[G5209]] not [[G3361]] that ye should [[G3982]] obey [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] truth? [[G225]]

### 8
This [[G3588]] persuasion [[G3988]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] him that [[G3588]] calleth [[G2564]] you. [[G5209]]

### 9
A little [[G3398]] leaven [[G2219]] leaveneth [[G2220]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] lump. [[G5445]]

### 10
I [[G1473]] have confidence [[G3982]] in [[G1519]] you [[G5209]] through [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] that [[G3754]] none [[G3762]] ye will be [[G5426]] otherwise [[G243]] minded: [[G5426]] but [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] troubleth [[G5015]] you [[G5209]] shall bear [[G941]] his [[G3588]] judgment, [[G2917]] whosoever [[G3748]]  he [[G302]] be. [[G5600]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] I, [[G1473]] brethren, [[G80]] if [[G1487]] yet [[G2089]] I [[G2784]] preach [[G2784]] circumcision, [[G4061]] why [[G5101]] yet [[G2089]] do I suffer [[G1377]] persecution? [[G1377]] then [[G686]] is [[G2673]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4716]] offence [[G4625]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] ceased. [[G2673]]

### 12
I would [[G3785]] even [[G2532]] they were cut [[G609]] off [[G609]] which [[G3588]] trouble [[G387]] you. [[G5209]]

### 13
For, [[G1063]] brethren, [[G80]] ye [[G5210]] have been called [[G2564]] unto [[G1909]] liberty; [[G1657]] only [[G3440]] not [[G3361]] liberty [[G1657]] for [[G1519]] an occasion [[G874]] to [[G4561]] the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G235]] by [[G1223]] love [[G26]] serve [[G1398]] one another. [[G240]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] the law [[G3551]] is fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] word, [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] this; [[G3588]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] thy [[G4675]] neighbour [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] thyself. [[G1438]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye bite [[G1143]] and [[G2532]] devour [[G2719]] one another, [[G240]] take heed [[G991]] not [[G3361]] that ye be [[G355]] consumed [[G355]] of [[G5259]] one [[G240]] another. [[G240]]

### 16
I say [[G3004]] then, [[G1161]] Walk [[G4043]] in the Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye shall [[G5055]] fulfil [[G5055]] the lust [[G1939]] of the flesh. [[G4561]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] lusteth [[G1937]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] flesh: [[G4561]] and [[G1161]] these [[G5023]] are contrary [[G480]] the one to the other: [[G240]] so that [[G2443]] cannot [[G3361]] ye [[G4160]] do [[G4160]] the things [[G5023]] that [[G3739]] ye would. [[G2309]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye be led [[G71]] of the Spirit, [[G4151]] ye are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] under [[G5259]] the law. [[G3551]]

### 19
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh [[G4561]] are [[G2076]] manifest, [[G5318]] which [[G3748]] are [[G2076]] Adultery, [[G3430]] fornication, [[G4202]] uncleanness, [[G167]] lasciviousness, [[G766]]

### 20
Idolatry, [[G1495]] witchcraft, [[G5331]] hatred, [[G2189]] variance, [[G2054]] emulations, [[G2205]] wrath, [[G2372]] strife, [[G2052]] seditions, [[G1370]] heresies, [[G139]]

### 21
Envyings, [[G5355]] murders, [[G5408]] drunkenness, [[G3178]] revellings, [[G2970]] and [[G2532]] such [[G5125]] like: [[G3664]] of the which [[G3739]] I tell before, [[G4302]] you [[G5213]] as [[G2531]] also [[G2532]] I have in time past, [[G4277]] told [[G4277]] that [[G3754]] they which [[G3588]] do [[G4238]] such things [[G5108]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2816]] inherit [[G2816]] the kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] is [[G2076]] love, [[G26]] joy, [[G5479]] peace, [[G1515]] longsuffering, [[G3115]] gentleness, [[G5544]] goodness, [[G19]] faith, [[G4102]]

### 23
Meekness, [[G4236]] temperance: [[G1466]] against [[G2596]] such [[G5108]] there is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] law. [[G3551]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] they that are [[G3588]] Christ's [[G5547]] have crucified [[G4717]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] affections [[G3804]] and [[G2532]] lusts. [[G1939]]

### 25
If [[G1487]] we live [[G2198]] in the Spirit, [[G4151]] also [[G2532]] let us [[G4748]] walk [[G4748]] in the Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 26
not [[G3361]] Let us [[G1096]] be [[G1096]] desirous of vain glory, [[G2755]] provoking [[G4292]] one another, [[G240]] envying [[G5354]] one another. [[G240]]
