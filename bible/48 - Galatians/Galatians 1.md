### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] an apostle, [[G652]] (not [[G3756]] of [[G575]] men, [[G444]] neither [[G3761]] by [[G1223]] man, [[G444]] but [[G235]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] the Father, [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] raised [[G1453]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the dead;) [[G3498]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] which are with [[G4862]] me, [[G1698]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1577]] churches [[G1577]] of [[G1053]] Galatia: [[G1053]]

### 3
Grace [[G5485]] to you [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] the Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

### 4
Who [[G3588]] gave [[G1325]] himself [[G1438]] for [[G5228]] our [[G2257]] sins, [[G266]] that [[G3704]] he might deliver [[G1807]] us [[G2248]] from [[G1537]] this [[G3588]] present [[G1764]] evil [[G4190]] world, [[G165]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Father: [[G3962]]

### 5
To whom [[G3739]] glory [[G1391]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G3588]]  and ever. [[G3588]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 6
I marvel [[G2296]] that [[G3754]] so [[G3779]] ye are [[G3346]] soon [[G5030]] removed [[G3346]] from [[G575]] him that [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] you [[G5209]] into [[G1722]] the grace [[G5485]] of Christ [[G5547]] unto [[G1519]] another [[G2087]] gospel: [[G2098]]

### 7
Which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] another; [[G243]] but [[G3361]] there be [[G1526]] some [[G5100]] that [[G3588]] trouble [[G5015]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] would [[G2309]] pervert [[G3344]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 8
But [[G235]] though [[G2532]] we, [[G2249]] or [[G2228]] an angel [[G32]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] preach any other gospel [[G2097]] unto you [[G5213]] than [[G3844]] that which [[G3739]] we have preached [[G2097]] unto you, [[G5213]] let him be [[G2077]] accursed. [[G331]]

### 9
As [[G5613]] we said before, [[G4280]] so [[G2532]] say I [[G3004]] now [[G737]] again, [[G3825]] If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] preach any other gospel [[G2097]] unto you [[G5209]] than [[G3844]] that [[G3739]] ye have received, [[G3880]] let him be [[G2077]] accursed. [[G331]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] now [[G737]] do I [[G3982]] persuade [[G3982]] men, [[G444]] or [[G2228]] God? [[G2316]] or [[G2228]] do I seek [[G2212]] to please [[G700]] men? [[G444]] for [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] yet [[G2089]] I [[G700]] pleased [[G700]] men, [[G444]] not [[G3756]] I should [[G2252]] be [[G2252]] the servant [[G1401]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] I certify that [[G1107]] you, [[G5213]] brethren, [[G80]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] which [[G3588]] was preached [[G2097]] of [[G5259]] me [[G1700]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] after [[G2596]] man. [[G444]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] neither [[G3761]] received [[G3880]] it [[G846]] of [[G3844]] man, [[G444]] neither [[G3777]] was I taught [[G1321]] but [[G235]] by [[G1223]] the revelation [[G602]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] ye have heard of [[G191]] my [[G1699]] conversation [[G391]] in time past [[G4218]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Jews' religion, [[G2454]] how that [[G3754]] beyond measure [[G5236]] I persecuted [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] wasted [[G4199]] it: [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] profited [[G4298]] in [[G1722]] the Jews' [[G3588]] religion [[G2454]] above [[G5228]] many [[G4183]] my equals [[G4915]] in [[G1722]] mine own [[G3450]] nation, [[G1085]] being [[G5225]] more exceedingly [[G4056]] zealous [[G2207]] the [[G3588]] of traditions [[G3967]]  of fathers. [[G3862]] my [[G3450]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] it pleased [[G2106]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] separated [[G873]] me [[G3165]] from [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] mother's [[G3384]] womb, [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] called [[G2564]] by [[G1223]] his [[G846]] grace, [[G5485]]

### 16
To reveal [[G601]] his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] that [[G2443]] I might preach [[G2097]] him [[G846]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heathen; [[G1484]] immediately [[G2112]] I conferred [[G4323]] not [[G3756]] with flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood: [[G129]]

### 17
Neither [[G3761]] went I up [[G424]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to [[G4314]]  them which [[G3588]] were [[G652]] apostles [[G652]] before [[G4253]] me; [[G1700]] but [[G235]] I went [[G565]] into [[G1519]] Arabia, [[G688]] and [[G2532]] returned [[G5290]] again [[G3825]] unto [[G1519]] Damascus. [[G1154]]

### 18
Then [[G1899]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] years [[G2094]] I went up [[G424]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to see [[G2477]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] abode [[G1961]] with [[G4314]] him [[G846]] fifteen [[G1178]] days. [[G2250]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] other [[G2087]] the [[G3588]] of [[G652]] apostles [[G652]] saw I [[G1492]] none, [[G3756]] save [[G1487]] James [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] Lord's [[G2962]] brother. [[G80]]

### 20
Now [[G1161]] the things which [[G3739]] I write [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] behold, [[G2400]] before [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] I lie [[G5574]] not. [[G3756]]

### 21
Afterwards [[G1899]] I came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] regions [[G2824]] of [[G4947]] Syria [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] Cilicia; [[G2791]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] was [[G2252]] unknown [[G50]] by [[G4383]] face [[G4383]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1577]] churches [[G1577]] of [[G2449]] Judaea [[G2449]] which [[G3588]] were in [[G1722]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] they had [[G2258]] heard [[G191]] only, [[G3440]] That [[G3754]] he which [[G3588]] persecuted [[G1377]] us [[G2248]] in times past [[G4218]] now [[G3568]] preacheth [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] which [[G3739]] once [[G4218]] he destroyed. [[G4199]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] they glorified [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]
