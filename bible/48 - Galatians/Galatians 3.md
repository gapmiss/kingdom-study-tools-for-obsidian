### 1
O [[G5599]] foolish [[G453]] Galatians, [[G1052]] who [[G5101]] hath bewitched [[G940]] you, [[G5209]] not [[G3361]] that ye should [[G3982]] obey [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] before [[G2596]] whose [[G3739]] eyes [[G3788]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] hath been evidently set forth, [[G4270]] crucified [[G4717]] among [[G1722]] you? [[G5213]]

### 2
This [[G5124]] only [[G3440]] would [[G2309]] I learn [[G3129]] of [[G575]] you, [[G5216]] Received ye [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] by [[G1537]] the works [[G2041]] of the law, [[G3551]] or [[G2228]] by [[G1537]] the hearing [[G189]] of faith? [[G4102]]

### 3
Are ye [[G2075]] so [[G3779]] foolish? [[G453]] having begun [[G1728]] in the Spirit, [[G4151]] now [[G3568]] are ye made [[G2005]] perfect [[G2005]] by the flesh? [[G4561]]

### 4
Have ye suffered [[G3958]] so many things [[G5118]] in vain? [[G1500]] if [[G1489]] yet [[G2532]] in vain. [[G1500]]

### 5
therefore [[G3767]] He [[G2023]] that [[G3588]] ministereth [[G2023]] to you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] worketh [[G1754]] miracles [[G1411]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] by [[G1537]] the works [[G2041]] of the law, [[G3551]] or [[G2228]] by [[G1537]] the hearing [[G189]] of faith? [[G4102]]

### 6
Even as [[G2531]] Abraham [[G11]] believed [[G4100]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] it was accounted [[G3049]] to him [[G846]] for [[G1519]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 7
Know ye [[G1097]] therefore [[G686]] that [[G3754]] they which are [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] the same [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] the children of [[G5207]] Abraham. [[G11]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] scripture, [[G1124]] foreseeing [[G4275]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] would justify [[G1344]] the [[G3588]] heathen [[G1484]] through [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] preached before the gospel [[G4283]] unto [[G11]] Abraham, [[G11]] In [[G1722]] thee [[G4671]] shall be [[G1757]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] blessed. [[G1757]]

### 9
So then [[G5620]] which [[G3588]] they are [[G2127]] be of [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] blessed [[G2127]] with [[G4862]] faithful [[G4103]] Abraham. [[G11]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] as many as [[G3745]] are [[G1526]] of [[G1537]] the works [[G2041]] of the law [[G3551]] are [[G1526]] under [[G5259]] the curse: [[G2671]] for [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] Cursed [[G1944]] every one [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] continueth [[G1696]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] all things [[G3956]] which [[G3588]] are written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] book [[G975]] the [[G3588]] of to [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] do [[G4160]] them. [[G846]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] that [[G3754]] no man [[G3762]] is justified [[G1344]] by [[G1722]] the law [[G3551]] in the sight of [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] evident: [[G1212]] for, [[G3754]] The [[G3588]] just [[G1342]] shall live [[G2198]] by [[G1537]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] faith: [[G4102]] but, [[G235]] The [[G3588]] man [[G444]] that doeth [[G4160]] them [[G846]] shall live [[G2198]] in [[G1722]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
Christ [[G5547]] hath redeemed [[G1805]] us [[G2248]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] curse [[G2671]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law, [[G3551]] being made [[G1096]] a curse [[G2671]] for [[G5228]] us: [[G2257]] for [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] Cursed [[G1944]] every one [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] hangeth [[G2910]] on [[G1909]] a tree: [[G3586]]

### 14
That [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] blessing of [[G2129]] Abraham [[G11]] might come [[G1096]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] through [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ; [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] we might receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] through [[G1223]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 15
Brethren, [[G80]] I speak [[G3004]] after the manner of [[G2596]] men; [[G444]] Though but [[G3676]] a man's [[G444]] covenant, [[G1242]] yet confirmed, [[G2964]] no man [[G3762]] disannulleth, [[G114]] or [[G2228]] addeth thereto. [[G1928]]

### 16
Now [[G1161]] to Abraham [[G11]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] were [[G4483]] seed [[G4690]] the [[G3588]] promises [[G1860]] made. [[G4483]] He saith [[G3004]] not, [[G3756]] And [[G2532]] to [[G4690]] seeds, [[G4690]] as [[G5613]] of [[G1909]] many; [[G4183]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] of [[G1909]] one, [[G1520]] And [[G2532]] to [[G4675]] thy [[G4675]] seed, [[G4690]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] I say, [[G3004]] the covenant, [[G1242]] that was confirmed before [[G4300]] of [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1519]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] which [[G3588]] was [[G1096]] four hundred [[G5071]] and [[G2532]] thirty [[G5144]] years [[G2094]] after, [[G3326]] cannot [[G3756]] disannul, [[G208]] that [[G3588]] it should make promise of none effect. [[G2673]] the [[G3588]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] inheritance [[G2817]] of [[G1537]] the law, [[G3551]] no more [[G3765]] of [[G1537]] promise: [[G1860]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G5483]] to Abraham [[G11]] by [[G1223]] promise. [[G1860]]

### 19
Wherefore [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] law? [[G3551]] It was added [[G4369]] because [[G5484]] of [[G3847]] transgressions, [[G3847]] till [[G891]] the [[G3588]] seed [[G4690]] should come [[G2064]] to whom [[G3739]] the promise was made; [[G1861]] ordained [[G1299]] by [[G1223]] angels [[G32]] in [[G1722]] the hand [[G5495]] of a mediator. [[G3316]]

### 20
Now [[G1161]] a [[G3588]] mediator [[G3316]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of one, [[G1520]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] one. [[G1520]]

### 21
the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] then [[G3767]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] promises [[G1860]] of [[G2316]] God? [[G2316]] God forbid: [[G1096]] for [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] there had been [[G1325]] a law [[G3551]] given [[G1325]] which [[G3588]] could have [[G1410]] given life, [[G2227]] verily [[G3689]] righteousness [[G1343]] should have been [[G2258]] by [[G1537]] the law. [[G3551]]

### 22
But [[G235]] the [[G3588]] scripture hath [[G1124]] concluded [[G4788]] all [[G3956]] under [[G5259]] sin, [[G266]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] by [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] might be given [[G1325]] to them that [[G3588]] believe. [[G4100]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] before [[G4253]] faith [[G4102]] came, [[G2064]] we were kept [[G5432]] under [[G5259]] the law, [[G3551]] shut up [[G4788]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] which [[G3588]] should afterwards [[G3195]] be revealed. [[G601]]

### 24
Wherefore [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] was [[G1096]] our [[G2257]] schoolmaster [[G3807]] unto [[G1519]] Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] we might be justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] after that [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] is come, [[G2064]] we are [[G2070]] no longer [[G3765]] under [[G5259]] a schoolmaster. [[G3807]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] ye are [[G2075]] all [[G3956]] the children [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] as many as [[G3745]] of you have been baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] have put on [[G1746]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 28
There is [[G1762]] neither [[G3756]] Jew [[G2453]] nor [[G3761]] Greek, [[G1672]] there is [[G1762]] neither [[G3756]] bond [[G1401]] nor [[G3761]] free, [[G1658]] there is [[G1762]] neither [[G3756]] male [[G730]] nor [[G2532]] female: [[G2338]] for [[G1063]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] all [[G3956]] one [[G1520]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye [[G5210]] Christ's, [[G5547]] then [[G686]] are ye [[G2075]] Abraham's [[G11]] seed, [[G4690]] and [[G2532]] heirs [[G2818]] according to [[G2596]] the promise. [[G1860]]
