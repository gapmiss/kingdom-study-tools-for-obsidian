### 1
Then [[G1899]] fourteen [[G1180]] years [[G2094]] after [[G1223]] I went up [[G305]] again [[G3825]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] with [[G3326]] Barnabas, [[G921]] and took with [[G4838]] Titus [[G5103]] also. [[G2532]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] I went up [[G305]] by [[G2596]] revelation, [[G602]] and [[G2532]] communicated [[G394]] unto them [[G846]] that [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] which [[G3739]] I preach [[G2784]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] but [[G1161]] privately [[G2596]]  to them [[G2398]] which [[G3588]] were of reputation, [[G1380]] lest by any means [[G3381]] I should run, [[G5143]] or [[G2228]] had run, [[G5143]] in [[G1519]] vain. [[G2756]]

### 3
But [[G235]] neither [[G3761]] Titus, [[G5103]] who [[G3588]] was with [[G4862]] me, [[G1698]] being [[G5607]] a Greek, [[G1672]] was compelled [[G315]] to be circumcised: [[G4059]]

### 4
And that [[G1161]] because of [[G1223]] false brethren [[G5569]] unawares brought in, [[G3920]] who [[G3748]] came in privily [[G3922]] to spy out [[G2684]] our [[G2257]] liberty [[G1657]] which [[G3739]] we have [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] that [[G2443]] they might bring into bondage: [[G2615]] us [[G2248]]

### 5
To whom [[G3739]] we gave place [[G1502]]  by [[G3588]] subjection, [[G5292]] no, not [[G3761]] for [[G4314]] an hour; [[G5610]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel [[G2098]] might continue [[G1265]] with [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] of [[G575]] these [[G3588]] who seemed [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] somewhat, [[G5100]] (whatsoever [[G3697]] they were, [[G2258]] it maketh matter [[G1308]] no [[G3762]] to me: [[G3427]] God [[G2316]] accepteth [[G2983]] no [[G3756]] man's [[G444]] person:) [[G4383]] for [[G1063]] they who [[G3588]] seemed [[G1380]] in conference added [[G4323]] nothing [[G3762]] to me: [[G1698]]

### 7
But [[G235]] contrariwise, [[G5121]] when they saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] was unto me, [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G203]] uncircumcision [[G203]] committed [[G4100]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4061]] circumcision [[G4061]] unto Peter; [[G4074]]

### 8
(For [[G1063]] he that [[G3588]] wrought effectually [[G1754]] in Peter [[G4074]] to [[G1519]] the apostleship [[G651]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4061]] circumcision, [[G4061]] the same was mighty [[G1754]] in [[G2532]] me [[G1698]] toward [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles:) [[G1484]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when [[G1097]] James, [[G2385]] Cephas, [[G2786]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] who [[G3588]] seemed [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] pillars, [[G4769]] perceived [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] that [[G3588]] was given [[G1325]] unto me, [[G3427]] they gave [[G1325]] to me [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] the right hands [[G1188]] of fellowship; [[G2842]] that [[G2443]] we [[G2249]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] heathen, [[G1484]] and [[G1161]] they [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] circumcision. [[G4061]]

### 10
Only [[G3440]] that [[G2443]] we should remember [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] poor; [[G4434]] the same [[G846]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] I was [[G4704]] forward [[G4704]] to do. [[G4160]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] Peter [[G4074]] was come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Antioch, [[G490]] I withstood [[G436]] him [[G846]] to [[G2596]] the face, [[G4383]] because [[G3754]] he was [[G2258]] to be blamed. [[G2607]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] before [[G4253]] that [[G3588]] certain [[G5100]] came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] James, [[G2385]] he did eat [[G4906]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles: [[G1484]] but [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] they were come, [[G2064]] he withdrew [[G5288]] and [[G2532]] separated [[G873]] himself, [[G1438]] fearing [[G5399]] them which [[G3588]] were of [[G1537]] the circumcision. [[G4061]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] Jews [[G2453]] dissembled [[G4942]] likewise [[G2532]] with him; [[G846]] insomuch that [[G5620]] Barnabas [[G921]] also [[G2532]] was carried away with [[G4879]] their [[G846]] dissimulation. [[G5272]]

### 14
But [[G235]] when [[G3753]] I saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] they walked [[G3716]] uprightly [[G3716]] according to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel, [[G2098]] I said [[G2036]] unto [[G4074]] Peter [[G4074]] before [[G1715]] all, [[G3956]] If [[G1487]] thou, [[G4771]] being [[G5225]] a Jew, [[G2453]] livest [[G2198]] after the manner of Gentiles, [[G1483]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] as do the Jews, [[G2452]] why [[G5101]] compellest thou [[G315]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] to live as do the Jews? [[G2450]]

### 15
We [[G2249]] Jews [[G2453]] by nature, [[G5449]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] sinners [[G268]] of [[G1537]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]]

### 16
Knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] a man [[G444]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1344]] justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] the works [[G2041]] of the law, [[G3551]] but [[G1437]] by [[G1223]] the faith [[G4102]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] even [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] have believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] we might be justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] the faith [[G4102]] of Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] the works [[G2041]] of the law: [[G3551]] for by [[G1360]] the works [[G2041]] of [[G1537]] the law [[G3551]] no [[G3756]] shall be [[G1344]] flesh [[G4561]] justified. [[G1344]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] if, [[G1487]] while we seek [[G2212]] to be justified [[G1344]] by [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] we ourselves [[G846]] also [[G2532]] are found [[G2147]] sinners, [[G268]] therefore [[G687]] Christ [[G5547]] the minister [[G1249]] of sin? [[G266]] God forbid. [[G1096]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] I build [[G3618]] again [[G3825]] the things [[G5023]] which [[G3739]] I destroyed, [[G2647]] I make [[G4921]] myself [[G1683]] a transgressor. [[G3848]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] through [[G1223]] the law [[G3551]] am dead [[G599]] to the law, [[G3551]] that [[G2443]] I might live [[G2198]] unto God. [[G2316]]

### 20
I am crucified with [[G4957]] Christ: [[G5547]] nevertheless [[G1161]] I live; [[G2198]] yet not [[G3765]] I, [[G1473]] but [[G1161]] Christ [[G5547]] liveth [[G2198]] in [[G1722]] me: [[G1698]] and [[G1161]] the life which [[G3739]] now [[G3568]] I [[G2198]] live [[G2198]] in [[G1722]] the flesh [[G4561]] I live [[G2198]] by [[G1722]] the faith [[G4102]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] loved [[G25]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G3860]] himself [[G1438]] for [[G5228]] me. [[G1700]]

### 21
not [[G3756]] I do [[G114]] frustrate [[G114]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] righteousness [[G1343]] by [[G1223]] the law, [[G3551]] then [[G686]] Christ [[G5547]] is dead [[G599]] in vain. [[G1432]]
