### 1
Brethren, [[G80]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G444]] be [[G2532]] overtaken [[G4301]] in [[G1722]] a [[G5100]] fault, [[G3900]] ye [[G5210]] which [[G3588]] are spiritual, [[G4152]] restore [[G2675]] such an one [[G5108]] in [[G1722]] the spirit [[G4151]] of meekness; [[G4236]] considering [[G4648]] thyself, [[G4572]] lest [[G3361]] thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] be tempted. [[G3985]]

### 2
Bear ye [[G941]] one another's [[G240]] burdens, [[G922]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] fulfil [[G378]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] think [[G1380]] himself to [[G1511]] be [[G1511]] something, [[G5100]] when he is [[G5607]] nothing, [[G3367]] he deceiveth [[G5422]] himself. [[G1438]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] let [[G1381]] every man [[G1538]] prove [[G1381]] his own [[G1438]] work, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall he have [[G2192]] rejoicing [[G2745]] in [[G1519]] himself [[G1438]] alone, [[G3441]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1519]] another. [[G2087]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] every man [[G1538]] shall bear [[G941]] his own [[G2398]] burden. [[G5413]]

### 6
him that [[G3588]] Let is [[G2727]] taught [[G2727]] in the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] communicate [[G2841]] unto him that [[G3588]] teacheth [[G2727]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] good things. [[G18]]

### 7
not [[G3361]] Be [[G4105]] deceived; [[G4105]] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] is [[G3456]] mocked: [[G3456]] for [[G1063]] whatsoever [[G1437]] a man [[G444]] soweth, [[G4687]] that [[G5124]] also [[G2532]] shall he [[G2325]] reap. [[G2325]]

### 8
For [[G3754]] he that [[G3588]] soweth [[G4687]] to [[G1519]] his [[G1438]] flesh [[G4561]] of [[G1537]] shall [[G2325]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] reap [[G2325]] corruption; [[G5356]] but [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] soweth [[G4687]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G1537]] shall [[G2325]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] reap [[G2325]] life [[G2222]] everlasting. [[G166]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] not [[G3361]] let us be [[G1573]] weary [[G1573]] in well [[G2570]] doing: [[G4160]] for [[G1063]] in due [[G2398]] season [[G2540]] we shall reap, [[G2325]] if we faint [[G1590]] not. [[G3361]]

### 10
As [[G5613]] we have [[G2192]] therefore [[G686]] opportunity, [[G2540]] let us do [[G2038]] good [[G18]] unto [[G4314]] all [[G3956]] especially [[G3122]] unto [[G4314]] them who are [[G3588]] of the household [[G3609]] of [[G4102]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 11
Ye see [[G1492]] how large [[G4080]] a letter [[G1121]] I have written [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] with mine own [[G1699]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 12
As many as [[G3745]] desire [[G2309]] to make a fair shew [[G2146]] in [[G1722]] the flesh, [[G4561]] they [[G3778]] constrain [[G315]] you [[G5209]] to be circumcised; [[G4059]] only [[G3440]] lest [[G3361]] they should suffer persecution [[G1377]] for the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] neither [[G3761]] they [[G3588]] themselves [[G846]] who [[G3588]] are circumcised [[G4059]] keep [[G5442]] the law; [[G3551]] but [[G235]] desire [[G2309]] you [[G5209]] to have [[G4059]] circumcised, [[G4059]] that [[G2443]] they may glory [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5212]] flesh. [[G4561]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] God forbid [[G1096]] that I [[G1698]] should glory, [[G2744]] save [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] the world [[G2889]] is crucified [[G4717]] unto me, [[G1698]] and I [[G2504]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2889]] world. [[G2889]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] neither [[G3777]] circumcision [[G4061]] availeth [[G2480]] any thing, [[G5100]] nor [[G3777]] uncircumcision, [[G203]] but [[G235]] a new [[G2537]] creature. [[G2937]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] as many as [[G3745]] walk [[G4748]] according to this [[G5129]] rule, [[G2583]] peace [[G1515]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] mercy, [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Israel [[G2474]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 17
From henceforth [[G3064]] no man [[G3367]] let [[G3930]] trouble [[G2873]] me: [[G3427]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] bear [[G941]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] body [[G4983]] the [[G3588]] marks [[G4742]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 18
Brethren, [[G80]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] with [[G3326]] your [[G5216]] spirit. [[G4151]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 255
Unto [[G4314]] the Galatians [[G1052]] written [[G1125]] from [[G575]] Rome. [[G4516]]
