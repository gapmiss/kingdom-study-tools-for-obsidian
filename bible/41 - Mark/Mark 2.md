### 1
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] Capernaum [[G2584]] after [[G1223]] days; [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] it was noised [[G191]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2076]] in [[G1519]] the house. [[G3624]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] many [[G4183]] were gathered together, [[G4863]] insomuch that [[G5620]] there was no room [[G3371]] to receive [[G5562]] no, not so much as [[G3366]] about [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] door: [[G2374]] and [[G2532]] he preached [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] they come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] bringing [[G5342]] one sick of the palsy, [[G3885]] which was borne [[G142]] of [[G5259]] four. [[G5064]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] when they could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] come [[G4331]] nigh unto [[G4331]] him [[G846]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] press, [[G3793]] they uncovered [[G648]] the [[G3588]] roof [[G4721]] where [[G3699]] he was: [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] when they had broken [[G1846]] up, [[G1846]] they let down [[G5465]] the [[G3588]] bed [[G2895]] wherein [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sick of the palsy [[G3885]] lay. [[G2621]]

### 5
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] their [[G846]] faith, [[G4102]] he said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto sick of the [[G3885]] palsy, [[G3885]] Son, [[G5043]] thy [[G4675]] sins [[G266]] be forgiven [[G863]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1122]] scribes [[G1122]] sitting [[G2521]] there, [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] reasoning [[G1260]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]]

### 7
Why [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] doth [[G2980]] thus [[G3779]] speak [[G2980]] blasphemies? [[G988]] who [[G5101]] can [[G1410]] forgive [[G863]] sins [[G266]] but [[G3361]] God [[G2316]] only? [[G1520]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] when [[G1921]] Jesus [[G2424]] perceived [[G1921]] in [[G4151]] his [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3754]] so [[G3779]] they [[G1260]] reasoned [[G1260]] within [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] reason ye [[G1260]] these things [[G5023]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] hearts? [[G2588]]

### 9
Whether [[G5101]] is it [[G2076]] easier [[G2123]] to say [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] to sick of the [[G3885]] palsy, [[G3885]] sins [[G266]] be forgiven [[G863]] thee; [[G4671]] or [[G2228]] to say, [[G2036]] Arise, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] thy [[G4675]] bed, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] walk? [[G4043]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] that [[G2443]] ye may know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] hath [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] to forgive [[G863]] sins, [[G266]] (he saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to sick of the [[G3885]] palsy,) [[G3885]]

### 11
I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Arise, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] thy [[G4675]] bed, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] go thy way [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] thine [[G4675]] house. [[G3624]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] he arose, [[G1453]] took up [[G142]] the [[G3588]] bed, [[G2895]] and [[G2532]] went forth [[G1831]] before [[G1726]] them all; [[G3956]] insomuch that [[G5620]] they were all [[G3956]] amazed, [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] saying, [[G3004]] We [[G1492]] never [[G3763]] saw [[G1492]] it on this fashion. [[G3779]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he went forth [[G1831]] again [[G3825]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea side; [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] resorted [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he taught [[G1321]] them. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] as he passed by, [[G3855]] he saw [[G1492]] Levi [[G3018]] the [[G3588]] of Alphaeus [[G256]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] receipt of custom, [[G5058]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]] And [[G2532]] arose and [[G450]] he [[G190]] followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that, as [[G1722]] Jesus [[G846]] sat at meat [[G2621]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3614]] many [[G4183]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] sat together [[G4873]] also [[G2532]] with Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples: [[G3101]] for [[G1063]] there were [[G2258]] many, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] they followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] saw [[G1492]] him [[G846]] eat [[G2068]] with [[G3326]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners, [[G268]] they said [[G3004]] unto [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] How is it [[G5101]] that [[G3754]] he eateth [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinketh [[G4095]] with [[G3326]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners? [[G268]]

### 17
When [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] They [[G3588]] that are whole [[G2480]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] of the physician, [[G2395]] but [[G235]] they that are [[G2192]] sick: [[G2560]] I came [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] to call [[G2564]] the righteous, [[G1342]] but [[G235]] sinners [[G268]] to [[G1519]] repentance. [[G3341]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] of John [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] of [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] used [[G2258]] to fast: [[G3522]] and [[G2532]] they come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Why [[G1302]] do [[G1302]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] of John [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] of [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] fast, [[G3522]] but [[G1161]] thy [[G4674]] disciples [[G3101]] fast [[G3522]] not? [[G3756]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Can [[G1410]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3567]] bridechamber [[G3567]] fast, [[G3522]] while [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] is [[G2076]] with [[G3326]] them? [[G846]] as long as [[G3745]] they have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G1438]] they cannot [[G1410]] fast. [[G3522]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] the days [[G2250]] will come, [[G2064]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] shall be taken away [[G522]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall they fast [[G3522]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days. [[G2250]]

### 21
No man [[G3762]] also [[G2532]] seweth [[G1976]] a piece [[G1915]] of new [[G46]] cloth [[G4470]] on [[G1909]] an [[G2440]] old [[G3820]] garment: [[G2440]] else [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] new piece [[G2537]] that filled up [[G4138]] it [[G846]] taketh away from [[G142]] the [[G3588]] old, [[G3820]] and [[G2532]] the rent [[G4978]] is made [[G1096]] worse. [[G5501]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] putteth [[G906]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] old [[G3820]] bottles: [[G779]] else [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] doth burst [[G4486]] the [[G3588]] bottles, [[G779]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] is spilled, [[G1632]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] bottles [[G779]] will be marred: [[G622]] but [[G235]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] must be put [[G992]] into [[G1519]] new [[G2537]] bottles. [[G779]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that [[G3899]] he [[G846]] went [[G3899]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] corn fields [[G4702]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath day; [[G4521]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] began, [[G756]] as they went, [[G3598]] to pluck [[G5089]] the [[G3588]] ears of corn. [[G4719]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Behold, [[G1492]] why [[G5101]] do they [[G4160]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath day [[G4521]] that which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1832]] lawful? [[G1832]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] never [[G3763]] Have ye [[G314]] read [[G314]] what [[G5101]] David [[G1138]] did, [[G4160]] when [[G3753]] he had [[G2192]] need, [[G5532]] and [[G2532]] was an hungred, [[G3983]] he, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that were with [[G3326]] him? [[G846]]

### 26
How [[G4459]] he went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of God [[G2316]] in the days of [[G1909]] Abiathar [[G8]] the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] did eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] shewbread, [[G4286]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1832]] lawful [[G1832]] to eat [[G5315]] but [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] for [[G2409]] priests, [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] also [[G2532]] to them which [[G3588]] were [[G5607]] with [[G4862]] him? [[G846]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] sabbath [[G4521]] was made [[G1096]] for [[G1223]] man, [[G444]] and not [[G3756]] man [[G444]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] sabbath: [[G4521]]

### 28
Therefore [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is [[G2076]] Lord [[G2962]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4521]] sabbath. [[G4521]]
