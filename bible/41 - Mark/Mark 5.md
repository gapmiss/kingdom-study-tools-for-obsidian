And [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] over [[G1519]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea, [[G2281]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] country [[G5561]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1046]] Gadarenes. [[G1046]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] when was out [[G1831]] he [[G846]] come [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] immediately [[G2112]] there met [[G528]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tombs [[G3419]] a man [[G444]] with [[G1722]] an [[G4151]] unclean [[G169]] spirit, [[G4151]]

### 3
Who [[G3739]] had [[G2192]] dwelling [[G2731]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tombs; [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] could [[G1410]] bind [[G1210]] him, [[G846]] no, not [[G3777]] with chains: [[G254]]

### 4
Because that [[G1223]] he [[G846]] often [[G4178]] had been [[G1210]] bound [[G1210]] with fetters [[G3976]] and [[G2532]] chains, [[G254]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chains [[G254]] had been plucked asunder [[G1288]] by [[G5259]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fetters [[G3976]] broken in pieces: [[G4937]] neither [[G2532]] could [[G2480]] any [[G3762]] tame [[G1150]] him. [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] always, [[G1275]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day, [[G2250]] he was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mountains, [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tombs, [[G3418]] crying, [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] cutting [[G2629]] himself [[G1438]] with stones. [[G3037]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] when he saw [[G1492]] Jesus [[G2424]] afar [[G3113]] off, [[G575]] he ran [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] worshipped [[G4352]] him, [[G846]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] cried [[G2896]] with a [[G5456]] loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] and said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] I [[G1698]] have to do [[G2532]] with [[G2532]] thee, [[G4671]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] most high [[G5310]] God? [[G2316]] I adjure [[G3726]] thee [[G4571]] by God, [[G2316]] that thou torment [[G928]] me [[G3165]] not. [[G3361]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] he said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Come out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] unclean [[G169]] spirit. [[G4151]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] thy [[G4671]] name? [[G3686]] And [[G2532]] he answered, [[G611]] saying, [[G3004]] My [[G3427]] name [[G3686]] Legion: [[G3003]] for [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] many. [[G4183]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] he besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] much [[G4183]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] he would away [[G649]] send [[G649]] them [[G846]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] country. [[G5561]]

### 11
Now [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] there [[G1563]] nigh [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3735]] mountains [[G3735]] a [[G34]] great [[G3173]] herd [[G34]] of swine [[G5519]] feeding. [[G1006]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] devils [[G1142]] besought [[G3870]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Send [[G3992]] us [[G2248]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] swine, [[G5519]] that [[G2443]] we may enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] forthwith [[G2112]] Jesus [[G2424]] gave leave. [[G2010]] them [[G846]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirits [[G4151]] went out, [[G1831]] and entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] swine: [[G5519]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] herd [[G34]] ran violently [[G3729]] down [[G2596]] a [[G3588]] steep place [[G2911]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] (they [[G1161]] were [[G2258]] about [[G5613]] two thousand;) [[G1367]] and [[G2532]] were choked [[G4155]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] they that fed [[G1006]] the [[G3588]] swine [[G5519]] fled, [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] told [[G312]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] country. [[G68]] And [[G2532]] they went out [[G1831]] to see [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] it was [[G2076]] that was done. [[G1096]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] they come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] see [[G2334]] him [[G3588]] that was possessed with the devil, [[G1139]] and had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] legion, [[G3003]] sitting, [[G2521]] and [[G2532]] clothed, [[G2439]] and [[G2532]] in his right mind: [[G4993]] and [[G2532]] they were afraid. [[G5399]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that saw [[G1492]] told [[G1334]] them [[G846]] how [[G4459]] it befell [[G1096]] him [[G3588]] to that was with the devil, [[G1139]] possessed [[G1139]] and [[G2532]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] swine. [[G5519]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] they began [[G756]] to pray [[G3870]] him [[G846]] to depart [[G565]] out [[G575]] of [[G3725]] their [[G846]] coasts. [[G3725]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] when was [[G1684]] he [[G846]] come [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] he that had been possessed with the devil [[G1139]] prayed [[G3870]] him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he might be [[G5600]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 19
Howbeit [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] suffered [[G863]] him [[G846]] not, [[G3756]] but [[G235]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Go [[G5217]] home [[G3624]] to [[G4314]] thy friends, [[G4674]] and [[G2532]] tell [[G312]] them [[G846]] how great things [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath done [[G4160]] for thee, [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] hath had compassion on [[G1653]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] he departed, [[G565]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to publish [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] Decapolis [[G1179]] how great things [[G3745]] Jesus [[G2424]] had done [[G4160]] for him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] did marvel. [[G2296]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] when was passed [[G1276]] Jesus [[G2424]] over [[G1276]] again [[G3825]] by [[G1722]] ship [[G4143]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side, [[G4008]] much [[G4183]] people [[G3793]] gathered [[G4863]] unto [[G1909]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he was [[G2258]] nigh unto [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 22
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there cometh [[G2064]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of rulers of the [[G752]] synagogue, [[G752]] Jairus [[G2383]] by name; [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] when he saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] he fell [[G4098]] at [[G4314]] his [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] greatly, [[G4183]] saying, [[G3004]] My [[G3450]] little daughter [[G2365]] lieth [[G2192]] at the point of death: [[G2079]] come [[G2064]] and lay [[G2007]] thy hands [[G5495]] on her, [[G846]] that [[G3704]] she may be healed; [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] she shall live. [[G2198]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] went [[G565]] with [[G3326]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] much [[G4183]] people [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] thronged [[G4918]] him. [[G846]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] a [[G1135]] certain [[G5100]] woman, [[G1135]] which had [[G5607]] an [[G1722]] issue [[G4511]] of blood [[G129]] twelve [[G1427]] years, [[G2094]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] had suffered [[G3958]] many things [[G4183]] of [[G5259]] many [[G4183]] physicians, [[G2395]] and [[G2532]] had spent [[G1159]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3844]] she [[G1438]] had, [[G3844]] and [[G2532]] nothing [[G3367]] was [[G5623]] bettered, [[G5623]] but [[G235]] rather [[G3123]] grew [[G2064]] worse, [[G5501]]

### 27
When she had heard [[G191]] of [[G4012]] Jesus, [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] press [[G3793]] behind, [[G3693]] and touched [[G680]] his [[G846]] garment. [[G2440]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] she said, [[G3004]] If but [[G2579]] I may touch [[G680]] his [[G846]] clothes, [[G2440]] I shall be whole. [[G4982]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] fountain [[G4077]] of [[G129]] her [[G846]] blood [[G129]] was dried up; [[G3583]] and [[G2532]] she felt [[G1097]] in body [[G4983]] that [[G3754]] she was healed [[G2390]] of [[G575]] that plague. [[G3148]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] Jesus, [[G2424]] immediately [[G2112]] knowing that [[G1921]] in [[G1722]] himself [[G1438]] virtue [[G1411]] had gone out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] him, [[G846]] turned him about [[G1994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] press, [[G3793]] and said, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] touched [[G680]] my [[G3450]] clothes? [[G2440]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou seest [[G991]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] thronging [[G4918]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] sayest thou, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] touched [[G680]] me? [[G3450]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] he looked round about [[G4017]] to see [[G1492]] her that had done [[G4160]] this thing. [[G5124]]

### 33
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] fearing [[G5399]] and [[G2532]] trembling, [[G5141]] knowing [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] was done [[G1096]] in [[G1909]] her, [[G846]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] fell down before [[G4363]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] told [[G2036]] him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Daughter, [[G2364]] thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] hath made [[G4982]] thee [[G4571]] whole; [[G4982]] go [[G5217]] in [[G1519]] peace, [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] be [[G2468]] whole [[G5199]] of [[G575]] thy [[G4675]] plague. [[G3148]]

### 35
he [[G846]] While [[G2980]] yet [[G2089]] spake, [[G2980]] there came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] ruler of the synagogue's [[G752]] which said, [[G3004]] Thy [[G4675]] daughter [[G2364]] is dead: [[G599]] why [[G5101]] troublest thou [[G4660]] the [[G3588]] Master [[G1320]] any further? [[G2089]]

### 36
As soon as [[G2112]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that was spoken, [[G2980]] he saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto ruler of the [[G752]] synagogue, [[G752]] not [[G3361]] Be [[G5399]] afraid, [[G5399]] only [[G3440]] believe. [[G4100]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] he suffered [[G863]] no man [[G3762]] to follow [[G4870]] him, [[G846]] save [[G1487]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] of James. [[G2385]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] he cometh [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] the [[G3588]] of ruler of the [[G752]] synagogue, [[G752]] and [[G2532]] seeth [[G2334]] the tumult, [[G2351]] and them that wept [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] wailed [[G214]] greatly. [[G4183]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] when he was come in, [[G1525]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] make ye this ado, [[G2350]] and [[G2532]] weep? [[G2799]] the [[G3588]] damsel [[G3813]] not [[G3756]] is [[G599]] dead, [[G599]] but [[G235]] sleepeth. [[G2518]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] they laughed to scorn. [[G2606]] him [[G846]] But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] when had them out, [[G1544]] put [[G1544]] all [[G537]] he taketh [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3813]] damsel, [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] that were with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] entereth in [[G1531]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] damsel [[G3813]] was [[G2258]] lying. [[G345]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] he took [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] damsel [[G3813]] the [[G3588]] by [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] and said [[G3004]] unto her, [[G846]] Talitha [[G5008]] cumi; [[G2891]] which [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] being interpreted, [[G3177]] Damsel, [[G2877]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] arise. [[G1453]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] damsel [[G2877]] arose, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] walked; [[G4043]] for [[G1063]] she was [[G2258]] of [[G2094]] twelve [[G1427]] years. [[G2094]] And [[G2532]] they were astonished [[G1839]] with [[G1611]] a great [[G3173]] astonishment. [[G1611]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] he charged [[G1291]] them [[G846]] straitly [[G4183]] that [[G2443]] no man [[G3367]] should know [[G1097]] it; [[G5124]] and [[G2532]] commanded [[G2036]] that something should be given [[G1325]] her [[G846]] to eat. [[G5315]]
