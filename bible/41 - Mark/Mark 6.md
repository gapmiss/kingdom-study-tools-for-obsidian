### 1
And [[G2532]] he went out [[G1831]] from thence, [[G1564]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] his own [[G846]] country; [[G3968]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] follow [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] when the sabbath day [[G4521]] was come, [[G1096]] he began [[G756]] to teach [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue: [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] hearing [[G191]] were astonished, [[G1605]] saying, [[G3004]] From whence [[G4159]] hath this [[G5129]] these things? [[G5023]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] wisdom [[G4678]] this which [[G3588]] is given [[G1325]] unto him, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] even [[G2532]] such [[G5108]] mighty works [[G1411]] are wrought [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] his [[G846]] hands? [[G5495]]

### 3
Is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] carpenter, [[G5045]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Mary, [[G3137]] the brother [[G80]] of James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] Joses, [[G2499]] and [[G2532]] of Juda, [[G2455]] and [[G2532]] Simon? [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] are [[G1526]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] sisters [[G79]] here [[G5602]] with [[G4314]] us? [[G2248]] And [[G2532]] they were offended [[G4624]] at [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] A prophet [[G4396]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] without honour, [[G820]] but [[G1487]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] country, [[G3968]] and [[G2532]] among [[G1722]] his own kin, [[G4773]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] house. [[G3614]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] he could [[G1410]] there [[G1563]] do [[G4160]] no [[G3762]] mighty work, [[G1411]] save that [[G1487]] he laid [[G2007]] his hands [[G5495]] upon a few [[G3641]] sick folk, [[G732]] and healed [[G2323]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] he marvelled [[G2296]] because [[G1223]] of their [[G846]] unbelief. [[G570]] And [[G2532]] he went [[G4013]] round about [[G2945]] the [[G3588]] villages, [[G2968]] teaching. [[G1321]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] he called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] twelve, [[G1427]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to send forth [[G649]] them [[G846]] by two [[G1417]] and two; [[G1417]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] power [[G1849]] over unclean [[G169]] spirits; [[G4151]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] commanded [[G3853]] them [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they should take [[G142]] nothing [[G3367]] for [[G1519]] journey, [[G3598]] save [[G1487]] a staff [[G4464]] only; [[G3440]] no [[G3361]] scrip, [[G4082]] no [[G3361]] bread, [[G740]] no [[G3361]] money [[G5475]] in [[G1519]] purse: [[G2223]]

### 9
But [[G235]] shod [[G5265]] with sandals; [[G4547]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] put on [[G1746]] two [[G1417]] coats. [[G5509]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] In what place soever [[G3699]] ye enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] an house, [[G3614]] there [[G1563]] abide [[G3306]] till [[G2193]] ye depart [[G1831]] from that place. [[G1564]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3745]] not [[G3361]] shall [[G1209]] receive [[G1209]] you, [[G5209]] nor [[G3366]] hear [[G191]] you, [[G5216]] when ye depart [[G1607]] thence, [[G1564]] shake off [[G1621]] the [[G3588]] dust [[G5522]] under [[G5270]] your [[G5216]] feet [[G4228]] for [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] against them. [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] It shall be [[G2071]] more tolerable [[G414]] for Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2228]] Gomorrha [[G1116]] in [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] of judgment, [[G2920]] than [[G2228]] for that [[G1565]] city. [[G4172]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] they went out, [[G1831]] and preached [[G2784]] that [[G2443]] men should repent. [[G3340]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] they cast out [[G1544]] many [[G4183]] devils, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] anointed [[G218]] with oil [[G1637]] many [[G4183]] that were sick, [[G732]] and [[G2532]] healed [[G2323]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] king [[G935]] Herod [[G2264]] heard [[G191]] (for [[G1063]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] was [[G1096]] spread abroad:) [[G5318]] and [[G2532]] he said, [[G3004]] That [[G3754]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G907]] was risen [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] therefore [[G1223]] mighty works [[G1411]] do shew forth themselves [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 15
Others [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] That [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] Elias. [[G2243]] And [[G1161]] others [[G243]] said, [[G3004]] That [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] a prophet, [[G4396]] or [[G2228]] as [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] when Herod [[G2264]] heard [[G191]] he said, [[G2036]] It [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] John, [[G2491]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] beheaded: [[G607]] he [[G846]] is risen [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] Herod [[G2264]] himself [[G846]] had sent forth [[G649]] and laid hold [[G2902]] upon John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] bound [[G1210]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G5438]] for [[G1223]] Herodias' sake, [[G2266]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Philip's [[G5376]] wife: [[G1135]] for [[G3754]] he had married [[G1060]] her. [[G846]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] had said [[G3004]] unto Herod, [[G2264]] It is [[G1832]] not [[G3756]] lawful [[G1832]] for thee [[G4671]] to have [[G2192]] thy [[G4675]] brother's [[G80]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 19
Therefore [[G1161]] Herodias [[G2266]] had a quarrel [[G1758]] against him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] would [[G2309]] have killed [[G615]] him; [[G846]] but [[G2532]] she could [[G1410]] not: [[G3756]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] Herod [[G2264]] feared [[G5399]] John, [[G2491]] knowing [[G1492]] that he [[G846]] was a just [[G1342]] man [[G435]] and [[G2532]] an holy, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] observed [[G4933]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] when he heard [[G191]] him, [[G846]] he did [[G4160]] many things, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] gladly. [[G2234]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] a convenient [[G2121]] day [[G2250]] was come, [[G1096]] that Herod [[G2264]] on his [[G846]] birthday [[G1077]] made [[G4160]] a supper [[G1173]] to his [[G846]] lords, [[G3175]] high [[G5506]] captains, [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] chief [[G4413]] of Galilee; [[G1056]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] when [[G2364]] daughter [[G2364]] of the said [[G846]] Herodias [[G2266]] came in, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] danced, [[G3738]] and [[G2532]] pleased [[G700]] Herod [[G2264]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] that sat with him, [[G4873]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2877]] damsel, [[G2877]] Ask [[G154]] of me [[G3165]] whatsoever [[G3739]] thou wilt, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] I will give [[G1325]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he sware [[G3660]] unto her, [[G846]] Whatsoever [[G3739]] thou shalt ask [[G154]] of me, [[G3165]] I will give [[G1325]] thee, [[G4671]] unto [[G2193]] the half [[G2255]] of my [[G3450]] kingdom. [[G932]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] went forth, [[G1831]] and said [[G2036]] unto her [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] What [[G5101]] shall I ask? [[G154]] And [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist. [[G910]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] she came in [[G1525]] straightway [[G2112]] with [[G3326]] haste [[G4710]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] king, [[G935]] and asked, [[G154]] saying, [[G3004]] I will [[G2309]] that [[G2443]] thou give [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] by and by [[G1824]] in [[G1909]] a charger [[G4094]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist. [[G910]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] was [[G1096]] exceeding sorry; [[G4036]] for [[G1223]] his oath's sake, [[G3727]] and [[G2532]] for their sakes which [[G3588]] sat with him, [[G4873]] he would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] reject [[G114]] her. [[G846]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] sent [[G649]] an executioner, [[G4688]] and commanded [[G2004]] his [[G846]] head [[G2776]] to be brought: [[G5342]] and [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] went [[G565]] and beheaded [[G607]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prison, [[G5438]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] brought [[G5342]] his [[G846]] head [[G2776]] in [[G1909]] a charger, [[G4094]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] it [[G846]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2877]] damsel: [[G2877]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] damsel [[G2877]] gave [[G1325]] it [[G846]] to her [[G846]] mother. [[G3384]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] when his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [[G191]] they came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] took up [[G142]] his [[G846]] corpse, [[G4430]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] tomb. [[G3419]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] gathered themselves together [[G4863]] unto [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] told [[G518]] him [[G846]] all things, [[G3956]] both [[G2532]] what [[G3745]] they had done, [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] what [[G3745]] they had taught. [[G1321]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Come [[G1205]] ye [[G5210]] yourselves [[G846]] apart [[G2596]] into [[G1519]] a desert [[G2048]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] rest [[G373]] a while: [[G3641]] for [[G1063]] there were [[G2258]] many [[G4183]] coming [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] going, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3761]] they had [[G2119]] leisure [[G2119]] so much as to eat. [[G5315]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] they departed [[G565]] into [[G1519]] a desert [[G2048]] place [[G5117]] by ship [[G4143]] privately. [[G2596]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] saw [[G1492]] them [[G846]] departing, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] knew [[G1921]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] ran [[G4936]] afoot [[G3979]] thither [[G1563]] out [[G575]] of all [[G3956]] cities, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] outwent [[G4281]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] came together [[G4905]] unto [[G4314]] him. [[G846]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] Jesus, [[G2424]] when he came out, [[G1831]] saw [[G1492]] much [[G4183]] people, [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] was moved with compassion [[G4697]] toward [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they were [[G2258]] as [[G5613]] sheep [[G4263]] not [[G3361]] having [[G2192]] a shepherd: [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] he began [[G756]] to teach [[G1321]] them [[G846]] many things. [[G4183]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] when the day [[G5610]] was [[G1096]] now [[G2235]] far spent, [[G4183]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] unto him, [[G846]] and said, [[G3004]] This is [[G2076]] a desert [[G2048]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] now [[G2235]] the time [[G5610]] far passed: [[G4183]]

### 36
Send away, [[G630]] them [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they may go [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] country [[G68]] round about, [[G2945]] and [[G2532]] into the villages, [[G2968]] and buy [[G59]] themselves [[G1438]] bread: [[G740]] for [[G1063]] they have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3756]] to eat. [[G5315]]

### 37
He [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Give [[G1325]] ye [[G5210]] them [[G846]] to eat. [[G5315]] And [[G2532]] they say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Shall we go [[G565]] and buy [[G59]] two hundred [[G1250]] pennyworth [[G1220]] of bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] them [[G846]] to eat? [[G5315]]

### 38
He [[G3588]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] How many [[G4214]] loaves [[G740]] have ye? [[G2192]] go [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G1492]] And [[G2532]] when they knew, [[G1097]] they say, [[G3004]] Five, [[G4002]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] fishes. [[G2486]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] he commanded [[G2004]] them [[G846]] to make down [[G347]] all [[G3956]] sit [[G347]] by companies [[G4849]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] green [[G5515]] grass. [[G5528]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] they sat down [[G377]] in ranks, [[G4237]] by [[G303]] hundreds, [[G1540]] and [[G2532]] by [[G303]] fifties. [[G4004]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] when he had taken [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] fishes, [[G2486]] he looked [[G308]] up [[G1519]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] and blessed, [[G2127]] and [[G2532]] brake [[G2622]] the [[G3588]] loaves, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] to his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G2443]] set before [[G3908]] them; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] fishes [[G2486]] divided he among [[G3307]] them all. [[G3956]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] they did [[G5315]] all [[G3956]] eat, [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were filled. [[G5526]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] they took up [[G142]] twelve [[G1427]] baskets [[G2894]] full [[G4134]] of the fragments, [[G2801]] and [[G2532]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fishes. [[G2486]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] they that [[G3588]] did eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] of [[G740]] loaves [[G740]] were [[G2258]] about [[G5616]] five thousand [[G4000]] men. [[G435]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] he constrained [[G315]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to get [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] to go [[G4254]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side [[G4008]] before unto [[G4314]] Bethsaida, [[G966]] while [[G2193]] he [[G846]] sent away [[G630]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G3793]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] when he had sent away, [[G657]] them [[G846]] he departed [[G565]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] to pray. [[G4336]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] when even [[G3798]] was come, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] alone [[G3441]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]]

### 48
And [[G2532]] he saw [[G1492]] them [[G846]] toiling [[G928]] in [[G1722]] rowing; [[G1643]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] was [[G2258]] contrary [[G1727]] unto them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] about [[G4012]] the fourth [[G5067]] watch [[G5438]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3571]] night [[G3571]] he cometh [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] would have [[G2309]] passed by [[G3928]] them. [[G846]]

### 49
But [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] when [[G1492]] saw [[G1492]] him [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] they supposed [[G1380]] it had been [[G1511]] a spirit, [[G5326]] and [[G2532]] cried out: [[G349]]

### 50
For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] they [[G1492]] saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] were troubled. [[G5015]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] he talked [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Be of good cheer: [[G2293]] it is [[G1510]] I; [[G1473]] not [[G3361]] be [[G5399]] afraid. [[G5399]]

### 51
And [[G2532]] he went up [[G305]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship; [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] ceased: [[G2869]] and [[G2532]] they were sore [[G3029]] amazed [[G1839]] in [[G1722]] themselves [[G1438]] beyond [[G1537]] measure, [[G4053]] and [[G2532]] wondered. [[G2296]]

### 52
For [[G1063]] they considered [[G4920]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] loaves: [[G740]] for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] was [[G2258]] hardened. [[G4456]]

### 53
And [[G2532]] when they had passed over, [[G1276]] they came [[G2064]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] of Gennesaret, [[G1082]] and [[G2532]] drew to the shore. [[G4358]]

### 54
