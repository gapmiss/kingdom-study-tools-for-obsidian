### 1
After [[G3326]] two [[G1417]] days [[G2250]] was [[G2258]] the [[G3588]] passover, [[G3957]] and [[G2532]] of unleavened bread: [[G106]] and [[G2532]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] sought [[G2212]] how [[G4459]] they might take [[G2902]] him [[G846]] by [[G1722]] craft, [[G1388]] and put to death. [[G615]]

### 2
But [[G1161]] they said, [[G3004]] Not [[G3361]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] lest [[G3379]] there be [[G2071]] an uproar [[G2351]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people. [[G2992]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] being [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] Bethany [[G963]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] of Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] leper, [[G3015]] as he [[G846]] sat at meat, [[G2621]] there came [[G2064]] a woman [[G1135]] having [[G2192]] an alabaster box [[G211]] of ointment [[G3464]] of spikenard [[G3487]] very precious; [[G4185]] and [[G2532]] she brake [[G4937]] the [[G3588]] box, [[G211]] and poured [[G2708]] on [[G2596]] his [[G846]] head. [[G2776]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] some [[G5100]] that had indignation [[G23]] within [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] Why [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] was [[G1096]] waste [[G684]] of the [[G3588]] ointment [[G3464]] made? [[G1096]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] it [[G5124]] might [[G1410]] have been sold [[G4097]] for more than [[G1883]] three hundred [[G5145]] pence, [[G1220]] and [[G2532]] have been given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4434]] poor. [[G4434]] And [[G2532]] they murmured against [[G1690]] her. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Let [[G863]] her [[G846]] alone; [[G863]] why [[G5101]] trouble [[G2873]] ye [[G3930]] her? [[G846]] she hath wrought [[G2038]] a good [[G2570]] work [[G2041]] on [[G1519]] me. [[G1691]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] ye have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] with [[G3326]] you [[G1438]] always, [[G3842]] and [[G2532]] whensoever [[G3752]] ye will [[G2309]] ye may [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] them [[G846]] good: [[G2095]] but [[G1161]] me [[G1691]] ye have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] always. [[G3842]]

### 8
She hath done [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] she [[G3778]] could: [[G2192]] she is come aforehand [[G4301]] to anoint [[G3462]] my [[G3450]] body [[G4983]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] burying. [[G1780]]

### 9
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Wheresoever [[G3699]] this [[G5124]] gospel [[G2098]] shall be preached [[G2784]] throughout [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G2889]] also [[G2532]] that [[G3739]] she [[G3778]] hath done [[G4160]] shall be spoken of [[G2980]] for [[G1519]] a memorial [[G3422]] of her. [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve, [[G1427]] went [[G565]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] to [[G2443]] betray [[G3860]] him [[G846]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] when they [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] they were glad, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] promised [[G1861]] to give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] money. [[G694]] And [[G2532]] he sought [[G2212]] how [[G4459]] conveniently [[G2122]] he might [[G3860]] betray [[G3860]] him. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] day [[G2250]] of unleavened bread, [[G106]] when [[G3753]] they killed [[G2380]] the [[G3588]] passover, [[G3957]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Where [[G4226]] wilt thou [[G2309]] that we go [[G565]] and prepare [[G2090]] that [[G2443]] thou mayest eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] passover? [[G3957]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he sendeth forth [[G649]] two [[G1417]] of his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Go ye [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] there shall meet [[G528]] you [[G5213]] a man [[G444]] bearing [[G941]] a pitcher [[G2765]] of water: [[G5204]] follow [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] wheresoever [[G3699]] he shall go in, [[G1525]] say ye [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] to goodman of the [[G3617]] house, [[G3617]] The [[G3588]] Master [[G1320]] saith, [[G3004]] Where [[G4226]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] guestchamber, [[G2646]] where [[G3699]] I shall eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] passover [[G3957]] with [[G3326]] my [[G3450]] disciples? [[G3101]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] will shew [[G1166]] you [[G5213]] a large [[G3173]] upper room [[G508]] furnished [[G4766]] prepared: [[G2092]] there [[G1563]] make ready [[G2090]] for us. [[G2254]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] went forth, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] as [[G2531]] he had said [[G2036]] unto them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they made ready [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] passover. [[G3957]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] in [[G1096]] the evening [[G3798]] he cometh [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] twelve. [[G1427]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] as they [[G846]] sat [[G345]] and [[G2532]] did eat, [[G2068]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] which [[G3588]] eateth [[G2068]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] shall betray [[G3860]] me. [[G3165]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] began [[G756]] to be sorrowful, [[G3076]] and [[G2532]] to say [[G3004]] unto him [[G846]] one [[G1520]] by [[G2596]] one, [[G1520]] it [[G3385]] I? [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] it [[G3385]] I? [[G1473]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] twelve, [[G1427]] that [[G3588]] dippeth [[G1686]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] dish. [[G5165]]

### 21
The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] indeed [[G3303]] goeth, [[G5217]] as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] of [[G4012]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] to that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is betrayed! [[G3860]] good [[G2570]] were it [[G2258]] for that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] if [[G1487]] he [[G846]] never [[G3756]] had been [[G1080]] born. [[G1080]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] as they [[G846]] did eat, [[G2068]] Jesus [[G2424]] took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] and blessed, [[G2127]] and brake [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] to them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Take, [[G2983]] eat: [[G5315]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] body. [[G4983]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] cup, [[G4221]] and when he had given thanks, [[G2168]] he gave [[G1325]] to them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they [[G4095]] all [[G3956]] drank [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] it. [[G846]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] This [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] blood [[G129]] of [[G2537]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] testament, [[G1242]] which [[G3588]] is shed [[G1632]] for [[G4012]] many. [[G4183]]

### 25
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] I will drink [[G4095]] no more [[G3765]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G1081]] the [[G3588]] of [[G288]] vine, [[G288]] until [[G2193]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] that [[G3752]] I drink [[G4095]] it [[G846]] new [[G2537]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] when they had sung an hymn, [[G5214]] they went out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] of Olives. [[G1636]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] All [[G3956]] ye shall be offended [[G4624]] because [[G1722]] of [[G1698]] me [[G1698]] this [[G3778]] night: [[G3571]] for [[G3754]] it is written, [[G1125]] I will smite [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] shepherd, [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] shall be scattered. [[G1287]]

### 28
But [[G235]] after [[G3326]] that I [[G3165]] am risen, [[G1453]] I will go before [[G4254]] you [[G5209]] into [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G5346]] unto him, [[G846]] Although [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] shall be offended, [[G4624]] yet [[G235]] not [[G3756]] I. [[G1473]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] That [[G3754]] this day, [[G4594]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] night, [[G3571]] before [[G4250]] the cock [[G220]] crow [[G5455]] twice, [[G1364]] thou shalt deny [[G533]] me [[G3165]] thrice. [[G5151]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] spake [[G3004]] the [[G4053]] more [[G3123]] vehemently, [[G4053]] If [[G1437]] I [[G3165]] should [[G1163]] die with [[G4880]] thee, [[G4671]] I will [[G533]] not [[G3361]] deny [[G533]] thee [[G4571]] in any wise. [[G5615]]  Likewise [[G1161]] also [[G2532]] said they [[G3004]] all. [[G3956]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] a place [[G5564]] which was [[G3739]] named [[G3686]] Gethsemane: [[G1068]] and [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] to his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Sit ye [[G2523]] here, [[G5602]] while [[G2193]] I shall pray. [[G4336]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] he taketh [[G3880]] with [[G3326]] him [[G1438]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to be sore amazed, [[G1568]] and [[G2532]] to be very heavy; [[G85]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] My [[G3450]] soul [[G5590]] is [[G2076]] exceeding sorrowful [[G4036]] unto [[G2193]] death: [[G2288]] tarry ye [[G3306]] here, [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] watch. [[G1127]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] he went forward [[G4281]] a little, [[G3397]] and fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] prayed [[G4336]] that, [[G2443]] if [[G1487]] it were [[G2076]] possible, [[G1415]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] might pass [[G3928]] from [[G575]] him. [[G846]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] he said, [[G3004]] Abba, [[G5]] Father, [[G3962]] all things [[G3956]] possible [[G1415]] unto thee; [[G4671]] take away [[G3911]] this [[G5124]] cup [[G4221]] from [[G575]] me: [[G1700]] nevertheless [[G235]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] I [[G1473]] will, [[G2309]] but [[G235]] what [[G5101]] thou wilt. [[G4771]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] he cometh, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] findeth [[G2147]] them [[G846]] sleeping, [[G2518]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto Peter, [[G4074]] Simon, [[G4613]] sleepest thou? [[G2518]] couldest [[G2480]] not [[G3756]] thou watch [[G1127]] one [[G1520]] hour? [[G5610]]

### 38
Watch ye [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] pray, [[G4336]] lest [[G2443]] ye enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] temptation. [[G3986]] The [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] truly [[G3303]] ready, [[G4289]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] weak. [[G772]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he went away, [[G565]] and prayed, [[G4336]] and spake [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] words. [[G3056]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] when he returned, [[G5290]] he found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] asleep [[G2518]] again, [[G3825]] (for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were [[G2258]] heavy,) [[G916]] neither [[G2532]] wist they [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] to answer [[G611]] him. [[G846]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] he cometh [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] third time, [[G5154]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Sleep on [[G2518]] now, [[G3063]] and [[G2532]] take rest: [[G373]] it is enough, [[G566]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] is come; [[G2064]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is betrayed [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] of sinners. [[G268]]

### 42
Rise up, [[G1453]] let us go; [[G71]] lo, [[G2400]] he that [[G3588]] betrayeth [[G3860]] me [[G3165]] is at hand. [[G1448]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] immediately, [[G2112]] while he [[G846]] yet [[G2089]] spake, [[G2980]] cometh [[G3854]] Judas, [[G2455]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve, [[G1427]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] a great [[G4183]] multitude [[G3793]] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] staves, [[G3586]] from [[G3844]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders. [[G4245]]

### 44
And [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] betrayed [[G3860]] him [[G846]] had given [[G1325]] them [[G846]] a token, [[G4953]] saying, [[G3004]] Whomsoever [[G3739]] I shall kiss, [[G5368]] that same [[G846]] is he; [[G2076]] take [[G2902]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] lead away [[G520]] safely. [[G806]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] as soon as he was come, [[G2064]] he goeth [[G4334]] straightway [[G2112]] to him, [[G846]] and saith, [[G3004]] Master, [[G4461]] master; [[G4461]] and [[G2532]] kissed [[G2705]] him. [[G846]]

### 46
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] laid [[G1911]] their [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2902]] him. [[G846]]

### 47
And [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] of them that [[G3588]] stood by [[G3936]] drew [[G4685]] a sword, [[G3162]] and smote [[G3817]]  a [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] of high [[G749]] priest, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] cut off [[G851]] his [[G846]] ear. [[G5621]]

### 48
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Are ye come out, [[G1831]] as [[G5613]] against [[G1909]] a thief, [[G3027]] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] staves [[G3586]] to take [[G4815]] me? [[G3165]]

### 49
I was [[G2252]] daily [[G2596]] with [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] teaching, [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] ye took [[G2902]] me [[G3165]] not: [[G3756]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] scriptures [[G1124]] must be fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 50
And [[G2532]] they [[G863]] all [[G3956]] forsook [[G863]] him, [[G846]] and fled. [[G5343]]

### 51
And [[G2532]] there followed [[G190]] him [[G846]] a [[G1520]] certain [[G5100]] young man, [[G3495]] having [[G4016]] a linen cloth [[G4616]] cast [[G4016]] about [[G1909]] naked [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] young [[G3495]] men [[G3495]] laid hold on [[G2902]] him: [[G846]]

### 52
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] left [[G2641]] the [[G3588]] linen cloth, [[G4616]] and fled [[G5343]] from [[G575]] them [[G846]] naked. [[G1131]]

### 53
And [[G2532]] they led away [[G520]] Jesus [[G2424]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] high priest: [[G749]] and [[G2532]] with him [[G846]] were assembled [[G4905]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes. [[G1122]]

### 54
And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] followed [[G190]] him [[G846]] afar [[G3113]] off, [[G575]] even [[G2193]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] palace [[G833]] the [[G3588]] of high [[G749]] priest: [[G749]] and [[G2532]] he sat [[G4775]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] servants, [[G5257]] and [[G2532]] warmed himself [[G2328]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] fire. [[G5457]]

### 55
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] council [[G4892]] sought for [[G2212]] witness [[G3141]] against [[G2596]] Jesus [[G2424]] to put [[G2289]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] death; [[G2289]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] none. [[G3756]]

### 56
For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] bare false witness [[G5576]] against [[G2596]] him, [[G846]] but [[G2532]] their [[G3588]] witness [[G3141]] agreed [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] together. [[G2470]]

### 57
And [[G2532]] there arose [[G450]] certain, [[G5100]] and bare false witness [[G5576]] against [[G2596]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 58
We [[G2249]] heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] say, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] will destroy [[G2647]] this [[G5126]] temple [[G3485]] that [[G3588]] is made with hands, [[G5499]] and [[G2532]] within [[G1223]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] I will build [[G3618]] another [[G243]] made without hands. [[G886]]

### 59
But [[G2532]] neither [[G3761]] so [[G3779]] did [[G2258]] their [[G846]] witness [[G3141]] agree [[G2258]] together. [[G2470]]

### 60
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] stood up [[G450]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] midst, [[G3319]] and asked [[G1905]] Jesus, [[G2424]] saying, [[G3004]] Answerest thou [[G611]] nothing? [[G3762]] what [[G5101]] these [[G3778]] witness against [[G2649]] thee? [[G4675]]

### 61
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] held his peace, [[G4623]] and [[G2532]] answered [[G611]] nothing. [[G3762]] Again [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2128]] Blessed? [[G2128]]

### 62
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] I [[G1473]] am: [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] ye shall see [[G3700]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] sitting [[G2521]] on [[G1537]] the right hand [[G1188]] of power, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] clouds [[G3507]] of heaven. [[G3772]]

### 63
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] rent [[G1284]] his [[G846]] clothes, [[G5509]] and saith, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] need [[G5532]]  we any [[G2192]] further [[G2089]] witnesses? [[G3144]]

### 64
Ye have heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] blasphemy: [[G988]] what [[G5101]] think [[G5316]] ye? [[G5213]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] all [[G3956]] condemned [[G2632]] him [[G846]] to be [[G1511]] guilty of [[G1777]] death. [[G2288]]

### 65
And [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] began [[G756]] to spit [[G1716]] on him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to cover [[G4028]] his [[G846]] face, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] to buffet [[G2852]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Prophesy: [[G4395]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] servants [[G5257]] did strike [[G906]] him [[G846]] with the palms of their hands. [[G4475]]

### 66
And [[G2532]] as Peter [[G4074]] was [[G5607]] beneath [[G2736]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] palace, [[G833]] there cometh [[G2064]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3814]] maids [[G3814]] the [[G3588]] of high [[G749]] priest: [[G749]]

### 67
And [[G2532]] when she saw [[G1492]] Peter [[G4074]] warming himself, [[G2328]] she looked [[G1689]] upon [[G846]] him, [[G846]] and said, [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] thou also [[G4771]] wast [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth. [[G3479]]

### 68
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] denied, [[G720]] saying, [[G3004]] I know [[G1492]] not, [[G3756]] neither [[G3761]] understand I [[G1987]] what [[G5101]] thou [[G4771]] sayest. [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] he went [[G1831]] out [[G1854]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] porch; [[G4259]] and [[G2532]] the cock [[G220]] crew. [[G5455]]

### 69
And [[G2532]]  a [[G3588]] maid [[G3814]] saw [[G1492]] him [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] and began [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] to them that [[G3588]] stood by, [[G3936]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] them. [[G846]]

### 70
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] denied it [[G720]] again. [[G3825]] And [[G2532]] a little [[G3397]] after, [[G3326]] they that [[G3588]] stood by [[G3936]] said [[G3004]] again [[G3825]] to Peter, [[G4074]] Surely [[G230]] thou art [[G1488]] of [[G1537]] them: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] thou [[G2532]] art [[G1488]] a Galilaean, [[G1057]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] speech [[G2981]] agreeth [[G3662]]

### 71
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] began [[G756]] to curse [[G332]] and [[G2532]] to swear, [[G3660]] I know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] this [[G5126]] man [[G444]] of whom [[G3739]] ye speak. [[G3004]]

### 72
And [[G2532]] the [[G1537]] second time [[G1208]] the cock [[G220]] crew. [[G5455]] And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] called to mind [[G363]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] that [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Before [[G4250]] the cock [[G220]] crow [[G5455]] twice, [[G1364]] thou shalt deny [[G533]] me [[G3165]] thrice. [[G5151]] And [[G2532]] when he thought thereon, [[G1911]] he wept. [[G2799]]
