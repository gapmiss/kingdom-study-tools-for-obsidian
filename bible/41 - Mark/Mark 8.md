### 1
In [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] being [[G5607]] very great, [[G3827]] and [[G2532]] having [[G2192]] nothing [[G3361]] to eat, [[G5315]] Jesus [[G2424]] called [[G4341]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] and saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]]

### 2
I have compassion [[G4697]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] because [[G3754]] now [[G2235]] they have with [[G4357]] been [[G4357]] me [[G3427]] three [[G5140]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] nothing [[G5101]] to eat: [[G5315]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] I send away [[G630]] them [[G846]] fasting [[G3523]] to [[G1519]] their own [[G846]] houses, [[G3624]] they will faint [[G1590]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way: [[G3598]] for [[G1063]] divers [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] came [[G2240]] from far. [[G3113]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] From whence [[G4159]] can [[G1410]] a man [[G5100]] satisfy [[G5526]] these [[G5128]] with bread [[G740]] here [[G5602]] in [[G1909]] the wilderness? [[G2047]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] he asked [[G1905]] them, [[G846]] How many [[G4214]] loaves [[G740]] have ye? [[G2192]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Seven. [[G2033]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] he commanded [[G3853]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] to sit down [[G377]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground: [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] he took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] loaves, [[G740]] and gave thanks, [[G2168]] and brake, [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] to [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G2443]] set before [[G3908]] and [[G2532]] they did set before [[G3908]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G3793]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] they had [[G2192]] a few [[G3641]] small fishes: [[G2485]] and [[G2532]] he blessed, [[G2127]] and commanded [[G2036]] to set before [[G3908]] them [[G846]] also [[G2532]]

### 8
So [[G1161]] they did eat, [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were filled: [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] they took up [[G142]] of the broken [[G2801]] that was left [[G4051]] seven [[G2033]] baskets. [[G4711]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] they that had eaten [[G5315]] were [[G2258]] about [[G5613]] four thousand: [[G5070]] and [[G2532]] he sent away. [[G630]] them [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] he entered [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] parts [[G3313]] of Dalmanutha. [[G1148]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] came forth, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to question [[G4802]] with [[G846]] him, [[G846]] seeking [[G2212]] of [[G3844]] him [[G846]] a sign [[G4592]] from [[G575]] heaven, [[G3772]] tempting [[G3985]] him. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] he sighed deeply [[G389]] in [[G4151]] his [[G846]] spirit, [[G4151]] and saith, [[G3004]] Why [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] doth seek [[G1934]] generation [[G1074]] after [[G1934]] a sign? [[G4592]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] no [[G1487]] There shall be [[G1325]] sign [[G4592]] given [[G1325]] unto [[G1074]] this [[G3778]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he left [[G863]] them, [[G846]] and entering [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] again [[G3825]] departed [[G565]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side. [[G4008]]

### 14
Now [[G2532]] had forgotten [[G1950]] to take [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] neither [[G3756]] had they [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] with [[G3326]] them [[G1438]] more than [[G1487]] one [[G1520]] loaf. [[G740]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he charged [[G1291]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Take heed, [[G3708]] beware [[G991]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] leaven [[G2219]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] leaven [[G2219]] of Herod. [[G2264]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] they reasoned [[G1260]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] saying, [[G3004]] because [[G3754]] we have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] bread. [[G740]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] when [[G1097]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1097]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] reason ye, [[G1260]] because [[G3754]] ye have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] bread? [[G740]] perceive ye [[G3539]] not yet, [[G3768]] neither [[G3761]] understand? [[G4920]] have ye [[G2192]] your [[G5216]] heart [[G2588]] yet [[G2089]] hardened? [[G4456]]

### 18
Having [[G2192]] eyes, [[G3788]] see ye [[G991]] not? [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] having [[G2192]] ears, [[G3775]] hear ye [[G191]] not? [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] do ye [[G3421]] remember? [[G3421]]

### 19
When [[G3753]] I brake [[G2806]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] among [[G1519]] five thousand, [[G4000]] how many [[G4214]] baskets [[G2894]] full [[G4134]] of fragments [[G2801]] took ye up? [[G142]] They say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Twelve. [[G1427]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] among [[G1519]] four thousand, [[G5070]] how many [[G4214]] baskets [[G4711]] full [[G4138]] of fragments [[G2801]] took ye up? [[G142]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Seven. [[G2033]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] How is it that [[G4459]] not [[G3756]] ye do [[G4920]] understand? [[G4920]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] he cometh [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Bethsaida; [[G966]] and [[G2532]] they bring [[G5342]] a blind man [[G5185]] unto him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] to [[G2443]] touch [[G680]] him. [[G846]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he took [[G1949]] the [[G3588]] blind man [[G5185]] the [[G3588]] by [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] and led [[G1806]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] town; [[G2968]] and [[G2532]] when he had spit [[G4429]] on [[G1519]] his [[G846]] eyes, [[G3659]] and put [[G2007]] his hands [[G5495]] upon him, [[G846]] he asked [[G1905]] him [[G846]] if [[G1487]] he saw [[G991]] ought. [[G5100]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] he looked up, [[G308]] and said, [[G3004]] I see [[G991]] men [[G444]] as [[G5613]] trees, [[G1186]] walking. [[G4043]]

### 25
After that [[G1534]] he put [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] again [[G3825]] upon [[G1909]] his [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] made [[G4160]] him [[G846]] look up: [[G308]] and [[G2532]] he was restored, [[G600]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G1689]] every man [[G537]] clearly. [[G5081]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] he sent away [[G649]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] saying, [[G3004]] Neither [[G3366]] go [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] town, [[G2968]] nor [[G3366]] tell [[G2036]] to any [[G5100]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] town. [[G2968]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went out, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] towns [[G2968]] of Caesarea [[G2542]] Philippi: [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] he asked [[G1905]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] saying [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Whom [[G5101]] do [[G3004]] men [[G444]] say [[G3004]] that I [[G3165]] am? [[G1511]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] answered, [[G611]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist: [[G910]] but [[G2532]] some [[G243]] Elias; [[G2243]] and [[G1161]] others, [[G243]] One [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] But [[G1161]] whom [[G5101]] say [[G3004]] ye [[G5210]] that I [[G3165]] am? [[G1511]] And [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] answereth [[G611]] and saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] he charged [[G2008]] them [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they should tell [[G3004]] no man [[G3367]] of [[G4012]] him. [[G846]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] he began [[G756]] to teach [[G1321]] them, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] suffer [[G3958]] many things, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] be rejected [[G593]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] the chief priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] be killed, [[G615]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] rise again. [[G450]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] he spake [[G2980]] that saying [[G3056]] openly. [[G3954]] And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] took [[G4355]] him, [[G846]] and began [[G756]] to rebuke [[G2008]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] when had turned [[G1994]] about [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] looked on [[G1492]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] he rebuked [[G2008]] Peter, [[G4074]] saying, [[G3004]] Get thee [[G5217]] behind [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] Satan: [[G4567]] for [[G3754]] thou savourest [[G5426]] not [[G3756]] the things [[G3588]] that be of God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] the things [[G3588]] that be of men. [[G444]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] when he had called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] with also, [[G4862]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Whosoever [[G3748]] will [[G2309]] come [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] let him deny [[G533]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] his [[G846]] cross, [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 35
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3739]] will [[G2309]] save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] shall lose [[G622]] it; [[G846]] but [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall lose [[G622]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G1752]] my [[G1700]] sake [[G1752]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gospel's, [[G2098]] the same [[G3778]] shall save [[G4982]] it. [[G846]]

### 36
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] shall it profit [[G5623]] a man, [[G444]] if [[G1437]] he shall gain [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] lose [[G2210]] his own [[G846]] soul? [[G5590]]

### 37
Or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] shall [[G1325]] a man [[G444]] give [[G1325]] in exchange for [[G465]] his [[G846]] soul? [[G5590]]

### 38
Whosoever [[G302]] therefore [[G1063]] shall be ashamed [[G1870]] of me [[G3165]] and of [[G2532]] my [[G1699]] words [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] adulterous [[G3428]] and [[G2532]] sinful [[G268]] generation; [[G1074]] of him [[G846]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] shall be [[G1870]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] ashamed, [[G1870]] when [[G3752]] he cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G3962]] his [[G846]] Father [[G3962]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] angels. [[G32]]
