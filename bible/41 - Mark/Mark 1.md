The beginning [[G746]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel [[G2098]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the Son [[G5207]] of God; [[G2316]]

### 2
As [[G5613]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] Behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] send [[G649]] my [[G3450]] messenger [[G32]] before [[G4253]] thy [[G4675]] face, [[G4383]] which [[G3739]] shall prepare [[G2680]] thy [[G4675]] way [[G3598]] before [[G1715]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 3
The voice [[G5456]] of one crying [[G994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] Prepare ye [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] make [[G4160]] his [[G846]] paths [[G5147]] straight. [[G2117]]

### 4
John [[G2491]] did [[G1096]] baptize [[G907]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] and [[G2532]] preach [[G2784]] the baptism [[G908]] of repentance [[G3341]] for [[G1519]] the remission [[G859]] of sins. [[G266]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] there went out [[G1607]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] land [[G5561]] of Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] they of Jerusalem, [[G2415]] and [[G2532]] were [[G907]] all [[G3956]] baptized [[G907]] of [[G5259]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] river [[G4215]] of Jordan, [[G2446]] confessing [[G1843]] their [[G846]] sins. [[G266]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] was [[G2258]] clothed with [[G1746]] camel's [[G2574]] hair, [[G2359]] and [[G2532]] with a girdle [[G2223]] of a skin [[G1193]] about [[G4012]] his [[G846]] loins; [[G3751]] and [[G2532]] he did eat [[G2068]] locusts [[G200]] and [[G2532]] wild [[G66]] honey; [[G3192]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] preached, [[G2784]] saying, [[G3004]] There cometh [[G2064]] one [[G3588]] mightier than [[G2478]] I [[G3450]] after [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] the [[G3588]] latchet [[G2438]] of whose [[G3739]] shoes [[G5266]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] stoop down [[G2955]] and [[G3089]] to unloose. [[G3089]]

### 8
I [[G1473]] indeed [[G3303]] have baptized [[G907]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] water: [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] he [[G846]] shall baptize [[G907]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] it came to pass [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] that Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] Nazareth [[G3478]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] was baptized [[G907]] of [[G5259]] John [[G2491]] in [[G1519]] Jordan. [[G2446]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] coming up [[G305]] out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] he saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] opened, [[G4977]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] like [[G5616]] a dove [[G4058]] descending [[G2597]] upon [[G1909]] him: [[G846]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] there came [[G1096]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] Son, [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] I am well pleased. [[G2106]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2117]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] driveth [[G1544]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he was [[G2258]] there [[G1563]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] forty [[G5062]] days, [[G2250]] tempted [[G3985]] of [[G5259]] Satan; [[G4567]] and [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] wild beasts; [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] ministered [[G1247]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 14
Now [[G1161]] after that [[G3326]] John [[G2491]] was put in prison, [[G3860]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] preaching [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] is fulfilled, [[G4137]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is at hand: [[G1448]] repent ye, [[G3340]] and [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]]

### 16
Now [[G1161]] as he walked [[G4043]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] he saw [[G1492]] Simon [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] Andrew [[G406]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] casting [[G906]] a net [[G293]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea: [[G2281]] for [[G1063]] they were [[G2258]] fishers. [[G231]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Come ye [[G1205]] after [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] and [[G2532]] I will make [[G4160]] you [[G5209]] to become [[G1096]] fishers [[G231]] of men. [[G444]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] they forsook [[G863]] their [[G846]] nets, [[G1350]] and followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] when he had gone [[G4260]] a little farther [[G3641]] thence, [[G1564]] he saw [[G1492]] James [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] who were [[G846]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] mending [[G2675]] their [[G3588]] nets. [[G1350]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] he called [[G2564]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they left [[G863]] their [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Zebedee [[G2199]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] hired servants, [[G3411]] and went [[G565]] after [[G3694]] him. [[G846]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] they went [[G1531]] into [[G1519]] Capernaum; [[G2584]] and [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] day [[G4521]] he entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and taught. [[G1321]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] they were astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] doctrine: [[G1322]] for [[G1063]] he [[G2258]] taught [[G1321]] them [[G846]] as [[G5613]] one that had [[G2192]] authority, [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] scribes. [[G1122]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] there was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogue [[G4864]] a [[G3588]] man [[G444]] with [[G1722]] an unclean [[G169]] spirit; [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] he cried out, [[G349]]

### 24
Saying, [[G3004]] Let alone; [[G1436]] what [[G5101]] have we to do [[G2254]] with [[G2532]] thee, [[G4671]] thou Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth? [[G3479]] art thou come [[G2064]] to destroy [[G622]] us? [[G2248]] I know [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] who [[G5101]] thou art, [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Holy One [[G40]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] rebuked [[G2008]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Hold thy peace, [[G5392]] and [[G2532]] come out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] him. [[G846]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] when had [[G4682]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] torn [[G4682]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] cried [[G2896]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] he came out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] him. [[G846]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] they were [[G2284]] all [[G3956]] amazed, [[G2284]] insomuch that [[G5620]] they questioned [[G4802]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] thing [[G2076]] is [[G2076]] this? [[G5124]] what [[G5101]] new [[G2537]] doctrine [[G1322]] this? [[G3778]] for [[G3754]] with [[G2596]] authority [[G1849]] commandeth he [[G2004]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they do obey [[G5219]] him. [[G846]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] immediately [[G2117]] his [[G846]] fame [[G189]] spread abroad [[G1831]] throughout [[G1519]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] region round about [[G4066]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] forthwith, [[G2112]] when they were come [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] they entered [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] of Simon [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] Andrew, [[G406]] with [[G3326]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John. [[G2491]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] Simon's [[G4613]] wife's mother [[G3994]] lay [[G2621]] sick of a fever, [[G4445]] and [[G2532]] anon [[G2112]] they tell [[G3004]] him [[G846]] of [[G4012]] her. [[G846]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] he came [[G4334]] and took [[G2902]] her [[G846]] the [[G3588]] by [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] and lifted up; [[G1453]] her [[G846]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] fever [[G4446]] left [[G863]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] she ministered [[G1247]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] at even, [[G3798]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] did [[G1096]] set, [[G1416]] they brought [[G5342]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] that were [[G2192]] diseased, [[G2560]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] that were possessed with devils. [[G1139]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] was [[G2258]] gathered together [[G1996]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] door. [[G2374]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] he healed [[G2323]] many [[G4183]] sick [[G2560]] that were [[G2192]] of divers [[G4164]] diseases, [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] cast out [[G1544]] many [[G4183]] devils; [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] suffered [[G863]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] devils [[G1140]] to speak, [[G2980]] because [[G3754]] they knew [[G1492]] him. [[G846]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] in the morning, [[G4404]] rising up [[G450]] before day, [[G1773]] a great while [[G3029]] he went out, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] departed [[G565]] into [[G1519]] a solitary [[G2048]] place, [[G5117]] and there [[G2546]] prayed. [[G4336]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] Simon [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that were with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] followed after [[G2614]] him. [[G846]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] when they had found [[G2147]] him, [[G846]] they said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] All [[G3956]] seek for [[G2212]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Let us go [[G71]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] next [[G2192]] towns, [[G2969]] that [[G2443]] I may preach [[G2784]] there also: [[G2546]] for [[G1063]] therefore [[G5124]] came I forth. [[G1831]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] he [[G2258]] preached [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues [[G4864]] throughout [[G1519]] all [[G3650]] Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] cast out [[G1544]] devils. [[G1140]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] there came [[G2064]] a leper [[G3015]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] beseeching [[G3870]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] kneeling down [[G1120]] to him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1437]] thou wilt, [[G2309]] thou canst [[G1410]] me [[G3165]] make clean. [[G2511]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] Jesus, [[G2424]] moved with compassion, [[G4697]] put forth [[G1614]] hand, [[G5495]] and touched [[G680]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] I will; [[G2309]] be thou clean. [[G2511]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] as soon as had [[G2036]] he [[G846]] spoken, [[G2036]] immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] leprosy [[G3014]] departed [[G565]] from [[G575]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he was cleansed. [[G2511]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] he straitly charged [[G1690]] him, [[G846]] and [[G1690]] forthwith [[G2112]] sent away; [[G1544]] him [[G846]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] See [[G3708]] thou say [[G2036]] nothing [[G3367]] to any man: [[G3367]] but [[G235]] go thy way, [[G5217]] shew [[G1166]] thyself [[G4572]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2409]] priest, [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] offer [[G4374]] for [[G4012]] thy [[G4675]] cleansing [[G2512]] those things which [[G3739]] Moses [[G3475]] commanded, [[G4367]] for [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 45
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] went out, [[G1831]] and began [[G756]] to publish [[G2784]] much, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] to blaze abroad [[G1310]] the [[G3588]] matter, [[G3056]] insomuch that [[G5620]] Jesus [[G846]] could [[G1410]] no more [[G3371]] openly [[G5320]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the city, [[G4172]] but [[G235]] was [[G2258]] without [[G1854]] in [[G1722]] desert [[G2048]] places: [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] from every quarter. [[G3836]]
