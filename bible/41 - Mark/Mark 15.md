### 1
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] morning [[G4404]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] held [[G4160]] a consultation [[G4824]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] council, [[G4892]] and bound [[G1210]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and carried away, [[G667]] and [[G2532]] delivered [[G3860]] to Pilate. [[G4091]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews? [[G2453]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou [[G4771]] sayest [[G3004]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] accused [[G2723]] him [[G846]] of many things: [[G4183]] but [[G1161]] he [[G846]] answered [[G611]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked [[G1905]] him [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] saying, [[G3004]] Answerest thou [[G611]] nothing? [[G3762]] behold [[G1492]] how many things [[G4214]] they witness against [[G2649]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] yet [[G3765]] answered [[G611]] nothing; [[G3762]] so that [[G5620]] Pilate [[G4091]] marvelled. [[G2296]]

### 6
Now [[G1161]] at [[G2596]] feast [[G1859]] he released [[G630]] unto them [[G846]] one [[G1520]] prisoner, [[G1198]] whomsoever [[G3746]] they desired. [[G154]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] named [[G3004]] Barabbas, [[G912]] bound [[G1210]] with [[G3326]] them that [[G3588]] had made insurrection with him, [[G4955]] who [[G3748]] had committed [[G4160]] murder [[G5408]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] insurrection. [[G4714]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] crying aloud [[G310]] began [[G756]] to desire [[G154]] as [[G2531]] ever [[G104]] he had [[G4160]] done [[G4160]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Will ye [[G2309]] that I release [[G630]] unto you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews? [[G2453]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] he knew [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] had delivered [[G3860]] him [[G846]] for [[G1223]] envy. [[G5355]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] moved [[G383]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] that [[G2443]] rather [[G3123]] he should [[G630]] release [[G630]] Barabbas [[G912]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] again [[G3825]] unto them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] will ye [[G2309]] then [[G3767]] that I shall do [[G4160]] whom [[G3739]] ye call [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews? [[G2453]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] cried out [[G2896]] again, [[G3825]] Crucify [[G4717]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
Then [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Why, [[G5101]] what [[G1063]] evil [[G2556]] hath he done? [[G4160]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] cried out [[G2896]] the more exceedingly, [[G4056]] Crucify [[G4717]] him. [[G846]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] Pilate, [[G4091]] willing [[G1014]] to content [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] released [[G630]] Barabbas [[G912]] unto them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] delivered [[G3860]] Jesus, [[G2424]] when he had scourged [[G5417]] to [[G2443]] be crucified. [[G4717]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] led away [[G520]] him [[G846]] into [[G2080]] the [[G3588]] hall, [[G833]] called [[G2076]] Praetorium; [[G4232]] and [[G2532]] they call together [[G4779]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] band. [[G4686]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] they clothed [[G1746]] him [[G846]] with purple, [[G4209]] and platted [[G4120]] a crown [[G4735]] of thorns, [[G174]] and [[G2532]] put it about [[G4060]] his [[G846]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to salute [[G782]] him, [[G846]] Hail, [[G5463]] King [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews! [[G2453]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] they smote [[G5180]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] on [[G2776]] head [[G2776]] with a reed, [[G2563]] and [[G2532]] did spit [[G1716]] upon [[G846]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] bowing [[G5087]] knees [[G1119]] worshipped [[G4352]] him. [[G846]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] they had mocked [[G1702]] him, [[G846]] they took off from [[G1562]] the [[G3588]] purple [[G4209]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] put [[G1746]] his own [[G2398]] clothes [[G2440]] on him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] led out [[G1806]] him [[G846]] to [[G2443]] crucify [[G4717]] him. [[G846]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] they compel [[G29]] one [[G5100]] Simon [[G4613]] a Cyrenian, [[G2956]] who passed by, [[G3855]] coming out [[G2064]] of [[G575]] the country, [[G68]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] of Alexander [[G223]] and [[G2532]] Rufus, [[G4504]] to [[G2443]] bear [[G142]] his [[G846]] cross. [[G4716]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] they bring [[G5342]] him [[G846]] unto [[G1909]] the place [[G5117]] Golgotha, [[G1115]] which [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] being interpreted, [[G3177]] The place [[G5117]] of a skull. [[G2898]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] they gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] to drink [[G4095]] wine [[G3631]] mingled with myrrh: [[G4669]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] received [[G2983]] not. [[G3756]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] when they had crucified [[G4717]] him, [[G846]] they parted [[G1266]] his [[G846]] garments, [[G2440]] casting [[G906]] lots [[G2819]] upon [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] what [[G5101]] every man [[G5101]] should take. [[G142]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] it was [[G2258]] the third [[G5154]] hour, [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] they crucified [[G4717]] him. [[G846]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] superscription [[G1923]] of his [[G846]] accusation [[G156]] was [[G2258]] written over, [[G1924]] THE [[G3588]] KING [[G935]] THE [[G3588]] OF [[G2453]] JEWS. [[G2453]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] they crucify [[G4717]] two [[G1417]] thieves; [[G3027]] the one [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] his right hand, [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] the other [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] his [[G846]] left. [[G2176]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] was fulfilled, [[G4137]] which [[G3588]] saith, [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] he was numbered [[G3049]] with [[G3326]] the transgressors. [[G459]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] they that [[G3588]] passed by [[G3899]] railed on [[G987]] him, [[G846]] wagging [[G2795]] their [[G846]] heads, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Ah, [[G3758]] thou that [[G3588]] destroyest [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] buildest [[G3618]] in [[G1722]] three [[G5140]] days, [[G2250]]

### 30
Save [[G4982]] thyself, [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] come down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cross. [[G4716]]

### 31
Likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] mocking [[G1702]] said [[G3004]] among [[G4314]] themselves [[G240]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] scribes, [[G1122]] He saved [[G4982]] others; [[G243]] himself [[G1438]] he cannot [[G1410]] save. [[G4982]]

### 32
Let Christ [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of Israel [[G2474]] descend [[G2597]] now [[G3568]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] cross, [[G4716]] that [[G2443]] we may see [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] believe. [[G4100]] And [[G2532]] they that [[G3588]] were crucified [[G4957]] with [[G846]] him [[G846]] reviled [[G3679]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] when the sixth [[G1623]] hour [[G5610]] was come, [[G1096]] there was [[G1096]] darkness [[G4655]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] land [[G1093]] until [[G2193]] the ninth [[G1766]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] at [[G1766]] ninth [[G1766]] hour [[G5610]] Jesus [[G2424]] cried [[G994]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] saying, [[G3004]] Eloi, [[G1682]] Eloi, [[G1682]] lama [[G2982]] sabachthani? [[G4518]] which [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] being interpreted, [[G3177]] My [[G3450]] God, [[G2316]] my [[G3450]] God, [[G2316]] why [[G5101]] hast thou forsaken [[G1459]] me? [[G3165]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of them that [[G3588]] stood by, [[G3936]] when they heard [[G191]] said, [[G3004]] Behold, [[G2400]] he calleth [[G5455]] Elias. [[G2243]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] ran [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] filled full [[G1072]] a spunge [[G4699]] of vinegar, [[G3690]] and [[G5037]] put [[G4060]] on a reed, [[G2563]] and gave to [[G4222]] him [[G846]] drink, [[G4222]] saying, [[G3004]] Let alone; [[G863]] let us see [[G1492]] whether [[G1487]] Elias [[G2243]] will come [[G2064]] to take down. [[G2507]] him [[G846]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] cried [[G863]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] and gave up the ghost. [[G1606]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] veil [[G2665]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3485]] temple [[G3485]] was rent [[G4977]] in [[G1519]] twain [[G1417]] from [[G575]] the top [[G509]] to [[G2193]] the bottom. [[G2736]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G2760]] centurion, [[G2760]] which [[G3588]] stood [[G3936]] over [[G1537]] against [[G1727]] him, [[G846]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] so [[G3779]] he out, [[G2896]] cried [[G2896]] and gave up the ghost, [[G1606]] he said, [[G2036]] Truly [[G230]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] was [[G2258]] the Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 40
There [[G1161]] were [[G2258]] also [[G2532]] women [[G1135]] looking on [[G2334]] afar [[G3113]] off: [[G575]] among [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of James [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] less [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] of Joses, [[G2499]] and [[G2532]] Salome; [[G4539]]

### 41
(Who [[G3739]] also, [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] Galilee, [[G1056]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] ministered [[G1247]] unto him;) [[G846]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] other women [[G243]] which [[G3588]] came up [[G4872]] with him [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] now [[G2235]] when the even [[G3798]] was come, [[G1096]] because [[G1893]] it was [[G2258]] the preparation, [[G3904]] that [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] the day before the sabbath, [[G4315]]

### 43
Joseph [[G2501]] of [[G575]] Arimathaea, [[G707]] an honourable [[G2158]] counseller, [[G1010]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] waited for [[G4327]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] came, [[G2064]] and went in [[G1525]] boldly [[G5111]] unto [[G4314]] Pilate, [[G4091]] and [[G2532]] craved [[G154]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 44
And [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] marvelled [[G2296]] if [[G1487]] already [[G2235]] he were [[G2348]] dead: [[G2348]] and [[G2532]] calling [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] centurion, [[G2760]] he asked [[G1905]] him [[G846]] whether [[G1487]] any while [[G3819]] he had been [[G599]] dead. [[G599]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] when he knew [[G1097]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] centurion, [[G2760]] he gave [[G1433]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] to Joseph. [[G2501]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] he bought [[G59]] fine linen, [[G4616]] and [[G2532]] took down, [[G2507]] him [[G846]] and wrapped him in [[G1750]] the [[G3588]] linen, [[G4616]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G2698]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a sepulchre [[G3419]] which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] hewn [[G2998]] out of [[G1537]] a rock, [[G4073]] and [[G2532]] rolled [[G4351]] a stone [[G3037]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3419]] sepulchre. [[G3419]]

### 47
And [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] of Joses [[G2499]] beheld [[G2334]] where [[G4225]] he was laid. [[G5087]]
