### 1
Then [[G2532]] came together [[G4863]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1122]] scribes, [[G1122]] which came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] when they saw [[G1492]] some [[G5100]] of [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] eat [[G2068]] bread [[G740]] defiled, [[G2839]] with [[G5495]] that [[G5124]] is to say, [[G2076]] with unwashen, [[G449]] hands, [[G5495]] they found fault. [[G3201]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] except [[G1437]] they wash [[G3538]] hands [[G5495]] oft, [[G4435]] eat [[G2068]] not, [[G3756]] holding [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] the [[G3588]] of elders. [[G4245]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] from [[G575]] the market, [[G58]] except [[G1437]] they wash, [[G907]] they eat [[G2068]] not. [[G3756]] And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] other things [[G243]] there be, [[G2076]] which [[G3739]] they have received [[G3880]] to hold, [[G2902]] the washing [[G909]] of cups, [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] pots, [[G3582]] brasen vessels, [[G5473]] and [[G2532]] of tables. [[G2825]]

### 5
Then [[G1899]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] Why [[G1302]] walk [[G4043]] not [[G3756]] thy [[G4675]] disciples [[G3101]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] of [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] but [[G235]] eat [[G2068]] with [[G5495]] bread [[G740]] unwashen [[G449]] hands? [[G5495]]

### 6
He [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Well [[G2573]] hath [[G4395]] Esaias [[G2268]] prophesied [[G4395]] of [[G4012]] you [[G5216]] hypocrites, [[G5273]] as [[G5613]] it is written, [[G1125]] This [[G3778]] people [[G2992]] honoureth [[G5091]] me [[G3165]] with lips, [[G5491]] but [[G1161]] their [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] is [[G568]] far [[G4206]] from [[G575]] me. [[G1700]]

### 7
Howbeit [[G1161]] in vain [[G3155]] do they worship [[G4576]] me, [[G3165]] teaching [[G1321]] doctrines [[G1319]] the commandments [[G1778]] of men. [[G444]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] laying aside [[G863]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] of God, [[G2316]] ye hold [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] of men, [[G444]] the washing [[G909]] of pots [[G3582]] and [[G2532]] cups: [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] other [[G243]] such [[G5108]] like things [[G3946]] ye do. [[G4160]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Full well [[G2573]] ye reject [[G114]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] of God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] ye may keep [[G5083]] your own [[G5216]] tradition. [[G3862]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] Moses [[G3475]] said, [[G2036]] Honour [[G5091]] thy [[G4675]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] mother; [[G3384]] and, [[G2532]] Whoso curseth [[G2551]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother, [[G3384]] let him die [[G5053]] the death: [[G2288]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] say, [[G3004]] If [[G1437]] a man [[G444]] shall say [[G2036]] to his father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother, [[G3384]] Corban, [[G2878]] that [[G3739]] is to say, [[G2076]] a gift, [[G1435]] by whatsoever [[G1437]] thou mightest be profited [[G5623]] by [[G1537]] me; [[G1700]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] ye suffer [[G863]] him [[G846]] no more [[G3765]] to do [[G4160]] ought [[G3762]] for [[G3962]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] his [[G846]] mother; [[G3384]]

### 13
Making of none effect [[G208]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] through your [[G5216]] tradition, [[G3862]] which [[G3739]] ye have delivered: [[G3860]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] such [[G5108]] like things [[G3946]] do ye. [[G4160]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] when he had called [[G4341]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Hearken [[G191]] unto me [[G3450]] every one [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] understand: [[G4920]]

### 15
There is [[G2076]] nothing [[G3762]] from without [[G1855]] a [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] that [[G3739]] entering [[G1531]] into [[G1519]] him [[G846]] can [[G1410]] defile [[G2840]] him: [[G846]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] things which come out [[G1607]] of [[G575]] him, [[G846]] those [[G1565]] are they [[G2076]] that defile [[G2840]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G444]]

### 16
If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] have [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he was entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the house [[G3624]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] him [[G846]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] parable. [[G3850]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Are [[G2075]] ye [[G5210]] so [[G3779]] without understanding [[G801]] also? [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] Do ye [[G3539]] perceive, [[G3539]] that [[G3754]] whatsoever thing [[G3956]] from without [[G1855]] entereth [[G1531]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] cannot [[G1410]] defile [[G2840]] him; [[G846]]

### 19
Because [[G3754]] it entereth [[G1531]] not [[G3756]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] but [[G235]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] belly, [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] goeth out [[G1607]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] draught, [[G856]] purging [[G2511]] all [[G3956]] meats? [[G1033]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] he said, [[G3004]] That [[G3588]] which out [[G1607]] cometh [[G1607]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] that [[G1565]] defileth [[G2840]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G444]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] from within, [[G2081]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] of men, [[G444]] proceed [[G1607]] evil [[G2556]] thoughts, [[G1261]] adulteries, [[G3430]] fornications, [[G4202]] murders, [[G5408]]

### 22
Thefts, [[G2829]] covetousness, [[G4124]] wickedness, [[G4189]] deceit, [[G1388]] lasciviousness, [[G766]] an [[G3788]] evil [[G4190]] eye, [[G3788]] blasphemy, [[G988]] pride, [[G5243]] foolishness: [[G877]]

### 23
All [[G3956]] these [[G5023]] evil things [[G4190]] come [[G1607]] from within, [[G2081]] and [[G2532]] defile [[G2840]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G444]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] from thence [[G1564]] he arose, [[G450]] and went [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] borders [[G3181]] of Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4605]] and [[G2532]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] an house, [[G3614]] and would have [[G2309]] no man [[G3762]] know [[G1097]] but [[G2532]] he could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] be hid. [[G2990]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] a woman, [[G1135]] whose [[G3739]] young daughter [[G2365]] had [[G2192]] an [[G4151]] unclean [[G169]] spirit, [[G4151]] heard [[G191]] of [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] and came [[G2064]] and fell [[G4363]] at [[G4314]] his [[G846]] feet: [[G4228]]

### 26
The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] was [[G2258]] a Greek, [[G1674]] a Syrophenician [[G4949]] by nation; [[G1085]] and [[G2532]] she besought [[G2065]] him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he would cast forth [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1140]] out [[G1537]] of [[G2364]] her [[G846]] daughter. [[G2364]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Let [[G863]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] first [[G4412]] be filled: [[G5526]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] meet [[G2570]] to take [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] children's [[G5043]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] to cast [[G906]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2952]] dogs. [[G2952]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Yes, [[G3483]] Lord: [[G2962]] yet [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] dogs [[G2952]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] table [[G5132]] eat [[G2068]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] children's [[G3813]] crumbs. [[G5589]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] For [[G1223]] this [[G5126]] saying [[G3056]] go thy way; [[G5217]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1140]] is gone out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] daughter. [[G2364]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] when she was come [[G565]] to [[G1519]] her [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] she found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1140]] gone out, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] her daughter [[G2364]] laid [[G906]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] bed. [[G2825]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] departing [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G3725]] of Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4605]] he came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] through [[G303]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3725]] coasts [[G3725]] of Decapolis. [[G1179]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] they bring [[G5342]] unto him [[G846]] one that was deaf, [[G2974]] and had an impediment in his speech; [[G3424]] and [[G2532]] they beseech [[G3870]] him [[G846]] to [[G2443]] put upon [[G2007]] his hand [[G5495]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] he took [[G618]] him [[G846]] aside [[G2596]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] and put [[G906]] his [[G846]] fingers [[G1147]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] ears, [[G3775]] and [[G2532]] he spit, [[G4429]] and touched [[G680]] his [[G846]] tongue; [[G1100]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] looking up [[G308]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] he sighed, [[G4727]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Ephphatha, [[G2188]] that [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] Be opened. [[G1272]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] his [[G846]] ears [[G189]] were opened, [[G1272]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] string [[G1199]] of [[G1100]] his [[G846]] tongue [[G1100]] was loosed, [[G3089]] and [[G2532]] he spake [[G2980]] plain. [[G3723]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] he charged [[G1291]] them [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they should tell [[G2036]] no man: [[G3367]] but [[G1161]] the more [[G3745]] he [[G846]] charged [[G1291]] them, [[G846]] so much the more [[G3123]] a great deal [[G4054]] they published [[G2784]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] beyond measure [[G5249]] were [[G1605]] astonished, [[G1605]] saying, [[G3004]] He hath done [[G4160]] all things [[G3956]] well: [[G2573]] he maketh [[G4160]] both [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] deaf [[G2974]] to hear, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dumb [[G216]] to speak. [[G2980]]
