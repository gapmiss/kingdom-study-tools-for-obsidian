### 1
And from thence, [[G2547]] he arose [[G450]] and cometh [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G3725]] of Judaea [[G2449]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] farther side [[G4008]] of Jordan: [[G2446]] and [[G2532]] the people [[G3793]] resort [[G4848]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] again; [[G3825]] and, [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] he was wont, [[G1486]] he taught [[G1321]] them [[G846]] again. [[G3825]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] came to [[G4334]] and asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] him, [[G846]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] for a man [[G435]] to put away [[G630]] wife? [[G1135]] tempting [[G3985]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] did [[G1781]] Moses [[G3475]] command [[G1781]] you? [[G5213]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Moses [[G3475]] suffered [[G2010]] to write [[G1125]] a bill [[G975]] of divorcement, [[G647]] and [[G2532]] to put away. [[G630]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] For [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] hardness of [[G4641]] your [[G5216]] heart [[G4641]] he wrote [[G1125]] you [[G5213]] this [[G3778]] precept. [[G1785]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] from [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] of the creation [[G2937]] God [[G2316]] made [[G4160]] them [[G846]] male [[G730]] and [[G2532]] female. [[G2338]]

### 7
For [[G1752]] this [[G5127]] cause [[G1752]] shall [[G2641]] a man [[G444]] leave [[G2641]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] cleave [[G4347]] to [[G4314]] his [[G846]] wife; [[G1135]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] they shall [[G2071]] twain [[G1417]] be [[G2071]] one [[G1520]] flesh: [[G4561]] so then [[G5620]] they are [[G1526]] no more [[G3765]] twain, [[G1417]] but [[G235]] one [[G1520]] flesh. [[G4561]]

### 9
What [[G3739]] therefore [[G3767]] God [[G2316]] hath joined together, [[G4801]] not [[G3361]] let put [[G5563]] man [[G444]] asunder. [[G5563]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] him [[G846]] again [[G3825]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Whosoever [[G3739]] shall put away [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] marry [[G1060]] another, [[G243]] committeth adultery [[G3429]] against [[G1909]] her. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] a woman [[G1135]] shall put away [[G630]] her [[G846]] husband, [[G435]] and [[G2532]] be married to [[G1060]] another, [[G243]] she committeth adultery. [[G3429]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] they brought [[G4374]] young children [[G3813]] to him, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he should touch [[G680]] them: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] disciples [[G3101]] rebuked [[G2008]] those that brought [[G4374]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] he was much displeased, [[G23]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Suffer [[G863]] the [[G3588]] little children [[G3813]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] forbid [[G2967]] them [[G846]] not: [[G3361]] for [[G1063]] of such [[G5108]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 15
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Whosoever [[G3739]] not [[G3361]] shall [[G1209]] receive [[G1209]] the of [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] God [[G2316]] as [[G5613]] a little child, [[G3813]] not [[G3756]] he shall [[G1525]] enter [[G1525]] therein. [[G846]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he took up in his arms, [[G1723]] them [[G846]] put [[G5087]] hands [[G5495]] upon [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and blessed [[G2127]] them. [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] when was gone [[G1607]] he [[G846]] forth [[G1607]] into [[G1519]] the way, [[G3598]] there came running, [[G4370]] one [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] kneeled [[G1120]] to him, [[G846]] and asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] Good [[G18]] Master, [[G1320]] what [[G5101]] shall I do [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] I may inherit [[G2816]] eternal [[G166]] life? [[G2222]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] callest thou [[G3004]] me [[G3165]] good? [[G18]] none [[G3762]] good [[G18]] but [[G1487]] one, [[G1520]] God. [[G2316]]

### 19
Thou knowest [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] commandments, [[G1785]] not [[G3361]] Do commit [[G3431]] adultery, [[G3431]] not [[G3361]] Do [[G5407]] kill, [[G5407]] not [[G3361]] Do [[G2813]] steal, [[G2813]] not [[G3361]] Do bear false [[G5576]] witness, [[G5576]] Defraud [[G650]] not, [[G3361]] Honour [[G5091]] thy [[G4675]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother. [[G3384]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] all [[G3956]] these [[G5023]] have I observed [[G5442]] from [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] youth. [[G3503]]

### 21
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] beholding [[G1689]] him [[G846]] loved [[G25]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] One thing [[G1520]] thou [[G4671]] lackest: [[G5302]] go thy way, [[G5217]] sell [[G4453]] whatsoever [[G3745]] thou hast, [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4434]] poor, [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt have [[G2192]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] come, [[G1204]] take up [[G142]] the [[G3588]] cross, [[G4716]] and follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] was sad [[G4768]] at [[G1909]] that saying, [[G3056]] and went away [[G565]] grieved: [[G3076]] for [[G1063]] he [[G2258]] had [[G2192]] great [[G4183]] possessions. [[G2933]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] looked round about, [[G4017]] and saith [[G3004]] unto [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] How [[G4459]] hardly [[G1423]] they that have [[G2192]] shall [[G1525]] riches [[G5536]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God! [[G2316]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were astonished [[G2284]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] words. [[G3056]] But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answereth [[G611]] again, [[G3825]] and saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Children, [[G5043]] how [[G4459]] hard [[G1422]] is it [[G2076]] for them that trust [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] riches [[G5536]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God! [[G2316]]

### 25
It is [[G2076]] easier [[G2123]] for a camel [[G2574]] to go [[G1525]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] eye [[G5168]] of a needle, [[G4476]] than [[G2228]] for a rich man [[G4145]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 26
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] were astonished [[G1605]] out of measure, [[G4057]] saying [[G3004]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] Who [[G5101]] then [[G2532]] can [[G1410]] be saved? [[G4982]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] looking upon [[G1689]] them [[G846]] saith, [[G3004]] With [[G3844]] men [[G444]] impossible, [[G102]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] with [[G3844]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] with [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] all things [[G3956]] are [[G2076]] possible. [[G1415]]

### 28
Then [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] began [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lo, [[G2400]] we [[G2249]] have left [[G863]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] have followed [[G190]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] There is [[G2076]] no man [[G3762]] that [[G3739]] hath left [[G863]] house, [[G3614]] or [[G2228]] brethren, [[G80]] or [[G2228]] sisters, [[G79]] or [[G2228]] father, [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother, [[G3384]] or [[G2228]] wife, [[G1135]] or [[G2228]] children, [[G5043]] or [[G2228]] lands, [[G68]] for [[G1752]] my [[G1700]] sake, [[G1752]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gospel's, [[G2098]]

### 30
But [[G1437]] he shall receive [[G2983]] an hundredfold [[G1542]] now [[G3568]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] time, [[G2540]] houses, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] sisters, [[G79]] and [[G2532]] mothers, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] lands, [[G68]] with [[G3326]] persecutions; [[G1375]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world [[G165]] to come [[G2064]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] first [[G4413]] shall be [[G2071]] last; [[G2078]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] first. [[G4413]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] they were [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem; [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went before [[G4254]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they were amazed; [[G2284]] and [[G2532]] as they followed, [[G190]] they were afraid. [[G5399]] And [[G2532]] he took [[G3880]] again [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] twelve, [[G1427]] and began [[G756]] to tell [[G3004]] them [[G846]] what things should [[G3195]] happen [[G4819]] unto him, [[G846]]

### 33
Behold, [[G2400]] we go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem; [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] shall be delivered [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] unto chief [[G749]] priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1122]] scribes; [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] they shall condemn [[G2632]] him [[G846]] to death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] shall deliver [[G3860]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1484]] Gentiles: [[G1484]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] they shall mock [[G1702]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] shall scourge [[G3146]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] shall spit upon [[G1716]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] shall kill [[G615]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] he shall rise again. [[G450]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] come unto [[G4365]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] we would [[G2309]] that [[G2443]] thou shouldest do [[G4160]] for us [[G2254]] whatsoever [[G3739]] we shall desire. [[G154]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] would ye that [[G2309]] I [[G3165]] should do [[G4160]] for you? [[G5213]]

### 37
They [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Grant [[G1325]] unto us [[G2254]] that [[G2443]] we may sit, [[G2523]] one [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] right hand, [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] the other [[G1520]] on [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] left hand, [[G2176]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] ye ask: [[G154]] can ye [[G1410]] drink of [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] drink of? [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] be baptized with [[G907]] the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am baptized with? [[G907]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] We can. [[G1410]] And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] indeed [[G3303]] Ye shall of [[G4095]] drink [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] drink of; [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] with [[G908]] baptism [[G908]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am baptized withal [[G907]] shall ye be baptized: [[G907]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] to sit [[G2523]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] right hand [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] left hand [[G2176]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] mine [[G1699]] to give; [[G1325]] but [[G235]] for whom [[G3739]] it is prepared. [[G2090]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] when [[G191]] the [[G3588]] ten [[G1176]] heard [[G191]] they began [[G756]] to be much displeased [[G23]] with [[G4012]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John. [[G2491]]

### 42
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] called [[G4341]] them [[G846]] and saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] they which are accounted [[G1380]] to rule over [[G757]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] exercise lordship over [[G2634]] them; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] great ones [[G3173]] exercise authority upon [[G2715]] them. [[G846]]

### 43
But [[G1161]] so [[G3779]] not [[G3756]] shall it [[G2071]] be [[G2071]] among [[G1722]] you: [[G5213]] but [[G235]] whosoever [[G3739]] will [[G2309]] be [[G1096]] great [[G3173]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] shall be [[G2071]] your [[G5216]] minister: [[G1249]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] of you [[G5216]] will [[G2309]] be [[G1096]] the chiefest, [[G4413]] shall be [[G2071]] servant [[G1401]] of all. [[G3956]]

### 45
For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] came [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] to be ministered unto, [[G1247]] but [[G235]] to minister, [[G1247]] and [[G2532]] to give [[G1325]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] a [[G3588]] ransom [[G3083]] for [[G473]] many. [[G4183]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Jericho: [[G2410]] and [[G2532]] as out [[G1607]] he [[G846]] went [[G1607]] of [[G575]] Jericho [[G2410]] with [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] a number of [[G3793]] great [[G2425]] people, [[G3793]] blind [[G5185]] Bartimaeus, [[G924]] the son [[G5207]] of Timaeus, [[G5090]] sat [[G2521]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] highway side [[G3598]] begging. [[G4319]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] when he heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G2076]] Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth, [[G3480]] he began [[G756]] to cry out, [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] say, [[G3004]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] me. [[G3165]]

### 48
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] charged [[G2008]] him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he should hold his peace: [[G4623]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] cried [[G2896]] the more [[G3123]]  a great deal, [[G4183]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] me. [[G3165]]

### 49
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood still, [[G2476]] and commanded [[G2036]] him [[G846]] to be called. [[G5455]] And [[G2532]] they call [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] blind man, [[G5185]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Be of good comfort, [[G2293]] rise; [[G1453]] he calleth [[G5455]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 50
And [[G1161]] he, [[G3588]] casting away [[G577]] his [[G846]] garment, [[G2440]] rose, [[G450]] and came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 51
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] What that [[G5101]] wilt thou [[G2309]] I should do [[G4160]] unto thee? [[G4671]] The [[G3588]] blind man [[G5185]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G4462]] that [[G2443]] I might receive my sight. [[G308]]

### 52
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Go thy way; [[G5217]] thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] hath made [[G4982]] thee [[G4571]] whole. [[G4982]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] he received his sight, [[G308]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] Jesus [[G2424]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]
