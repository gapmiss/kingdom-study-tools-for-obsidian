### 1
And [[G2532]] he began [[G756]] to speak [[G3004]] unto them [[G846]] by [[G1722]] parables. [[G3850]] A man [[G444]] planted [[G5452]] a vineyard, [[G290]] and [[G2532]] set [[G4060]] an hedge about [[G5418]] and [[G2532]] digged [[G3736]] the winefat, [[G5276]] and [[G2532]] built [[G3618]] a tower, [[G4444]] and [[G2532]] let out [[G1554]] it [[G846]] to husbandmen, [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] went into a far country. [[G589]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] at [[G2540]] season [[G2540]] he sent [[G649]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] husbandmen [[G1092]] a servant, [[G1401]] that [[G2443]] he might receive [[G2983]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] husbandmen [[G1092]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] the [[G3588]] of [[G290]] vineyard. [[G290]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] caught [[G2983]] and beat [[G1194]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] sent away [[G649]] empty. [[G2756]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] another [[G243]] servant; [[G1401]] and at him [[G2548]] they cast stones, [[G3036]] and wounded in the head, [[G2775]] and [[G2532]] sent away [[G649]] shamefully handled. [[G821]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he sent [[G649]] another; [[G243]] and him [[G2548]] they killed, [[G615]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] others; [[G243]] beating [[G1194]] some, [[G3303]] and [[G1161]] killing [[G615]] some. [[G3588]]

### 6
Having [[G2192]] yet [[G2089]] therefore [[G3767]] one [[G1520]] son, [[G5207]] his [[G846]] wellbeloved, [[G27]] he sent [[G649]] him [[G846]] also [[G2532]] last [[G2078]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] They will reverence [[G1788]] my [[G3450]] son. [[G5207]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] those [[G1565]] husbandmen [[G1092]] said [[G2036]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] heir; [[G2818]] come, [[G1205]] let us kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] shall [[G2071]] inheritance [[G2817]] be [[G2071]] ours. [[G2257]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] they took [[G2983]] him, [[G846]] and killed [[G615]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G1544]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] vineyard. [[G290]]

### 9
What [[G5101]] therefore [[G3767]] shall [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] of [[G290]] vineyard [[G290]] do? [[G4160]] he will come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] destroy [[G622]] the [[G3588]] husbandmen, [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] will give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] unto others. [[G243]]

### 10
not [[G3761]] And have ye [[G314]] read [[G314]] this [[G3778]] scripture; [[G1124]] The [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] builders [[G3618]] rejected [[G593]] is [[G3778]] become [[G1096]] the [[G1519]] head [[G2776]] of the corner: [[G1137]]

### 11
This [[G3778]] the Lord's [[G2962]] was [[G1096]] doing, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] it is [[G2076]] marvellous [[G2298]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] eyes? [[G3788]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] they sought [[G2212]] on [[G846]] to lay hold [[G2902]] him, [[G846]] but [[G2532]] feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people: [[G3793]] for [[G1063]] they knew [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] he had spoken [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] against [[G4314]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they left [[G863]] him, [[G846]] and went their way. [[G565]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] they send [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2265]] Herodians, [[G2265]] to [[G2443]] catch [[G64]] him [[G846]] in words. [[G3056]]

### 14
And when [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] were come, [[G2064]] they say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] thou art [[G1488]] true, [[G227]] and [[G2532]] carest [[G3199]] for [[G4012]] no man: [[G3762]] for [[G1063]] thou regardest [[G991]] not [[G3756]] the [[G1519]] person [[G4383]] of men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] teachest [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1909]] truth: [[G225]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] to give [[G1325]] tribute [[G2778]] to Caesar, [[G2541]] or [[G2228]] not? [[G3756]]

### 15
Shall we give, [[G1325]] or [[G2228]] not [[G3361]] shall we [[G1325]] give? [[G1325]] But [[G1161]] he, [[G3588]] knowing [[G1492]] their [[G846]] hypocrisy, [[G5272]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] tempt ye [[G3985]] me? [[G3165]] bring [[G5342]] me [[G3427]] a penny, [[G1220]] that [[G2443]] I may see [[G1492]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] brought [[G5342]] And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Whose [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] image [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] superscription? [[G1923]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Caesar's. [[G2541]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Render [[G591]] to Caesar [[G2541]] the things [[G3588]] that are Caesar's, [[G2541]] and [[G2532]] to God [[G2316]] the things [[G3588]]  that are [[G3588]] God's. [[G2316]] And [[G2532]] they marvelled [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 18
Then [[G2532]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] the Sadducees, [[G4523]] which [[G3748]] say [[G3004]] there is [[G1511]] no [[G3361]] resurrection; [[G386]] and [[G2532]] they asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 19
Master, [[G1320]] Moses [[G3475]] wrote [[G1125]] unto us, [[G2254]] If [[G1437]] a man's [[G5100]] brother [[G80]] die, [[G599]] and [[G2532]] leave [[G2641]] wife [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] leave [[G863]] no [[G3361]] children, [[G5043]] that [[G2443]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] should take [[G2983]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] raise up [[G1817]] seed [[G4690]] unto his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]]

### 20
Now there were [[G2258]] seven [[G2033]] brethren: [[G80]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] took [[G2983]] a wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] dying [[G599]] left [[G863]] no [[G3756]] seed. [[G4690]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] took [[G2983]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] died, [[G599]] neither [[G3761]] left [[G863]] he [[G846]] any seed: [[G4690]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] likewise. [[G5615]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] had [[G2983]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] left [[G863]] no [[G3756]] seed: [[G4690]] last [[G2078]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] died [[G599]] also. [[G2532]]

### 23
In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] therefore, [[G3767]] when [[G3752]] they shall rise, [[G450]] whose [[G5101]] wife [[G1135]] shall she be [[G2071]] of them? [[G846]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] had [[G2192]] her [[G846]] to wife. [[G1135]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] Do ye [[G4105]] therefore [[G5124]] err, [[G4105]] because [[G1223]] ye know [[G1492]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] scriptures, [[G1124]] neither [[G3366]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of God? [[G2316]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] they shall rise [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] neither [[G3777]] they [[G1060]] marry, [[G1060]] nor [[G3777]] are given in marriage; [[G1061]] but [[G235]] are [[G1526]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] which are in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 26
And [[G1161]] as touching [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] that [[G3754]] they rise: [[G1453]] not [[G3756]] have ye [[G314]] read [[G314]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] book [[G976]] of Moses, [[G3475]] how [[G5613]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] bush [[G942]] God [[G2316]] spake [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jacob? [[G2384]]

### 27
He is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of the dead, [[G3498]] but [[G235]] the God [[G2316]] of the living: [[G2198]] ye [[G5210]] therefore [[G3767]] greatly [[G4183]] do [[G4105]] err. [[G4105]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1122]] scribes [[G1122]] came, [[G4334]] and having heard [[G191]] them [[G846]] reasoning together, [[G4802]] and perceiving [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he had answered [[G611]] them [[G846]] well, [[G2573]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] Which [[G4169]] is [[G2076]] the first [[G4413]] commandment [[G1785]] of all? [[G3956]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] The first [[G4413]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] commandments [[G1785]] Hear, [[G191]] O Israel; [[G2474]] The Lord [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] one [[G1520]] Lord: [[G2962]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] thou shalt love [[G25]] the Lord [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] God [[G2316]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] soul, [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] mind, [[G1271]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] strength: [[G2479]] this [[G3778]] the first [[G4413]] commandment. [[G1785]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] the second [[G1208]] like, [[G3664]] this, [[G846]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] thy [[G4675]] neighbour [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] thyself. [[G4572]] There is [[G2076]] none [[G3756]] other [[G243]] commandment [[G1785]] greater [[G3187]] than these. [[G5130]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribe [[G1122]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Well, [[G2573]] Master, [[G1320]] thou hast said [[G2036]] the [[G1909]] truth: [[G225]] for [[G3754]] there is [[G2076]] one [[G1520]] God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G2076]] none [[G3756]] other [[G243]] but [[G4133]] he: [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] to love [[G25]] him [[G846]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] understanding, [[G4907]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] soul, [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] strength, [[G2479]] and [[G2532]] to love [[G25]] neighbour [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] himself, [[G1438]] is [[G2076]] more [[G4119]] than all [[G3956]] whole burnt offerings [[G3646]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices. [[G2378]]

### 34
And [[G2532]]  when [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he answered [[G611]] discreetly, [[G3562]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou art [[G1488]] not [[G3756]] far [[G3112]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]] And [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] after that [[G3765]] durst [[G5111]] ask [[G1905]] him [[G846]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G3004]] while he taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] How [[G4459]] say [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] that [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] is [[G2076]] the Son [[G5207]] of David? [[G1138]]

### 36
For [[G1063]] David [[G1138]] himself [[G846]] said [[G2036]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] to my [[G3450]] Lord, [[G2962]] Sit thou [[G2521]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] right hand, [[G1188]] till [[G2193]] I make [[G5087]] thine [[G4675]] enemies [[G2190]] thy [[G4675]] footstool. [[G5286]]

### 37
David [[G1138]] therefore [[G3767]] himself [[G846]] calleth [[G3004]] him [[G846]] Lord; [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] whence [[G4159]] is he [[G2076]] his [[G846]] son? [[G5207]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] common [[G4183]] people [[G3793]] heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] gladly. [[G2234]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] doctrine, [[G1322]] Beware [[G991]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] scribes, [[G1122]] which [[G3588]] love [[G2309]] to go [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] long clothing, [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] salutations [[G783]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplaces, [[G58]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] the chief seats [[G4410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] the uppermost rooms [[G4411]] at [[G1722]] feasts: [[G1173]]

### 40
Which [[G3588]] devour [[G2719]] widows' [[G5503]] houses, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] for a pretence [[G4392]] long [[G3117]] make [[G4336]] prayers: [[G4336]] these [[G3778]] shall receive [[G2983]] greater [[G4053]] damnation. [[G2917]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] sat [[G2523]] over against [[G2713]] the [[G3588]] treasury, [[G1049]] and beheld [[G2334]] how [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] cast [[G906]] money [[G5475]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] treasury: [[G1049]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] that were rich [[G4145]] cast [[G906]] in [[G4183]] much. [[G4183]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] there came [[G2064]] a certain [[G1520]] poor [[G4434]] widow, [[G5503]] and she threw in [[G906]] two [[G1417]] mites, [[G3016]] which [[G3739]] make [[G2076]] a farthing. [[G2835]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] he called [[G4341]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] poor [[G4434]] widow [[G5503]] hath cast in, [[G906]] more [[G4119]] than all [[G3956]] they which [[G3588]] have cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] treasury: [[G1049]]

### 44
For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] did cast in [[G906]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] abundance; [[G4052]] but [[G1161]] she [[G846]] of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] want [[G5304]] did cast in [[G906]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] she had, [[G2192]] all [[G3650]] her [[G846]] living. [[G979]]
