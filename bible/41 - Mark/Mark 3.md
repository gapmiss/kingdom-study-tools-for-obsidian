### 1
And [[G2532]] he entered [[G1525]] again [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue; [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] there was [[G2258]] a man [[G444]] there [[G1563]] which had [[G2192]] a withered [[G3583]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] they watched [[G3906]] him, [[G846]] whether [[G1487]] he would heal [[G2323]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] day; [[G4521]] that [[G2443]] they might accuse [[G2723]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] which had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] withered [[G3583]] hand, [[G5495]] Stand [[G1453]] forth. [[G3319]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] to do good [[G15]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] days, [[G4521]] or [[G2228]] to do evil? [[G2554]] to save [[G4982]] life, [[G5590]] or [[G2228]] to kill? [[G615]] But [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] held their peace. [[G4623]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when he had looked round about [[G4017]] on them [[G846]] with [[G3326]] anger, [[G3709]] being grieved [[G4818]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] hardness [[G4457]] of [[G2588]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] he saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G444]] man, [[G444]] Stretch forth [[G1614]] thine [[G4675]] hand. [[G5495]] And [[G2532]] he stretched out: [[G1614]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] was restored [[G600]] whole [[G5199]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] other. [[G243]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] went forth, [[G1831]] and straightway [[G2112]] took [[G4160]] counsel [[G4824]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Herodians [[G2265]] against [[G2596]] him, [[G846]] how [[G3704]] they might destroy [[G622]] him. [[G846]]

### 7
But [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] withdrew himself [[G402]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] sea: [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] a great [[G4183]] multitude [[G4128]] from [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] Judaea, [[G2449]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] Idumaea, [[G2401]] and [[G2532]] beyond [[G4008]] Jordan; [[G2446]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] about [[G4012]] Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4605]] a great [[G4183]] multitude, [[G4128]] when they had heard [[G191]] what great things [[G3745]] he did, [[G4160]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he spake [[G2036]] to [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] that [[G2443]] a small ship [[G4142]] should wait [[G4342]] on him [[G846]] because [[G1223]] of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] lest [[G2443]] they should throng [[G2346]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] he had healed [[G2323]] many; [[G4183]] insomuch that [[G5620]] they pressed upon [[G1968]] him [[G846]] for to [[G2443]] touch [[G680]] him, [[G846]] as many as [[G3745]] had [[G2192]] plagues. [[G3148]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] when [[G3752]] they saw [[G2334]] him, [[G846]] fell down before [[G4363]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] cried, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] straitly [[G4183]] he [[G2008]] charged [[G2008]] them [[G846]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] they should [[G5318]] make [[G4160]] him [[G846]] known. [[G5318]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he goeth up [[G305]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] calleth [[G4341]] whom [[G3739]] he [[G846]] would: [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] they came [[G565]] unto [[G4314]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] he ordained [[G4160]] twelve, [[G1427]] that [[G2443]] they should be [[G5600]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] he might send forth [[G649]] them [[G846]] to preach, [[G2784]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] to have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to heal [[G2323]] sicknesses, [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] to cast out [[G1544]] devils: [[G1140]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] Simon [[G4613]] he surnamed [[G2007]] Peter; [[G4074]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] James [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] of James; [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] surnamed [[G3686]]  he [[G2007]] them [[G846]] Boanerges, [[G993]] which [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] The sons [[G5207]] of thunder: [[G1027]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] Andrew, [[G406]] and [[G2532]] Philip, [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] Bartholomew, [[G918]] and [[G2532]] Matthew, [[G3156]] and [[G2532]] Thomas, [[G2381]] and [[G2532]] James [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] of Alphaeus, [[G256]] and [[G2532]] Thaddaeus, [[G2280]] and [[G2532]] Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] Canaanite, [[G2581]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] betrayed [[G3860]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] an house. [[G3624]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] the multitude [[G3793]] cometh together [[G4905]] again, [[G3825]] so that [[G5620]] they [[G846]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] so much as [[G3383]] eat [[G5315]] bread. [[G740]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] when [[G191]] his [[G846]] friends [[G3844]] heard [[G191]] they went out [[G1831]] to lay hold [[G2902]] on [[G846]] him: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they said, [[G3004]] He is beside himself. [[G1839]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] which [[G3588]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] said, [[G3004]] He hath [[G2192]] Beelzebub, [[G954]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1140]] devils [[G1140]] casteth he out [[G1544]] devils. [[G1140]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he called [[G4341]] them [[G846]] and said [[G3004]] unto them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] parables, [[G3850]] How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] Satan [[G4567]] cast out [[G1544]] Satan? [[G4567]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] a kingdom [[G932]] be divided [[G3307]] against [[G1909]] itself, [[G1438]] that [[G1565]] kingdom [[G932]] cannot [[G3756]] stand. [[G2476]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] a house [[G3614]] be divided [[G3307]] against [[G1909]] itself, [[G1438]] that [[G1565]] house [[G3614]] cannot [[G3756]] stand. [[G2476]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] Satan [[G4567]] rise up [[G450]] against [[G1909]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] be divided, [[G3307]] he [[G2476]] cannot [[G1410]] stand, [[G2476]] but [[G235]] hath [[G2192]] an end. [[G5056]]

### 27
No [[G3756]] man [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] strong man's [[G2478]] house, [[G3614]] and spoil [[G1283]] his [[G846]] goods, [[G4632]] except [[G3361]] first [[G4412]] he will [[G1210]] bind [[G1210]] the [[G3588]] strong man; [[G2478]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] he will spoil [[G1283]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]]

### 28
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] All [[G3956]] sins [[G265]] shall be forgiven [[G863]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G5207]] sons [[G5207]] of men, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] blasphemies [[G988]] wherewith [[G3745]] soever [[G302]] they shall blaspheme: [[G987]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] he [[G3739]]  that [[G302]] shall blaspheme [[G987]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] hath [[G2192]] never [[G3756]] forgiveness, [[G859]] but [[G235]] is [[G2076]] in danger [[G1777]] of eternal [[G166]] damnation: [[G2920]]

### 30
Because [[G3754]] they said, [[G3004]] He hath [[G2192]] an unclean [[G169]] spirit. [[G4151]]

### 31
There came [[G2064]] then [[G3767]] his [[G846]] brethren [[G80]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and, [[G2532]] standing [[G2476]] without, [[G1854]] sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] calling [[G5455]] him. [[G846]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] the multitude [[G3793]] sat [[G2521]] about [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] and [[G1161]] they said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Behold, [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] brethren [[G80]] without [[G1854]] seek [[G2212]] for thee. [[G4571]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] he answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] mother, [[G3384]] or [[G2228]] my [[G3450]] brethren? [[G80]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] he looked [[G4017]] round about [[G2945]] on them which sat [[G2521]] about [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] and said, [[G3004]] Behold [[G1492]] my [[G3450]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] brethren! [[G80]]

### 35
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G302]] shall do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of God, [[G2316]] the same [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] brother, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] sister, [[G79]] and [[G2532]] mother. [[G3384]]
