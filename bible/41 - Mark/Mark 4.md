### 1
And [[G2532]] he began [[G756]] again [[G3825]] to teach [[G1321]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea side: [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] there was gathered [[G4863]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] a [[G3793]] great [[G4183]] multitude, [[G3793]] so that [[G5620]] he [[G846]] entered [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] and sat [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] multitude [[G3793]] was [[G2258]] by [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he taught [[G1321]] them [[G846]] many things [[G4183]] by [[G1722]] parables, [[G3850]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] doctrine, [[G1322]]

### 3
Hearken; [[G191]] Behold, [[G2400]] there went out [[G1831]] a [[G3588]] sower [[G4687]] to sow: [[G4687]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] he [[G3588]] sowed, [[G4687]] some [[G3739]] fell [[G4098]] by [[G3844]] the way side, [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fowls [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air [[G3772]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] devoured up. [[G2719]] it [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] some [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] stony ground, [[G4075]] where [[G3699]] it had [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] much [[G4183]] earth; [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] it sprang up, [[G1816]] because [[G1223]] it had [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] depth [[G899]] of earth: [[G1093]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] the sun [[G2246]] when was [[G393]] up, [[G393]] it was scorched; [[G2739]] and [[G2532]] because [[G1223]] it had [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] root, [[G4491]] it withered away. [[G3583]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] some [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] among [[G1519]] thorns, [[G173]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] thorns [[G173]] grew up, [[G305]] and [[G2532]] choked [[G4846]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] it yielded [[G1325]] no [[G3756]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] other [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1519]] good [[G2570]] ground, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] did yield [[G1325]] fruit [[G2590]] that sprang up [[G305]] and [[G2532]] increased; [[G837]] and [[G2532]] brought forth, [[G5342]] some [[G1722]] thirty, [[G5144]] and [[G2532]] some [[G1722]] sixty, [[G1835]] and [[G2532]] some [[G1722]] an hundred. [[G1540]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] He [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] he was [[G1096]] alone, [[G2651]] they [[G3588]] that were [[G4012]] about [[G4012]] him [[G846]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] asked [[G2065]] of him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] parable. [[G3850]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Unto you [[G5213]] it is given [[G1325]] to know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God: [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] unto them [[G1565]] that are [[G3588]] without, [[G1854]] all things [[G3956]] are done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] parables: [[G3850]]

### 12
That [[G2443]] seeing [[G991]] they may see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] perceive; [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] hearing [[G191]] they may hear, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] understand; [[G4920]] lest at any time [[G3379]] they should be converted, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] sins [[G265]] should be forgiven [[G863]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Know ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] parable? [[G3850]] and [[G2532]] how then [[G4459]] will ye know [[G1097]] all [[G3956]] parables? [[G3850]]

### 14
The [[G3588]] sower [[G4687]] soweth [[G4687]] the [[G3588]] word. [[G3056]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] these [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] they [[G3588]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] way side, [[G3598]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] is sown; [[G4687]] but [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] they have heard, [[G191]] Satan [[G4567]] cometh [[G2064]] immediately, [[G2112]] and [[G2532]] taketh away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that was sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] are they [[G1526]] likewise [[G3668]] which are sown [[G4687]] on [[G1909]] stony ground; [[G4075]] who, [[G3739]] when [[G3752]] they have heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] immediately [[G2112]] receive [[G2983]] it [[G846]] with [[G3326]] gladness; [[G5479]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] root [[G4491]] in [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] and so [[G235]] endure [[G1526]] but [[G235]] for a time: [[G4340]] afterward, [[G1534]] when [[G1096]] affliction [[G2347]] or [[G2228]] persecution [[G1375]] ariseth [[G1096]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word's sake, [[G3056]] immediately [[G2112]] they are offended. [[G4624]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] they [[G3588]] which are sown [[G4687]] among [[G1519]] thorns; [[G173]] hear [[G191]]  such as [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cares [[G3308]] of this [[G5127]] world, [[G165]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] deceitfulness [[G539]] of riches, [[G4149]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lusts [[G1939]] of [[G4012]] other things [[G3062]] entering in, [[G1531]] choke [[G4846]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] it becometh [[G1096]] unfruitful. [[G175]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] they which are sown [[G4687]] on [[G1909]] good [[G2570]] ground; [[G1093]] such as [[G3748]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] receive [[G3858]] and [[G2532]] bring forth fruit, [[G2592]] some [[G1722]] thirtyfold, [[G5144]] some [[G1722]] sixty, [[G1835]] and [[G2532]] some [[G1722]] an hundred. [[G1540]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]]  Is [[G3385]] a [[G3588]] candle [[G3088]] brought [[G2064]] to [[G2443]] be put [[G5087]] under [[G5259]] a [[G3588]] bushel, [[G3426]] or [[G2228]] under [[G5259]] a [[G3588]] bed? [[G2825]] and not [[G3756]] to [[G2443]] be set [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] candlestick? [[G3087]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] there is [[G2076]] nothing [[G3756]] hid, [[G2927]] which [[G3739]] shall [[G1437]] not [[G3361]] be manifested; [[G5319]] neither [[G3761]] was any thing kept [[G1096]] secret, [[G614]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] it should come [[G2064]] abroad. [[G1519]]

### 23
If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] have [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Take heed [[G991]] what [[G5101]] ye hear: [[G191]] with [[G1722]] what [[G3739]] measure [[G3358]] ye mete, [[G3354]] it shall be measured [[G3354]] to you: [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] unto you [[G5213]] that hear [[G191]] shall more be given. [[G4369]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] he [[G3739]] that [[G302]] hath, [[G2192]] to him [[G846]] shall be given: [[G1325]] and [[G2532]] he that [[G3739]] hath [[G2192]] not, [[G3756]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] shall be taken [[G142]] even [[G2532]] that which [[G3739]] he hath. [[G2192]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] he said, [[G3004]] So [[G3779]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] as [[G5613]] if [[G1437]] a man [[G444]] should cast [[G906]] seed [[G4703]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground; [[G1093]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] should sleep, [[G2518]] and [[G2532]] rise [[G1453]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seed [[G4703]] should spring [[G985]] and [[G2532]] grow up, [[G3373]] he [[G846]] knoweth [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] how. [[G5613]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] bringeth forth fruit [[G2592]] of herself; [[G844]] first [[G4412]] the blade, [[G5528]] then [[G1534]] the ear, [[G4719]] after that [[G1534]] full [[G4134]] the [[G4621]] corn [[G4621]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ear. [[G4719]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] is brought forth, [[G3860]] immediately [[G2112]] he putteth in [[G649]] the [[G3588]] sickle, [[G1407]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] harvest [[G2326]] is come. [[G3936]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] he said, [[G3004]] Whereunto [[G5101]] shall we liken [[G3666]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God? [[G2316]] or [[G2228]] with [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] comparison [[G3850]] shall we compare [[G3846]] it? [[G846]]

### 31
like [[G5613]] a grain [[G2848]] of mustard seed, [[G4615]] which, [[G3739]] when [[G3752]] it is sown [[G4687]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] is [[G2076]] less than [[G3398]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] seeds [[G4690]] that be [[G3588]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]]

### 32
But [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] it is sown, [[G4687]] it groweth up, [[G305]] and [[G2532]] becometh [[G1096]] greater than [[G3187]] all [[G3956]] herbs, [[G3001]] and [[G2532]] shooteth out [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] branches; [[G2798]] so that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] fowls [[G4071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] air [[G3772]] may [[G1410]] lodge [[G2681]] under [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] shadow [[G4639]] of it. [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] with [[G5108]] many [[G4183]] such [[G5108]] parables [[G3850]] spake he [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] unto them, [[G846]] as [[G2531]] they were able [[G1410]] to hear [[G191]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] without [[G5565]] a parable [[G3850]] spake he [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] unto them: [[G846]] and when [[G1161]] they were alone, [[G2398]] he expounded [[G1956]] all things [[G3956]] to [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] day, [[G2250]] the even [[G3798]] when was [[G1096]] come, [[G1096]] he saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Let us pass over [[G1330]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side. [[G4008]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] when they had sent away [[G863]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] they took [[G3880]] him [[G846]] even as [[G5613]] he was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]] And [[G2532]] there were [[G2258]] also [[G1161]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] other [[G243]] little ships. [[G4142]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] there arose [[G1096]] a [[G2978]] great [[G3173]] storm [[G2978]] of wind, [[G417]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] waves [[G2949]] beat [[G1911]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] so that [[G5620]] it [[G846]] now [[G2235]] was [[G1072]] full. [[G1072]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] hinder part of the ship, [[G4403]] asleep [[G2518]] on [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] pillow: [[G4344]] and [[G2532]] they awake [[G1326]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] carest [[G3199]] thou [[G4671]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] we perish? [[G622]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] he arose, [[G1326]] and rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] wind, [[G417]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2281]] sea, [[G2281]] Peace, [[G4623]] be still. [[G5392]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] ceased, [[G2869]] and [[G2532]] there was [[G1096]] a [[G1055]] great [[G3173]] calm. [[G1055]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] are ye [[G2075]] so [[G3779]] fearful? [[G1169]] how is it that [[G4459]] ye have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] faith? [[G4102]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] they feared [[G5399]] exceedingly, [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] What [[G5101]] manner of man [[G686]] is [[G2076]] this, [[G3778]] that [[G3754]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] obey [[G5219]] him? [[G846]]
