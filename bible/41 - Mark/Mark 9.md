### 1
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] there be [[G1526]] some [[G5100]] of them that stand [[G2476]] here, [[G5602]] which [[G3748]] shall [[G1089]] not [[G3361]] taste [[G1089]] of death, [[G2288]] till [[G2193]] they have seen [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] come [[G2064]] with [[G1722]] power. [[G1411]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] six [[G1803]] days [[G2250]] Jesus [[G2424]] taketh [[G3880]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] leadeth up [[G399]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] an [[G3735]] high [[G5308]] mountain [[G3735]] apart [[G3441]] by [[G2596]] themselves: [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] he was transfigured [[G3339]] before [[G1715]] them. [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] raiment [[G2440]] became [[G1096]] shining, [[G4744]] exceeding [[G3029]] white [[G3022]] as [[G5613]] snow; [[G5510]] so as [[G3634]] no [[G3756]] fuller [[G1102]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] can [[G1410]] white them. [[G3021]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] there appeared [[G3700]] unto them [[G846]] Elias [[G2243]] with [[G4862]] Moses: [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] they were [[G2258]] talking [[G4814]] with Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G3004]] to Jesus, [[G2424]] Master, [[G4461]] it is [[G2076]] good [[G2570]] for us [[G2248]] to be [[G1511]] here: [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] let us make [[G4160]] three [[G5140]] tabernacles; [[G4633]] one [[G1520]] for thee, [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Elias. [[G2243]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] he wist [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] to say; [[G2980]] for [[G1063]] they were [[G2258]] sore afraid. [[G1630]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] there was [[G1096]] a cloud [[G3507]] that overshadowed [[G1982]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] came [[G2064]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] cloud, [[G3507]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] Son: [[G5207]] hear [[G191]] him. [[G846]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] suddenly, [[G1819]] when they had looked round about, [[G4017]] they saw [[G1492]] no man [[G3762]] any more, [[G3765]] save [[G235]] Jesus [[G2424]] only [[G3441]] with [[G3326]] themselves. [[G1438]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] as came [[G2597]] they [[G846]] down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] he charged [[G1291]] them [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they should tell [[G1334]] no man [[G3367]] what things [[G3739]] they had seen, [[G1492]] till [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] were risen [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] they kept [[G2902]] that saying [[G3056]] with [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] questioning one with another [[G4802]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] rising [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] should mean. [[G2076]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] they asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Why [[G3754]] say [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] that [[G3754]] Elias [[G2243]] must [[G1163]] first [[G4412]] come? [[G2064]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] Elias [[G2243]] verily [[G3303]] cometh [[G2064]] first, [[G4412]] and restoreth [[G600]] all things; [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] it is written [[G1125]] of [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man, [[G444]] that [[G2443]] he must suffer [[G3958]] many things, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] be set at nought. [[G1847]]

### 13
But [[G235]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] Elias [[G2243]] indeed [[G2532]] is [[G2064]] come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] they have done [[G4160]] unto him [[G846]] whatsoever [[G3745]] they listed, [[G2309]] as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] of [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] when he came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] disciples, [[G3101]] he saw [[G1492]] a [[G3793]] great [[G4183]] multitude [[G3793]] about [[G4012]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] questioning [[G4802]] with them. [[G846]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] when they beheld [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] were greatly amazed, [[G1568]] and [[G2532]] running to [[G4370]] saluted [[G782]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he asked [[G1905]] the [[G3588]] scribes, [[G1122]] What [[G5101]] question ye [[G4802]] with [[G4314]] them? [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Master, [[G1320]] I have brought [[G5342]] unto [[G4314]] thee [[G4571]] my [[G3450]] son, [[G5207]] which hath [[G2192]] a [[G4151]] dumb [[G216]] spirit; [[G4151]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] wheresoever [[G3699]] he taketh [[G2638]] him, [[G846]] he teareth [[G4486]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he foameth, [[G875]] and [[G2532]] gnasheth [[G5149]] with [[G3599]] his [[G846]] teeth, [[G3599]] and [[G2532]] pineth away: [[G3583]] and [[G2532]] I spake [[G2036]] to [[G3101]] thy [[G4675]] disciples [[G3101]] that [[G2443]] they should cast out; [[G1544]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they could [[G2480]] not. [[G3756]]

### 19
He [[G3588]] answereth [[G611]] him, [[G846]] and [[G1161]] saith, [[G3004]] O [[G5599]] faithless [[G571]] generation, [[G1074]] how [[G2193]] long [[G4219]] shall I be [[G2071]] with [[G4314]] you? [[G5209]] how [[G2193]] long [[G4219]] shall I suffer [[G430]] you? [[G5216]] bring [[G5342]] him [[G846]] unto [[G4314]] me. [[G3165]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] they brought [[G5342]] him [[G846]] unto [[G4314]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] when he saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] straightway [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] tare [[G4682]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground, [[G1093]] and wallowed [[G2947]] foaming. [[G875]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] he asked [[G1905]] his [[G846]] father, [[G3962]] How long [[G4214]] is it [[G2076]] ago [[G5550]] since [[G5613]] this [[G5124]] came [[G1096]] unto him? [[G846]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Of a child. [[G3812]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] ofttimes [[G4178]] it hath cast [[G906]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] the waters, [[G5204]] to [[G2443]] destroy [[G622]] him: [[G846]] but [[G235]] if [[G1487]] thou canst do [[G1410]] any thing, [[G5100]] have compassion [[G4697]] on [[G1909]] us, [[G2248]] and help [[G997]] us. [[G2254]]

### 23
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] thou canst [[G1410]] believe, [[G4100]] all things [[G3956]] possible [[G1415]] him [[G3588]] to that [[G4100]] believeth. [[G4100]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3813]] child [[G3813]] cried out, [[G2896]] and said [[G3004]] with [[G3326]] tears, [[G1144]] Lord, [[G2962]] I believe; [[G4100]] help thou [[G997]] mine [[G3450]] unbelief. [[G570]]

### 25
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the people [[G3793]] came running together, [[G1998]] he rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] foul [[G169]] spirit, [[G4151]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] dumb [[G216]] and [[G2532]] deaf [[G2974]] spirit, [[G4151]] I [[G1473]] charge [[G2004]] thee, [[G4671]] come out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] enter [[G1525]] no more [[G3371]] into [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] cried, [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] rent [[G4682]] him [[G846]] sore, [[G4183]] and came out of him: [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] he was [[G1096]] as [[G5616]] one dead; [[G3498]] insomuch that [[G5620]] many [[G4183]] said, [[G3004]] He is dead. [[G599]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] took [[G2902]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] by [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] and lifted up; [[G1453]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he arose. [[G450]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] when he [[G846]] was come [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the house, [[G3624]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] him [[G846]] privately, [[G2596]] Why [[G3754]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] we [[G2249]] cast out? [[G1544]] him [[G846]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] This [[G5124]] kind [[G1085]] can [[G1410]] come forth [[G1831]] by [[G1722]] nothing, [[G3762]] but [[G3361]] by [[G1722]] prayer [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] fasting. [[G3521]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] they departed [[G1831]] thence, [[G1564]] and passed [[G3899]] through [[G1223]] Galilee; [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] he would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] any man [[G5100]] should know [[G1097]]

### 31
For [[G1063]] he taught [[G1321]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is delivered [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] the hands [[G5495]] of men, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] they shall kill [[G615]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] after that he is killed, [[G615]] he shall rise [[G450]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day. [[G2250]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] understood not [[G50]] that saying, [[G4487]] and [[G2532]] were afraid [[G5399]] to ask [[G1905]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum: [[G2584]] and [[G2532]] being [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] he asked [[G1905]] them, [[G846]] What was it that [[G5101]] ye disputed [[G1260]] among [[G4314]] yourselves [[G1438]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way? [[G3598]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] held their peace: [[G4623]] for [[G1063]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] they had disputed [[G1256]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] who [[G5101]] the greatest. [[G3187]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] he sat down, [[G2523]] and called [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] twelve, [[G1427]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] desire [[G2309]] to be [[G1511]] first, [[G4413]] shall be [[G2071]] last [[G2078]] of all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] servant [[G1249]] of all. [[G3956]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] he took [[G2983]] a child, [[G3813]] and set [[G2476]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] when he had taken in his arms, [[G1723]] him [[G846]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]]

### 37
Whosoever [[G3739]] shall receive [[G1209]] one [[G1520]] of such [[G5108]] children [[G3813]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] receiveth [[G1209]] me: [[G1691]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall receive [[G1209]] me, [[G1691]] receiveth [[G1209]] not [[G3756]] me, [[G1691]] but [[G235]] him [[G3588]] that sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] we saw [[G1492]] one [[G5100]] casting out [[G1544]] devils [[G1140]] in [[G3686]] thy [[G4675]] name, [[G3686]] and he [[G3739]] followeth [[G190]] not [[G3756]] us: [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] we forbad [[G2967]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] he followeth [[G190]] not [[G3756]] us. [[G2254]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Forbid [[G2967]] him [[G846]] not: [[G3361]] for [[G1063]] there is [[G2076]] no man [[G3762]] which [[G3739]] shall do [[G4160]] a miracle [[G1411]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] that [[G2532]] can [[G1410]] lightly [[G5035]] speak evil [[G2551]] of me. [[G3165]]

### 40
For [[G1063]] he that [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] against [[G2596]] us [[G5216]] is [[G2076]] on part. [[G5228]] our [[G5216]]

### 41
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall give to [[G4222]] you [[G5209]] a cup [[G4221]] of water [[G5204]] drink [[G4222]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] because [[G3754]] ye belong [[G2075]] to Christ, [[G5547]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] he shall [[G622]] not [[G3361]] lose [[G622]] his [[G846]] reward. [[G3408]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall offend [[G4624]] one [[G1520]] of ones that [[G4100]] little [[G3398]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] me, [[G1691]] it is [[G2076]] better [[G2570]] for him [[G846]] that [[G1487]] a millstone [[G3457]] were hanged [[G4029]] about [[G4012]] his [[G846]] neck, [[G5137]] and [[G2532]] he were cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] thy [[G4675]] hand [[G5495]] offend [[G4624]] thee, [[G4571]] cut off: [[G609]] it [[G846]] it is [[G2076]] better [[G2570]] for thee [[G4671]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] life [[G2222]] maimed, [[G2948]] than [[G2228]] having [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] hands [[G5495]] to go [[G565]] into [[G1519]] hell, [[G1067]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] that never shall be quenched: [[G762]]

### 44
Where [[G3699]] their [[G846]] worm [[G4663]] dieth [[G5053]] not, [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] not [[G3756]] is [[G4570]] quenched. [[G4570]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] thy [[G4675]] foot [[G4228]] offend [[G4624]] thee, [[G4571]] cut off: [[G609]] it [[G846]] it is [[G2076]] better [[G2570]] for thee [[G4671]] to enter [[G1525]] halt [[G5560]] into [[G1519]] life, [[G2222]] than [[G2228]] having [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] feet [[G4228]] to be cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] hell, [[G1067]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] that never shall be quenched: [[G762]]

### 46
Where [[G3699]] their [[G846]] worm [[G4663]] dieth [[G5053]] not, [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] not [[G3756]] is [[G4570]] quenched. [[G4570]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] thine [[G4675]] eye [[G3788]] offend [[G4624]] thee, [[G4571]] pluck out: [[G1544]] it [[G846]] it is [[G2076]] better [[G2570]] for thee [[G4671]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] with one eye, [[G3442]] than [[G2228]] having [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] eyes [[G3788]] to be cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] hell [[G1067]] fire: [[G4442]]

### 48
Where [[G3699]] their [[G846]] worm [[G4663]] dieth [[G5053]] not, [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] not [[G3756]] is [[G4570]] quenched. [[G4570]]

### 49
For [[G1063]] every one [[G3956]] shall be salted [[G233]] with fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] sacrifice [[G2378]] shall be salted [[G233]] with salt. [[G251]]

### 50
Salt [[G217]] good: [[G2570]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] salt [[G217]] have [[G1096]] lost his saltness, [[G358]] wherewith [[G1722]] will ye season [[G741]] it? [[G846]] Have [[G2192]] salt [[G217]] in [[G1722]] yourselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] have peace [[G1514]] with [[G1722]] one [[G240]] another. [[G240]]
