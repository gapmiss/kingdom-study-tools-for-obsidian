### 1
And [[G2532]] as he [[G846]] went out [[G1607]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] one [[G1520]] of his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] see [[G1492]] what manner of [[G4217]] stones [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] what [[G4217]] buildings [[G3619]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Seest thou [[G991]] these [[G3778]] great [[G3173]] buildings? [[G3619]] there shall be [[G863]] not [[G3361]] left [[G863]] one stone [[G3037]] upon [[G1909]] another, [[G3037]] that [[G3739]] shall be thrown [[G2647]] not [[G3361]] down. [[G2647]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] as he [[G846]] sat [[G2521]] upon [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] of Olives [[G1636]] over against [[G2713]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] Andrew [[G406]] asked [[G1905]] him [[G846]] privately, [[G2398]]

### 4
Tell [[G2036]] us, [[G2254]] when [[G4219]] these things [[G5023]] shall [[G2071]] be? [[G2071]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] shall be [[G3195]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] when [[G3752]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] shall be fulfilled? [[G4931]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] them [[G846]] began [[G756]] to say, [[G3004]] Take heed [[G991]] lest [[G3361]] any [[G5100]] deceive [[G4105]] you: [[G5209]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] saying, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] shall deceive [[G4105]] many. [[G4183]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] ye shall hear [[G191]] of wars [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] rumours [[G189]] of wars, [[G4171]] be ye [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] troubled: [[G2360]] for [[G1063]] must needs be; [[G1163]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] not yet. [[G3768]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] nation [[G1484]] shall rise [[G1453]] against [[G1909]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kingdom [[G932]] against [[G1909]] kingdom: [[G932]] and [[G2532]] there shall be [[G2071]] earthquakes [[G4578]] in [[G2596]] divers places, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] there shall be [[G2071]] famines [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] troubles: [[G5016]] these [[G5023]] the beginnings [[G746]] of sorrows. [[G5604]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] take heed [[G991]] to yourselves: [[G1438]] for [[G1063]] they shall deliver up [[G3860]] you [[G5209]] to [[G1519]] councils; [[G4892]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1519]] the synagogues [[G4864]] ye shall be beaten: [[G1194]] and [[G2532]] ye shall be brought [[G2476]] before [[G1909]] rulers [[G2232]] and [[G2532]] kings [[G935]] for [[G1752]] my [[G1700]] sake, [[G1752]] for [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] against them. [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] must [[G1163]] first [[G4412]] be published [[G2784]] among [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] nations. [[G1484]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] they shall lead [[G71]] you [[G5209]] and deliver [[G3860]] up, [[G3860]] no [[G3361]] take thought [[G4305]] beforehand [[G4305]] what [[G5101]] ye shall speak, [[G2980]] neither [[G3366]] do ye premeditate: [[G3191]] but [[G235]] whatsoever [[G3739]] shall be given [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] hour, [[G5610]] that [[G5124]] speak ye: [[G2980]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] ye that [[G5210]] speak, [[G2980]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] the brother [[G80]] shall betray [[G3860]] the brother [[G80]] to [[G1519]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] the father [[G3962]] the son; [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] children [[G5043]] shall rise up [[G1881]] against [[G1909]] parents, [[G1118]] and [[G2532]] shall cause to be put to [[G2289]] them [[G846]] death. [[G2289]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] ye shall be [[G2071]] hated [[G3404]] of [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] for [[G1223]] my [[G3450]] name's sake: [[G3686]] but [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] shall endure [[G5278]] unto [[G1519]] the end, [[G5056]] the same [[G3778]] shall be saved. [[G4982]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] ye shall see [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] abomination [[G946]] of desolation, [[G2050]] spoken of [[G4483]] by [[G5259]] Daniel [[G1158]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] standing [[G2476]] where [[G3699]] it ought [[G1163]] not, [[G3756]] (let him that [[G3588]] readeth [[G314]] understand,) [[G3539]] then [[G5119]] let them [[G3588]] that be in [[G1722]] Judaea [[G2449]] flee [[G5343]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountains: [[G3735]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] him that [[G3588]] let is go [[G2597]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetop [[G1430]] not [[G3361]] down [[G2597]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] neither [[G3366]] enter [[G1525]] to take [[G142]] any thing [[G5100]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] house: [[G3614]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] let him [[G3588]] that is [[G5607]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] field [[G68]] not [[G3361]] turn [[G1994]] back [[G3694]] again [[G1519]] for to take up [[G142]] his [[G846]] garment. [[G2440]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] to them [[G3588]] that are [[G2192]] with [[G1722]] child, [[G1064]] and [[G2532]] to them [[G3588]] that give suck [[G2337]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days! [[G2250]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] pray ye [[G4336]] that [[G2443]] your [[G5216]] flight [[G5437]] be [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] in the winter. [[G5494]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] shall be [[G2071]] affliction, [[G2347]] such as [[G3634]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] from [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] of the creation [[G2937]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] created [[G2936]] unto [[G2193]] this time, [[G3568]] neither [[G3361]] shall be. [[G1096]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] except [[G1487]] that the Lord [[G2962]] had shortened [[G2856]] those [[G3588]] days, [[G2250]] no [[G3756]] flesh [[G4561]] should be saved: [[G4982]] but [[G235]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] elect's [[G1588]] sake, whom [[G3739]] he hath chosen, [[G1586]] he hath shortened [[G2856]] the [[G3588]] days. [[G2250]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] shall say [[G2036]] to you, [[G5213]] Lo, [[G2400]] here [[G5602]] Christ; [[G5547]] or, [[G2228]] lo, [[G2400]] there; [[G1563]] believe [[G4100]] not: [[G3361]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] false Christs [[G5580]] and [[G2532]] false prophets [[G5578]] shall rise, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] shall shew [[G1325]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders, [[G5059]] to [[G4314]] seduce, [[G635]] if [[G1487]] possible, [[G1415]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elect. [[G1588]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] take [[G991]] heed: [[G991]] behold, [[G2400]] I have foretold [[G4280]] you [[G5213]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 24
But [[G235]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] after [[G3326]] that [[G1565]] tribulation, [[G2347]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] shall be darkened, [[G4654]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G1325]] give [[G1325]] her [[G846]] light, [[G5338]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] stars [[G792]] of heaven [[G3772]] shall [[G2071]] fall, [[G1601]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] powers [[G1411]] that [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] shall be shaken. [[G4531]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall they see [[G3700]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the clouds [[G3507]] with [[G3326]] great [[G4183]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall he send [[G649]] his [[G846]] angels, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] shall gather together [[G1996]] his [[G846]] elect [[G1588]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] winds, [[G417]] from [[G575]] the uttermost part [[G206]] of the earth [[G1093]] to [[G2193]] the uttermost part [[G206]] of heaven. [[G3772]]

### 28
Now [[G1161]] learn [[G3129]] a [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fig tree; [[G4808]] When [[G3752]] her [[G846]] branch [[G2798]] is [[G1096]] yet [[G2235]] tender, [[G527]] and [[G2532]] putteth forth [[G1631]] leaves, [[G5444]] ye know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] summer [[G2330]] is [[G2076]] near: [[G1451]]

### 29
So [[G3779]] ye [[G5210]] in like manner, [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] ye shall see [[G1492]] these things [[G5023]] come to pass, [[G1096]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] nigh, [[G1451]] at [[G1909]] the doors. [[G2374]]

### 30
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] shall [[G3928]] not [[G3361]] pass, [[G3928]] till [[G3360]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] be done. [[G1096]]

### 31
Heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] shall pass away: [[G3928]] but [[G1161]] my [[G3450]] words [[G3056]] shall pass [[G3928]] not [[G3361]] away. [[G3928]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] of [[G4012]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] hour [[G5610]] knoweth [[G1492]] no man, [[G3762]] no, not [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] which are [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] neither [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] but [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 33
Take ye heed, [[G991]] watch [[G69]] and [[G2532]] pray: [[G4336]] for [[G1063]] ye know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] when [[G4219]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] is. [[G2076]]

### 34
as [[G5613]] a man [[G444]] taking a far journey, [[G590]] who left [[G863]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] authority [[G1849]] to his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] to every man [[G1538]] his [[G846]] work, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] commanded [[G1781]] the [[G3588]] porter [[G2377]] to [[G2443]] watch. [[G1127]]

### 35
Watch ye [[G1127]] therefore: [[G3767]] for [[G1063]] ye know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] when [[G4219]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3614]] house [[G3614]] cometh, [[G2064]] at even, [[G3796]] or [[G2228]] at midnight, [[G3317]] or [[G2228]] at the cockcrowing, [[G219]] or [[G2228]] in the morning: [[G4404]]

### 36
Lest [[G3361]] coming [[G2064]] suddenly [[G1810]] he find [[G2147]] you [[G5209]] sleeping. [[G2518]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] what [[G3739]] I say [[G3004]] unto you [[G5213]] I say [[G3004]] unto all, [[G3956]] Watch. [[G1127]]
