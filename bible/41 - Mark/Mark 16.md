### 1
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] when [[G4521]] sabbath [[G4521]] was past, [[G1230]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] of James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] Salome, [[G4539]] had bought [[G59]] sweet spices, [[G759]] that [[G2443]] they might come [[G2064]] and anoint [[G218]] him. [[G846]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] very [[G3029]] early in the morning [[G4404]] the [[G3588]] first [[G1520]] of the week, [[G4521]] they came [[G2064]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre [[G3419]] at the rising [[G393]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2246]] sun. [[G2246]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] they said [[G3004]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] Who [[G5101]] shall roll away [[G617]] us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3419]] sepulchre? [[G3419]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] when they looked, [[G308]] they saw [[G2334]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] was rolled away: [[G617]] for [[G1063]] it was [[G2258]] very [[G4970]] great. [[G3173]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] entering [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] they saw [[G1492]] a young man [[G3495]] sitting [[G2521]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] right side, [[G1188]] clothed [[G4016]] in a long [[G4749]] white [[G3022]] garment; [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] they were affrighted. [[G1568]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] not [[G3361]] Be [[G1568]] affrighted: [[G1568]] Ye seek [[G2212]] Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth, [[G3479]] which [[G3588]] was crucified: [[G4717]] he is risen; [[G1453]] he is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] here: [[G5602]] behold [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] they laid [[G5087]] him. [[G846]]

### 7
But [[G235]] go your way, [[G5217]] tell [[G2036]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] that [[G3754]] he goeth before [[G4254]] you [[G5209]] into [[G1519]] Galilee: [[G1056]] there [[G1563]] shall ye see [[G3700]] him, [[G846]] as [[G2531]] he said [[G2036]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] they went out [[G1831]] quickly, [[G5035]] and fled [[G5343]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre; [[G3419]] for [[G1161]] they [[G846]] trembled [[G5156]] and [[G2532]] were amazed: [[G1611]] neither [[G2532]] said they [[G2036]] any thing [[G3762]] to any [[G3762]] for [[G1063]] they were afraid. [[G5399]]

### 9
Now when [[G1161]] was risen [[G450]] early [[G4404]] the first [[G4413]] of the week, [[G4521]] he appeared [[G5316]] first [[G4412]] to Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] out of [[G575]] whom [[G3739]] he had cast [[G1544]] seven [[G2033]] devils. [[G1140]]

### 10
she went [[G4198]] and told [[G518]] them that [[G1565]] had been [[G1096]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] as they mourned [[G3996]] and [[G2532]] wept. [[G2799]]

### 11
And they, [[G2548]] when they had heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] he was alive, [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] had been seen [[G2300]] of [[G5259]] her, [[G846]] believed not. [[G569]]

### 12
After [[G3326]] that [[G5023]] he appeared [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] another [[G2087]] form [[G3444]] unto two [[G1417]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] as they walked, [[G4043]] and went [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] the country. [[G68]]

### 13
And they [[G2548]] went [[G565]] and told [[G518]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3062]] residue: [[G3062]] neither [[G3761]] believed they [[G4100]] them. [[G1565]]

### 14
Afterward [[G5305]] he appeared [[G5319]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1733]] eleven [[G1733]] as they [[G846]] sat at meat, [[G345]] and [[G2532]] upbraided [[G3679]] them with their [[G846]] unbelief [[G570]] and [[G2532]] hardness of heart, [[G4641]] because [[G3754]] they believed [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] them which [[G3588]] had seen [[G2300]] him [[G846]] after he was risen. [[G1453]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Go ye [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and preach [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] to every [[G3956]] creature. [[G2937]]

### 16
He [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] is baptized [[G907]] shall be saved; [[G4982]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that believeth not [[G569]] shall be damned. [[G2632]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] these [[G5023]] signs [[G4592]] shall follow [[G3877]] them [[G3588]] that believe; [[G4100]] In [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] name [[G3686]] shall they cast out [[G1544]] devils; [[G1140]] they shall speak [[G2980]] with new [[G2537]] tongues; [[G1100]]

### 18
They shall take up [[G142]] serpents; [[G3789]] and if [[G2579]] they drink [[G4095]] any [[G5100]] deadly thing, [[G2286]] it shall [[G984]] not [[G3361]] hurt [[G984]] them; [[G846]] they shall lay [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] the sick, [[G732]] and [[G2532]] they shall [[G2192]] recover. [[G2573]]

### 19
So [[G3767]] then [[G3303]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] had spoken [[G2980]] unto them, [[G846]] he was received up [[G353]] into [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] sat [[G2523]] on [[G1537]] the right hand [[G1188]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] they [[G1565]] went forth, [[G1831]] and preached [[G2784]] every where, [[G3837]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] working with [[G4903]] and [[G2532]] confirming [[G950]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] with [[G1223]] signs [[G4592]] following. [[G1872]] Amen. [[G281]]
