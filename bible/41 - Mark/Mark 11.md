### 1
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] they came nigh [[G1448]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] unto [[G1519]] Bethphage [[G967]] and [[G2532]] Bethany, [[G963]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] of Olives, [[G1636]] he sendeth forth [[G649]] two [[G1417]] of his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Go your way [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] over against [[G2713]] you: [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] as soon as [[G2112]] ye be entered [[G1531]] into [[G1519]] it, [[G846]] ye shall find [[G2147]] a colt [[G4454]] tied, [[G1210]] whereon [[G1909]] never [[G3762]] man [[G444]] sat; [[G2523]] loose [[G3089]] him, [[G846]] and bring [[G71]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] say [[G2036]] unto you, [[G5213]] Why [[G5101]] do ye [[G4160]] this? [[G5124]] say ye [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] of him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] he will send [[G649]] him [[G846]] hither. [[G5602]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] they went their way, [[G565]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] colt [[G4454]] tied [[G1210]] by [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] without [[G1854]] in [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] place where two ways met; [[G296]] and [[G2532]] they loose [[G3089]] him. [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] of them that [[G3588]] stood [[G2476]] there [[G1563]] said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] do ye, [[G4160]] loosing [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] colt? [[G4454]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them [[G846]] even as [[G2531]] Jesus [[G2424]] had commanded: [[G1781]] and [[G2532]] they let [[G863]] them [[G846]] go. [[G863]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] they brought [[G71]] the [[G3588]] colt [[G4454]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G1911]] their [[G846]] garments [[G2440]] on him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he sat [[G2523]] upon [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] spread [[G4766]] their [[G846]] garments [[G2440]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] way: [[G3598]] and [[G1161]] others [[G243]] cut down [[G2875]] branches [[G4746]] off [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] trees, [[G1186]] and [[G2532]] strawed [[G4766]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] they that [[G3588]] went before, [[G4254]] and [[G2532]] they that [[G3588]] followed, [[G190]] cried, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] Hosanna; [[G5614]] Blessed [[G2127]] he that [[G3588]] cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of the Lord: [[G2962]]

### 10
Blessed [[G2127]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of our [[G2257]] father [[G3962]] David, [[G1138]] that cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of the Lord: [[G2962]] Hosanna [[G5614]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] highest. [[G5310]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple: [[G2411]] and when [[G2532]] he had looked round about upon [[G4017]] all things, [[G3956]] and now [[G2235]] the [[G3588]] eventide [[G3798]] was come, [[G5607]] he went out [[G1831]] unto [[G1519]] Bethany [[G963]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] twelve. [[G1427]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] on the [[G3588]] morrow, [[G1887]] when they [[G846]] were come [[G1831]] from [[G575]] Bethany, [[G963]] he was hungry: [[G3983]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] seeing [[G1492]] a fig tree [[G4808]] afar off [[G3113]] having [[G2192]] leaves, [[G5444]] he came, [[G2064]] if [[G1487]] haply [[G686]] he might find [[G2147]] any thing [[G5100]] thereon: [[G1722]] when [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] it, [[G846]] he found [[G2147]] nothing [[G3762]] but [[G3361]] leaves; [[G5444]] for [[G1063]] the time [[G2540]] of figs [[G4810]] was [[G2258]] not [[G3756]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto it, [[G846]] No man [[G3367]] eat [[G5315]] fruit [[G2590]] of [[G1537]] thee [[G4675]] hereafter [[G3371]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]] And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [[G191]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] they come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem: [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and began [[G756]] to cast out [[G1544]] them that [[G3588]] sold [[G4453]] and [[G2532]] bought [[G59]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] overthrew [[G2690]] the [[G3588]] tables [[G5132]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2855]] moneychangers, [[G2855]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seats [[G2515]] of them that [[G3588]] sold [[G4453]] doves; [[G4058]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] would [[G863]] suffer [[G863]] that [[G2443]] any man [[G5100]] should carry [[G1308]] vessel [[G4632]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he taught, [[G1321]] saying [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] Is it [[G1125]] written, [[G1125]] My [[G3450]] house [[G3624]] shall be called [[G2564]] of all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of prayer? [[G4335]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] have made [[G4160]] it [[G846]] a den [[G4693]] of thieves. [[G3027]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] chief priests [[G749]] heard [[G191]] and [[G2532]] sought [[G2212]] how [[G4459]] they might destroy [[G622]] him: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they feared [[G5399]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] was astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] doctrine. [[G1322]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] even [[G3796]] was come, [[G1096]] he went [[G1607]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city. [[G4172]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] in the morning, [[G4404]] as they passed by, [[G3899]] they saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] fig tree [[G4808]] dried up [[G3583]] from [[G1537]] the roots. [[G4491]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] calling to remembrance [[G363]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G4461]] behold, [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] fig tree [[G4808]] which [[G3739]] thou cursedst [[G2672]] is withered away. [[G3583]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Have [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] in God. [[G2316]]

### 23
For [[G1063]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall say [[G2036]] unto this [[G5129]] mountain, [[G3735]] Be thou removed, [[G142]] and [[G2532]] be thou cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] shall [[G1252]] doubt [[G1252]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] but [[G235]] shall believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] those things which [[G3739]] he saith [[G3004]] shall come to pass; [[G1096]] he [[G846]] shall have [[G2071]] whatsoever [[G3739]] he saith. [[G2036]]

### 24
Therefore [[G1223]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] What things [[G3956]] soever [[G3745]] ye [[G154]] desire, [[G154]] when ye pray, [[G4336]] believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] ye receive [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G5213]] shall have [[G2071]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] ye stand [[G4739]] praying, [[G4336]] forgive, [[G863]] if [[G1487]] ye have [[G2192]] ought [[G5100]] against [[G2596]] any: [[G5100]] that [[G2443]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] also [[G2532]] which is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] may forgive [[G863]] you [[G5213]] your [[G5216]] trespasses. [[G3900]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye [[G5210]] not [[G3756]] do [[G863]] forgive, [[G863]] neither [[G3761]] your [[G5216]] will [[G863]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] is [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] forgive [[G863]] your [[G5216]] trespasses. [[G3900]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] they come [[G2064]] again [[G3825]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem: [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] as he [[G846]] was walking [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] there come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] say [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] By [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] doest thou [[G4160]] these things? [[G5023]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] gave [[G1325]] thee [[G4671]] this [[G3778]] authority [[G1849]] to [[G2443]] do [[G4160]] these things? [[G5023]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I will [[G1905]] also [[G2504]] ask [[G1905]] of you [[G5209]] one [[G1520]] question, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] answer [[G611]] me, [[G3427]] and [[G2532]] I will tell [[G2046]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I do [[G4160]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 30
The [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] of John, [[G2491]] was [[G2258]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] or [[G2228]] of [[G1537]] men? [[G444]] answer [[G611]] me. [[G3427]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] they reasoned [[G3049]] with [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1437]] we shall say, [[G2036]] From [[G1537]] heaven; [[G3772]] he will say, [[G2046]] Why [[G1302]] then [[G3767]] not [[G3756]] did ye [[G4100]] believe [[G4100]] him? [[G846]]

### 32
But [[G235]] if [[G1437]] we shall say, [[G2036]] Of [[G1537]] men; [[G444]] they feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people: [[G2992]] for [[G1063]] all [[G537]] counted [[G2192]] John, [[G2491]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2258]] a prophet [[G4396]] indeed. [[G3689]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] they answered [[G611]] and said [[G3004]] unto Jesus, [[G2424]] cannot [[G3756]] We [[G1492]] tell. [[G1492]] And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Neither [[G3761]] do I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I do [[G4160]] these things. [[G5023]]
