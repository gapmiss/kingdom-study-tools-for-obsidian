Behold, [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] cometh, [[H935]] and thy spoil [[H7998]] shall be divided [[H2505]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee. [[H7130]]

### 2
For I will gather [[H622]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] against [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to battle; [[H4421]] and the city [[H5892]] shall be taken, [[H3920]] and the houses [[H1004]] rifled, [[H8155]] and the women [[H802]] ravished; [[H7693]] and half [[H2677]] of the city [[H5892]] shall go forth [[H3318]] into captivity, [[H1473]] and the residue [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] shall not [[H3808]] be cut off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 3
Then shall the Lord [[H3068]] go forth, [[H3318]] and fight against [[H3898]] those [[H1992]] nations, [[H1471]] as when [[H3117]] he fought [[H3898]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle. [[H7128]]

### 4
And his feet [[H7272]] shall stand [[H5975]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] upon [[H5921]] the mount [[H2022]] of Olives, [[H2132]] which [[H834]] before [[H6440]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] on the east, [[H6924]] and the mount [[H2022]] of Olives [[H2132]] shall cleave [[H1234]] in the midst [[H2677]] thereof toward the east [[H4217]] and toward the west, [[H3220]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] valley; [[H1516]] and half [[H2677]] of the mountain [[H2022]] shall remove [[H4185]] toward the north, [[H6828]] and half [[H2677]] of it toward the south. [[H5045]]

### 5
And ye shall flee [[H5127]] the valley [[H1516]] of the mountains; [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] the valley [[H1516]] of the mountains [[H2022]] shall reach [[H5060]] unto [[H413]] Azal: [[H682]] yea, ye shall flee, [[H5127]] like as [[H834]] ye fled [[H5127]] from before [[H6440]] the earthquake [[H7494]] in the days [[H3117]] of Uzziah [[H5818]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] and the Lord [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] shall come, [[H935]] all [[H3605]] the saints [[H6918]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 6
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the light [[H216]] shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] clear, [[H3368]] dark: [[H7087]]

### 7
But it shall be [[H1961]] one [[H259]] day [[H3117]] which [[H1931]] shall be known [[H3045]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] day, [[H3117]] nor [[H3808]] night: [[H3915]] but it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] at evening [[H6153]] time [[H6256]] it shall be [[H1961]] light. [[H216]]

### 8
And it shall be [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] living [[H2416]] waters [[H4325]] shall go out [[H3318]] from Jerusalem; [[H3389]] half [[H2677]] of them toward [[H413]] the former [[H6931]] sea, [[H3220]] and half [[H2677]] of them toward [[H413]] the hinder [[H314]] sea: [[H3220]] in summer [[H7019]] and in winter [[H2779]] shall it be. [[H2779]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall be [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall there be [[H1961]] one [[H259]] Lord, [[H3068]] and his name [[H8034]] one. [[H259]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] shall be turned [[H5437]] as a plain [[H6160]] from Geba [[H1387]] to Rimmon [[H7417]] south [[H5045]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and it shall be lifted up, [[H7213]] and inhabited [[H3427]] in her place, [[H8478]] from Benjamin's [[H1144]] gate [[H8179]] unto [[H5704]] the place [[H4725]] of the first [[H7223]] gate, [[H8179]] unto [[H5704]] the corner [[H6434]] gate, [[H8179]] and the tower [[H4026]] of Hananeel [[H2606]] unto [[H5704]] the king's [[H4428]] winepresses. [[H3342]]

### 11
And shall dwell [[H3427]] in it, and there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] utter destruction; [[H2764]] but Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall be safely [[H983]] inhabited. [[H3427]]

### 12
And this [[H2063]] shall be [[H1961]] the plague [[H4046]] wherewith [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] will smite [[H5062]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] have fought [[H6633]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem; [[H3389]] Their flesh [[H1320]] shall consume away [[H4743]] while they [[H1931]] stand [[H5975]] upon their feet, [[H7272]] and their eyes [[H5869]] shall consume away [[H4743]] in their holes, [[H2356]] and their tongue [[H3956]] shall consume away [[H4743]] in their mouth. [[H6310]]

### 13
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] a great [[H7227]] tumult [[H4103]] from the Lord [[H3068]] shall be [[H1961]] among them; and they shall lay hold [[H2388]] every one [[H376]] on the hand [[H3027]] of his neighbour, [[H7453]] and his hand [[H3027]] shall rise up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of his neighbour. [[H7453]]

### 14
And Judah [[H3063]] also [[H1571]] shall fight [[H3898]] at Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and the wealth [[H2428]] of all [[H3605]] the heathen [[H1471]] round about [[H5439]] shall be gathered together, [[H622]] gold, [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] and apparel, [[H899]] in great [[H3966]] abundance. [[H7230]]

### 15
And so [[H3651]] shall be [[H1961]] the plague [[H4046]] of the horse, [[H5483]] of the mule, [[H6505]] of the camel, [[H1581]] and of the ass, [[H2543]] and of all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H929]] that [[H834]] shall be [[H1961]] in these [[H1992]] tents, [[H4264]] as this [[H2063]] plague. [[H4046]]

### 16
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] every one [[H3605]] that is left [[H3498]] of all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] which came [[H935]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall even go up [[H5927]] from [[H1767]] year [[H8141]] to year [[H8141]] to worship [[H7812]] the King, [[H4428]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and to keep [[H2287]] the feast [[H2282]] of tabernacles. [[H5521]]

### 17
And it shall be, [[H1961]] whoso [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] come up [[H5927]] of [[H853]] the families [[H4940]] of the earth [[H776]] unto [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to worship [[H7812]] the King, [[H4428]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] even upon [[H5921]] them shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain. [[H1653]]

### 18
And if [[H518]] the family [[H4940]] of Egypt [[H4714]] go not up, [[H5927]] and come [[H935]] not, [[H3808]] that no [[H3808]] there shall be [[H1961]] the plague, [[H4046]] wherewith [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] will smite [[H5062]] the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] come not up [[H5927]] to keep [[H2287]] the feast [[H2282]] of tabernacles. [[H5521]]

### 19
This [[H2063]] shall be [[H1961]] the punishment [[H2403]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and the punishment [[H2403]] of all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] come not up [[H5927]] to keep [[H2287]] the feast [[H2282]] of tabernacles. [[H5521]]

### 20
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall there be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the bells [[H4698]] of the horses, [[H5483]] HOLINESS [[H6944]] UNTO THE LORD; [[H3068]] and the pots [[H5518]] in the Lord's [[H3068]] house [[H1004]] shall be [[H1961]] like the bowls [[H4219]] before [[H6440]] the altar. [[H4196]]

### 21
Yea, every [[H3605]] pot [[H5518]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and in Judah [[H3063]] shall be [[H1961]] holiness [[H6944]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]] and all [[H3605]] they that sacrifice [[H2076]] shall come [[H935]] and take [[H3947]] of them, and seethe [[H1310]] therein: and in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] the Canaanite [[H3669]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts.
