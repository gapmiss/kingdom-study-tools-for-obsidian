### 1
And I turned, [[H7725]] and lifted up [[H5375]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there came out [[H3318]] four [[H702]] chariots [[H4818]] from between [[H996]] two [[H8147]] mountains; [[H2022]] and the mountains [[H2022]] mountains [[H2022]] of brass. [[H5178]]

### 2
In the first [[H7223]] chariot [[H4818]] red [[H122]] horses; [[H5483]] and in the second [[H8145]] chariot [[H4818]] black [[H7838]] horses; [[H5483]]

### 3
And in the third [[H7992]] chariot [[H4818]] white [[H3836]] horses; [[H5483]] and in the fourth [[H7243]] chariot [[H4818]] grisled [[H1261]] and bay [[H554]] horses. [[H5483]]

### 4
Then I answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me, What [[H4100]] these, [[H428]] my lord? [[H113]]

### 5
And the angel [[H4397]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, These [[H428]] the four [[H702]] spirits [[H7307]] of the heavens, [[H8064]] which go forth [[H3318]] from standing [[H3320]] before [[H5921]] the Lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 6
The black [[H7838]] horses [[H5483]] which [[H834]] therein go forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the north [[H6828]] country; [[H776]] and the white [[H3836]] go forth [[H3318]] after [[H310]] them; and the grisled [[H1261]] go forth [[H3318]] toward [[H413]] the south [[H8486]] country. [[H776]]

### 7
And the bay [[H554]] went forth, [[H3318]] and sought [[H1245]] to go [[H1980]] that they might walk to and fro [[H1980]] through the earth: [[H776]] and he said, [[H559]] Get you hence, [[H1980]] walk to and fro [[H1980]] through the earth. [[H776]] So they walked to and fro [[H1980]] through the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
Then cried [[H2199]] he upon [[H853]] me, and spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H7200]] these that go [[H3318]] toward [[H413]] the north [[H6828]] country [[H776]] have quieted [[H5117]] my spirit [[H7307]] in the north [[H6828]] country. [[H776]]

### 9
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 10
Take [[H3947]] of [[H853]] the captivity, [[H1473]] of Heldai, [[H2469]] of [[H853]] Tobijah, [[H2900]] and of [[H853]] Jedaiah, [[H3048]] which [[H834]] are come [[H935]] from Babylon, [[H894]] and come [[H935]] thou [[H859]] the same [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and go [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of Josiah [[H2977]] the son [[H1121]] of Zephaniah; [[H6846]]

### 11
Then take [[H3947]] silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and make [[H6213]] crowns, [[H5850]] and set [[H7760]] upon the head [[H7218]] of Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Josedech, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest; [[H3548]]

### 12
And speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] speaketh [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] saying, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] the man [[H376]] whose name [[H8034]] The BRANCH; [[H6780]] and he shall grow up [[H6779]] out of his place, [[H8478]] and he shall build [[H1129]] the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 13
Even he [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and he [[H1931]] shall bear [[H5375]] the glory, [[H1935]] and shall sit [[H3427]] and rule [[H4910]] upon [[H5921]] his throne; [[H3678]] and he shall be [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] upon [[H5921]] his throne: [[H3678]] and the counsel [[H6098]] of peace [[H7965]] shall be [[H1961]] between [[H996]] them both. [[H8147]]

### 14
And the crowns [[H5850]] shall be [[H1961]] to Helem, [[H2494]] and to Tobijah, [[H2900]] and to Jedaiah, [[H3048]] and to Hen [[H2581]] the son [[H1121]] of Zephaniah, [[H6846]] for a memorial [[H2146]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
And they far off [[H7350]] shall come [[H935]] and build [[H1129]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] you. And shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] ye will diligently [[H8085]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]
