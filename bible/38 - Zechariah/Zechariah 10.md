### 1
Ask [[H7592]] ye of the Lord [[H3068]] rain [[H4306]] in the time [[H6256]] of the latter rain; [[H4456]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall make [[H6213]] bright clouds, [[H2385]] and give [[H5414]] them showers [[H1653]] of rain, [[H4306]] to every one [[H376]] grass [[H6212]] in the field. [[H7704]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] the idols [[H8655]] have spoken [[H1696]] vanity, [[H205]] and the diviners [[H7080]] have seen [[H2372]] a lie, [[H8267]] and have told [[H1696]] false [[H7723]] dreams; [[H2472]] they comfort [[H5162]] in vain: [[H1892]] therefore [[H3651]] they went their way [[H5265]] as [[H3644]] a flock, [[H6629]] they were troubled, [[H6031]] because [[H3588]] no [[H369]] shepherd. [[H7462]]

### 3
Mine anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] against [[H5921]] the shepherds, [[H7462]] and I punished [[H6485]] the goats: [[H6260]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath visited [[H6485]] his flock [[H5739]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and hath made [[H7760]] them as his goodly [[H1935]] horse [[H5483]] in the battle. [[H4421]]

### 4
Out of [[H4480]] him came forth [[H3318]] the corner, [[H6438]] out of [[H4480]] him the nail, [[H3489]] out of [[H4480]] him the battle [[H4421]] bow, [[H7198]] out of [[H4480]] him every [[H3605]] oppressor [[H5065]] together. [[H3162]]

### 5
And they shall be [[H1961]] as mighty [[H1368]] which tread down [[H947]] in the mire [[H2916]] of the streets [[H2351]] in the battle: [[H4421]] and they shall fight, [[H3898]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] them, and the riders [[H7392]] on horses [[H5483]] shall be confounded. [[H3001]]

### 6
And I will strengthen [[H1396]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and I will save [[H3467]] the house [[H1004]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] and I will bring them again to place them; [[H7725]] for [[H3588]] I have mercy upon [[H7355]] them: and they shall be [[H1961]] as though [[H834]] I had not [[H3808]] cast them off: [[H2186]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and will hear them. [[H6030]]

### 7
And Ephraim [[H669]] shall be [[H1961]] like a mighty [[H1368]] and their heart [[H3820]] shall rejoice [[H8055]] as through [[H3644]] wine: [[H3196]] yea, their children [[H1121]] shall see [[H7200]] and be glad; [[H8056]] their heart [[H3820]] shall rejoice [[H1523]] in the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
I will hiss [[H8319]] for them, and gather [[H6908]] them; for [[H3588]] I have redeemed [[H6299]] them: and they shall increase [[H7235]] as [[H3644]] they have increased. [[H7235]]

### 9
And I will sow [[H2232]] them among the people: [[H5971]] and they shall remember [[H2142]] me in far countries; [[H4801]] and they shall live [[H2421]] with [[H854]] their children, [[H1121]] and turn again. [[H7725]]

### 10
I will bring them again [[H7725]] also out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and gather [[H6908]] them out of Assyria; [[H804]] and I will bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] and Lebanon; [[H3844]] and shall not [[H3808]] be found [[H4672]] for them. [[H4672]]

### 11
And he shall pass through [[H5674]] the sea [[H3220]] with affliction, [[H6869]] and shall smite [[H5221]] the waves [[H1530]] in the sea, [[H3220]] and all [[H3605]] the deeps [[H4688]] of the river [[H2975]] shall dry up: [[H3001]] and the pride [[H1347]] of Assyria [[H804]] shall be brought down, [[H3381]] and the sceptre [[H7626]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall depart away. [[H5493]]

### 12
And I will strengthen [[H1396]] them in the Lord; [[H3068]] and they shall walk up and down [[H1980]] in his name, [[H8034]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
