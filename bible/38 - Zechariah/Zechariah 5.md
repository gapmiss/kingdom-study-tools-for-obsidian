### 1
Then I turned, [[H7725]] and lifted up [[H5375]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] a flying [[H5774]] roll. [[H4039]]

### 2
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, What [[H4100]] seest [[H7200]] thou? [[H859]] And I answered, [[H559]] I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] a flying [[H5774]] roll; [[H4039]] the length [[H753]] thereof twenty [[H6242]] cubits, [[H520]] and the breadth [[H7341]] thereof ten [[H6235]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 3
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] me, This [[H2063]] the curse [[H423]] that goeth forth [[H3318]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] every one [[H3605]] that stealeth [[H1589]] shall be cut off [[H5352]] on this side [[H2088]] according [[H3644]] to it; and every [[H3605]] one that sweareth [[H7650]] shall be cut off [[H5352]] on that side [[H2088]] according [[H3644]] to it. [[H3644]]

### 4
I will bring it forth, [[H3318]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and it shall enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the thief, [[H1590]] and into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of him that sweareth [[H7650]] falsely [[H8267]] by my name: [[H8034]] and it shall remain [[H3885]] in the midst [[H8432]] of his house, [[H1004]] and shall consume [[H3615]] it with the timber [[H6086]] thereof and the stones [[H68]] thereof. [[H68]]

### 5
Then the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me went forth, [[H3318]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Lift up [[H5375]] now [[H4994]] thine eyes, [[H5869]] and see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] that goeth forth. [[H3318]]

### 6
And I said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] it? [[H1931]] And he said, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] an ephah [[H374]] that goeth forth. [[H3318]] He said [[H559]] moreover, This [[H2063]] their resemblance [[H5869]] through all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 7
And, behold, [[H2009]] there was lifted up [[H5375]] a talent [[H3603]] of lead: [[H5777]] and this [[H2063]] a [[H259]] woman [[H802]] that sitteth [[H3427]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the ephah. [[H374]]

### 8
And he said, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] wickedness. [[H7564]] And he cast [[H7993]] it into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the ephah; [[H374]] and he cast [[H7993]] the weight [[H68]] of lead [[H5777]] upon [[H413]] the mouth [[H6310]] thereof. [[H6310]]

### 9
Then lifted I up [[H5375]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there came out [[H3318]] two [[H8147]] women, [[H802]] and the wind [[H7307]] in their wings; [[H3671]] for they had [[H2007]] wings [[H3671]] like the wings [[H3671]] of a stork: [[H2624]] and they lifted up [[H5375]] the ephah [[H374]] between [[H996]] the earth [[H776]] and the heaven. [[H8064]]

### 10
Then said [[H559]] I to [[H413]] the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me, Whither [[H575]] do these [[H1992]] bear [[H1980]] the ephah? [[H374]]

### 11
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, To build [[H1129]] it an house [[H1004]] in the land [[H776]] of Shinar: [[H8152]] and it shall be established, [[H3559]] and set [[H3240]] there [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] her own base. [[H4369]]
