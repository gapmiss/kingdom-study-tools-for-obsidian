### 1
In the eighth [[H8066]] month, [[H2320]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Darius, [[H1867]] came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] the son [[H1121]] of Berechiah, [[H1296]] the son [[H1121]] of Iddo [[H5714]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] hath been sore [[H7110]] displeased [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] your fathers. [[H1]]

### 3
Therefore say [[H559]] thou unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Turn [[H7725]] ye unto [[H413]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and I will turn [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] you, saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 4
Be [[H1961]] ye not [[H408]] as your fathers, [[H1]] unto [[H413]] whom [[H834]] the former [[H7223]] prophets [[H5030]] have cried, [[H7121]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Turn [[H7725]] ye now [[H4994]] from your evil [[H7451]] ways, [[H1870]] and your evil [[H7451]] doings: [[H4611]] but they did not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] nor [[H3808]] hearken [[H7181]] unto [[H413]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
Your fathers, [[H1]] where [[H346]] they? [[H1992]] and the prophets, [[H5030]] do they live [[H2421]] for ever? [[H5769]]

### 6
But [[H389]] my words [[H1697]] and my statutes, [[H2706]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] my servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] did they not [[H3808]] take hold [[H5381]] of your fathers? [[H1]] and they returned [[H7725]] and said, [[H559]] Like as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] thought [[H2161]] to do [[H6213]] unto us, according to our ways, [[H1870]] and according to our doings, [[H4611]] so [[H3651]] hath he dealt [[H6213]] with [[H854]] us. [[H854]]

### 7
Upon the four [[H702]] and twentieth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the eleventh [[H6249]] month, [[H2320]] which [[H1931]] the month [[H2320]] Sebat, [[H7627]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Darius, [[H1867]] came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] the son [[H1121]] of Berechiah, [[H1296]] the son [[H1121]] of Iddo [[H5714]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]]

### 8
I saw [[H7200]] by night, [[H3915]] and behold [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] riding [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] a red [[H122]] horse, [[H5483]] and he [[H1931]] stood [[H5975]] among [[H996]] the myrtle trees [[H1918]] that [[H834]] in the bottom; [[H4699]] and behind [[H310]] him red [[H122]] horses, [[H5483]] speckled, [[H8320]] and white. [[H3836]]

### 9
Then said [[H559]] I, O my lord, [[H113]] what [[H4100]] these? [[H428]] And the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, I [[H589]] will shew [[H7200]] thee what [[H4100]] these [[H428]]

### 10
And the man [[H376]] that stood [[H5975]] among [[H996]] the myrtle trees [[H1918]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] These [[H428]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent [[H7971]] to walk [[H1980]] to and fro through the earth. [[H776]]

### 11
And they answered [[H6030]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that stood [[H5975]] among [[H996]] the myrtle trees, [[H1918]] and said, [[H559]] We have walked to and fro [[H1980]] through the earth, [[H776]] and, behold, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] sitteth still, [[H3427]] and is at rest. [[H8252]]

### 12
Then the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] how long [[H5704]] wilt thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] have mercy on [[H7355]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and on the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] against which [[H834]] thou hast had indignation [[H2194]] these [[H2088]] threescore and ten [[H7657]] years? [[H8141]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me good [[H2896]] words [[H1697]] comfortable [[H5150]] words. [[H1697]]

### 14
So the angel [[H4397]] that communed [[H1696]] with me said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Cry [[H7121]] thou, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] I am jealous [[H7065]] for Jerusalem [[H3389]] and for Zion [[H6726]] with a great [[H1419]] jealousy. [[H7068]]

### 15
And I [[H589]] am very [[H1419]] sore [[H7110]] displeased [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] the heathen [[H1471]] at ease: [[H7600]] for [[H834]] I [[H589]] was but a little [[H4592]] displeased, [[H7107]] and they [[H1992]] helped [[H5826]] forward the affliction. [[H7451]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] I am returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] with mercies: [[H7356]] my house [[H1004]] shall be built [[H1129]] in it, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and a line [[H6957]] shall be stretched forth [[H5186]] upon [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 17
Cry [[H7121]] yet, [[H5750]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] My cities [[H5892]] through prosperity [[H2896]] shall yet [[H5750]] be spread abroad; [[H6327]] and the Lord [[H3068]] shall yet [[H5750]] comfort [[H5162]] Zion, [[H6726]] and shall yet [[H5750]] choose [[H977]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 18
Then lifted I up [[H5375]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] and saw, [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] four [[H702]] horns. [[H7161]]

### 19
And I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me, What [[H4100]] these? [[H428]] And he answered [[H559]] me, These [[H428]] the horns [[H7161]] which [[H834]] have scattered [[H2219]] Judah, [[H3063]] Israel, [[H3478]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] shewed [[H7200]] me four [[H702]] carpenters. [[H2796]]

### 21
Then said [[H559]] I, What [[H4100]] come [[H935]] these [[H428]] to do? [[H6213]] And he spake, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]] These [[H428]] the horns [[H7161]] which [[H834]] have scattered [[H2219]] Judah, [[H3063]] so that [[H6310]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] did lift up [[H5375]] his head: [[H7218]] but these [[H428]] are come [[H935]] to fray [[H2729]] them, to cast out [[H3034]] the horns [[H7161]] of the Gentiles, [[H1471]] which lifted up [[H5375]] horn [[H7161]] over [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] to scatter [[H2219]] it.
