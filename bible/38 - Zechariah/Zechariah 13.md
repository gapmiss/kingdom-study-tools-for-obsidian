In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there shall be [[H1961]] a fountain [[H4726]] opened [[H6605]] to the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] and to the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] for sin [[H2403]] and for uncleanness. [[H5079]]

[[H776]]

And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] any [[H376]] shall yet [[H5750]] prophesy, [[H5012]] then his father [[H1]] and his mother [[H517]] that begat [[H3205]] him shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thou shalt not [[H3808]] live; [[H2421]] for [[H3588]] thou speakest [[H1696]] lies [[H8267]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and his father [[H1]] and his mother [[H517]] that begat [[H3205]] him shall thrust him through [[H1856]] when he prophesieth.

But he shall say, [[H559]] I [[H595]] no [[H3808]] prophet, [[H5030]] I [[H595]] an husbandman; [[H5647]] for [[H3588]] man [[H120]] taught me to keep cattle [[H7069]] from my youth. [[H5271]]

### 6
And shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] these [[H428]] wounds [[H4347]] in [[H996]] thine hands? [[H3027]] Then he shall answer, [[H559]] with which [[H834]] I was wounded [[H5221]] the house [[H1004]] of my friends. [[H157]]

Awake, [[H5782]] O sword, [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] my shepherd, [[H7462]] and against [[H5921]] the man [[H1397]] my fellow, [[H5997]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]] smite [[H5221]] the shepherd, [[H7462]] and the sheep [[H6629]] shall be scattered: [[H6327]] and I will turn [[H7725]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the little ones. [[H6819]]
