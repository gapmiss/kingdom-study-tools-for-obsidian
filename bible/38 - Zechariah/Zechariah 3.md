### 1
And he shewed [[H7200]]  me [[H853]] Joshua [[H3091]] the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] standing [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and Satan [[H7854]] standing [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] his right hand [[H3225]] to resist [[H7853]] him. [[H7853]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] The Lord [[H3068]] rebuke [[H1605]] thee, O Satan; [[H7854]] even the Lord [[H3068]] that hath chosen [[H977]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] rebuke [[H1605]] thee: not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] a brand [[H181]] plucked [[H5337]] out of the fire? [[H784]]

### 3
Now Joshua [[H3091]] was [[H1961]] clothed [[H3847]] with filthy [[H6674]] garments, [[H899]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the angel. [[H4397]]

### 4
And he answered [[H6030]] and spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] those that stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him, saying, [[H559]] Take away [[H5493]] the filthy [[H6674]] garments [[H899]] from [[H5921]] him. And unto [[H413]] him he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H7200]] I have caused thine iniquity [[H5771]] to pass [[H5674]] from [[H5921]] thee, and I will clothe [[H3847]] thee with change of raiment. [[H4254]]

### 5
And I said, [[H559]] Let them set [[H7760]] a fair [[H2889]] mitre [[H6797]] upon [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]] So they set [[H7760]] a fair [[H2889]] mitre [[H6797]] upon [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and clothed [[H3847]] him with garments. [[H899]] And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] stood by. [[H5975]]

### 6
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] protested [[H5749]] unto Joshua, [[H3091]] saying, [[H559]]

### 7
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] If [[H518]] thou wilt walk [[H1980]] in my ways, [[H1870]] and if [[H518]] thou wilt keep [[H8104]] my charge, [[H4931]] then thou [[H859]] shalt also [[H1571]] judge [[H1777]] my house, [[H1004]] and shalt also [[H1571]] keep [[H8104]]  my [[H853]] courts, [[H2691]] and I will give [[H5414]] thee places to walk [[H4108]] among [[H996]] these [[H428]] that stand by. [[H5975]]

### 8
Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] O Joshua [[H3091]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] thou, [[H859]] and thy fellows [[H7453]] that sit [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] thee: for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] men [[H376]] wondered at: [[H4159]] for, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I will bring forth [[H935]] my servant [[H5650]] the BRANCH. [[H6780]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] behold [[H2009]] the stone [[H68]] that [[H834]] I have laid [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] Joshua; [[H3091]] upon [[H5921]] one [[H259]] stone [[H68]] seven [[H7651]] eyes: [[H5869]] behold, [[H2005]] I will engrave [[H6605]] the graving [[H6603]] thereof, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and I will remove [[H4185]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] in one [[H259]] day. [[H3117]]

### 10
In that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] shall ye call [[H7121]] every man [[H376]] his neighbour [[H7453]] under [[H413]] the vine [[H1612]] and under [[H413]] the fig tree. [[H8384]]
