### 1
And the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me came again, [[H7725]] and waked [[H5782]] me, as a man [[H376]] that [[H834]] is wakened [[H5782]] out of his sleep, [[H8142]]

### 2
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, What [[H4100]] seest [[H7200]] thou? [[H859]] And I said, [[H559]] I have looked, [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] a candlestick [[H4501]] all [[H3605]] gold, [[H2091]] with a bowl [[H1543]] upon [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of it, and his seven [[H7651]] lamps [[H5216]] thereon, [[H5921]] and seven [[H7651]] pipes [[H4166]] to the seven [[H7651]] lamps, [[H5216]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] thereof: [[H7218]]

### 3
And two [[H8147]] olive trees [[H2132]] by [[H5921]] it, one [[H259]] upon the right [[H3225]] of the bowl, [[H1543]] and the other [[H259]] upon [[H5921]] the left [[H8040]] thereof. [[H8040]]

### 4
So I answered [[H6030]] and spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me, saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] these, [[H428]] my lord? [[H113]]

### 5
Then the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Knowest [[H3045]] thou not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] these [[H428]] be? And I said, [[H559]] No, [[H3808]] my lord. [[H113]]

### 6
Then he answered [[H6030]] and spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Zerubbabel, [[H2216]] saying, [[H559]] Not [[H3808]] by might, [[H2428]] nor [[H3808]] by power, [[H3581]] but [[H3588]] by my spirit, [[H7307]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 7
Who [[H4310]] thou, [[H859]] O great [[H1419]] mountain? [[H2022]] before [[H6440]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] a plain: [[H4334]] and he shall bring forth [[H3318]] the headstone [[H68]] shoutings, [[H8663]] Grace, [[H2580]] grace [[H2580]] unto it. [[H2580]]

### 8
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 9
The hands [[H3027]] of Zerubbabel [[H2216]] have laid the foundation [[H3245]] of this [[H2088]] house; [[H1004]] his hands [[H3027]] shall also finish it; [[H1214]] and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath sent [[H7971]] me unto you. [[H413]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] hath despised [[H936]] the day [[H3117]] of small things? [[H6996]] for they shall rejoice, [[H8055]] and shall see [[H7200]] the plummet [[H913]] in the hand [[H3027]] of Zerubbabel [[H2216]] those [[H428]] seven; [[H7651]] they [[H1992]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which run to and fro [[H7751]] through the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]]

### 11
Then answered [[H6030]] I, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] olive trees [[H2132]] upon [[H5921]] the right [[H3225]] of the candlestick [[H4501]] and upon [[H5921]] the left [[H8040]] thereof? [[H8040]]

### 12
And I answered [[H6030]] again, [[H8145]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] two [[H8147]] olive [[H2132]] branches [[H7641]] which [[H834]] through [[H3027]] the two [[H8147]] golden [[H2091]] pipes [[H6804]] empty [[H7324]] the golden [[H2091]] out of [[H5921]] themselves? [[H5921]]

### 13
And he answered [[H559]] me and said, [[H559]] Knowest [[H3045]] thou not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] these [[H428]] And I said, [[H559]] No, [[H3808]] my lord. [[H113]]

### 14
Then said [[H559]] he, These [[H428]] the two [[H8147]] anointed [[H3323]] ones, [[H1121]] that stand [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the Lord [[H113]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]]
