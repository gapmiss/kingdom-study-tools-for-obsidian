The burden [[H4853]] of the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the land [[H776]] of Hadrach, [[H2317]] and Damascus [[H1834]] the rest [[H4496]] thereof: when [[H3588]] the eyes [[H5869]] of man, [[H120]] as of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] toward the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
And Hamath [[H2574]] also [[H1571]] shall border [[H1379]] thereby; Tyrus, [[H6865]] and Zidon, [[H6721]] though [[H3588]] it be very [[H3966]] wise. [[H2449]]

### 3
And Tyrus [[H6865]] did build [[H1129]] herself a strong hold, [[H4692]] and heaped up [[H6651]] silver [[H3701]] as the dust, [[H6083]] and fine gold [[H2742]] as the mire [[H2916]] of the streets. [[H2351]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] will cast her out, [[H3423]] and he will smite [[H5221]] her power [[H2428]] in the sea; [[H3220]] and she [[H1931]] shall be devoured [[H398]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 5
Ashkelon [[H831]] shall see [[H7200]] and fear; [[H3372]] Gaza [[H5804]] also and be very [[H3966]] sorrowful, [[H2342]] and Ekron; [[H6138]] for [[H3588]] her expectation [[H4007]] shall be ashamed; [[H954]] and the king [[H4428]] shall perish [[H6]] from Gaza, [[H5804]] and Ashkelon [[H831]] shall not [[H3808]] be inhabited. [[H3427]]

### 6
And a bastard [[H4464]] shall dwell [[H3427]] in Ashdod, [[H795]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] the pride [[H1347]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 7
And I will take away [[H5493]] his blood [[H1818]] out of his mouth, [[H6310]] and his abominations [[H8251]] from between [[H996]] his teeth: [[H8127]] but he that remaineth, [[H7604]] even [[H1571]] he, [[H1931]] for our God, [[H430]] and he shall be [[H1961]] as a governor [[H441]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and Ekron [[H6138]] as a Jebusite. [[H2983]]

### 8
And I will encamp [[H2583]] about mine house [[H1004]] because of the army, [[H4675]] because of him that passeth and because of him that returneth: [[H7725]] and no [[H3808]] oppressor [[H5065]] by, shall pass [[H5674]] through [[H5674]] them any more: [[H5750]] for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] have I seen [[H7200]] with mine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
Rejoice [[H1523]] greatly, [[H3966]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion; [[H6726]] shout, [[H7321]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] behold, [[H2009]] thy King [[H4428]] cometh [[H935]] unto thee: he [[H1931]] just, [[H6662]] and having salvation; [[H3467]] lowly, [[H6041]] and riding [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] an ass, [[H2543]] and upon [[H5921]] a colt [[H5895]] the foal [[H1121]] of an ass. [[H860]]

### 10
And I will cut off [[H3772]] the chariot [[H7393]] from Ephraim, [[H669]] and the horse [[H5483]] from Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the battle [[H4421]] bow [[H7198]] shall be cut off: [[H3772]] and he shall speak [[H1696]] peace [[H7965]] unto the heathen: [[H1471]] and his dominion [[H4915]] from sea [[H3220]] to [[H5704]] sea, [[H3220]] and from the river [[H5104]] to [[H5704]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 11
As for thee [[H859]] also, [[H1571]] by the blood [[H1818]] of thy covenant [[H1285]] I have sent forth [[H7971]] thy prisoners [[H615]] out of the pit [[H953]] wherein no [[H369]] water. [[H4325]]

### 12
Turn [[H7725]] you to the strong hold, [[H1225]] ye prisoners [[H615]] of hope: [[H8615]] even [[H1571]] to day [[H3117]] do I declare [[H5046]] I will render [[H7725]] double [[H4932]] unto thee; [[H4932]]

### 13
When [[H3588]] I have bent [[H1869]] Judah [[H3063]] for me, filled [[H4390]] the bow [[H7198]] with Ephraim, [[H669]] and raised up [[H5782]] thy sons, [[H1121]] O Zion, [[H6726]] against [[H5921]] thy sons, [[H1121]] O Greece, [[H3120]] and made [[H7760]] thee as the sword [[H2719]] of a mighty man. [[H1368]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall be seen [[H7200]] over [[H5921]] them, and his arrow [[H2671]] shall go forth [[H3318]] as the lightning: [[H1300]] and the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] shall blow [[H8628]] the trumpet, [[H7782]] and shall go [[H1980]] with whirlwinds [[H5591]] of the south. [[H8486]]

### 15
The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] shall defend [[H1598]] them; and they shall devour, [[H398]] and subdue [[H3533]] with sling [[H7050]] stones; [[H68]] and they shall drink, [[H8354]] make a noise [[H1993]] as through [[H3644]] wine; [[H3196]] and they shall be filled [[H4390]] like bowls, [[H4219]] as the corners [[H2106]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

### 16
And the Lord [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] shall save [[H3467]] them in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] as the flock [[H6629]] of his people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] the stones [[H68]] of a crown, [[H5145]] lifted up as an ensign [[H5264]] upon [[H5921]] his land. [[H127]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] how [[H4100]] great his goodness, [[H2898]] and how [[H4100]] great his beauty! [[H3308]] corn [[H1715]] shall make the young men [[H970]] cheerful, [[H5107]] and new wine [[H8492]] the maids. [[H1330]]
