### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the fourth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Darius, [[H1867]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Zechariah [[H2148]] in the fourth [[H702]] of the ninth [[H8671]] month, [[H2320]] in Chisleu; [[H3691]]

### 2
When they had sent [[H7971]] unto the house [[H1004]] of God [[H410]] Sherezer [[H8272]] and Regem-melech, [[H7276]] and their men, [[H582]] to pray [[H2470]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 3
to speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the priests [[H3548]] which [[H834]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and to [[H413]] the prophets, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]] Should I weep [[H1058]] in the fifth [[H2549]] month, [[H2320]] separating myself, [[H5144]] as [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] these [[H2088]] so many [[H4100]] years? [[H8141]]

### 4
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 5
Speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and to [[H413]] the priests, [[H3548]] saying, [[H559]] When [[H3588]] ye fasted [[H6684]] and mourned [[H5594]] in the fifth [[H2549]] and seventh [[H7637]] even those [[H2088]] seventy [[H7657]] years, [[H8141]] did ye at all [[H6684]] fast [[H6684]] unto me, to me? [[H6684]]

### 6
And when [[H3588]] ye did eat, [[H398]] and when [[H3588]] ye did drink, [[H8354]] did not [[H3808]] ye [[H859]] eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]]

### 7
not [[H3808]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath cried [[H7121]] by [[H3027]] the former [[H7223]] prophets, [[H5030]] when Jerusalem [[H3389]] was [[H1961]] inhabited [[H3427]] and in prosperity, [[H7961]] and the cities [[H5892]] thereof round about her, [[H5439]] when inhabited [[H3427]] the south [[H5045]] and the plain? [[H8219]]

### 8
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] saying, [[H559]]

### 9
Thus [[H3541]] speaketh [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] saying, [[H559]] Execute [[H8199]] true [[H571]] judgment, [[H4941]] and shew [[H6213]] mercy [[H2617]] and compassions [[H7356]] every man [[H376]] to [[H854]] his brother: [[H251]]

### 10
And oppress [[H6231]] not [[H408]] the widow, [[H490]] nor the fatherless, [[H3490]] the stranger, [[H1616]] nor the poor; [[H6041]] and let none [[H408]] of you imagine [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H376]] his brother [[H251]] in your heart. [[H3824]]

### 11
But they refused [[H3985]] to hearken, [[H7181]] and pulled away [[H5414]] the shoulder, [[H3802]] and stopped [[H3513]] their ears, [[H241]] that they should not hear. [[H8085]]

### 12
Yea, they made [[H7760]] their hearts [[H3820]] an adamant stone, [[H8068]] lest they should hear [[H8085]]  the [[H853]] law, [[H8451]] and the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath sent [[H7971]] in his spirit [[H7307]] by [[H3027]] the former [[H7223]] prophets: [[H5030]] therefore came [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] wrath [[H7110]] from [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 13
Therefore it is come to pass, [[H1961]] as [[H834]] he cried, [[H7121]] and they would not [[H3808]] hear; [[H8085]] so [[H3651]] they cried, [[H7121]] and I would not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]]

### 14
But I scattered them with a whirlwind [[H5590]] among [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] they knew [[H3045]] not. [[H3808]] Thus the land [[H776]] was desolate [[H8074]] after [[H310]] them, that no man passed through [[H5674]] nor returned: [[H7725]] for they laid [[H7760]] the pleasant [[H2532]] land [[H776]] desolate.
