### 1
Open [[H6605]] thy doors, [[H1817]] O Lebanon, [[H3844]] that the fire [[H784]] may devour [[H398]] thy cedars. [[H730]]

### 2
Howl, [[H3213]] fir tree; [[H1265]] for [[H3588]] the cedar [[H730]] is fallen; [[H5307]] because [[H834]] the mighty [[H117]] are spoiled: [[H7703]] howl, [[H3213]] O ye oaks [[H437]] of Bashan; [[H1316]] for [[H3588]] the forest [[H3293]] of the vintage [[H1208]] is come down. [[H3381]]

### 3
a voice [[H6963]] of the howling [[H3215]] of the shepherds; [[H7462]] for [[H3588]] their glory [[H155]] is spoiled: [[H7703]] a voice [[H6963]] of the roaring [[H7581]] of young lions; [[H3715]] for [[H3588]] the pride [[H1347]] of Jordan [[H3383]] is spoiled. [[H7703]]

### 4
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God; [[H430]] Feed [[H7462]] the flock [[H6629]] of the slaughter; [[H2028]]

### 5
Whose [[H834]] possessors [[H7069]] slay [[H2026]] them, and hold themselves not guilty: [[H816]] and they that sell [[H4376]] them say, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for I am rich: [[H6238]] and their own shepherds [[H7462]] pity [[H2550]] them not. [[H5921]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] I will no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] pity [[H2550]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] but, lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will deliver [[H4672]] the men [[H120]] every one [[H376]] into his neighbour's [[H7453]] hand, [[H3027]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of his king: [[H4428]] and they shall smite [[H3807]] the land, [[H776]] and out of their hand [[H3027]] I will not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]]

### 7
And I will feed [[H7462]] the flock [[H6629]] of slaughter, [[H2028]] you, [[H3651]] O poor [[H6041]] of the flock. [[H6629]] And I took [[H3947]] unto me two [[H8147]] staves; [[H4731]] the one [[H259]] I called [[H7121]] Beauty, [[H5278]] and the other [[H259]] I called [[H7121]] Bands; [[H2256]] and I fed [[H7462]] the flock. [[H6629]]

### 8
Three [[H7969]] shepherds [[H7462]] also I cut off [[H3582]] in one [[H259]] month; [[H3391]] and my soul [[H5315]] lothed [[H7114]] them, and their soul [[H5315]] also [[H1571]] abhorred [[H973]] me. [[H973]]

### 9
Then said [[H559]] I, I will not [[H3808]] feed [[H7462]] you: that that dieth, [[H4191]] let it die; [[H4191]] and that that is to be cut off, [[H3582]] let it be cut off; [[H3582]] and let the rest [[H7604]] eat [[H398]] every one [[H802]] the flesh [[H1320]] of another. [[H7468]]

### 10
And I took [[H3947]] my staff, [[H4731]] Beauty, [[H5278]] and cut it asunder, [[H1438]] that I might break [[H6565]] my covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] I had made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 11
And it was broken [[H6565]] in that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] and so [[H3651]] the poor [[H6041]] of the flock [[H6629]] that waited upon [[H8104]] me knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
And I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, If [[H518]] ye think [[H5869]] good, [[H2896]] give [[H3051]] my price; [[H7939]] and if [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] forbear. [[H2308]] So they weighed for [[H8254]] my price [[H7939]] thirty [[H7970]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Cast [[H7993]] it unto [[H413]] the potter: [[H3335]] a goodly [[H145]] price [[H3366]] that [[H834]] I was prised at [[H3365]] of [[H5921]] them. And I took [[H3947]] the thirty [[H7970]] of silver, [[H3701]] and cast [[H7993]] them to [[H413]] the potter [[H3335]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
Then I cut asunder [[H1438]] mine other [[H8145]] staff, [[H4731]] Bands, [[H2256]] that I might break [[H6565]] the brotherhood [[H264]] between [[H996]] Judah [[H3063]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Take [[H3947]] unto thee yet [[H5750]] the instruments [[H3627]] of a foolish [[H196]] shepherd. [[H7462]]

### 16
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will raise up [[H6965]] a shepherd [[H7462]] in the land, [[H776]] shall not [[H3808]] visit [[H6485]] those that be cut off, [[H3582]] neither [[H3808]] shall seek [[H1245]] the young one, [[H5289]] nor [[H3808]] heal [[H7495]] that that is broken, [[H7665]] nor [[H3808]] feed [[H3557]] that that standeth still: [[H5324]] but he shall eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of the fat, [[H1277]] and tear pieces. [[H6561]] their claws [[H6541]] in [[H6541]]

### 17
Woe [[H1945]] to the idol [[H457]] shepherd [[H7473]] that leaveth [[H5800]] the flock! [[H6629]] the sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] his arm, [[H2220]] and upon [[H5921]] his right [[H3225]] eye: [[H5869]] his arm [[H2220]] shall be clean [[H3001]] dried up, [[H3001]] and his right [[H3225]] eye [[H5869]] shall be utterly [[H3543]] darkened. [[H3543]]
