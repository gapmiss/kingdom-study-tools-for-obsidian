[[H7130]]

Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will make [[H7760]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a cup [[H5592]] of trembling [[H7478]] unto all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] round about, [[H5439]] when they shall be [[H1961]] in the siege [[H4692]] both [[H1571]] against [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

And in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] will I make [[H7760]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a burdensome [[H4614]] stone [[H68]] for all [[H3605]] people: [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] that burden [[H6006]] themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, [[H8295]] though all [[H3605]] the people [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] be gathered together [[H622]] against [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

In that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I will smite [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] horse [[H5483]] with astonishment, [[H8541]] and his rider [[H7392]] with madness: [[H7697]] and I will open [[H6491]] mine eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and will smite [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] horse [[H5483]] of the people [[H5971]] with blindness.

And the governors [[H441]] of Judah [[H3063]] shall say [[H559]] in their heart, [[H3820]] The inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] my strength [[H556]] in the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] their God. [[H430]]

### 6
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] will I make [[H7760]] the governors [[H441]] of Judah [[H3063]] like an hearth [[H3595]] of fire [[H784]] among the wood, [[H6086]] and like a torch [[H3940]] of fire [[H784]] in a sheaf; [[H5995]] and they shall devour [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] round about, [[H5439]] on [[H5921]] the right hand [[H3225]] and on [[H5921]] the left: [[H8040]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall be inhabited [[H3427]] again [[H5750]] in her own place, [[H8478]] in Jerusalem.

The Lord [[H3068]] also shall save [[H3467]] the tents [[H168]] of Judah [[H3063]] first, [[H7223]] that [[H4616]] the glory [[H8597]] of the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] and the glory [[H8597]] of the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] do not [[H3808]] magnify [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 8
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall the Lord [[H3068]] defend [[H1598]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and he that is feeble [[H3782]] among them at that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall be [[H1961]] as David; [[H1732]] and the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] as God, [[H430]] as the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 9
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] I will seek [[H1245]] to destroy [[H8045]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that come [[H935]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

[[H1060]]

### 11
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall there be a great [[H1431]] mourning [[H4553]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] as the mourning [[H4553]] of Hadadrimmon [[H1910]] in the valley [[H1237]] of Megiddon. [[H4023]]

### 12
And the land [[H776]] shall mourn, [[H5594]] every [[H4940]] family [[H4940]] apart; [[H905]] the family [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] apart, [[H905]] and their wives [[H802]] apart; [[H905]] the family [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of Nathan [[H5416]] apart, [[H905]] and their wives [[H802]] apart; [[H802]]
