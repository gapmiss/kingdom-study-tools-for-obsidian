### 1
I lifted up [[H5375]] mine eyes [[H5869]] again, and looked, [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] with a measuring [[H4060]] line [[H2256]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 2
Then said [[H559]] I, Whither [[H575]] goest [[H1980]] thou? [[H859]] And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, To measure [[H4058]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] the breadth [[H7341]] thereof, and what [[H4100]] the length [[H753]] thereof. [[H753]]

### 3
And, behold, [[H2009]] the angel [[H4397]] that talked [[H1696]] with me went forth, [[H3318]] and another [[H312]] angel [[H4397]] went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] him, [[H7125]]

### 4
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Run, [[H7323]] speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] this [[H1975]] young man, [[H5288]] saying, [[H559]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall be inhabited [[H3427]] towns without walls [[H6519]] for the multitude [[H7230]] of men [[H120]] and cattle [[H929]] therein: [[H8432]]

### 5
For I, [[H589]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] unto her a wall [[H2346]] of fire [[H784]] round about, [[H5439]] and will be [[H1961]] the glory [[H3519]] in the midst [[H8432]] of her. [[H8432]]

### 6
Ho, [[H1945]] ho, [[H1945]] and flee [[H5127]] from the land [[H776]] of the north, [[H6828]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I have spread you abroad [[H6566]] as the four [[H702]] winds [[H7307]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
Deliver thyself, [[H4422]] O [[H1945]] Zion, [[H6726]] that dwellest [[H3427]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] After [[H310]] the glory [[H3519]] hath he sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] the nations [[H1471]] which spoiled [[H7997]] you: for [[H3588]] he that toucheth [[H5060]] you toucheth [[H5060]] the apple [[H892]] of his eye. [[H5869]]

### 9
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I will shake [[H5130]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] them, and they shall be [[H1961]] a spoil [[H7998]] to their servants: [[H5650]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath sent [[H7971]] me. [[H7971]]

### 10
Sing [[H7442]] and rejoice, [[H8055]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion: [[H6726]] for, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2005]] I come, [[H935]] and I will dwell [[H7931]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
And many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] shall be joined [[H3867]] to [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and shall be [[H1961]] my people: [[H5971]] and I will dwell [[H7931]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee, and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall inherit [[H5157]] Judah [[H3063]] his portion [[H2506]] in [[H5921]] the holy [[H6944]] land, [[H127]] and shall choose [[H977]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] again. [[H3389]]

### 13
Be silent, [[H2013]] O all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he is raised up [[H5782]] out of his holy [[H6944]] habitation. [[H4583]]
