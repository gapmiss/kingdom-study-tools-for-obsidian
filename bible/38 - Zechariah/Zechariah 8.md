### 1
Again the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] came [[H1961]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] I was jealous [[H7065]] for Zion [[H6726]] with great [[H1419]] jealousy, [[H7068]] and I was jealous [[H7065]] for her with great [[H1419]] fury. [[H2534]]

### 3
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] I am returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] Zion, [[H6726]] and will dwell [[H7931]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall be called [[H7121]] a city [[H5892]] of truth; [[H571]] and the mountain [[H2022]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] the holy [[H6944]] mountain. [[H2022]]

### 4
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] There shall yet [[H5750]] old men [[H2205]] and old women [[H2205]] dwell [[H3427]] in the streets [[H7339]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and every man [[H376]] with his staff [[H4938]] in his hand [[H3027]] for very [[H7230]] age. [[H3117]]

### 5
And the streets [[H7339]] of the city [[H5892]] shall be full [[H4390]] of boys [[H3206]] and girls [[H3207]] playing [[H7832]] in the streets [[H7339]] thereof. [[H7339]]

### 6
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] If [[H3588]] it be marvellous [[H6381]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the remnant [[H7611]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] in these [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] should it also [[H1571]] be marvellous [[H6381]] in mine eyes? [[H5869]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 7
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will save [[H3467]] my people [[H5971]] from the east [[H4217]] country, [[H776]] and from the west [[H3996]] country; [[H776]]

### 8
And I will bring [[H935]] them, and they shall dwell [[H7931]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and they shall be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] in truth [[H571]] and in righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 9
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Let your hands [[H3027]] be strong, [[H2388]] ye that hear [[H8085]] in these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] by the mouth [[H6310]] of the prophets, [[H5030]] which [[H834]] in the day [[H3117]] the foundation laid, [[H3245]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] was that the temple [[H1964]] might be built. [[H1129]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] before [[H6440]] these [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] hire [[H7939]] for man, [[H120]] nor [[H369]] any hire [[H7939]] for beast; [[H929]] neither [[H369]] peace [[H7965]] to him that went out [[H3318]] or came in [[H935]] because of [[H4480]] the affliction: [[H6862]] for I set [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] men [[H120]] every one [[H376]] against his neighbour. [[H7453]]

### 11
But now [[H6258]] I [[H589]] not [[H3808]] unto the residue [[H7611]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] as in the former [[H7223]] days, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] the seed [[H2233]] prosperous; [[H7965]] the vine [[H1612]] shall give [[H5414]] her fruit, [[H6529]] and the ground [[H776]] shall give [[H5414]] her increase, [[H2981]] and the heavens [[H8064]] shall give [[H5414]] their dew; [[H2919]]  and I will cause [[H853]] the remnant [[H7611]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] to possess [[H5157]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]]

### 13
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] as [[H834]] ye were [[H1961]] a curse [[H7045]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] O house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] so [[H3651]] will I save [[H3467]] you, and ye shall be [[H1961]] a blessing: [[H1293]] fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] let your hands [[H3027]] be strong. [[H2388]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] As [[H834]] I thought [[H2161]] to punish [[H7489]] you, when your fathers [[H1]] provoked me to wrath, [[H7107]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and I repented [[H5162]] not: [[H5162]]

### 15
So [[H3651]] again [[H7725]] have I thought [[H2161]] in these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] to do well [[H3190]]  unto [[H853]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and to the house [[H1004]] of Judah: [[H3063]] fear [[H3372]] ye not. [[H3372]]

### 16
These [[H428]] the things [[H1697]] that [[H834]] ye shall do; [[H6213]] Speak [[H1696]] ye every man [[H376]] the truth [[H571]] to [[H854]] his neighbour; [[H7453]] execute [[H8199]] the judgment [[H4941]] of truth [[H571]] and peace [[H7965]] in your gates: [[H8179]]

### 17
And let none [[H376]] of you imagine [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] in your hearts [[H3824]] against his neighbour; [[H7453]] and love [[H157]] no [[H408]] false [[H8267]] oath: [[H7621]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] that [[H834]] I hate, [[H8130]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 19
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] The fast [[H6685]] of the fourth [[H7243]] and the fast [[H6685]] of the fifth, [[H2549]] and the fast [[H6685]] of the seventh, [[H7637]] and the fast [[H6685]] of the tenth, [[H6224]] shall be [[H1961]] to the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] joy [[H8342]] and gladness, [[H8057]] and cheerful [[H2896]] feasts; [[H4150]] therefore love [[H157]] the truth [[H571]] and peace. [[H7965]]

### 20
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] yet [[H5750]] that [[H834]] there shall come [[H935]] people, [[H5971]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of many [[H7227]] cities: [[H5892]]

### 21
And the inhabitants [[H3427]] of one [[H259]] shall go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] another, [[H259]] saying, [[H559]] Let us go [[H1980]] speedily [[H1980]] to pray [[H2470]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and to seek [[H1245]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]] I [[H589]] will go [[H1980]] also. [[H1980]]

### 22
Yea, many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] and strong [[H6099]] nations [[H1471]] shall come [[H935]] to seek [[H1245]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and to pray [[H2470]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] shall take hold [[H2388]] out of all [[H3605]] languages [[H3956]] of the nations, [[H1471]] even shall take hold [[H2388]] of the skirt [[H3671]] of him [[H376]] that is a Jew, [[H3064]] saying, [[H559]] We will go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] you: for [[H3588]] we have heard [[H8085]] God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] you. [[H5973]]
