### 1
Hear [[H8085]]  ye [[H853]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] take up [[H5375]] against [[H5921]] you, a lamentation, [[H7015]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
The virgin [[H1330]] of Israel [[H3478]] is fallen; [[H5307]] she shall no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] rise: [[H6965]] she is forsaken [[H5203]] upon [[H5921]] her land; [[H127]] none [[H369]] to raise her up. [[H6965]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] The city [[H5892]] that went out [[H3318]] a thousand [[H505]] shall leave [[H7604]] an hundred, [[H3967]] and that which went forth [[H3318]] an hundred [[H3967]] shall leave [[H7604]] ten, [[H6235]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Seek [[H1875]] ye me, and ye shall live: [[H2421]]

### 5
But seek [[H1875]] not [[H408]] Beth-el, [[H1008]] nor [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into Gilgal, [[H1537]] and pass [[H5674]] not [[H3808]] to Beer-sheba: [[H884]] for [[H3588]] Gilgal [[H1537]] shall surely [[H1540]] go into captivity, [[H1540]] and Beth-el [[H1008]] shall come [[H1961]] to nought. [[H205]]

### 6
Seek [[H1875]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and ye shall live; [[H2421]] lest [[H6435]] he break out [[H6743]] like fire [[H784]] in the house [[H1004]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] and devour [[H398]] and none [[H369]] to quench [[H3518]] in Beth-el. [[H1008]]

### 7
Ye who turn [[H2015]] judgment [[H4941]] to wormwood, [[H3939]] and leave off [[H3240]] righteousness [[H6666]] in the earth, [[H776]]

### 8
that maketh [[H6213]] the seven stars [[H3598]] and Orion, [[H3685]] and turneth [[H2015]] the shadow of death [[H6757]] into the morning, [[H1242]] and maketh the day [[H3117]] dark [[H2821]] with night: [[H3915]] that calleth [[H7121]] for the waters [[H4325]] of the sea, [[H3220]] and poureth them out [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth: [[H776]] The Lord [[H3068]] his name: [[H8034]]

### 9
That strengtheneth [[H1082]] the spoiled [[H7701]] against [[H5921]] the strong, [[H5794]] so that the spoiled [[H7701]] shall come [[H935]] against [[H5921]] the fortress. [[H4013]]

### 10
They hate [[H8130]] him that rebuketh [[H3198]] in the gate, [[H8179]] and they abhor [[H8581]] him that speaketh [[H1696]] uprightly. [[H8549]]

### 11
Forasmuch [[H3282]] therefore [[H3651]] as your treading [[H1318]] upon [[H5921]] the poor, [[H1800]] and ye take [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] him burdens [[H4864]] of wheat: [[H1250]] ye have built [[H1129]] houses [[H1004]] of hewn stone, [[H1496]] but ye shall not [[H3808]] dwell [[H3427]] in them; ye have planted [[H5193]] pleasant [[H2531]] vineyards, [[H3754]] but ye shall not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] of them. [[H3196]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] your manifold [[H7227]] transgressions [[H6588]] and your mighty [[H6099]] sins: [[H2403]] they afflict [[H6887]] the just, [[H6662]] they take [[H3947]] a bribe, [[H3724]] and they turn aside [[H5186]] the poor [[H34]] in the gate [[H8179]]

### 13
Therefore [[H3651]] the prudent [[H7919]] shall keep silence [[H1826]] in that [[H1931]] time; [[H6256]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] an evil [[H7451]] time. [[H6256]]

### 14
Seek [[H1875]] good, [[H2896]] and not [[H408]] evil, [[H7451]] that [[H4616]] ye may live: [[H2421]] and so [[H3651]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] shall be [[H1961]] with [[H854]] you, as [[H834]] ye have spoken. [[H559]]

### 15
Hate [[H8130]] the evil, [[H7451]] and love [[H157]] the good, [[H2896]] and establish [[H3322]] judgment [[H4941]] in the gate: [[H8179]] it may be [[H194]] that the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts [[H6635]] will be gracious [[H2603]] unto the remnant [[H7611]] of Joseph. [[H3130]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the Lord, [[H136]] saith [[H559]] thus; [[H3541]] Wailing [[H4553]] in all [[H3605]] streets; [[H7339]] and they shall say [[H559]] in all [[H3605]] the highways, [[H2351]] Alas! [[H1930]] alas! [[H1930]] and they shall call [[H7121]] the husbandman [[H406]] to [[H413]] mourning, [[H60]] and such as are skilful [[H3045]] of lamentation [[H5092]] to [[H413]] wailing. [[H4553]]

### 17
And in all [[H3605]] vineyards [[H3754]] wailing: [[H4553]] for [[H3588]] I will pass [[H5674]] through [[H7130]] thee, saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
Woe [[H1945]] unto you that desire [[H183]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord! [[H3068]] to what end [[H4100]] it [[H2088]] for you? the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] darkness, [[H2822]] and not [[H3808]] light. [[H216]]

### 19
As if [[H834]] a man [[H376]] did flee [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] a lion, [[H738]] and a bear [[H1677]] met [[H6293]] him; or went [[H935]] into the house, [[H1004]] and leaned [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H7023]] and a serpent [[H5175]] bit [[H5391]] him. [[H5391]]

### 20
not [[H3808]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] darkness, [[H2822]] and not [[H3808]] light? [[H216]] even very dark, [[H651]] and no [[H3808]] brightness [[H5051]] in it? [[H5051]]

### 21
I hate, [[H8130]] I despise [[H3988]] your feast days, [[H2282]] and I will not [[H3808]] smell [[H7306]] in your solemn assemblies. [[H6116]]

### 22
Though [[H3588]] ye offer [[H5927]] me burnt offerings [[H5930]] and your meat offerings, [[H4503]] I will not [[H3808]] accept [[H7521]] neither [[H3808]] will I regard [[H5027]] the peace offerings [[H8002]] of your fat beasts. [[H4806]]

### 23
Take thou away [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] me the noise [[H1995]] of thy songs; [[H7892]] for I will not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] the melody [[H2172]] of thy viols. [[H5035]]

### 24
But let judgment [[H4941]] run down [[H1556]] as waters, [[H4325]] and righteousness [[H6666]] as a mighty [[H386]] stream. [[H5158]]

### 25
Have ye offered [[H5066]] unto me sacrifices [[H2077]] and offerings [[H4503]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 26
But ye have borne [[H5375]] the tabernacle [[H5522]] of your Moloch [[H4432]] and Chiun [[H3594]] your images, [[H6754]] the star [[H3556]] of your god, [[H430]] which [[H834]] ye made [[H6213]] to yourselves. [[H6213]]

### 27
Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity [[H1540]] beyond [[H1973]] Damascus, [[H1834]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] whose name [[H8034]] The God [[H430]] of hosts. [[H6635]]
