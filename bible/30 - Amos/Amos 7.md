### 1
Thus [[H3541]] hath the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] shewed [[H7200]] unto me; and, behold, [[H2009]] he formed [[H3335]] grasshoppers [[H1462]] in the beginning [[H8462]] of the shooting up [[H5927]] of the latter growth; [[H3954]] and, lo, [[H2009]] the latter growth [[H3954]] after [[H310]] the king's [[H4428]] mowings. [[H1488]]

### 2
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H518]] they had made an end [[H3615]] of eating [[H398]] the grass [[H6212]] of the land, [[H776]] then I said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3068]] forgive, [[H5545]] I beseech thee: [[H4994]] by whom [[H4310]] shall Jacob [[H3290]] arise? [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] small. [[H6996]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] repented [[H5162]] for [[H5921]] this: [[H2063]] It shall not [[H3808]] be, [[H1961]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
Thus [[H3541]] hath the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] shewed [[H7200]] unto me: and, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] called [[H7121]] to contend [[H7378]] by fire, [[H784]] and it devoured [[H398]] the great [[H7227]] deep, [[H8415]] and did eat up [[H398]] a part. [[H2506]]

### 5
Then said [[H559]] I, O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] cease, [[H2308]] I beseech thee: [[H4994]] by whom [[H4310]] shall Jacob [[H3290]] arise? [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] small. [[H6996]]

### 6
The Lord [[H3068]] repented [[H5162]] for [[H5921]] this: [[H2063]] This [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] shall not [[H3808]] be, [[H1961]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 7
Thus [[H3541]] he shewed [[H7200]] me: and, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] stood [[H5324]] upon [[H5921]] a wall [[H2346]] by a plumbline, [[H594]] with a plumbline [[H594]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Amos, [[H5986]] what [[H4100]] seest [[H7200]] thou? [[H859]] And I said, [[H559]] A plumbline. [[H594]] Then said [[H559]] the Lord, [[H136]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will set [[H7760]] a plumbline [[H594]] in the midst [[H7130]] of my people [[H5971]] Israel: [[H3478]] I will not [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] pass by [[H5674]] them any more: [[H5674]]

### 9
And the high places [[H1116]] of Isaac [[H3446]] shall be desolate, [[H8074]] and the sanctuaries [[H4720]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall be laid waste; [[H2717]] and I will rise [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 10
Then Amaziah [[H558]] the priest [[H3548]] of Beth-el [[H1008]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Amos [[H5986]] hath conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] thee in the midst [[H7130]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] the land [[H776]] is not able [[H3201]] to bear [[H3557]] all [[H3605]] his words. [[H1697]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] Amos [[H5986]] saith, [[H559]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] shall die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and Israel [[H3478]] shall surely [[H1540]] be led away captive [[H1540]] out of [[H5921]] their own land. [[H127]]

### 12
Also Amaziah [[H558]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Amos, [[H5986]] O thou seer, [[H2374]] go, [[H1980]] flee thee away [[H1272]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and there [[H8033]] eat [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] and prophesy [[H5012]] there: [[H5012]]

### 13
But prophesy [[H5012]] not [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] any more [[H5750]] at Beth-el: [[H1008]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] the king's [[H4428]] chapel, [[H4720]] and it [[H1931]] the king's [[H4467]] court. [[H1004]]

### 14
Then answered [[H6030]] Amos, [[H5986]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Amaziah, [[H558]] I [[H595]] no [[H3808]] prophet, [[H5030]] neither [[H3808]] I [[H595]] a prophet's [[H5030]] son; [[H1121]] but [[H3588]] I [[H595]] an herdman, [[H951]] and a gatherer [[H1103]] of sycomore fruit: [[H8256]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] took [[H3947]] me as I followed [[H310]] the flock, [[H6629]] and the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Go, [[H1980]] prophesy [[H5012]] unto [[H413]] my people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 16
Now [[H6258]] therefore hear [[H8085]] thou the word [[H1697]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] Thou [[H859]] sayest, [[H559]] Prophesy [[H5012]] not [[H3808]] against [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and drop [[H5197]] not [[H3808]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Isaac. [[H3446]]

### 17
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Thy wife [[H802]] shall be an harlot [[H2181]] in the city, [[H5892]] and thy sons [[H1121]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and thy land [[H127]] shall be divided [[H2505]] by line; [[H2256]] and thou [[H859]] shalt die [[H4191]] in [[H5921]] a polluted [[H2931]] land: [[H127]] and Israel [[H3478]] shall surely [[H1540]] go into captivity [[H1540]] forth of [[H5921]] his land.
