### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to them at ease [[H7600]] in Zion, [[H6726]] and trust [[H982]] in the mountain [[H2022]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] named [[H5344]] chief [[H7225]] of the nations, [[H1471]] to whom the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] came! [[H935]]

### 2
Pass [[H5674]] ye unto Calneh, [[H3641]] and see; [[H7200]] and from thence [[H8033]] go [[H1980]] ye to Hamath [[H2574]] the great: [[H7227]] then go down [[H3381]] to Gath [[H1661]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] these [[H428]] kingdoms? [[H4467]] or [[H518]] their border [[H1366]] greater [[H7227]] than your border? [[H1366]]

### 3
Ye that put far away [[H5077]] the evil [[H7451]] day, [[H3117]] and cause the seat [[H7675]] of violence [[H2555]] to come near; [[H5066]]

### 4
That lie [[H7901]] upon [[H5921]] beds [[H4296]] of ivory, [[H8127]] and stretch [[H5628]] themselves upon [[H5921]] their couches, [[H6210]] and eat [[H398]] the lambs [[H3733]] out of the flock, [[H6629]] and the calves [[H5695]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the stall; [[H4770]]

### 5
That chant [[H6527]] to [[H5921]] the sound [[H6310]] of the viol, [[H5035]] invent [[H2803]] to themselves instruments [[H3627]] of musick, [[H7892]] like David; [[H1732]]

### 6
That drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] in bowls, [[H4219]] and anoint [[H4886]] themselves with the chief [[H7225]] ointments: [[H8081]] but they are not [[H3808]] grieved [[H2470]] for [[H5921]] the affliction [[H7667]] of Joseph. [[H3130]]

### 7
Therefore [[H3651]] now [[H6258]] shall they go captive [[H1540]] with the first [[H7218]] that go captive, [[H1540]] and the banquet [[H4797]] of them that stretched [[H5628]] themselves shall be removed. [[H5493]]

### 8
The Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] hath sworn [[H7650]] by himself, [[H5315]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] I [[H595]] abhor [[H8374]] the excellency [[H1347]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and hate [[H8130]] his palaces: [[H759]] therefore will I deliver up [[H5462]] the city [[H5892]] with all that is therein. [[H4393]]

### 9
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] there remain [[H3498]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] in one [[H259]] house, [[H1004]] that they shall die. [[H4191]]

### 10
And a man's uncle [[H1730]] shall take him up, [[H5375]] and he that burneth [[H5635]] him, to bring out [[H3318]] the bones [[H6106]] out of [[H4480]] the house, [[H1004]] and shall say [[H559]] unto him that [[H834]] by the sides [[H3411]] of the house, [[H1004]] yet [[H5750]] with [[H5973]] thee? and he shall say, [[H559]] No. [[H657]] Then shall he say, [[H559]] Hold thy tongue: [[H2013]] for [[H3588]] we may not [[H3808]] make mention [[H2142]] of the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] commandeth, [[H6680]] and he will smite [[H5221]] the great [[H1419]] house [[H1004]] with breaches, [[H7447]] and the little [[H6996]] house [[H1004]] with clefts. [[H1233]]

### 12
Shall horses [[H5483]] run [[H7323]] upon the rock? [[H5553]] will plow [[H2790]] with oxen? [[H1241]] for [[H3588]] ye have turned [[H2015]] judgment [[H4941]] into gall, [[H7219]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of righteousness [[H6666]] into hemlock: [[H3939]]

### 13
Ye which rejoice [[H8055]] in a thing [[H1697]] of nought, [[H3808]] which say, [[H559]] Have we not [[H3808]] taken [[H3947]] to us horns [[H7161]] by our own strength? [[H2392]]

### 14
But, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I will raise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] you a nation, [[H1471]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of hosts; [[H6635]] and they shall afflict [[H3905]] you from the entering in [[H935]] of Hemath [[H2574]] unto [[H5704]] the river [[H5158]] of the wilderness.
