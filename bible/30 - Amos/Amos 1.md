### 1
The words [[H1697]] of Amos, [[H5986]] who [[H834]] was [[H1961]] among the herdmen [[H5349]] of Tekoa, [[H8620]] which [[H834]] he saw [[H2372]] concerning [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in the days [[H3117]] of Uzziah [[H5818]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the days [[H3117]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] two years [[H8141]] before [[H6440]] the earthquake. [[H7494]]

### 2
And he said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] will roar [[H7580]] from Zion, [[H6726]] and utter [[H5414]] his voice [[H6963]] from Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and the habitations [[H4999]] of the shepherds [[H7462]] shall mourn, [[H56]] and the top [[H7218]] of Carmel [[H3760]] shall wither. [[H3001]]

### 3
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] and for [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] thereof; because [[H5921]] they have threshed [[H1758]] Gilead [[H1568]] with threshing instruments [[H2742]] of iron: [[H1270]]

### 4
But I will send [[H7971]] a fire [[H784]] into the house [[H1004]] of Hazael, [[H2371]] which shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] of Ben-hadad. [[H1130]]

### 5
I will break [[H7665]] also the bar [[H1280]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] and cut off [[H3772]] the inhabitant [[H3427]] from the plain [[H1237]] of Aven, [[H206]] and him that holdeth [[H8551]] the sceptre [[H7626]] from the house [[H1004]] of Eden: [[H5730]] and the people [[H5971]] of Syria [[H758]] shall go into captivity [[H1540]] unto Kir, [[H7024]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Gaza, [[H5804]] and for [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] thereof; because [[H5921]] they carried away captive [[H1540]] the whole [[H8003]] captivity, [[H1546]] to deliver up [[H5462]] to Edom: [[H123]]

### 7
But I will send [[H7971]] a fire [[H784]] on the wall [[H2346]] of Gaza, [[H5804]] which shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] thereof: [[H759]]

### 8
And I will cut off [[H3772]] the inhabitant [[H3427]] from Ashdod, [[H795]] and him that holdeth [[H8551]] the sceptre [[H7626]] from Ashkelon, [[H831]] and I will turn [[H7725]] mine hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] Ekron: [[H6138]] and the remnant [[H7611]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] shall perish, [[H6]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 9
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Tyrus, [[H6865]] and for [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] thereof; because [[H5921]] they delivered up [[H5462]] the whole [[H8003]] captivity [[H1546]] to Edom, [[H123]] and remembered [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] the brotherly [[H251]] covenant: [[H1285]]

### 10
But I will send [[H7971]] a fire [[H784]] on the wall [[H2346]] of Tyrus, [[H6865]] which shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] thereof. [[H759]]

### 11
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Edom, [[H123]] and for [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] thereof; because [[H5921]] he did pursue [[H7291]] his brother [[H251]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and did cast off [[H7843]] all pity, [[H7356]] and his anger [[H639]] did tear [[H2963]] perpetually, [[H5703]] and he kept [[H8104]] his wrath [[H5678]] for ever: [[H5331]]

### 12
But I will send [[H7971]] a fire [[H784]] upon Teman, [[H8487]] which shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] of Bozrah. [[H1224]]

### 13
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and for [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] thereof; because [[H5921]] they have ripped up [[H1234]] the women with child [[H2030]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] that [[H4616]] they might enlarge [[H7337]] their border: [[H1366]]

### 14
But I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in the wall [[H2346]] of Rabbah, [[H7237]] and it shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] thereof, with shouting [[H8643]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle, [[H4421]] with a tempest [[H5591]] in the day [[H3117]] of the whirlwind: [[H5492]]

### 15
And their king [[H4428]] shall go [[H1980]] into captivity, [[H1473]] he [[H1931]] and his princes [[H8269]] together, [[H3162]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
