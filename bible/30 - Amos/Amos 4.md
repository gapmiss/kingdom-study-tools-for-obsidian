### 1
Hear [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] ye kine [[H6510]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] that [[H834]] in the mountain [[H2022]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] which oppress [[H6231]] the poor, [[H1800]] which crush [[H7533]] the needy, [[H34]] which say [[H559]] to their masters, [[H113]] Bring, [[H935]] and let us drink. [[H8354]]

### 2
The Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] hath sworn [[H7650]] by his holiness, [[H6944]] that, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] you, that he will take you away [[H5375]] with hooks, [[H6793]] and your posterity [[H319]] with fishhooks. [[H1729]]

### 3
And ye shall go out [[H3318]] at the breaches, [[H6556]] every [[H802]] before [[H5048]] her; and ye shall cast [[H7993]] into the palace, [[H2038]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
Come [[H935]] to Beth-el, [[H1008]] and transgress; [[H6586]] at Gilgal [[H1537]] multiply [[H7235]] transgression; [[H6586]] and bring [[H935]] your sacrifices [[H2077]] every morning, [[H1242]] your tithes [[H4643]] after three [[H7969]] years: [[H3117]]

### 5
And offer [[H6999]] a sacrifice of thanksgiving [[H8426]] with leaven, [[H2557]] and proclaim [[H7121]] publish [[H8085]] the free offerings: [[H5071]] for [[H3588]] this [[H3651]] liketh [[H157]] you, O ye children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]

### 6
And I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] have given [[H5414]] you cleanness [[H5356]] of teeth [[H8127]] in all [[H3605]] your cities, [[H5892]] and want [[H2640]] of bread [[H3899]] in all [[H3605]] your places: [[H4725]] yet have ye not [[H3808]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H5704]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
And also [[H1571]] I [[H595]] have withholden [[H4513]] the rain [[H1653]] from [[H4480]] you, when yet [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] to the harvest: [[H7105]] and I caused it to rain [[H4305]] upon [[H5921]] one [[H259]] city, [[H5892]] and caused it not to rain [[H4305]] upon [[H5921]] another [[H259]] city: [[H5892]] one [[H259]] piece [[H2513]] was rained upon, [[H4305]] and the piece [[H2513]] whereupon [[H834]] it rained [[H4305]] not [[H3808]] withered. [[H3001]]

### 8
So two [[H8147]] three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] wandered [[H5128]] unto [[H413]] one [[H259]] city, [[H5892]] to drink [[H8354]] water; [[H4325]] but they were not [[H3808]] satisfied: [[H7646]] yet have ye not [[H3808]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H5704]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
I have smitten [[H5221]] you with blasting [[H7711]] and mildew: [[H3420]] when your gardens [[H1593]] and your vineyards [[H3754]] and your fig trees [[H8384]] and your olive trees [[H2132]] increased, [[H7235]] the palmerworm [[H1501]] devoured [[H398]] yet have ye not [[H3808]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H5704]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
I have sent [[H7971]] among you the pestilence [[H1698]] after the manner [[H1870]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] your young men [[H970]] have I slain [[H2026]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and have taken away [[H7628]] your horses; [[H5483]] and I have made the stink [[H889]] of your camps [[H4264]] to come up [[H5927]] unto your nostrils: [[H639]] yet have ye not [[H3808]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H5704]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
I have overthrown [[H2015]] of you, as God [[H430]] overthrew [[H4114]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah, [[H6017]] and ye were [[H1961]] as a firebrand [[H181]] plucked out [[H5337]] of the burning: [[H8316]] yet have ye not [[H3808]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H5704]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] will I do [[H6213]] unto thee, O Israel: [[H3478]] because [[H6118]] I will do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] unto thee, prepare [[H3559]] to meet [[H7125]] thy God, [[H430]] O Israel. [[H3478]]

### 13
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] he that formeth [[H3335]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and createth [[H1254]] the wind, [[H7307]] and declareth [[H5046]] unto man [[H120]] what [[H4100]] his thought, [[H7808]] that maketh [[H6213]] the morning [[H7837]] darkness, [[H5890]] and treadeth [[H1869]] upon [[H5921]] the high places [[H1116]] of the earth, [[H776]] The Lord, [[H3068]] The God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] his name.
