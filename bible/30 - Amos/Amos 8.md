### 1
Thus [[H3541]] hath the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] shewed [[H7200]] unto me: and behold [[H2009]] a basket [[H3619]] of summer fruit. [[H7019]]

### 2
And he said, [[H559]] Amos, [[H5986]] what [[H4100]] seest [[H7200]] thou? [[H859]] And I said, [[H559]] A basket [[H3619]] of summer fruit. [[H7019]] Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, The end [[H7093]] is come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] my people [[H5971]] of Israel; [[H3478]] I will not [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] pass by [[H5674]] them any more. [[H5674]]

### 3
And the songs [[H7892]] of the temple [[H1964]] shall be howlings [[H3213]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3068]] many [[H7227]] dead bodies [[H6297]] in every [[H3605]] place; [[H4725]] they shall cast forth [[H7993]] with silence. [[H2013]]

### 4
Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] O ye that swallow [[H7602]] up the needy, [[H34]] even to make the poor [[H6035]] of the land [[H776]] to fail, [[H7673]]

### 5
Saying, [[H559]] When [[H4970]] will the new moon [[H2320]] be gone, [[H5674]] that we may sell [[H7666]] corn? [[H7668]] and the sabbath, [[H7676]] that we may set forth [[H6605]] wheat, [[H1250]] making the ephah [[H374]] small, [[H6994]] and the shekel [[H8255]] great, [[H1431]] and falsifying [[H5791]] the balances [[H3976]] by deceit? [[H4820]]

### 6
That we may buy [[H7069]] the poor [[H1800]] for silver, [[H3701]] and the needy [[H34]] for [[H5668]] a pair of shoes; [[H5275]] and sell [[H7666]] the refuse [[H4651]] of the wheat? [[H1250]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] hath sworn [[H7650]] by the excellency [[H1347]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] Surely [[H518]] I will never [[H5331]] forget [[H7911]] any [[H3605]] of their works. [[H4639]]

### 8
Shall not [[H3808]] the land [[H776]] tremble [[H7264]] for [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] and every one [[H3605]] mourn [[H56]] that dwelleth [[H3427]] therein? and it shall rise up [[H5927]] wholly [[H3605]] as a flood; [[H2975]] and it shall be cast out [[H1644]] and drowned, [[H8257]] as the flood [[H2975]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] that I will cause the sun [[H8121]] to go down [[H935]] at noon, [[H6672]] and I will darken [[H2821]] the earth [[H776]] in the clear [[H216]] day: [[H3117]]

### 10
And I will turn [[H2015]] your feasts [[H2282]] into mourning, [[H60]] and all [[H3605]] your songs [[H7892]] into lamentation; [[H7015]] and I will bring up [[H5927]] sackcloth [[H8242]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] loins, [[H4975]] and baldness [[H7144]] upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] head; [[H7218]] and I will make [[H7760]] it as the mourning [[H60]] of an only [[H3173]] and the end [[H319]] thereof as a bitter [[H4751]] day. [[H3117]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] that I will send [[H7971]] a famine [[H7458]] in the land, [[H776]] not [[H3808]] a famine [[H7458]] of bread, [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] a thirst [[H6772]] for water, [[H4325]] but [[H3588]] of hearing [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 12
And they shall wander [[H5128]] from sea [[H3220]] to [[H5704]] sea, [[H3220]] and from the north [[H6828]] even to [[H5704]] the east, [[H4217]] they shall run to and fro [[H7751]] to seek [[H1245]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and shall not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]]

### 13
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall the fair [[H3303]] virgins [[H1330]] and young men [[H970]] faint [[H5968]] for thirst. [[H6772]]

### 14
They that swear [[H7650]] by the sin [[H819]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] and say, [[H559]] Thy god, [[H430]] O Dan, [[H1835]] liveth; [[H2416]] and, The manner [[H1870]] of Beer-sheba [[H884]] liveth; [[H2416]] even they shall fall, [[H5307]] and never [[H3808]] rise up [[H6965]] again. [[H6965]]
