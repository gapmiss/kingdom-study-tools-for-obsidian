### 1
Hear [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] you, O children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] against [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] family [[H4940]] which [[H834]] I brought up [[H5927]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
You only [[H7535]] have I known [[H3045]] of all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the earth: [[H127]] therefore [[H5921]] I will punish [[H6485]]  you [[H853]] for all [[H3605]] your iniquities. [[H5771]]

### 3
Can two [[H8147]] walk [[H1980]] together, [[H3162]] except [[H1115]] they be agreed? [[H3259]]

### 4
Will a lion [[H738]] roar [[H7580]] in the forest, [[H3293]] when he hath no [[H369]] prey? [[H2964]] will a young lion [[H3715]] cry [[H5414]]  out [[H6963]] of his den, [[H4585]] if [[H518]] he have taken [[H3920]] nothing? [[H1115]]

### 5
Can a bird [[H6833]] fall [[H5307]] in [[H5921]] a snare [[H6341]] upon the earth, [[H776]] where no [[H369]] gin [[H4170]] for him? shall take up [[H5927]] a snare [[H6341]] from [[H4480]] the earth, [[H127]] and have taken [[H3920]] nothing at all? [[H3920]]

### 6
Shall a trumpet [[H7782]] be blown [[H8628]] in the city, [[H5892]] and the people [[H5971]] not [[H3808]] be afraid? [[H2729]] shall there be [[H1961]] evil [[H7451]] in a city, [[H5892]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] done [[H6213]]

### 7
Surely [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] will do [[H6213]] nothing, [[H1697]] but [[H3588]] he revealeth [[H1540]] his secret [[H5475]] unto [[H413]] his servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]]

### 8
The lion [[H738]] hath roared, [[H7580]] who [[H4310]] will not [[H3808]] fear? [[H3372]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3068]] hath spoken, [[H1696]] who [[H4310]] can but [[H3808]] prophesy? [[H5012]]

### 9
Publish [[H8085]] in [[H5921]] the palaces [[H759]] at Ashdod, [[H795]] and in [[H5921]] the palaces [[H759]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and say, [[H559]] Assemble yourselves [[H622]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] and behold [[H7200]] the great [[H7227]] tumults [[H4103]] in the midst [[H7130]] thereof, and the oppressed [[H6217]] in the midst [[H8432]] thereof. [[H8432]]

### 10
For they know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] to do [[H6213]] right, [[H5229]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] who store up [[H686]] violence [[H2555]] and robbery [[H7701]] in their palaces. [[H759]]

### 11
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] An adversary [[H6862]] even round about [[H5439]] the land; [[H776]] and he shall bring down [[H3381]] thy strength [[H5797]] from [[H4480]] thee, and thy palaces [[H759]] shall be spoiled. [[H962]]

### 12
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] As [[H834]] the shepherd [[H7462]] taketh out [[H5337]] of the mouth [[H6310]] of the lion [[H738]] two [[H8147]] legs, [[H3767]] or [[H176]] a piece [[H915]] of an ear; [[H241]] so [[H3651]] shall the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] be taken out [[H5337]] that dwell [[H3427]] in Samaria [[H8111]] in the corner [[H6285]] of a bed, [[H4296]] and in Damascus [[H1833]] a couch. [[H6210]]

### 13
Hear [[H8085]] ye, and testify [[H5749]] in the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] the God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]]

### 14
That [[H3588]] in the day [[H3117]] that I shall visit [[H6485]] the transgressions [[H6588]] of Israel [[H3478]] upon [[H5921]] him I will also visit [[H6485]] the altars [[H4196]] of Beth-el: [[H1008]] and the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] shall be cut off, [[H1438]] and fall [[H5307]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 15
And I will smite [[H5221]] the winter [[H2779]] house [[H1004]] with [[H5921]] the summer [[H7019]] house; [[H1004]] and the houses [[H1004]] of ivory [[H8127]] shall perish, [[H6]] and the great [[H7227]] houses [[H1004]] shall have an end, [[H5486]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
