### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and for [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] thereof; because [[H5921]] he burned [[H8313]] the bones [[H6106]] of the king [[H4428]] of Edom [[H123]] into lime: [[H7875]]

### 2
But I will send [[H7971]] a fire [[H784]] upon Moab, [[H4124]] and it shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] of Kerioth: [[H7152]] and Moab [[H4124]] shall die [[H4191]] with tumult, [[H7588]] with shouting, [[H8643]] with the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet: [[H7782]]

### 3
And I will cut off [[H3772]] the judge [[H8199]] from the midst [[H7130]] thereof, and will slay [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] thereof with [[H5973]] him, saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and for [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] thereof; because [[H5921]] they have despised [[H3988]] the law [[H8451]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H2706]] and their lies [[H3577]] caused them to err, [[H8582]] after [[H310]] the which [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] have walked: [[H1980]]

### 5
But I will send [[H7971]] a fire [[H784]] upon Judah, [[H3063]] and it shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 6
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and for [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] thereof; because [[H5921]] they sold [[H4376]] the righteous [[H6662]] for silver, [[H3701]] and the poor [[H34]] for [[H5668]] a pair of shoes; [[H5275]]

### 7
That pant [[H7602]] after [[H5921]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth [[H776]] on the head [[H7218]] of the poor, [[H1800]] and turn aside [[H5186]] the way [[H1870]] of the meek: [[H6035]] and a man [[H376]] and his father [[H1]] will go in [[H3212]] unto [[H413]] the maid, [[H5291]] to [[H4616]] profane [[H2490]] my holy [[H6944]] name: [[H8034]]

### 8
And they lay down [[H5186]] upon [[H5921]] clothes [[H899]] laid to pledge [[H2254]] by [[H681]] every [[H3605]] altar, [[H4196]] and they drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] of the condemned [[H6064]] the house [[H1004]] of their god. [[H430]]

### 9
Yet destroyed [[H8045]] I [[H595]] the Amorite [[H567]] before [[H6440]] them, whose [[H834]] height [[H1363]] like the height [[H1363]] of the cedars, [[H730]] and he [[H1931]] strong [[H2634]] as the oaks; [[H437]] yet I destroyed [[H8045]] his fruit [[H6529]] from above, [[H4605]] and his roots [[H8328]] from beneath. [[H8328]]

### 10
Also I [[H595]] brought you up [[H5927]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and led [[H1980]] you forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] through the wilderness, [[H4057]] to possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] of the Amorite. [[H567]]

### 11
And I raised up [[H6965]] of your sons [[H1121]] for prophets, [[H5030]] and of your young men [[H970]] for Nazarites. [[H5139]] not [[H369]] even [[H637]] thus, [[H2063]] O ye children [[H1121]] of Israel? [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
But ye gave [[H853]] the Nazarites [[H5139]] wine [[H3196]] to drink; [[H8248]] and commanded [[H6680]] the prophets, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]] Prophesy [[H5012]] not. [[H5012]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] am pressed [[H5781]] under [[H8478]] you, as [[H834]] a cart [[H5699]] is pressed [[H5781]] full [[H4392]] of sheaves. [[H5995]]

### 14
Therefore the flight [[H4498]] shall perish [[H6]] from the swift, [[H7031]] and the strong [[H2389]] shall not [[H3808]] strengthen [[H553]] his force, [[H3581]] neither [[H3808]] shall the mighty [[H1368]] deliver [[H4422]] himself: [[H5315]]

### 15
Neither [[H3808]] shall he stand [[H5975]] that handleth [[H8610]] the bow; [[H7198]] and swift [[H7031]] of foot [[H7272]] shall not [[H3808]] deliver [[H4422]] neither [[H3808]] shall he that rideth [[H7392]] the horse [[H5483]] deliver [[H4422]] himself. [[H5315]]

### 16
And courageous [[H533]] among the mighty [[H1368]] shall flee away [[H5127]] naked [[H6174]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
