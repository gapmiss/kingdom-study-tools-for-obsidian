[[Amos 8|←]] • [[Obadiah 1|→]]

### 1
I saw [[H7200]] the Lord [[H136]] standing [[H5324]] upon [[H5921]] the altar: [[H4196]] and he said, [[H559]] Smite [[H5221]] the lintel [[H3730]] of the door, that the posts [[H5592]] may shake: [[H7493]] and cut [[H1214]] them in the head, [[H7218]] all [[H3605]] of them; and I will slay [[H2026]] the last [[H319]] of them with the sword: [[H2719]] he that fleeth [[H5127]] of them shall not [[H3808]] flee away, [[H5127]] and he that escapeth [[H6412]] of them shall not [[H3808]] be delivered. [[H4422]]

### 2
Though [[H518]] they dig [[H2864]] into hell, [[H7585]] thence [[H8033]] shall mine hand [[H3027]] take [[H3947]] them; though [[H518]] they climb up [[H5927]] to heaven, [[H8064]] thence [[H8033]] will I bring them down: [[H3381]]

### 3
And though [[H518]] they hide themselves [[H2244]] in the top [[H7218]] of Carmel, [[H3760]] I will search [[H2664]] and take out [[H3947]] them thence; [[H8033]] and though [[H518]] they be hid [[H5641]] from [[H5048]] my sight [[H5869]] in the bottom [[H7172]] of the sea, [[H3220]] thence [[H8033]] will I command [[H6680]] the serpent, [[H5175]] and he shall bite [[H5391]] them: [[H5391]]

### 4
And though [[H518]] they go [[H1980]] into captivity [[H7628]] before [[H6440]] their enemies, [[H341]] thence [[H8033]] will I command [[H6680]] the sword, [[H2719]] and it shall slay [[H2026]] them: and I will set [[H7760]] mine eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] them for evil, [[H7451]] and not [[H3808]] for good. [[H2896]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts [[H6635]] he that toucheth [[H5060]] the land, [[H776]] and it shall melt, [[H4127]] and all [[H3605]] that dwell [[H3427]] therein shall mourn: [[H56]] and it shall rise up [[H5927]] wholly [[H3605]] like a flood; [[H2975]] and shall be drowned, [[H8257]] as the flood [[H2975]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 6
he that buildeth [[H1129]] his stories [[H4609]] in the heaven, [[H8064]] and hath founded [[H3245]] his troop [[H92]] in [[H5921]] the earth; [[H776]] he that calleth [[H7121]] for the waters [[H4325]] of the sea, [[H3220]] and poureth them out [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth: [[H776]] The Lord [[H3068]] his name. [[H8034]]

### 7
ye [[H859]] not [[H3808]] as children [[H1121]] of the Ethiopians [[H3569]] unto me, O children [[H1121]] of Israel? [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]] Have not [[H3808]] I brought up [[H5927]] Israel [[H3478]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt? [[H4714]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] from Caphtor, [[H3731]] and the Syrians [[H758]] from Kir? [[H7024]]

### 8
Behold, [[H2009]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] upon the sinful [[H2400]] kingdom, [[H4467]] and I will destroy [[H8045]] it from off [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth; [[H127]] saving [[H657]] that [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] utterly [[H8045]] destroy [[H8045]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will command, [[H6680]] and I will sift [[H5128]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] among all [[H3605]] nations, [[H1471]] like as [[H834]] is sifted [[H5128]] in a sieve, [[H3531]] yet shall not [[H3808]] the least grain [[H6872]] fall [[H5307]] upon the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] the sinners [[H2400]] of my people [[H5971]] shall die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] which say, [[H559]] The evil [[H7451]] shall not [[H3808]] overtake [[H5066]] nor prevent [[H6923]] us. [[H6923]]

### 11
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] will I raise up [[H6965]] the tabernacle [[H5521]] of David [[H1732]] that is fallen, [[H5307]] and close up [[H1443]] the breaches [[H6556]] thereof; and I will raise up [[H6965]] his ruins, [[H2034]] and I will build [[H1129]] it as in the days [[H3117]] of old: [[H5769]]

### 12
That [[H4616]] they may possess [[H3423]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Edom, [[H123]] and of all [[H3605]] the heathen, [[H1471]] which [[H834]] are called by [[H7121]] my name, [[H8034]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] that doeth [[H6213]] this. [[H6213]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that the plowman [[H2790]] shall overtake [[H5066]] the reaper, [[H7114]] and the treader [[H1869]] of grapes [[H6025]] him that soweth [[H4900]] seed; [[H2233]] and the mountains [[H2022]] shall drop [[H5197]] sweet wine, [[H6071]] and all [[H3605]] the hills [[H1389]] shall melt. [[H4127]]

### 14
And I will bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of my people [[H5971]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they shall build [[H1129]] the waste [[H8074]] cities, [[H5892]] and inhabit [[H3427]] and they shall plant [[H5193]] vineyards, [[H3754]] and drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] thereof; they shall also make [[H6213]] gardens, [[H1593]] and eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of them. [[H6529]]

### 15
And I will plant [[H5193]] them upon [[H5921]] their land, [[H127]] and they shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be pulled up [[H5428]] out of [[H5921]] their land [[H127]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] them, saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]
