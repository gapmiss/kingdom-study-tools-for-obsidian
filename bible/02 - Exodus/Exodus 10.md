### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have hardened [[H3513]] his heart, [[H3820]] and the heart [[H3820]] of his servants, [[H5650]] that [[H4616]] I might shew [[H7896]] these [[H428]] my signs [[H226]] before [[H7130]] him: [[H7130]]

### 2
And that [[H4616]] thou mayest tell [[H5608]] in the ears [[H241]] of thy son, [[H1121]] and of thy son's [[H1121]] son, [[H1121]] what things [[H834]] I have wrought [[H5953]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and my signs [[H226]] which [[H834]] I have done [[H7760]] among them; that ye may know [[H3045]] how that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]] How long [[H4970]] wilt thou refuse [[H3985]] to humble thyself [[H6031]] before [[H6440]] me? let my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may serve [[H5647]] me. [[H5647]]

### 4
Else, [[H3588]] if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] refuse [[H3986]]  to let [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] behold, [[H2005]] to morrow [[H4279]] will I bring [[H935]] the locusts [[H697]] into thy coast: [[H1366]]

### 5
And they shall cover [[H3680]] the face [[H5869]] of the earth, [[H776]] that one cannot [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to see [[H7200]] the earth: [[H776]] and they shall eat [[H398]] the residue [[H3499]] of that which is escaped, [[H6413]] which remaineth [[H7604]] unto you from [[H4480]] the hail, [[H1259]] and shall eat [[H398]] every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] which groweth [[H6779]] for you out of [[H4480]] the field: [[H7704]]

### 6
And they shall fill [[H4390]] thy houses, [[H1004]] and the houses [[H1004]] of all [[H3605]] thy servants, [[H5650]] and the houses [[H1004]] of all [[H3605]] the Egyptians; [[H4714]] which [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] thy fathers, [[H1]] nor thy fathers' [[H1]] fathers [[H1]] have seen, [[H7200]] since the day [[H3117]] that they were [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H127]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] And he turned [[H6437]] himself, and went out [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 7
And Pharaoh's [[H6547]] servants [[H5650]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, How long [[H4970]] shall this man [[H2088]] be [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]]  unto us? let [[H853]] the men [[H376]] go, [[H7971]] that they may serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God: [[H430]] knowest [[H3045]] thou not yet [[H2962]] that [[H3588]] Egypt [[H4714]] is destroyed? [[H6]]

### 8
And [[H853]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] were brought again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] and he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Go, [[H1980]] serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]] who [[H4310]] they that shall go? [[H1980]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] We will go [[H1980]] with our young [[H5288]] and with our old, [[H2205]] with our sons [[H1121]] and with our daughters, [[H1323]] with our flocks [[H6629]] and with our herds [[H1241]] will we go; [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] we a feast [[H2282]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Let the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] so [[H3651]] with [[H5973]] you, as [[H834]] I will let you go, [[H7971]] and your little ones: [[H2945]] look [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] before [[H6440]] you. [[H5048]]

### 11
Not [[H3808]] so: [[H3651]] go [[H1980]] now [[H4994]] ye men, [[H1397]] and serve [[H5647]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] that ye [[H859]] did desire. [[H1245]] And they were driven out [[H1644]] from [[H853]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] presence. [[H6440]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Stretch out [[H5186]] thine hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] for the locusts, [[H697]] that they may come up [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and eat [[H398]] every [[H3605]] herb [[H6212]] of the land, [[H776]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the hail [[H1259]] hath left. [[H7604]]

### 13
And Moses [[H4872]] stretched forth [[H5186]] his rod [[H4294]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and the Lord [[H3068]] brought [[H5090]] an east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] upon the land [[H776]] all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and all [[H3605]] night; [[H3915]] when it was [[H1961]] morning, [[H1242]] the east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] brought [[H5375]] the locusts. [[H697]]

### 14
And the locusts [[H697]] went up [[H5927]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and rested [[H5117]] in all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] very [[H3966]] grievous [[H3515]] before [[H6440]] them there were [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] such [[H3651]] locusts [[H697]] as they, neither [[H3808]] after [[H310]] them shall be [[H1961]] such. [[H3651]]

### 15
For they covered [[H3680]] the face [[H5869]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] so that the land [[H776]] was darkened; [[H2821]] and they did eat [[H398]] every [[H3605]] herb [[H6212]] of the land, [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] the fruit [[H6529]] of the trees [[H6086]] which [[H834]] the hail [[H1259]] had left: [[H3498]] and there remained [[H3498]] not [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] green thing [[H3418]] in the trees, [[H6086]] or in the herbs [[H6212]] of the field, [[H7704]] through all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 16
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] called [[H7121]] for Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] in haste; [[H4116]] and he said, [[H559]] I have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and against you. [[H430]]

### 17
Now [[H6258]] therefore forgive, [[H5375]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] my sin [[H2403]] only [[H389]] this once, [[H6471]] and intreat [[H6279]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] that he may take away [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] me this [[H2088]] death [[H4194]] only. [[H7535]]

### 18
And he went out [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and intreated [[H6279]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 19
And the Lord [[H3068]] turned [[H2015]] a mighty [[H3966]] strong [[H2389]] west [[H3220]] wind, [[H7307]] which took away [[H5375]] the locusts, [[H697]] and cast [[H8628]] them into the Red [[H5488]] sea; [[H3220]] there remained [[H7604]] not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] locust [[H697]] in all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 20
But the Lord [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] so that he would not [[H3808]]  let [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] go. [[H7971]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Stretch out [[H5186]] thine hand [[H3027]] toward [[H5921]] heaven, [[H8064]] that there may be [[H1961]] darkness [[H2822]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] even darkness [[H2822]] may be felt. [[H4959]]

### 22
And Moses [[H4872]] stretched forth [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] toward [[H5921]] heaven; [[H8064]] and there was [[H1961]] a thick [[H653]] darkness [[H2822]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] three [[H7969]] days: [[H3117]]

### 23
They saw [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] one [[H376]] another, [[H251]] neither [[H3808]] rose [[H6965]] any [[H376]] from his place [[H8478]] for three [[H7969]] days: [[H3117]] but all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] had [[H1961]] light [[H216]] in their dwellings. [[H4186]]

### 24
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] ye, serve [[H5647]] the Lord; [[H3068]] only [[H7535]] let your flocks [[H6629]] and your herds [[H1241]] be stayed: [[H3322]] let your little ones [[H2945]] also [[H1571]] go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] you. [[H5973]]

### 25
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] must give [[H5414]] us [[H3027]] also [[H1571]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and burnt offerings, [[H5930]] that we may sacrifice [[H6213]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 26
Our cattle [[H4735]] also [[H1571]] shall go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] us; there shall not [[H3808]] an hoof [[H6541]] be left behind; [[H7604]] for [[H3588]] thereof [[H4480]] must we take [[H3947]] to serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] and we [[H587]] know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] with what [[H4100]] we must serve [[H5647]] the Lord, [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] we come [[H935]] thither. [[H8033]]

### 27
But the Lord [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] and he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] let them go. [[H7971]]

### 28
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto him, Get [[H1980]] thee from [[H5921]] me, take heed [[H8104]] to thyself, see [[H7200]] my face [[H6440]] no [[H408]] more; [[H3254]] for [[H3588]] in day [[H3117]] thou seest [[H7200]] my face [[H6440]] thou shalt die. [[H4191]]

### 29
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] Thou hast spoken [[H1696]] well, [[H3651]] I will see [[H7200]] thy face [[H6440]] again [[H3254]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]]
