### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] See, [[H7200]] I have made [[H5414]] thee a god [[H430]] to Pharaoh: [[H6547]] and Aaron [[H175]] thy brother [[H251]] shall be [[H1961]] thy prophet. [[H5030]]

### 2
Thou [[H859]] shalt speak [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I command [[H6680]] thee: and Aaron [[H175]] thy brother [[H251]] shall speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] that he send [[H7971]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of his land. [[H776]]

### 3
And I [[H589]] will harden [[H7185]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] and multiply [[H7235]] my signs [[H226]] and my wonders [[H4159]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 4
But Pharaoh [[H6547]] shall not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] you, that I may lay [[H5414]] my hand [[H3027]] upon Egypt, [[H4714]] and bring forth [[H3318]] mine armies, [[H6635]] my people [[H5971]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by great [[H1419]] judgments. [[H8201]]

### 5
And the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I stretch forth [[H5186]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] Egypt, [[H4714]] and bring out [[H3318]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] from among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 6
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] them, so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] they. [[H6213]]

### 7
And Moses [[H4872]] fourscore [[H8084]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] and Aaron [[H175]] fourscore [[H8084]] and three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] when they spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] saying, [[H559]]

### 9
When [[H3588]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] shall speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you, saying, [[H559]] Shew [[H5414]] a miracle [[H4159]] for you: then thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Take [[H3947]] thy rod, [[H4294]] and cast [[H7993]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] it shall become [[H1961]] a serpent. [[H8577]]

### 10
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and they did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded: [[H6680]] and Aaron [[H175]] cast down [[H7993]] his rod [[H4294]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and before [[H6440]] his servants, [[H5650]] and it became [[H1961]] a serpent. [[H8577]]

### 11
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] also [[H1571]] called [[H7121]] the wise men [[H2450]] and the sorcerers: [[H3784]] now the magicians [[H2748]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] did [[H6213]] in like manner [[H3651]] with their enchantments. [[H3858]]

### 12
For they cast down [[H7993]] every man [[H376]] his rod, [[H4294]] and they became [[H1961]] serpents: [[H8577]] but Aaron's [[H175]] rod [[H4294]] swallowed up [[H1104]] their rods. [[H4294]]

### 13
And he hardened [[H2388]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] that he hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] them; as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said. [[H1696]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] hardened, [[H3515]] he refuseth [[H3985]] to let the people [[H5971]] go. [[H7971]]

### 15
Get [[H1980]] thee unto [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] in the morning; [[H1242]] lo, [[H2009]] he goeth out [[H3318]] unto the water; [[H4325]] and thou shalt stand [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] the river's [[H2975]] brink [[H8193]] against he come; [[H7125]] and the rod [[H4294]] which [[H834]] was turned [[H2015]] to a serpent [[H5175]] shalt thou take [[H3947]] in thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 16
And thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of the Hebrews [[H5680]] hath sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]]  Let [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may serve [[H5647]] me in the wilderness: [[H4057]] and, behold, [[H2009]] hitherto [[H3541]] thou wouldest not [[H3808]] hear. [[H8085]]

### 17
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] In this [[H2063]] thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord: [[H3068]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will smite [[H5221]] with the rod [[H4294]] that [[H834]] in mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] which [[H834]] in the river, [[H2975]] and they shall be turned [[H2015]] to blood. [[H1818]]

### 18
And the fish [[H1710]] that [[H834]] in the river [[H2975]] shall die, [[H4191]] and the river [[H2975]] shall stink; [[H887]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall lothe [[H3811]] to drink [[H8354]] of the water [[H4325]] of [[H4480]] the river. [[H2975]]

### 19
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Take [[H3947]] thy rod, [[H4294]] and stretch out [[H5186]] thine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] upon [[H5921]] their streams, [[H5104]] upon [[H5921]] their rivers, [[H2975]] and upon [[H5921]] their ponds, [[H98]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their pools [[H4723]] of water, [[H4325]] that they may become [[H1961]] blood; [[H1818]] and there may be [[H1961]] blood [[H1818]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] both in wood, [[H6086]] and in stone. [[H68]]

### 20
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] did [[H6213]] so, [[H3651]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded; [[H6680]] and he lifted up [[H7311]] the rod, [[H4294]] and smote [[H5221]] the waters [[H4325]] that [[H834]] in the river, [[H2975]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and in the sight [[H5869]] of his servants; [[H5650]] and all [[H3605]] the waters [[H4325]] that [[H834]] in the river [[H2975]] were turned [[H2015]] to blood. [[H1818]]

### 21
And the fish [[H1710]] that [[H834]] in the river [[H2975]] died; [[H4191]] and the river [[H2975]] stank, [[H887]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] of the water [[H4325]] of [[H4480]] the river; [[H2975]] and there was [[H1961]] blood [[H1818]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 22
And the magicians [[H2748]] of Egypt [[H4714]] did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] with their enchantments: [[H3909]] and Pharaoh's [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] was hardened, [[H2388]] neither [[H3808]] did he hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] them; as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said. [[H1696]]

### 23
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] turned [[H6437]] and went [[H935]] into [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] neither [[H3808]] did he set [[H7896]] his heart [[H3820]] to this [[H2063]] also. [[H1571]]

### 24
And all [[H3605]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] digged [[H2658]] round about [[H5439]] the river [[H2975]] for water [[H4325]] to drink; [[H8354]] for [[H3588]] they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] of the water [[H4325]] of the river. [[H2975]]

### 25
And seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] were fulfilled, [[H4390]] after [[H310]] that the Lord [[H3068]] had smitten [[H5221]] the river. [[H2975]]
