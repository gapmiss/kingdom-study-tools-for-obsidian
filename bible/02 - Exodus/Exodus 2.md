### 1
And there went [[H1980]] a man [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Levi, [[H3878]] and took [[H3947]]  a [[H853]] daughter [[H1323]] of Levi. [[H3878]]

### 2
And the woman [[H802]] conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] a son: [[H1121]] and when she saw [[H7200]] him that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] goodly [[H2896]] she hid [[H6845]] him three [[H7969]] months. [[H3391]]

### 3
And when she could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] hide [[H6845]] him, she took [[H3947]] for him an ark [[H8392]] of bulrushes, [[H1573]] and daubed [[H2560]] it with slime [[H2564]] and with pitch, [[H2203]] and put [[H7760]] the child [[H3206]] therein; and she laid [[H7760]] in the flags [[H5488]] by [[H5921]] the river's [[H2975]] brink. [[H8193]]

### 4
And his sister [[H269]] stood [[H3320]] afar off, [[H7350]] to wit [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] would be done [[H6213]] to him. [[H6213]]

### 5
And the daughter [[H1323]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] came down [[H3381]] to wash [[H7364]] at [[H5921]] the river; [[H2975]] and her maidens [[H5291]] walked along [[H1980]] by [[H5921]] the river's [[H2975]] side; [[H3027]] and when she saw [[H7200]] the ark [[H8392]] among [[H8432]] the flags, [[H5488]] she sent [[H7971]] her maid [[H519]] to fetch [[H3947]] it. [[H3947]]

### 6
And when she had opened [[H6605]] she saw [[H7200]] the child: [[H3206]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the babe [[H5288]] wept. [[H1058]] And she had compassion [[H2550]] on [[H5921]] him, and said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] of the Hebrews' [[H5680]] children. [[H3206]]

### 7
Then said [[H559]] his sister [[H269]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] daughter, [[H1323]] Shall I go [[H1980]] and call [[H7121]] to thee a nurse [[H3243]] of [[H4480]] the Hebrew [[H5680]] women, [[H802]] that she may nurse [[H3243]] the child [[H3206]] for thee? [[H3206]]

### 8
And Pharaoh's [[H6547]] daughter [[H1323]] said [[H559]] to her, Go. [[H1980]] And the maid [[H5959]] went [[H1980]] and called [[H7121]] the child's [[H3206]] mother. [[H517]]

### 9
And Pharaoh's [[H6547]] daughter [[H1323]] said [[H559]] unto her, Take [[H1980]] this child [[H3206]] away, and nurse [[H3243]] it for me, and I [[H589]] will give [[H5414]] thy wages. [[H7939]] And the woman [[H802]] took [[H3947]] the child, [[H3206]] and nursed [[H5134]] it. [[H5134]]

### 10
And the child [[H3206]] grew, [[H1431]] and she brought [[H935]] him unto Pharaoh's [[H6547]] daughter, [[H1323]] and he became [[H1961]] her son. [[H1121]] And she called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Moses: [[H4872]] and she said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] I drew [[H4871]] him out of [[H4480]] the water. [[H4325]]

### 11
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] when Moses [[H4872]] was grown, [[H1431]] that he went out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] and looked [[H7200]] on their burdens: [[H5450]] and he spied [[H7200]] an Egyptian [[H4713]] smiting [[H5221]] an Hebrew, [[H5680]] one of his brethren. [[H251]]

### 12
And he looked [[H6437]] this way [[H3541]] and that way, [[H3541]] and when he saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] no [[H369]] man, [[H376]] he slew [[H5221]] the Egyptian, [[H4713]] and hid [[H2934]] him in the sand. [[H2344]]

### 13
And when he went out [[H3318]] the second [[H8145]] day, [[H3117]] behold, [[H2009]] two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] of the Hebrews [[H5680]] strove together: [[H5327]] and he said [[H559]] to him that did the wrong, [[H7563]] Wherefore [[H4100]] smitest [[H5221]] thou thy fellow? [[H7453]]

### 14
And he said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] made [[H7760]] thee [[H376]] a prince [[H8269]] and a judge [[H8199]] over [[H5921]] us? intendest [[H559]] thou [[H859]] to kill [[H2026]] me, as [[H834]] thou killedst [[H2026]] the Egyptian? [[H4713]] And Moses [[H4872]] feared, [[H3372]] and said, [[H559]] Surely [[H403]] this thing [[H1697]] is known. [[H3045]]

### 15
Now when Pharaoh [[H6547]] heard [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] he sought [[H1245]] to slay [[H2026]] Moses. [[H4872]] But Moses [[H4872]] fled [[H1272]] from the face [[H6440]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Midian: [[H4080]] and he sat down [[H3427]] by [[H5921]] a well. [[H875]]

### 16
Now the priest [[H3548]] of Midian [[H4080]] had seven [[H7651]] daughters: [[H1323]] and they came [[H935]] and drew [[H1802]] and filled [[H4390]] the troughs [[H7298]] to water [[H8248]] their father's [[H1]] flock. [[H6629]]

### 17
And the shepherds [[H7462]] came [[H935]] and drove them away: [[H1644]] but Moses [[H4872]] stood up [[H6965]] and helped [[H3467]] them, and watered [[H8248]] their flock. [[H6629]]

### 18
And when they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Reuel [[H7467]] their father, [[H1]] he said, [[H559]] How [[H4069]] ye are come [[H935]] so soon [[H4116]] to day? [[H3117]]

### 19
And they said, [[H559]] An Egyptian [[H4713]] delivered [[H5337]] us out of the hand [[H3027]] of the shepherds, [[H7462]] and also [[H1571]] drew [[H1802]] enough [[H1802]] for us, and watered [[H8248]] the flock. [[H6629]]

### 20
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his daughters, [[H1323]] And where [[H346]] he? why [[H4100]] it [[H2088]] ye have left [[H5800]] the man? [[H376]] call [[H7121]] him, that he may eat [[H398]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 21
And Moses [[H4872]] was content [[H2974]] to dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] the man: [[H376]] and he gave [[H5414]] Moses [[H4872]] Zipporah [[H6855]] his daughter. [[H1323]]

### 22
And she bare [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and he called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Gershom: [[H1647]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] I have been [[H1961]] a stranger [[H1616]] in a strange [[H5237]] land. [[H776]]

### 23
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in process [[H1992]] of time, [[H3117]] that the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] died: [[H4191]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] sighed [[H584]] by reason of [[H4480]] the bondage, [[H5656]] and they cried, [[H2199]] and their cry [[H7775]] came up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] God [[H430]] by reason of [[H4480]] the bondage. [[H5656]]

### 24
And God [[H430]] heard [[H8085]] their groaning, [[H5009]] and God [[H430]] remembered [[H2142]] his covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Abraham, [[H85]] with [[H854]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and with [[H854]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 25
And God [[H430]] looked upon [[H7200]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and God [[H430]] had respect [[H3045]] unto [[H3045]]
