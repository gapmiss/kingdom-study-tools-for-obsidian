### 1
In the third [[H7992]] month, [[H2320]] when the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were gone forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the same [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] came [[H935]] they the wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai. [[H5514]]

### 2
For they were departed [[H5265]] from Rephidim, [[H7508]] and were come [[H935]] the desert [[H4057]] of Sinai, [[H5514]] and had pitched [[H2583]] in the wilderness; [[H4057]] and there [[H8033]] Israel [[H3478]] camped [[H2583]] before [[H5048]] the mount. [[H2022]]

### 3
And Moses [[H4872]] went up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] and the Lord [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] him out of [[H4480]] the mountain, [[H2022]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] shalt thou say [[H559]] to the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and tell [[H5046]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]]

### 4
Ye [[H859]] have seen [[H7200]] what [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] unto the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and I bare [[H5375]] you on [[H5921]] eagles' [[H5404]] wings, [[H3671]] and brought [[H935]] you unto [[H413]] myself. [[H413]]

### 5
Now [[H6258]] therefore, if [[H518]] ye will obey [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] indeed, [[H8085]] and keep [[H8104]] my covenant, [[H1285]] then ye shall be [[H1961]] a peculiar treasure [[H5459]] unto me above all [[H3605]] people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] mine: [[H776]]

### 6
And ye [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] unto me a kingdom [[H4467]] of priests, [[H3548]] and an holy [[H6918]] nation. [[H1471]] These [[H428]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thou shalt speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And Moses [[H4872]] came [[H935]] and called [[H7121]] for the elders [[H2205]] of the people, [[H5971]] and laid [[H7760]] before their faces [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H6680]]

### 8
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] answered [[H6030]] together, [[H3162]] and said, [[H559]] All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] we will do. [[H6213]] And Moses [[H4872]] returned [[H7725]] the words [[H1697]] of the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee in a thick [[H5645]] cloud, [[H6051]] that [[H5668]] the people [[H5971]] may hear [[H8085]] when I speak [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] thee, and believe [[H539]] thee for ever. [[H5769]] And Moses [[H4872]] told [[H5046]] the words [[H1697]] of the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] and sanctify [[H6942]] them to day [[H3117]] and to morrow, [[H4279]] and let them wash [[H3526]] their clothes, [[H8071]]

### 11
And be [[H1961]] ready [[H3559]] against the third [[H7992]] day: [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] will come down [[H3381]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] upon [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Sinai. [[H5514]]

### 12
And thou shalt set bounds [[H1379]] unto the people [[H5971]] round about, [[H5439]] saying, [[H559]] Take heed [[H8104]] to yourselves, go up [[H5927]] into the mount, [[H2022]] or touch [[H5060]] the border [[H7097]] of it: whosoever [[H3605]] toucheth [[H5060]] the mount [[H2022]] shall be surely [[H4191]] put to death: [[H4191]]

### 13
There shall not [[H3808]] an hand [[H3027]] touch [[H5060]] it, but [[H3588]] he shall surely [[H5619]] be stoned, [[H5619]] or [[H176]] shot [[H3384]] through; [[H3384]] whether [[H518]] beast [[H929]] or [[H518]] man, [[H376]] it shall not [[H3808]] live: [[H2421]] when the trumpet [[H3104]] soundeth long, [[H4900]] they [[H1992]] shall come up [[H5927]] to the mount. [[H2022]]

### 14
And Moses [[H4872]] went down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mount [[H2022]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] and sanctified [[H6942]] the people; [[H5971]] and they washed [[H3526]] their clothes. [[H8071]]

### 15
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Be [[H1961]] ready [[H3559]] against the third [[H7969]] day: [[H3117]] come [[H5066]] not [[H408]] at [[H413]] wives. [[H802]]

### 16
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] in the morning, [[H1242]] that there were [[H1961]] thunders [[H6963]] and lightnings, [[H1300]] and a thick [[H3515]] cloud [[H6051]] upon [[H5921]] the mount, [[H2022]] and the voice [[H6963]] of the trumpet [[H7782]] exceeding [[H3966]] loud; [[H2389]] so that all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] in the camp [[H4264]] trembled. [[H2729]]

### 17
And Moses [[H4872]] brought forth [[H3318]] the people [[H5971]] out of [[H4480]] the camp [[H4264]] to meet [[H7125]] with God; [[H430]] and they stood [[H3320]] at the nether part [[H8482]] of the mount. [[H2022]]

### 18
And mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] was altogether [[H3605]] on a smoke, [[H6225]] because [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] descended [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] it in fire: [[H784]] and the smoke [[H6227]] thereof ascended [[H5927]] as the smoke [[H6227]] of a furnace, [[H3536]] and the whole [[H3605]] mount [[H2022]] quaked [[H2729]] greatly. [[H3966]]

### 19
And when [[H1961]] the voice [[H6963]] of the trumpet [[H7782]] sounded long, [[H6963]] and waxed louder [[H2390]] and louder, [[H3966]] Moses [[H4872]] spake, [[H1696]] and God [[H430]] answered [[H6030]] him by a voice. [[H6963]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] came down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]] on [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of the mount: [[H2022]] and the Lord [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] Moses [[H4872]] to [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of the mount; [[H2022]] and Moses [[H4872]] went up. [[H5927]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Go down, [[H3381]] charge [[H5749]] the people, [[H5971]] lest [[H6435]] they break through [[H2040]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] to gaze, [[H7200]] and many [[H7227]] of [[H4480]] them perish. [[H5307]]

### 22
And let the priests [[H3548]] also, [[H1571]] which come near [[H5066]] to [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] sanctify themselves, [[H6942]] lest [[H6435]] the Lord [[H3068]] break forth [[H6555]] upon them. [[H6555]]

### 23
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] The people [[H5971]] cannot [[H3201]] come up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] mount [[H2022]] Sinai: [[H5514]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] chargedst [[H5749]] us, saying, [[H559]] Set bounds [[H1379]] about the mount, [[H2022]] and sanctify [[H6942]] it. [[H6942]]

### 24
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Away, [[H1980]] get thee down, [[H3381]] and thou shalt come up, [[H5927]] thou, [[H859]] and Aaron [[H175]] with [[H5973]] thee: but let not [[H408]] the priests [[H3548]] and the people [[H5971]] break through [[H2040]] to come up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] lest [[H6435]] he break forth [[H6555]] upon them. [[H6555]]

### 25
So Moses [[H4872]] went down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] and spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]
