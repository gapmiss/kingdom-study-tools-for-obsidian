### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Sanctify [[H6942]] unto me all [[H3605]] the firstborn, [[H1060]] whatsoever [[H3605]] openeth [[H6363]] the womb [[H7358]] among the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] of man [[H120]] and of beast: [[H929]] it [[H1931]] mine. [[H1931]]

### 3
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Remember [[H2142]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] in which [[H834]] ye came out [[H3318]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of bondage; [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] by strength [[H2392]] of hand [[H3027]] the Lord [[H3068]] brought you out [[H3318]] from this [[H2088]] there shall no [[H3808]] leavened bread [[H2557]] be eaten. [[H398]]

### 4
This day [[H3117]] came ye out [[H3318]] in the month [[H2320]] Abib. [[H24]]

### 5
And it shall be [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall bring [[H935]] thee into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Hivites, [[H2340]] and the Jebusites, [[H2983]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] thee, a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] that thou shalt keep [[H5647]] this [[H2063]] service [[H5656]] in this [[H2088]] month. [[H2320]]

### 6
Seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] thou shalt eat [[H398]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] and in the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] a feast [[H2282]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
Unleavened bread [[H4682]] shall be eaten [[H398]] seven [[H7651]] days; [[H3117]] and there shall no [[H3808]] leavened bread [[H2557]] be seen [[H7200]] with thee, neither [[H3808]] shall there be leaven [[H7603]] seen [[H7200]] with thee in all [[H3605]] thy quarters. [[H1366]]

### 8
And thou shalt shew [[H5046]] thy son [[H1121]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saying, [[H559]] because of [[H5668]] that [[H2088]] the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] unto me when I came forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
And it shall be [[H1961]] for a sign [[H226]] unto thee upon [[H5921]] thine hand, [[H3027]] and for a memorial [[H2146]] between [[H996]] thine eyes, [[H5869]] that [[H4616]] the Lord's [[H3068]] law [[H8451]] may be [[H1961]] in thy mouth: [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] with a strong [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] brought thee out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 10
Thou shalt therefore keep [[H8104]] this [[H2063]] ordinance [[H2708]] in his season [[H4150]] from year [[H3117]] to year. [[H3117]]

### 11
And it shall be [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall bring [[H935]] thee into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] as [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto thee and to thy fathers, [[H1]] and shall give [[H5414]] it thee, [[H5414]]

### 12
That thou shalt set apart [[H5674]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] that openeth [[H6363]] the matrix, [[H7358]] and every [[H3605]] firstling [[H6363]] that cometh [[H7698]] of a beast [[H929]] which [[H834]] thou hast; [[H1961]] the males [[H2145]] the Lord's. [[H3068]]

### 13
And every [[H3605]] firstling [[H6363]] of an ass [[H2543]] thou shalt redeem [[H6299]] with a lamb; [[H7716]] and if [[H518]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] redeem [[H6299]] it, then thou shalt break his neck: [[H6202]] and all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of man [[H120]] among thy children [[H1121]] shalt thou redeem. [[H6299]]

### 14
And it shall be [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] thy son [[H1121]] asketh [[H7592]] thee in time to come, [[H4279]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] this? [[H2063]] that thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, By strength [[H2392]] of hand [[H3027]] the Lord [[H3068]] brought us out [[H3318]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] from the house [[H1004]] of bondage: [[H5650]]

### 15
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] would hardly [[H7185]] let us go, [[H7971]] that the Lord [[H3068]] slew [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] both the firstborn [[H1060]] of man, [[H120]] and the firstborn [[H1060]] of beast: [[H929]] therefore [[H3651]] I [[H589]] sacrifice [[H2076]] to the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] that openeth [[H6363]] the matrix, [[H7358]] being males; [[H2145]] but all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of my children [[H1121]] I redeem. [[H6299]]

### 16
And it shall be [[H1961]] for a token [[H226]] upon [[H5921]] thine hand, [[H3027]] and for frontlets [[H2903]] between [[H996]] thine eyes: [[H5869]] for [[H3588]] by strength [[H2392]] of hand [[H3027]] the Lord [[H3068]] brought us forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 17
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Pharaoh [[H6547]]  had let [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that God [[H430]] led [[H5148]] them not [[H3808]] the way [[H1870]] of the land [[H776]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] although [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] near; [[H7138]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] Lest peradventure [[H6435]] the people [[H5971]] repent [[H5162]] when they see [[H7200]] war, [[H4421]] and they return [[H7725]] to Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 18
But God [[H430]] led [[H5437]] the people [[H5971]] about, the way [[H1870]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] of the Red [[H5488]] sea: [[H3220]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went up [[H5927]] harnessed [[H2571]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 19
And Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the bones [[H6106]] of Joseph [[H3130]] with [[H5973]] him: for [[H3588]] he had straitly [[H7650]] sworn [[H7650]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] God [[H430]] will surely [[H6485]] visit [[H6485]] you; and ye shall carry up away [[H5927]] my bones [[H6106]] hence [[H2088]] with [[H854]] you. [[H854]]

### 20
And they took their journey [[H5265]] from Succoth, [[H5523]] and encamped [[H2583]] in Etham, [[H864]] in the edge [[H7097]] of the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] went [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] them by day [[H3119]] in a pillar [[H5982]] of a cloud, [[H6051]] to lead [[H5148]] them the way; [[H1870]] and by night [[H3915]] in a pillar [[H5982]] of fire, [[H784]] to give them light; [[H215]] to go [[H1980]] by day [[H3119]] and night: [[H3915]]

### 22
He took not away [[H4185]] the pillar [[H5982]] of the cloud [[H6051]] by day, [[H3119]] nor the pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] by night, [[H3915]] before [[H6440]] the people. [[H5971]]
