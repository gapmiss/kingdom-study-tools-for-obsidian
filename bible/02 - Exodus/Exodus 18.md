### 1
When Jethro, [[H3503]] the priest [[H3548]] of Midian, [[H4080]] Moses' [[H4872]] father in law, [[H2859]] heard [[H8085]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] had done [[H6213]] for Moses, [[H4872]] and for Israel [[H3478]] his people, [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had brought [[H3318]] Israel [[H3478]] out of Egypt; [[H4714]]

### 2
Then Jethro, [[H3503]] Moses' [[H4872]] father in law, [[H2859]] took [[H3947]] Zipporah, [[H6855]] Moses' [[H4872]] wife, [[H802]] after [[H310]] he had sent her back, [[H7964]]

### 3
And her two [[H8147]] sons; [[H1121]] of which [[H834]] the name [[H8034]] of the one [[H259]] Gershom; [[H1647]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] I have been [[H1961]] an alien [[H1616]] in a strange [[H5237]] land: [[H776]]

### 4
And the name [[H8034]] of the other [[H259]] Eliezer; [[H461]] for [[H3588]] the God [[H430]] of my father, [[H1]] mine help, [[H5828]] and delivered [[H5337]] me from the sword [[H2719]] of Pharaoh: [[H6547]]

### 5
And Jethro, [[H3503]] Moses' [[H4872]] father in law, [[H2859]] came [[H935]] with his sons [[H1121]] and his wife [[H802]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] into [[H413]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] where [[H8033]] he [[H1931]] encamped [[H2583]] at the mount [[H2022]] of God: [[H430]]

### 6
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] I [[H589]] thy father in law [[H2859]] Jethro [[H3503]] am come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, and thy wife, [[H802]] and her two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] with [[H5973]] her. [[H5973]]

### 7
And Moses [[H4872]] went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] his father in law, [[H2859]] and did obeisance, [[H7812]] and kissed [[H5401]] him; and they asked [[H7592]] each [[H376]] other [[H7453]] of welfare; [[H7965]] and they came [[H935]] into the tent. [[H168]]

### 8
And Moses [[H4872]] told [[H5608]] his father in law [[H2859]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] unto Pharaoh [[H6547]] and to the Egyptians [[H4714]] for [[H5921]] Israel's [[H3478]] sake, [[H182]] all [[H3605]] the travail [[H8513]] that [[H834]] had come upon [[H4672]] them by the way, [[H1870]] and the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5337]] them. [[H5337]]

### 9
And Jethro [[H3503]] rejoiced [[H2302]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the goodness [[H2896]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] to Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] he had delivered [[H5337]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians. [[H4714]]

### 10
And Jethro [[H3503]] said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] hath delivered [[H5337]] you out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and out of the hand [[H3027]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] who [[H834]] hath delivered [[H5337]] the people [[H5971]] from under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians. [[H4714]]

### 11
Now [[H6258]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] greater [[H1419]] than all [[H3605]] gods: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] in the thing [[H1697]] wherein [[H834]] they dealt proudly [[H2102]] above [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 12
And Jethro, [[H3503]] Moses' [[H4872]] father in law, [[H2859]] took [[H3947]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] and sacrifices [[H2077]] for God: [[H430]] and Aaron [[H175]] came, [[H935]] and all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] with [[H5973]] Moses' [[H4872]] father in law [[H2859]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]]

### 13
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that Moses [[H4872]] sat [[H3427]] to judge [[H8199]] the people: [[H5971]] and the people [[H5971]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] from [[H4480]] the morning [[H1242]] unto [[H5704]] the evening. [[H6153]]

### 14
And when Moses' [[H4872]] father in law [[H2859]] saw [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he [[H1931]] did [[H6213]] to the people, [[H5971]] he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] doest [[H6213]] to the people? [[H5971]] why [[H4069]] sittest [[H3427]] thou [[H859]] thyself alone, [[H905]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] stand [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] thee from [[H4480]] morning [[H1242]] unto [[H5704]] even? [[H6153]]

### 15
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto his father in law, [[H2859]] Because [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me to inquire [[H1875]] of God: [[H430]]

### 16
When [[H3588]] they have [[H1961]] a matter, [[H1697]] they come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me; and I judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] one [[H376]] and another, [[H7453]] and I do make know [[H3045]] the statutes [[H2706]] of God, [[H430]] and his laws. [[H8451]]

### 17
And Moses' [[H4872]] father in law [[H2859]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] doest [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] good. [[H2896]]

### 18
Thou wilt surely [[H5034]] wear away, [[H5034]] both [[H1571]] thou, [[H859]] and [[H1571]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] thee: for [[H3588]] this thing [[H1697]] too heavy [[H3515]] for [[H4480]] thee; thou art not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to perform [[H6213]] it thyself alone. [[H905]]

### 19
Hearken [[H8085]] now [[H6258]] unto my voice, [[H6963]] I will give thee counsel, [[H3289]] and God [[H430]] shall be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee: Be [[H1961]] thou [[H859]] for the people [[H5971]] to God-ward, [[H4136]] that thou [[H859]] mayest bring [[H935]] the causes [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] God: [[H430]]

### 20
And thou shalt teach [[H2094]] them [[H853]] ordinances [[H2706]] and laws, [[H8451]] and shalt shew [[H3045]] them [[H853]] the way [[H1870]] wherein they must walk, [[H1980]] and the work [[H4639]] that [[H834]] they must do. [[H6213]]

### 21
Moreover thou [[H859]] shalt provide [[H2372]] out of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] able [[H2428]] men, [[H376]] such as fear [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] men [[H376]] of truth, [[H571]] hating [[H8130]] covetousness; [[H1215]] and place [[H7760]] over [[H5921]] them, rulers [[H8269]] of thousands, [[H505]] rulers [[H8269]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] rulers [[H8269]] of fifties, [[H2572]] and rulers [[H8269]] of tens: [[H6235]]

### 22
And let them judge [[H8199]] the people [[H5971]] at all [[H3605]] seasons: [[H6256]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] every [[H3605]] great [[H1419]] matter [[H1697]] they shall bring [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, but every [[H3605]] small [[H6996]] matter [[H1697]] they [[H1992]] shall judge: [[H8199]] so shall it be easier [[H7043]] for [[H5921]] thyself, and they shall bear [[H5375]] with [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 23
If [[H518]] thou shalt do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] and God [[H430]] command [[H6680]] thee then thou shalt be able [[H3201]] to endure, [[H5975]] and all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] shall also [[H1571]] go [[H935]] to [[H5921]] their place [[H4725]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 24
So Moses [[H4872]] hearkened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of his father in law, [[H2859]] and did [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had said. [[H559]]

### 25
And Moses [[H4872]] chose [[H977]] able [[H2428]] men [[H582]] out of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and made [[H5414]] them heads [[H7218]] over [[H5921]] the people, [[H5971]] rulers [[H8269]] of thousands, [[H505]] rulers [[H8269]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] rulers [[H8269]] of fifties, [[H2572]] and rulers [[H8269]] of tens. [[H6235]]

### 26
And they judged [[H8199]] the people [[H5971]] at all [[H3605]] seasons: [[H6256]] the hard [[H7186]] causes [[H1697]] they brought [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] but every [[H3605]] small [[H6996]] matter [[H1697]] they judged [[H8199]] themselves. [[H1992]]

### 27
And Moses [[H4872]]  let [[H853]] his father in law [[H2859]] depart; [[H7971]] and he went [[H3212]] his way [[H1980]] into [[H413]] his own land. [[H776]]
