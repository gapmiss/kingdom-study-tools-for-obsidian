### 1
Then [[H227]] sang [[H7891]] Moses [[H4872]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and spake, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]] I will sing [[H7891]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he hath triumphed [[H1342]] gloriously: [[H1342]] the horse [[H5483]] and his rider [[H7392]] hath he thrown [[H7411]] into the sea. [[H3220]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3050]] my strength [[H5797]] and song, [[H2176]] and he is become [[H1961]] my salvation: [[H3444]] he [[H2088]] my God, [[H410]] and I will prepare him an habitation; [[H5115]] my father's [[H1]] God, [[H430]] and I will exalt [[H7311]] him. [[H7311]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] a man [[H376]] of war: [[H4421]] the Lord [[H3068]] his name. [[H8034]]

### 4
Pharaoh's [[H6547]] chariots [[H4818]] and his host [[H2428]] hath he cast [[H3384]] into the sea: [[H3220]] his chosen [[H4005]] captains [[H7991]] also are drowned [[H2883]] in the Red [[H5488]] sea. [[H3220]]

### 5
The depths [[H8415]] have covered [[H3680]] them: they sank [[H3381]] into the bottom [[H4688]] as [[H3644]] a stone. [[H68]]

### 6
Thy right hand, [[H3225]] O Lord, [[H3068]] is become glorious [[H142]] in power: [[H3581]] thy right hand, [[H3225]] O Lord, [[H3068]] hath dashed in pieces [[H7492]] the enemy. [[H341]]

### 7
And in the greatness [[H7230]] of thine excellency [[H1347]] thou hast overthrown [[H2040]] them that rose up against [[H6965]] thee: thou sentest forth [[H7971]] thy wrath, [[H2740]] consumed [[H398]] them as stubble. [[H7179]]

### 8
And with the blast [[H7307]] of thy nostrils [[H639]] the waters [[H4325]] were gathered together, [[H6192]] the floods [[H5140]] stood upright [[H5324]] as [[H3644]] an heap, [[H5067]] the depths [[H8415]] were congealed [[H7087]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 9
The enemy [[H341]] said, [[H559]] I will pursue, [[H7291]] I will overtake, [[H5381]] I will divide [[H2505]] the spoil; [[H7998]] my lust [[H5315]] shall be satisfied [[H4390]] upon them; I will draw [[H7324]] my sword, [[H2719]] my hand [[H3027]] shall destroy [[H3423]] them. [[H3423]]

### 10
Thou didst blow [[H5398]] with thy wind, [[H7307]] the sea [[H3220]] covered [[H3680]] them: they sank [[H6749]] as lead [[H5777]] in the mighty [[H117]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 11
Who [[H4310]] like unto thee, [[H3644]] O Lord, [[H3068]] among the gods? [[H410]] who [[H4310]] like thee, [[H3644]] glorious [[H142]] in holiness, [[H6944]] fearful [[H3372]] praises, [[H8416]] doing [[H6213]] wonders? [[H6382]]

### 12
Thou stretchedst out [[H5186]] thy right hand, [[H3225]] the earth [[H776]] swallowed [[H1104]] them. [[H1104]]

### 13
Thou in thy mercy [[H2617]] hast led forth [[H5148]] the people [[H5971]] which [[H2098]] thou hast redeemed: [[H1350]] thou hast guided [[H5095]] in thy strength [[H5797]] unto [[H413]] thy holy [[H6944]] habitation. [[H5116]]

### 14
The people [[H5971]] shall hear, [[H8085]] be afraid: [[H7264]] sorrow [[H2427]] shall take hold [[H270]] on the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Palestina. [[H6429]]

### 15
Then [[H227]] the dukes [[H441]] of Edom [[H123]] shall be amazed; [[H926]] the mighty men [[H352]] of Moab, [[H4124]] trembling [[H7461]] shall take hold upon [[H270]] them; all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Canaan [[H3667]] shall melt away. [[H4127]]

### 16
Fear [[H367]] and dread [[H6343]] shall fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] them; by the greatness [[H1419]] of thine arm [[H2220]] they shall be still [[H1826]] as a stone; [[H68]] till [[H5704]] thy people [[H5971]] pass over, [[H5674]] O Lord, [[H3068]] till [[H5704]] the people [[H5971]] pass over, [[H5674]] which [[H2098]] thou hast purchased. [[H7069]]

### 17
Thou shalt bring [[H935]] them in, and plant [[H5193]] them in the mountain [[H2022]] of thine inheritance, [[H5159]] the place, [[H4349]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast made [[H6466]] for thee to dwell in, [[H3427]] the Sanctuary, [[H4720]] O Lord, [[H136]] thy hands [[H3027]] have established. [[H3559]]

### 18
The Lord [[H3068]] shall reign [[H4427]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] the horse [[H5483]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] went in [[H935]] with his chariots [[H7393]] and with his horsemen [[H6571]] into the sea, [[H3220]] and the Lord [[H3068]] brought again [[H7725]] the waters [[H4325]] of the sea [[H3220]] upon [[H5921]] them; but the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] on dry [[H3004]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 20
And Miriam [[H4813]] the prophetess, [[H5031]] the sister [[H269]] of Aaron, [[H175]] took [[H3947]] a timbrel [[H8596]] in her hand; [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] the women [[H802]] went out [[H3318]] after [[H310]] her with timbrels [[H8596]] and with dances. [[H4246]]

### 21
And Miriam [[H4813]] answered [[H6030]] them, Sing [[H7891]] ye to the Lord, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he hath triumphed [[H1342]] gloriously; [[H1342]] the horse [[H5483]] and his rider [[H7392]] hath he thrown [[H7411]] into the sea. [[H3220]]

### 22
So Moses [[H4872]] brought [[H5265]] Israel [[H3478]] from the Red [[H5488]] sea, [[H3220]] and they went out [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the wilderness [[H4057]] of Shur; [[H7793]] and they went [[H1980]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] water. [[H4325]]

### 23
And when they came [[H935]] to Marah, [[H4785]] they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] of the waters [[H4325]] of Marah, [[H4785]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] bitter: [[H4751]] therefore [[H3651]] the name [[H8034]] of it was called [[H7121]] Marah. [[H4785]]

### 24
And the people [[H5971]] murmured [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall we drink? [[H8354]]

### 25
And he cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] shewed [[H3384]] him a tree, [[H6086]] when he had cast [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the waters, [[H4325]] the waters [[H4325]] were made sweet: [[H4985]] there [[H8033]] he made [[H7760]] for them a statute [[H2706]] and an ordinance, [[H4941]] and there [[H8033]] he proved [[H5254]] them, [[H5254]]

### 26
And said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou wilt diligently [[H8085]] hearken [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and wilt do [[H6213]] that which is right [[H3477]] in his sight, [[H5869]] and wilt give ear [[H238]] to his commandments, [[H4687]] and keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] his statutes, [[H2706]] I will put [[H7760]] none [[H3605]] of these diseases [[H4245]] upon [[H5921]] thee, which [[H834]] I have brought [[H7760]] upon the Egyptians: [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] that healeth [[H7495]] thee. [[H7495]]

### 27
And they came [[H935]] to Elim, [[H362]] where [[H8033]] twelve [[H8147]] wells [[H5869]] of water, [[H4325]] and threescore and ten [[H7657]] palm trees: [[H8558]] and they encamped [[H2583]] there [[H8033]] by [[H5921]] the waters. [[H4325]]
