### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they turn [[H7725]] and encamp [[H2583]] before [[H6440]] Pi-hahiroth, [[H6367]] between [[H996]] Migdol [[H4024]] and the sea, [[H3220]] over against [[H6440]] Baal-zephon: [[H1189]] before [[H5226]] it shall ye encamp [[H2583]] by [[H5921]] the sea. [[H3220]]

### 3
For Pharaoh [[H6547]] will say [[H559]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] They [[H1992]] entangled [[H943]] in the land, [[H776]] the wilderness [[H4057]] hath shut them in. [[H5462]]

### 4
And I will harden [[H2388]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] that he shall follow [[H7291]] after [[H310]] them; and I will be honoured [[H3513]] upon Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and upon all [[H3605]] his host; [[H2428]] that the Egyptians [[H4714]] may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]] And they did [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]]

### 5
And it was told [[H5046]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] that [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] fled: [[H1272]] and the heart [[H3824]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] and of his servants [[H5650]] was turned [[H2015]] against [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] and they said, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] have we done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] that [[H3588]]  we have let [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] go [[H7971]] from serving [[H5647]] us? [[H5647]]

### 6
And he made ready [[H631]] his chariot, [[H7393]] and took [[H3947]] his people [[H5971]] with [[H5973]] him: [[H5973]]

### 7
And he took [[H3947]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] chosen [[H977]] chariots, [[H7393]] and all [[H3605]] the chariots [[H7393]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and captains [[H7991]] over [[H5921]] every one [[H3605]] of them. [[H3605]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] the heart [[H3820]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and he pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went out [[H3318]] with an high [[H7311]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 9
But the Egyptians [[H4714]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] them, all [[H3605]] the horses [[H5483]] chariots [[H7393]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and his horsemen, [[H6571]] and his army, [[H2428]] and overtook [[H5381]] them encamping [[H2583]] by [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] beside [[H5921]] Pi-hahiroth, [[H6367]] before [[H6440]] Baal-zephon. [[H1189]]

### 10
And when Pharaoh [[H6547]] drew nigh, [[H7126]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] lifted up [[H5375]] their eyes, [[H5869]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] marched [[H5265]] after [[H310]] them; and they were sore [[H3966]] afraid: [[H3372]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] cried out [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Because [[H1097]] no [[H369]] graves [[H6913]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] hast thou taken us away [[H3947]] to die [[H4191]] in the wilderness? [[H4057]] wherefore [[H4100]] hast thou dealt [[H6213]] thus [[H2063]] with us, to carry us forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt? [[H4714]]

### 12
not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] we did tell [[H1696]] thee in Egypt, [[H4714]] saying, [[H559]] Let us alone, [[H2308]] that we may serve [[H5647]] the Egyptians? [[H4714]] For [[H3588]] better [[H2896]] for us to serve [[H5647]] the Egyptians, [[H4714]] than that we should die [[H4191]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 13
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Fear [[H3372]] ye not, [[H408]] stand still, [[H3320]] and see [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3444]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he will shew [[H6213]] to you to day: [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] whom [[H834]] ye have seen [[H7200]] to day, [[H3117]] ye shall see [[H7200]] them again [[H3254]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 14
The Lord [[H3068]] shall fight [[H3898]] for you, and ye [[H859]] shall hold your peace. [[H2790]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Wherefore [[H4100]] criest [[H6817]] thou unto [[H413]] me? speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they go forward: [[H5265]]

### 16
But lift thou up [[H7311]] thy rod, [[H4294]] and stretch out [[H5186]] thine hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] and divide [[H1234]] it: and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall go [[H935]] on dry [[H3004]] through the midst [[H8432]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 17
And I, [[H589]] behold, [[H2005]] I will harden [[H2388]] the hearts [[H3820]] of the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and they shall follow [[H935]] them: [[H310]] and I will get me honour [[H3513]] upon Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and upon all [[H3605]] his host, [[H2428]] upon his chariots, [[H7393]] and upon his horsemen. [[H6571]]

### 18
And the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when I have gotten me honour [[H3513]] upon Pharaoh, [[H6547]] upon his chariots, [[H7393]] and upon his horsemen. [[H6571]]

### 19
And the angel [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] which went [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] the camp [[H4264]] of Israel, [[H3478]] removed [[H5265]] and went [[H1980]] behind [[H310]] them; and the pillar [[H5982]] of the cloud [[H6051]] went [[H5265]] from before their face, [[H6440]] and stood [[H5975]] behind [[H310]] them: [[H310]]

### 20
And it came [[H935]] between [[H996]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] and the camp [[H4264]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and it was [[H1961]] a cloud [[H6051]] and darkness [[H2822]] but it gave light [[H215]] by night [[H3915]] so that the one [[H2088]] came not near [[H7126]] the other [[H2088]] all [[H3605]] the night. [[H3915]]

### 21
And Moses [[H4872]] stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea; [[H3220]] and the Lord [[H3068]]  caused [[H853]] the sea [[H3220]] to go [[H1980]] by a strong [[H5794]] east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] all [[H3605]] that night, [[H3915]] and made [[H7760]] the sea [[H3220]] dry [[H2724]] and the waters [[H4325]] were divided. [[H1234]]

### 22
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went [[H935]] into the midst [[H8432]] of the sea [[H3220]] upon the dry [[H3004]] and the waters [[H4325]] a wall [[H2346]] unto them on their right hand, [[H3225]] and on their left. [[H8040]]

### 23
And the Egyptians [[H4714]] pursued, [[H7291]] and went in [[H935]] after [[H310]] them to [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the sea, [[H3220]] all [[H3605]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] horses, [[H5483]] his chariots, [[H7393]] and his horsemen. [[H6571]]

### 24
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that in the morning [[H1242]] watch [[H821]] the Lord [[H3068]] looked [[H8259]] unto [[H413]] the host [[H4264]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] through the pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] and of the cloud, [[H6051]] and troubled [[H2000]] the host [[H4264]] of the Egyptians, [[H4714]]

### 25
And took off [[H5493]] their chariot [[H4818]] wheels, [[H212]] that they drave [[H5090]] them heavily: [[H3517]] so that the Egyptians [[H4714]] said, [[H559]] Let us flee [[H5127]] from the face [[H6440]] of Israel; [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] fighteth [[H3898]] for them against the Egyptians. [[H4714]]

### 26
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Stretch out [[H5186]] thine hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] that the waters [[H4325]] may come again [[H7725]] upon [[H5921]] the Egyptians, [[H4714]] upon [[H5921]] their chariots, [[H7393]] and upon [[H5921]] their horsemen. [[H6571]]

### 27
And Moses [[H4872]] stretched forth [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] and the sea [[H3220]] returned [[H7725]] to his strength [[H386]] when the morning [[H1242]] appeared; [[H6437]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] fled [[H5127]] against [[H7125]] it; and the Lord [[H3068]] overthrew [[H5287]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 28
And the waters [[H4325]] returned, [[H7725]] and covered [[H3680]] the chariots, [[H7393]] and the horsemen, [[H6571]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H2428]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] that came [[H935]] into the sea [[H3220]] after [[H310]] them; there remained [[H7604]] not [[H3808]] so much as [[H5704]] one [[H259]] of them. [[H259]]

### 29
But the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] walked [[H1980]] upon dry [[H3004]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the sea; [[H3220]] and the waters [[H4325]] a wall [[H2346]] unto them on their right hand, [[H3225]] and on their left. [[H8040]]

### 30
Thus the Lord [[H3068]] saved [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians; [[H4714]] and Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] dead [[H4191]] upon [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] shore. [[H8193]]

### 31
And Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] that great [[H1419]] work [[H3027]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] upon the Egyptians: [[H4714]] and the people [[H5971]] feared [[H3372]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and believed [[H539]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and his servant [[H5650]] Moses. [[H4872]]
