### 1
And when the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Moses [[H4872]] delayed [[H954]] to come down [[H3381]] out of [[H4480]] the mount, [[H2022]] the people [[H5971]] gathered themselves together [[H6950]] unto [[H5921]] Aaron, [[H175]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Up, [[H6965]] make [[H6213]] us gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] shall go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] us; for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] Moses, [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] brought [[H5927]] us up out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] we wot [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] is become [[H1961]] of him. [[H1961]]

### 2
And Aaron [[H175]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Break off [[H6561]] the golden [[H2091]] earrings, [[H5141]] which [[H834]] in the ears [[H241]] of your wives, [[H802]] of your sons, [[H1121]] and of your daughters, [[H1323]] and bring [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 3
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] brake off [[H6561]] the golden [[H2091]] earrings [[H5141]] which [[H834]] in their ears, [[H241]] and brought [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Aaron. [[H175]]

### 4
And he received [[H3947]] at their hand, [[H3027]] and fashioned [[H3335]] it with a graving tool, [[H2747]] after he had made [[H6213]] it a molten [[H4541]] calf: [[H5695]] and they said, [[H559]] These [[H428]] thy gods, [[H430]] O Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] brought [[H5927]] thee up out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 5
And when Aaron [[H175]] saw [[H7200]] he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] before [[H6440]] it; and Aaron [[H175]] made proclamation, [[H7121]] and said, [[H559]] To morrow [[H4279]] a feast [[H2282]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And they rose up early [[H7925]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and brought [[H5066]] peace offerings; [[H8002]] and the people [[H5971]] sat down [[H3427]] to eat [[H398]] and to drink, [[H8354]] and rose up [[H6965]] to play. [[H6711]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Go, [[H1980]] get thee down; [[H3381]] for [[H3588]] thy people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] thou broughtest [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] have corrupted [[H7843]]

### 8
They have turned aside [[H5493]] quickly [[H4118]] out of [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] them: they have made [[H6213]] them a molten [[H4541]] calf, [[H5695]] and have worshipped [[H7812]] it, and have sacrificed [[H2076]] thereunto, and said, [[H559]] These [[H428]] thy gods, [[H430]] O Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] have brought thee up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] I have seen [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and, behold, [[H2009]] it [[H1931]] a stiffnecked [[H7186]] people: [[H5971]]

### 10
Now [[H6258]] therefore let me alone, [[H3240]] that my wrath [[H639]] may wax hot [[H2734]] against them, and that I may consume [[H3615]] them: and I will make [[H6213]] of thee a great [[H1419]] nation. [[H1471]]

### 11
And Moses [[H4872]] besought [[H2470]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] and said, [[H559]] Lord, [[H3068]] why [[H4100]] doth thy wrath [[H639]] wax hot [[H2734]] against thy people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] thou hast brought forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with great [[H1419]] power, [[H3581]] and with a mighty [[H2389]] hand? [[H3027]]

### 12
Wherefore [[H4100]] should the Egyptians [[H4714]] speak, [[H559]] and say, [[H559]] For mischief [[H7451]] did he bring [[H3318]] them out, to slay [[H2026]] them in the mountains, [[H2022]] and to consume [[H3615]] them from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth? [[H127]] Turn [[H7725]] from thy fierce [[H2740]] wrath, [[H639]] and repent [[H5162]] of [[H5921]] this evil [[H7451]] against thy people. [[H5971]]

### 13
Remember [[H2142]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Israel, [[H3478]] thy servants, [[H5650]] to whom [[H834]] thou swarest [[H7650]] by thine own self, and saidst [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, I will multiply [[H7235]] your seed [[H2233]] as the stars [[H3556]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I have spoken [[H559]] of will I give [[H5414]] unto your seed, [[H2233]] and they shall inherit [[H5157]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] repented [[H5162]] of [[H5921]] the evil [[H7451]] which [[H834]] he thought [[H1696]] to do [[H6213]] unto his people. [[H5971]]

### 15
And Moses [[H4872]] turned, [[H6437]] and went down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mount, [[H2022]] and the two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of the testimony [[H5715]] in his hand: [[H3027]] the tables [[H3871]] written [[H3789]] on both [[H8147]] their sides; [[H5676]] on the one side [[H2088]] and on the other [[H2088]] they [[H1992]] written. [[H3789]]

### 16
And the tables [[H3871]] the work [[H4639]] of God, [[H430]] and the writing [[H4385]] the writing [[H4385]] of God, [[H430]] graven [[H2801]] upon [[H5921]] the tables. [[H3871]]

### 17
And when Joshua [[H3091]] heard [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] of the people [[H5971]] as they shouted, [[H7452]] he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] a noise [[H6963]] of war [[H4421]] in the camp. [[H4264]]

### 18
And he said, [[H559]] not [[H369]] the voice [[H6963]] of shout [[H6030]] for mastery, [[H1369]] neither [[H369]] the voice [[H6963]] of cry [[H6030]] for being overcome: [[H2476]] the noise [[H6963]] of sing [[H6031]] do I [[H595]] hear. [[H8085]]

### 19
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as soon as [[H834]] he came nigh [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] that he saw [[H7200]] the calf, [[H5695]] and the dancing: [[H4246]] and Moses' [[H4872]] anger [[H639]] waxed hot, [[H2734]] and he cast [[H7993]] the tables [[H3871]] out of his hands, [[H3027]] and brake [[H7665]] them beneath [[H8478]] the mount. [[H2022]]

### 20
And he took [[H3947]] the calf [[H5695]] which [[H834]] they had made, [[H6213]] and burnt [[H8313]] in the fire, [[H784]] and ground [[H2912]] to [[H5704]] powder, [[H1854]] and strawed [[H2219]] upon [[H6440]] the water, [[H4325]]  and made [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] drink [[H8248]]

### 21
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] What [[H4100]] did [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] unto thee, that [[H3588]] thou hast brought [[H935]] so great [[H1419]] a sin [[H2401]] upon [[H5921]] them? [[H5921]]

### 22
And Aaron [[H175]] said, [[H559]] Let not [[H408]] the anger [[H639]] of my lord [[H113]] wax hot: [[H2734]] thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] the people, [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] on mischief. [[H7451]]

### 23
For they said [[H559]] unto me, Make [[H6213]] us gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] shall go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] us: for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] Moses, [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] brought us up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] we wot [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] is become [[H1961]] of him. [[H1961]]

### 24
And I said [[H559]] unto them, Whosoever [[H4310]] hath any gold, [[H2091]] let them break [[H6561]] off. So they gave [[H5414]] me: then I cast [[H7993]] it into the fire, [[H784]] and there came out [[H3318]] this [[H2088]] calf. [[H5695]]

### 25
And when Moses [[H4872]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] naked; [[H6544]] (for [[H3588]] Aaron [[H175]] had made them naked [[H6544]] unto shame [[H8103]] among their enemies:) [[H6965]]

### 26
Then Moses [[H4872]] stood [[H5975]] in the gate [[H8179]] of the camp, [[H4264]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] on the Lord's [[H3068]] side? unto [[H413]] me. And all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] gathered [[H622]] themselves together unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 27
And he said [[H559]] unto them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Put [[H7760]] every man [[H376]] his sword [[H2719]] by [[H5921]] his side, [[H3409]] go in [[H5674]] and out [[H7725]] from gate [[H8179]] to gate [[H8179]] throughout the camp, [[H4264]] and slay [[H2026]] every man [[H376]] his brother, [[H251]] and every man [[H376]] his companion, [[H7453]] and every man [[H376]] his neighbour. [[H7138]]

### 28
And the children [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] did [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Moses: [[H4872]] and there fell [[H5307]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] about three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 29
For Moses [[H4872]] had said, [[H559]] Consecrate [[H4390]] yourselves [[H3027]] to day [[H3117]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] even [[H3588]] every man [[H376]] upon his son, [[H1121]] and upon his brother; [[H251]] that he may bestow [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] you a blessing [[H1293]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 30
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Ye [[H859]] have sinned [[H2398]] a great [[H1419]] sin: [[H2401]] and now [[H6258]] I will go up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] the Lord; [[H3068]] peradventure [[H194]] I shall make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H1157]] your sin. [[H2403]]

### 31
And Moses [[H4872]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] Oh, [[H577]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] have sinned [[H2398]] a great [[H1419]] sin, [[H2401]] and have made [[H6213]] them gods [[H430]] of gold. [[H2091]]

### 32
Yet now, [[H6258]] if [[H518]] thou wilt forgive [[H5375]] their sin—; [[H2403]] and if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] blot [[H4229]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] out of thy book [[H5612]] which [[H834]] thou hast written. [[H3789]]

### 33
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Whosoever [[H834]] hath sinned [[H2398]] against me, him will I blot out [[H4229]] of my book. [[H5612]]

### 34
Therefore now [[H6258]] go, [[H1980]] lead [[H5148]] the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] of which [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] unto thee: behold, [[H2009]] mine Angel [[H4397]] shall go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee: nevertheless in the day [[H3117]] when I visit [[H6485]] I will visit [[H6485]] their sin [[H2403]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 35
And the Lord [[H3068]] plagued [[H5062]] the people, [[H5971]] because [[H834]] they made [[H6213]] the calf, [[H5695]] which [[H834]] Aaron [[H175]] made. [[H6213]]
