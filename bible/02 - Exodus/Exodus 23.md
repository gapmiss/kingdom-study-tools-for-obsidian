[[Exodus 22|←]] • [[Exodus 24|→]]

---

### 1
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] raise [[H5375]] a false [[H7723]] report: [[H8088]] put [[H7896]] not [[H408]] thine hand [[H3027]] with [[H5973]] the wicked [[H7563]] to be [[H1961]] an unrighteous [[H2555]] witness. [[H5707]]

### 2
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] follow [[H310]] a multitude [[H7227]] to evil; [[H7451]] neither [[H3808]] shalt thou speak [[H6030]] in [[H5921]] a cause [[H7379]] to decline [[H5186]] after [[H310]] many [[H7227]] to wrest [[H5186]]

### 3
Neither [[H3808]] shalt thou countenance [[H1921]] a poor man [[H1800]] in his cause. [[H7379]]

### 4
If [[H3588]] thou meet [[H6293]] thine enemy's [[H341]] ox [[H7794]] or [[H176]] his ass [[H2543]] going astray, [[H8582]] thou shalt surely bring it back [[H7725]] to him again. [[H7725]]

### 5
If [[H3588]] thou see [[H7200]] the ass [[H2543]] of him that hateth [[H8130]] thee lying [[H7257]] under [[H8478]] his burden, [[H4853]] and wouldest forbear [[H2308]] to help [[H5800]] him, thou shalt surely [[H5800]] help [[H5800]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 6
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] wrest [[H5186]] the judgment [[H4941]] of thy poor [[H34]] in his cause. [[H7379]]

### 7
Keep thee far [[H7368]] from a false [[H8267]] matter; [[H1697]] and the innocent [[H5355]] and righteous [[H6662]] slay [[H2026]] thou not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] justify [[H6663]] the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 8
And thou shalt take [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] gift: [[H7810]] for [[H3588]] the gift [[H7810]] blindeth [[H5786]] the wise, [[H6493]] and perverteth [[H5557]] the words [[H1697]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 9
Also thou shalt not [[H3808]] oppress [[H3905]] a stranger: [[H1616]] for ye [[H859]] know [[H3045]] the heart [[H5315]] of a stranger, [[H1616]] seeing [[H3588]] ye were [[H1961]] strangers [[H1616]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 10
And six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] thou shalt sow [[H2232]] thy land, [[H776]] and shalt gather in [[H622]] the fruits [[H8393]] thereof: [[H8393]]

### 11
But the seventh [[H7637]] thou shalt let it rest [[H8058]] and lie still; [[H5203]] that the poor [[H34]] of thy people [[H5971]] may eat: [[H398]] and what they leave [[H3499]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] shall eat. [[H398]] In like manner [[H3651]] thou shalt deal [[H6213]] with thy vineyard, [[H3754]] with thy oliveyard. [[H2132]]

### 12
Six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] thou shalt do [[H6213]] thy work, [[H4639]] and on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] thou shalt rest: [[H7673]] that [[H4616]] thine ox [[H7794]] and thine ass [[H2543]] may rest, [[H5117]] and the son [[H1121]] of thy handmaid, [[H519]] and the stranger, [[H1616]] may be refreshed. [[H5314]]

### 13
And in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you be circumspect: [[H8104]] and make no mention [[H2142]] of the name [[H8034]] of other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] neither [[H3808]] let it be heard [[H8085]] out of [[H5921]] thy mouth. [[H6310]]

### 14
Three [[H7969]] times [[H7272]] thou shalt keep a feast [[H2287]] unto me in the year. [[H8141]]

### 15
Thou shalt keep [[H8104]] the feast [[H2282]] of unleavened bread: [[H4682]] (thou shalt eat [[H398]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] as [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] thee, in the time appointed [[H4150]] of the month [[H2320]] Abib; [[H24]] for [[H3588]] in it thou camest out [[H3318]] from Egypt: [[H4714]] and none [[H3808]] shall appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] me empty:) [[H7387]]

### 16
And the feast [[H2282]] of harvest, [[H7105]] the firstfruits [[H1061]] of thy labours, [[H4639]] which [[H834]] thou hast sown [[H2232]] in the field: [[H7704]] and the feast [[H2282]] of ingathering, [[H614]] in the end [[H3318]] of the year, [[H8141]] when thou hast gathered in [[H622]] thy labours [[H4639]] out of [[H4480]] the field. [[H7704]]

### 17
Three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] in the year [[H8141]] all [[H3605]] thy males [[H2138]] shall appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H113]] God. [[H3068]]

### 18
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] offer [[H2076]] the blood [[H1818]] of my sacrifice [[H2077]] with [[H5921]] leavened bread; [[H2557]] neither [[H3808]] shall the fat [[H2459]] of my sacrifice [[H2282]] remain [[H3885]] until [[H5704]] the morning. [[H1242]]

### 19
The first [[H7225]] of the firstfruits [[H1061]] of thy land [[H127]] thou shalt bring [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] seethe [[H1310]] a kid [[H1423]] in his mother's [[H517]] milk. [[H2461]]

### 20
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] send [[H7971]] an Angel [[H4397]] before [[H6440]] thee, to keep [[H8104]] thee in the way, [[H1870]] and to bring [[H935]] thee into [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] I have prepared. [[H3559]]

### 21
Beware [[H8104]] of [[H6440]] him, and obey [[H8085]] his voice, [[H6963]] provoke [[H4843]] him not; [[H408]] for [[H3588]] he will not [[H3808]] pardon [[H5375]] your transgressions: [[H6588]] for [[H3588]] my name [[H8034]] in him. [[H7130]]

### 22
But [[H3588]] if [[H518]] thou shalt indeed [[H8085]] obey [[H8085]] his voice, [[H6963]] and do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I speak; [[H1696]] then I will be an enemy [[H340]] unto thine enemies, [[H341]] and an adversary [[H6696]] unto thine adversaries. [[H6887]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] mine Angel [[H4397]] shall go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee, and bring [[H935]] thee in unto [[H413]] the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] and the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Hivites, [[H2340]] and the Jebusites: [[H2983]] and I will cut them off. [[H3582]]

### 24
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] bow down [[H7812]] to their gods, [[H430]] nor [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] them, nor [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] after their works: [[H4639]] but [[H3588]] thou shalt utterly [[H2040]] overthrow [[H2040]] them, and quite [[H7665]] break down [[H7665]] their images. [[H4676]]

### 25
And ye shall serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and he shall bless [[H1288]] thy bread, [[H3899]] and thy water; [[H4325]] and I will take away [[H5493]] sickness [[H4245]] from the midst of thee. [[H7130]]

### 26
There shall nothing [[H3808]] cast their young, [[H7921]] nor be barren, [[H6135]] in thy land: [[H776]] the number [[H4557]] of thy days [[H3117]] I will fulfil. [[H4390]]

### 27
I will send [[H7971]] my fear [[H367]] before [[H6440]] thee, and will destroy [[H2000]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] to whom [[H834]] thou shalt come, [[H935]] and I will make [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] thine enemies [[H341]] turn their backs [[H6203]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 28
And I will send [[H7971]] hornets [[H6880]] before [[H6440]] thee, which shall drive out [[H1644]] the Hivite, [[H2340]] the Canaanite, [[H3669]] and the Hittite, [[H2850]] from before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 29
I will not [[H3808]] drive them out [[H1644]] from before [[H6440]] thee in one [[H259]] year; [[H8141]] lest [[H6435]] the land [[H776]] become [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8077]] and the beast [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] multiply [[H7227]] against [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 30
By little [[H4592]] and little [[H4592]] I will drive them out [[H1644]] from before [[H6440]] thee, until [[H834]] thou be increased, [[H6509]] and inherit [[H5157]] the land. [[H776]]

### 31
And I will set [[H7896]] thy bounds [[H1366]] from the Red [[H5488]] sea [[H3220]] even unto [[H5704]] the sea [[H3220]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and from the desert [[H4057]] unto [[H5704]] the river: [[H5104]] for [[H3588]] I will deliver [[H5414]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] into your hand; [[H3027]] and thou shalt drive them out [[H1644]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 32
Thou shalt make [[H3772]] no [[H3808]] covenant [[H1285]] with them, nor with their gods. [[H430]]

### 33
They shall not [[H3808]] dwell [[H3427]] in thy land, [[H776]] lest [[H6435]] they make thee sin [[H2398]] against me: for [[H3588]] if thou serve [[H5647]] their gods, [[H430]] it will surely [[H3588]] be [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] unto thee. [[H4170]]
