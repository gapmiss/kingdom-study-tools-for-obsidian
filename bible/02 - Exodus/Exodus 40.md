### 5
And thou shalt set [[H5414]] the altar [[H4196]] of gold [[H2091]] for the incense [[H7004]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the testimony, [[H5715]] and put [[H7760]] the hanging [[H4539]] of the door [[H6607]] to the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

### 9
And thou shalt take [[H3947]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] and anoint [[H4886]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein, and shalt hallow [[H6942]] it, and all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] thereof: and it shall be [[H1961]] holy. [[H6944]]

### 15
And thou shalt anoint [[H4886]] them, as [[H834]] thou didst anoint [[H4886]] their father, [[H1]] that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: [[H3547]] for their anointing [[H4888]] shall surely be [[H1961]] an everlasting [[H5769]] priesthood [[H3550]] throughout their generations. [[H1755]]

### 16
Thus did [[H6213]] Moses: [[H4872]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] him, so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] he. [[H6213]]

### 17
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] in the second [[H8145]] year, [[H8141]] on the first [[H259]] of the month, [[H2320]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] was reared up. [[H6965]]

### 18
And Moses [[H4872]] reared up [[H6965]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] and fastened [[H5414]] his sockets, [[H134]] and set up [[H7760]] the boards [[H7175]] thereof, and put in [[H5414]] the bars [[H1280]] thereof, and reared up [[H6965]] his pillars. [[H5982]]

### 19
And he spread abroad [[H6566]] the tent [[H168]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] and put [[H7760]] the covering [[H4372]] of the tent [[H168]] above [[H4605]] upon [[H5921]] it; as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 20
And he took [[H3947]] and put [[H5414]] the testimony [[H5715]] into [[H413]] the ark, [[H727]] and set [[H7760]] the staves [[H905]] on [[H5921]] the ark, [[H727]] and put [[H5414]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] above [[H4605]] upon [[H5921]] the ark: [[H727]]

### 21
And he brought [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] into [[H413]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] and set up [[H7760]] the vail [[H6532]] of the covering, [[H4539]] and covered [[H5526]] the ark [[H727]] of the testimony; [[H5715]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 22
And he put [[H5414]] the table [[H7979]] in the tent [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] upon [[H5921]] the side [[H3409]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] northward, [[H6828]] without [[H2351]] the vail. [[H6532]]

### 23
And he set [[H6187]] the bread [[H3899]] in order [[H6186]] upon [[H5921]] it before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 24
And he put [[H7760]] the candlestick [[H4501]] in the tent [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] over against [[H5227]] the table, [[H7979]] on [[H5921]] the side [[H3409]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] southward. [[H5045]]

### 25
And he lighted [[H5927]] the lamps [[H5216]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 26
And he put [[H7760]] the golden [[H2091]] altar [[H4196]] in the tent [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] before [[H6440]] the vail: [[H6532]]

### 27
And he burnt [[H6999]] sweet [[H5561]] incense [[H7004]] thereon; [[H5921]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 28
And he set up [[H7760]] the hanging [[H4539]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

### 29
And he put [[H7760]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the tent [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and offered [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]]  it [[H853]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the meat offering; [[H4503]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 30
And he set [[H7760]] the laver [[H3595]] between [[H996]] the tent [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] and the altar, [[H4196]] and put [[H5414]] water [[H4325]] there, [[H8033]] to wash [[H7364]]

### 31
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] washed [[H7364]] their hands [[H3027]] and their feet [[H7272]] thereat: [[H4480]]

### 32
When they went [[H935]] into [[H413]] the tent [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and when they came near [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] the altar, [[H4196]] they washed; [[H7364]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 33
And he reared up [[H6965]] the court [[H2691]] round about [[H5439]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and the altar, [[H4196]] and set up [[H5414]] the hanging [[H4539]] of the court [[H2691]] gate. [[H8179]] So Moses [[H4872]] finished [[H3615]] the work. [[H4399]]

### 34
Then a cloud [[H6051]] covered [[H3680]] the tent [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

### 35
And Moses [[H4872]] was not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the tent [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] because [[H3588]] the cloud [[H6051]] abode [[H7931]] thereon, [[H5921]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

### 36
And when the cloud [[H6051]] was taken up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] over the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went onward [[H5265]] in all [[H3605]] their journeys: [[H4550]]

### 37
But if [[H518]] the cloud [[H6051]] were not [[H3808]] taken up, [[H5927]] then they journeyed [[H5265]] not [[H3808]] till [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] that it was taken up. [[H5927]]

### 38
For [[H3588]] the cloud [[H6051]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] by day, [[H3119]] and fire [[H784]] was [[H1961]] on it by night, [[H3915]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] throughout all [[H3605]] their journeys.
