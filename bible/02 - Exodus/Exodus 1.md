### 1
Now these [[H428]] the names [[H8034]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which came [[H935]] into Egypt; [[H4714]] every man [[H376]] and his household [[H1004]] came [[H935]] with [[H854]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 2
Reuben, [[H7205]] Simeon, [[H8095]] Levi, [[H3878]] and Judah, [[H3063]]

### 3
Issachar, [[H3485]] Zebulun, [[H2074]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]]

### 4
Dan, [[H1835]] and Naphtali, [[H5321]] Gad, [[H1410]] and Asher. [[H836]]

### 5
And all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that came out [[H3318]] of the loins [[H3409]] of Jacob [[H3290]] were [[H1961]] seventy [[H7657]] souls: [[H5315]] for Joseph [[H3130]] was [[H1961]] in Egypt [[H4714]]

### 6
And Joseph [[H3130]] died, [[H4191]] and all [[H3605]] his brethren, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] generation. [[H1755]]

### 7
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were fruitful, [[H6509]] and increased abundantly, [[H8317]] and multiplied, [[H7235]] and waxed exceeding [[H3966]] mighty; [[H6105]] and the land [[H776]] was filled [[H4390]] with [[H854]] them. [[H854]]

### 8
Now there arose up [[H6965]] a new [[H2319]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Egypt, [[H4714]] which [[H834]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] Joseph. [[H3130]]

### 9
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his people, [[H5971]] Behold, [[H2009]] the people [[H5971]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] more [[H7227]] and mightier [[H6099]] than [[H4480]] we: [[H4480]]

### 10
Come on, [[H3051]] let us deal wisely [[H2449]] with them; lest [[H6435]] they multiply, [[H7235]] and it come to pass, [[H1961]] that, when [[H3588]] there falleth out [[H7122]] any war, [[H4421]] they [[H1931]] join [[H3254]] also [[H1571]] unto [[H5921]] our enemies, [[H8130]] and fight [[H3898]] against us, and get them up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the land. [[H776]]

### 11
Therefore they did set [[H7760]] over [[H5921]] them taskmasters [[H4522]] to [[H4616]] afflict [[H6031]] them with their burdens. [[H5450]] And they built [[H1129]] for Pharaoh [[H6547]] treasure [[H4543]] cities, [[H5892]] Pithom [[H6619]] and Raamses. [[H7486]]

### 12
But the more [[H834]] they afflicted [[H6031]] them, the more [[H3651]] they multiplied [[H7235]] and grew. [[H6555]] And they were grieved [[H6973]] because [[H6440]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 13
And the Egyptians [[H4714]]  made [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] to serve [[H5647]] with rigour: [[H6531]]

### 14
And they made [[H853]] their lives [[H2416]] bitter [[H4843]] with hard [[H7186]] bondage, [[H5656]] in morter, [[H2563]] and in brick, [[H3843]] and in all manner [[H3605]] of service [[H5656]] in the field: [[H7704]] all [[H3605]] their service, [[H5656]] wherein [[H834]] they made them serve, [[H5647]] with rigour. [[H6531]]

### 15
And the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] spake [[H559]] to the Hebrew [[H5680]] midwives, [[H3205]] of which [[H834]] the name [[H8034]] of the one [[H259]] Shiphrah, [[H8236]] and the name [[H8034]] of the other [[H8145]] Puah: [[H6326]]

### 16
And he said, [[H559]] When ye do the office of a midwife [[H3205]]  to [[H853]] the Hebrew women, [[H5680]] and see [[H7200]] upon [[H5921]] the stools; [[H70]] if [[H518]] it [[H1931]] a son, [[H1121]] then ye shall kill [[H4191]] him: but if [[H518]] it [[H1931]] a daughter, [[H1323]] then she shall live. [[H2425]]

### 17
But the midwives [[H3205]] feared [[H3372]] God, [[H430]] and did [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] as [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] commanded [[H1696]] them, but saved [[H2421]] the men children [[H3206]] alive. [[H3206]]

### 18
And the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] called for [[H7121]] the midwives, [[H3205]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Why [[H4069]] have ye done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] and have saved [[H2421]] the men children [[H3206]] alive? [[H3206]]

### 19
And the midwives [[H3205]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Because [[H3588]] the Hebrew [[H5680]] women not [[H3808]] as the Egyptian [[H4713]] women; [[H802]] for [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] lively, [[H2422]] and are delivered [[H3205]] ere [[H2962]] the midwives [[H3205]] come in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 20
Therefore God [[H430]] dealt well [[H3190]] with the midwives: [[H3205]] and the people [[H5971]] multiplied, [[H7235]] and waxed very [[H3966]] mighty. [[H6105]]

### 21
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] because [[H3588]] the midwives [[H3205]] feared [[H3372]] God, [[H430]] that he made [[H6213]] them houses. [[H1004]]

### 22
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] charged [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Every [[H3605]] son [[H1121]] that is born [[H3209]] ye shall cast [[H7993]] into the river, [[H2975]] and every [[H3605]] daughter [[H1323]] ye shall save alive. [[H2421]]
