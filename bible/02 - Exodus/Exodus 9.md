### 1
Then the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and tell [[H1696]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]]  Let [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may serve [[H5647]] me. [[H5647]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] refuse [[H3986]] to let go, [[H7971]] and wilt hold [[H2388]] them still, [[H5750]]

### 3
Behold, [[H2009]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is [[H1961]] upon thy cattle [[H4735]] which [[H834]] in the field, [[H7704]] upon the horses, [[H5483]] upon the asses, [[H2543]] upon the camels, [[H1581]] upon the oxen, [[H1241]] and upon the sheep: [[H6629]] a very [[H3966]] grievous [[H3515]] murrain. [[H1698]]

### 4
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall sever [[H6395]] between [[H996]] the cattle [[H4735]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the cattle [[H4735]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] and there shall nothing [[H1697]] die [[H4191]] of all [[H3605]] the children's [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] appointed [[H7760]] a set time, [[H4150]] saying, [[H559]] To morrow [[H4279]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] that [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] and all [[H3605]] the cattle [[H4735]] of Egypt [[H4714]] died: [[H4191]] but of the cattle [[H4735]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] died [[H4191]] not [[H3808]] one. [[H259]]

### 7
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] sent, [[H7971]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there was not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of the cattle [[H4735]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] dead. [[H4191]] And the heart [[H3820]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] was hardened, [[H3513]] and he did not [[H3808]]  let [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] go. [[H7971]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Take [[H3947]] to you handfuls [[H2651]] of ashes [[H6368]] of the furnace, [[H3536]] and let Moses [[H4872]] sprinkle [[H2236]] it toward the heaven [[H8064]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 9
And it shall become [[H1961]] small dust [[H80]] in [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and shall be [[H1961]] a boil [[H7822]] breaking forth [[H6524]] blains [[H76]] upon [[H5921]] man, [[H120]] and upon [[H5921]] beast, [[H929]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 10
And they took [[H3947]] ashes [[H6368]] of the furnace, [[H3536]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh; [[H6547]] and Moses [[H4872]] sprinkled [[H2236]] it up toward heaven; [[H8064]] and it became [[H1961]] a boil [[H7822]] breaking forth [[H6524]] blains [[H76]] upon man, [[H120]] and upon beast. [[H929]]

### 11
And the magicians [[H2748]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Moses [[H4872]] because of [[H6440]] the boils; [[H7822]] for [[H3588]] the boil [[H7822]] was [[H1961]] upon the magicians, [[H2748]] and upon all [[H3605]] the Egyptians. [[H4714]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] the heart [[H3820]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and he hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] them; as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Rise up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]]  Let [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may serve [[H5647]] me. [[H5647]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will at this [[H2063]] time [[H6471]] send [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] my plagues [[H4046]] upon [[H413]] thine heart, [[H3820]] and upon thy servants, [[H5650]] and upon thy people; [[H5971]] that [[H5668]] thou mayest know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] none [[H369]] like me [[H3644]] in all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] I will stretch out [[H7971]] my hand, [[H3027]] that I may smite [[H5221]] thee and thy people [[H5971]] with pestilence; [[H1698]] and thou shalt be cut off [[H3582]] from [[H4480]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 16
And in very [[H199]] deed [[H5668]] for this [[H2063]] have I raised thee up, [[H5975]] for [[H5668]] to shew [[H7200]]  thee [[H853]] my power; [[H3581]] and that [[H4616]] my name [[H8034]] may be declared [[H5608]] throughout all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
As yet [[H5750]] exaltest [[H5549]] thou thyself against my people, [[H5971]] that thou wilt not [[H1115]] let them go? [[H7971]]

### 18
Behold, [[H2005]] to morrow [[H4279]] about this time [[H6256]] I will cause it to rain [[H4305]] a very [[H3966]] grievous [[H3515]] hail, [[H1259]] such [[H834]] as [[H3644]] hath not [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] in Egypt [[H4714]] since [[H3117]] the foundation [[H3245]] thereof even until [[H5704]] now. [[H6258]]

### 19
Send [[H7971]] therefore now, [[H6258]] gather [[H5756]] thy cattle, [[H4735]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast in the field; [[H7704]] every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] which [[H834]] shall be found [[H4672]] in the field, [[H7704]] and shall not [[H3808]] be brought [[H622]] home, [[H1004]] the hail [[H1259]] shall come down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] them, and they shall die. [[H4191]]

### 20
He that feared [[H3372]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] among the servants [[H5650]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]]  made [[H853]] his servants [[H5650]] and his cattle [[H4735]] flee [[H5127]] into [[H413]] the houses: [[H1004]]

### 21
And he that [[H834]] regarded [[H7760]] not [[H3808]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] left [[H5800]] his servants [[H5650]] and his cattle [[H4735]] in the field. [[H7704]]

### 22
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Stretch forth [[H5186]] thine hand [[H3027]] toward [[H5921]] heaven, [[H8064]] that there may be [[H1961]] hail [[H1259]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] upon [[H5921]] man, [[H120]] and upon [[H5921]] beast, [[H929]] and upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] herb [[H6212]] of the field, [[H7704]] throughout the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 23
And Moses [[H4872]] stretched forth [[H5186]] his rod [[H4294]] toward [[H5921]] heaven: [[H8064]] and the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H5414]] thunder [[H6963]] and hail, [[H1259]] and the fire [[H784]] ran along [[H1980]] upon the ground; [[H776]] and the Lord [[H3068]] rained [[H4305]] hail [[H1259]] upon [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 24
So there was [[H1961]] hail, [[H1259]] and fire [[H784]] mingled [[H8432]] with the hail, [[H1259]] very [[H3966]] grievous, [[H3515]] such as [[H834]] there was [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] like it [[H3644]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] since [[H227]] it became [[H1961]] a nation. [[H1471]]

### 25
And the hail [[H1259]] smote [[H5221]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in the field, [[H7704]] both man [[H120]] and beast; [[H929]] and the hail [[H1259]] smote [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] herb [[H6212]] of the field, [[H7704]] and brake [[H7665]] every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 26
Only [[H7535]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] where [[H8033]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] was [[H1961]] there no [[H3808]] hail. [[H1259]]

### 27
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] sent, [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] for Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I have sinned [[H2398]] this time: [[H6471]] the Lord [[H3068]] righteous, [[H6662]] and I [[H589]] and my people [[H5971]] wicked. [[H7563]]

### 28
Intreat [[H6279]] the Lord [[H3068]] (for enough) [[H7227]] that there be no [[H1961]] mighty [[H430]] thunderings [[H6963]] and hail; [[H1259]] and I will let you go, [[H7971]] and ye shall stay [[H5975]] no [[H3808]] longer. [[H3254]]

### 29
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, As soon as I am gone out [[H3318]]  of [[H853]] the city, [[H5892]] I will spread abroad [[H6566]] my hands [[H3709]] unto [[H413]] the Lord; [[H3068]] the thunder [[H6963]] shall cease, [[H2308]] neither [[H3808]] shall there be [[H1961]] any more [[H5750]] hail; [[H1259]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest know [[H3045]] how that [[H3588]] the earth [[H776]] the Lord's. [[H3068]]

### 30
But as for thee [[H859]] and thy servants, [[H5650]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] ye will not yet [[H2962]] fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] God. [[H430]]

### 31
And the flax [[H6594]] and the barley [[H8184]] was smitten: [[H5221]] for [[H3588]] the barley [[H8184]] in the ear, [[H24]] and the flax [[H6594]] bolled. [[H1392]]

### 32
But the wheat [[H2406]] and the rie [[H3698]] were not [[H3808]] smitten: [[H5221]] for [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] not grown up. [[H648]]

### 33
And Moses [[H4872]] went out [[H3318]]  of [[H853]] the city [[H5892]] from [[H5973]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and spread abroad [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] unto [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and the thunders [[H6963]] and hail [[H1259]] ceased, [[H2308]] and the rain [[H4306]] was not [[H3808]] poured [[H5413]] upon the earth. [[H776]]

### 34
And when Pharaoh [[H6547]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the rain [[H4306]] and the hail [[H1259]] and the thunders [[H6963]] were ceased, [[H2308]] he sinned [[H2398]] yet more, [[H3254]] and hardened [[H3513]] his heart, [[H3820]] he [[H1931]] and his servants. [[H5650]]

### 35
And the heart [[H3820]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] was hardened, [[H2388]] neither [[H3808]]  would he let [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] go; [[H7971]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]]
