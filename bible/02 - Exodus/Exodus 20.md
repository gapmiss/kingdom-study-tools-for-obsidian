And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] the thunderings, [[H6963]] and the lightnings, [[H3940]] and the noise [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] and the mountain [[H2022]] smoking: [[H6226]] and when the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] they removed, [[H5128]] and stood [[H5975]] afar off. [[H7350]]

### 19
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Speak [[H1696]] thou [[H859]] with [[H5973]] us, and we will hear: [[H8085]] but let not [[H408]] God [[H430]] speak [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] us, lest [[H6435]] we die. [[H4191]]

[[H1115]]

### 21
And the people [[H5971]] stood [[H5975]] afar off, [[H7350]] and Moses [[H4872]] drew near [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] the thick darkness [[H6205]] where [[H8033]] God [[H430]]

### 22
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Thus [[H3541]] thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Ye [[H859]] have seen [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] I have talked [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] you from [[H4480]] heaven. [[H8064]]

### 23
Ye shall not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] with [[H854]] me gods [[H430]] of silver, [[H3701]] neither [[H3808]] shall ye make [[H6213]] unto you gods [[H430]] of gold. [[H2091]]

### 24
An altar [[H4196]] of earth [[H127]] thou shalt make [[H6213]] unto me, and shalt sacrifice [[H2076]] thereon [[H5921]] thy burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and thy peace offerings, [[H8002]] thy sheep, [[H6629]] and thine oxen: [[H1241]] in all [[H3605]] places [[H4725]] where [[H834]] I record [[H2142]] my name [[H8034]] I will come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, and I will bless [[H1288]] thee. [[H1288]]

### 25
And if [[H518]] thou wilt make [[H6213]] me an altar [[H4196]] of stone, [[H68]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] it of hewn stone: [[H1496]] for [[H3588]] if thou lift up [[H5130]] thy tool [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] it, thou hast polluted [[H2490]] it. [[H2490]]

### 26
Neither [[H3808]] shalt thou go up [[H5927]] by steps [[H4609]] unto [[H5921]] mine altar, [[H4196]] that [[H834]] thy nakedness [[H6172]] be not [[H3808]] discovered [[H1540]] thereon. [[H5921]]
