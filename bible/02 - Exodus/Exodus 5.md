### 1
And afterward [[H310]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went in, [[H935]] and told [[H559]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]]  Let [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may hold a feast [[H2287]] unto me in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 2
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] I should obey [[H8085]] his voice [[H6963]]  to let [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] go? [[H7971]] I know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the Lord, [[H3068]] neither [[H3808]]  will I let [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] go. [[H7971]]

### 3
And they said, [[H559]] The God [[H430]] of the Hebrews [[H5680]] hath met [[H7122]] with [[H5921]] us: let us go, [[H1980]] we pray thee, [[H4994]] three [[H7969]] days' [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] into the desert, [[H4057]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] lest [[H6435]] he fall upon [[H6293]] us with pestilence, [[H1698]] or [[H176]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Wherefore [[H4100]] do ye, Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] let [[H6544]] the people [[H5971]] from their works? [[H4639]] get [[H1980]] you unto your burdens. [[H5450]]

### 5
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] now [[H6258]] many, [[H7227]] and ye make them rest [[H7673]] from their burdens. [[H5450]]

### 6
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] commanded [[H6680]] the same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the taskmasters [[H5065]] of the people, [[H5971]] and their officers, [[H7860]] saying, [[H559]]

### 7
Ye shall no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] give [[H5414]] the people [[H5971]] straw [[H8401]] to make [[H3835]] brick, [[H3843]] as heretofore: [[H8032]] let them [[H1992]] go [[H1980]] and gather [[H7197]] straw [[H8401]] for themselves. [[H8401]]

### 8
And the tale [[H4971]] of the bricks, [[H3843]] which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] did make [[H6213]] heretofore, [[H8032]] ye shall lay [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] them; ye shall not [[H3808]] diminish [[H1639]] thereof: [[H4480]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] idle; [[H7503]] therefore [[H3651]] they [[H1992]] cry, [[H6817]] saying, [[H559]] Let us go [[H1980]] sacrifice [[H2076]] to our God. [[H430]]

### 9
Let there more work [[H5656]] be laid [[H3513]] upon [[H5921]] the men, [[H376]] that they may labour [[H6213]] therein; and let them not [[H408]] regard [[H8159]] vain [[H8267]] words. [[H1697]]

### 10
And the taskmasters [[H5065]] of the people [[H5971]] went out, [[H3318]] and their officers, [[H7860]] and they spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] I will not [[H369]] give [[H5414]] you straw. [[H8401]]

### 11
Go [[H1980]] ye, [[H859]] get [[H3947]] you straw [[H8401]] where [[H834]] ye can find [[H4672]] it: yet [[H3588]] not [[H369]] ought [[H1697]] of your work [[H5656]] shall be diminished. [[H1639]]

### 12
So the people [[H5971]] were scattered abroad [[H6327]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to gather [[H7197]] stubble [[H7179]] instead of straw. [[H8401]]

### 13
And the taskmasters [[H5065]] hasted [[H213]] saying, [[H559]] Fulfil [[H3615]] your works, [[H4639]] daily [[H3117]] tasks, [[H1697]] as when [[H834]] there was [[H1961]] straw. [[H8401]]

### 14
And the officers [[H7860]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] taskmasters [[H5065]] had set [[H7760]] over [[H5921]] them, were beaten, [[H5221]] demanded, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4069]] have ye not [[H3808]] fulfilled [[H3615]] your task [[H2706]] in making brick [[H3835]] both [[H1571]] yesterday [[H8543]] and [[H1571]] to day, [[H3117]] as heretofore? [[H8032]]

### 15
Then the officers [[H7860]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] and cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] saying, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] dealest [[H6213]] thou thus [[H3541]] with thy servants? [[H5650]]

### 16
There is no [[H369]] straw [[H8401]] given [[H5414]] unto thy servants, [[H5650]] and they say [[H559]] to us, Make [[H6213]] brick: [[H3843]] and, behold, [[H2009]] thy servants [[H5650]] beaten; [[H5221]] but the fault [[H2398]] in thine own people. [[H5971]]

### 17
But he said, [[H559]] Ye [[H859]] idle, [[H7503]] idle: [[H7503]] therefore [[H3651]] ye [[H859]] say, [[H559]] Let us go [[H1980]] do sacrifice [[H2076]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
Go [[H1980]] therefore now, [[H6258]] work; [[H5647]] for there shall no [[H3808]] straw [[H8401]] be given [[H5414]] you, yet shall ye deliver [[H5414]] the tale [[H8506]] of bricks. [[H3843]]

### 19
And the officers [[H7860]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did see [[H7200]] they in evil [[H7451]] after it was said, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] minish [[H1639]] from your bricks [[H3843]] of your daily [[H3117]] task. [[H1697]]

### 20
And they met [[H6293]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] who stood [[H5324]] in the way, [[H7125]] as they came forth [[H3318]] from [[H853]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]]

### 21
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, The Lord [[H3068]] look [[H7200]] upon [[H5921]] you, and judge; [[H8199]] because [[H834]]  ye have made [[H853]] our savour [[H7381]] to be abhorred [[H887]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and in the eyes [[H5869]] of his servants, [[H5650]] to put [[H5414]] a sword [[H2719]] in their hand [[H3027]] to slay [[H2026]] us. [[H2026]]

### 22
And Moses [[H4872]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] Lord, [[H136]] wherefore [[H4100]] hast thou evil entreated [[H7489]] this [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] why [[H4100]] it [[H2088]] thou hast sent [[H7971]] me? [[H7971]]

### 23
For since [[H227]] I came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] to speak [[H1696]] in thy name, [[H8034]] he hath done evil [[H7489]] to this [[H2088]] people; [[H5971]] neither [[H3808]] hast thou delivered [[H5337]] thy people [[H5971]] at all. [[H5337]]
