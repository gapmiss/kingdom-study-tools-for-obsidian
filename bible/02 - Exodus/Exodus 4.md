### 1
And Moses [[H4872]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] But, behold, [[H2005]] they will not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] me, nor [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto my voice: [[H6963]] for [[H3588]] they will say, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, What that [[H2088]] in thine hand? [[H3027]] And he said, [[H559]] A rod. [[H4294]]

### 3
And he said, [[H559]] Cast [[H7993]] it on the ground. [[H776]] And he cast [[H7993]] it on the ground, [[H776]] and it became [[H1961]] a serpent; [[H5175]] and Moses [[H4872]] fled [[H5127]] from before [[H6440]] it. [[H6440]]

### 4
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Put forth [[H7971]] thine hand, [[H3027]] and take [[H270]] it by the tail. [[H2180]] And he put forth [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] and caught [[H2388]] it, and it became [[H1961]] a rod [[H4294]] in his hand: [[H3709]]

### 5
That [[H4616]] they may believe [[H539]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] the God [[H430]] of Isaac, [[H3327]] and the God [[H430]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] hath appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] furthermore [[H5750]] unto him, Put [[H935]] now [[H4994]] thine hand [[H3027]] into thy bosom. [[H2436]] And he put [[H935]] his hand [[H3027]] into his bosom: [[H2436]] and when he took [[H3318]] it out, behold, [[H2009]] his hand [[H3027]] leprous [[H6879]] as snow. [[H7950]]

### 7
And he said, [[H559]] Put again. [[H7725]] thine hand [[H3027]] into [[H413]] thy bosom [[H2436]] And he put again; [[H7725]] his hand [[H3027]] into [[H413]] his bosom [[H2436]] and plucked it out [[H3318]] of his bosom, [[H2436]] and, behold, [[H2009]] it was turned again [[H7725]] as his flesh. [[H1320]]

### 8
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] they will not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] thee, neither [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the first [[H7223]] sign, [[H226]] that they will believe [[H539]] the voice [[H6963]] of the latter [[H314]] sign. [[H226]]

### 9
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] they will not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] also [[H1571]] these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] signs, [[H226]] neither [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto thy voice, [[H6963]] that thou shalt take [[H3947]] of the water [[H4325]] of the river, [[H2975]] and pour [[H8210]] upon the dry [[H3004]] and the water [[H4325]] which [[H834]] thou takest [[H3947]] out of [[H4480]] the river [[H2975]] shall become [[H1961]] blood [[H1818]] upon the dry [[H3006]]

### 10
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O [[H994]] my Lord, [[H136]] I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] eloquent, [[H1697]] neither [[H1571]] heretofore, [[H8032]] nor [[H1571]] since [[H227]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thy servant: [[H5650]] but [[H3588]] I [[H595]] slow [[H3515]] of speech, [[H6310]] and of a slow [[H3515]] tongue. [[H3956]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Who [[H4310]] hath made [[H7760]] man's [[H120]] mouth? [[H6310]] or [[H176]] who [[H4310]] maketh [[H7760]] the dumb, [[H483]] or [[H176]] deaf, [[H2795]] or [[H176]] the seeing, [[H6493]] or [[H176]] the blind? [[H5787]] have not [[H3808]] I [[H595]] the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 12
Now [[H6258]] therefore go, [[H1980]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thy mouth, [[H6310]] and teach [[H3384]] thee what [[H834]] thou shalt say. [[H1696]]

### 13
And he said, [[H559]] O [[H994]] my Lord, [[H136]] send, [[H7971]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] by the hand [[H3027]] thou wilt send. [[H7971]]

### 14
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Moses, [[H4872]] and he said, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] Aaron [[H175]] the Levite [[H3881]] thy brother? [[H251]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] can speak [[H1696]] well. [[H1696]] And also, [[H1571]] behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] cometh forth [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] thee: and when he seeth [[H7200]] thee, he will be glad [[H8056]] in his heart. [[H3820]]

### 15
And thou shalt speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, and put [[H7760]] words [[H1697]] in his mouth: [[H6310]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thy mouth, [[H6310]] and with [[H5973]] his mouth, [[H6310]] and will teach [[H3384]]  you [[H853]] what [[H834]] ye shall do. [[H6213]]

### 16
And he [[H1931]] shall be thy spokesman [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the people: [[H5971]] and he shall be, [[H1961]] he [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] to thee instead of a mouth, [[H6310]] and thou [[H859]] shalt be [[H1961]] to him instead of God. [[H430]]

### 17
And thou shalt take [[H3947]] this [[H2088]] rod [[H4294]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] wherewith [[H834]] thou shalt do [[H6213]] signs. [[H226]]

### 18
And Moses [[H4872]] went [[H1980]] and returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Jethro [[H3503]] his father in law, [[H2859]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Let me go, [[H1980]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] my brethren [[H251]] which [[H834]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and see [[H7200]] whether they be yet [[H5750]] alive. [[H2416]] And Jethro [[H3503]] said [[H559]] to Moses, [[H4872]] Go [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 19
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in Midian, [[H4080]] Go, [[H1980]] return [[H7725]] into Egypt: [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] are dead [[H4191]] which sought [[H1245]] thy life. [[H5315]]

### 20
And Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] his wife [[H802]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and set [[H7392]] them upon [[H5921]] an ass, [[H2543]] and he returned [[H7725]] to the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] and Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the rod [[H4294]] of God [[H430]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] When thou goest [[H1980]] to return [[H7725]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] see [[H7200]] that thou do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] those wonders [[H4159]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] which [[H834]] I have put [[H7760]] in thine hand: [[H3027]] but I [[H589]] will harden [[H2388]] his heart, [[H3820]] that he shall not [[H3808]]  let [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] go. [[H7971]]

### 22
And thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Israel [[H3478]] my son, [[H1121]] my firstborn: [[H1060]]

### 23
And I say [[H559]] unto [[H413]]  thee, Let [[H853]] my son [[H1121]] go, [[H7971]] that he may serve [[H5647]] me: and if thou refuse [[H3985]] to let him go, [[H7971]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will slay [[H2026]] thy son, [[H1121]] thy firstborn. [[H1060]]

### 24
And it came to pass [[H1961]] by the way [[H1870]] in the inn, [[H4411]] that the Lord [[H3068]] met [[H6298]] him, and sought [[H1245]] to kill [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 25
Then Zipporah [[H6855]] took [[H3947]] a sharp stone, [[H6864]] and cut off [[H3772]] the foreskin [[H6190]] of her son, [[H1121]] and cast [[H5060]] at his feet, [[H7272]] and said, [[H559]] Surely [[H3588]] a bloody [[H1818]] husband [[H2860]] thou [[H859]] to me. [[H859]]

### 26
So he let him go: [[H7503]] then [[H227]] she said, [[H559]] A bloody [[H1818]] husband [[H2860]] because of the circumcision. [[H4139]]

### 27
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Go [[H1980]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] to meet [[H7125]] Moses. [[H4872]] And he went, [[H1980]] and met [[H6298]] him in the mount [[H2022]] of God, [[H430]] and kissed [[H5401]] him. [[H5401]]

### 28
And Moses [[H4872]] told [[H5046]] Aaron [[H175]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] who [[H834]] had sent [[H7971]] him, and all [[H3605]] the signs [[H226]] which [[H834]] he had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H6680]]

### 29
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went [[H1980]] and gathered together [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 30
And Aaron [[H175]] spake [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and did [[H6213]] the signs [[H226]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 31
And the people [[H5971]] believed: [[H539]] and when they heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had visited [[H6485]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and that [[H3588]] he had looked upon [[H7200]] their affliction, [[H6040]] then they bowed their heads [[H6915]] and worshipped.
