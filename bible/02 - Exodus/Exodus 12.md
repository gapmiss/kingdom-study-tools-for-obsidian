### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
This [[H2088]] month [[H2320]] unto you the beginning [[H7218]] of months: [[H2320]] it [[H1931]] the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] of the year [[H8141]] to you. [[H8141]]

### 3
Speak [[H1696]] ye unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] In the tenth [[H6218]] of this [[H2088]] month [[H2320]] they shall take [[H3947]] to them every man [[H376]] a lamb, [[H7716]] according to the house [[H1004]] of fathers, [[H1]] a lamb [[H7716]] for an house: [[H1004]]

### 4
And if [[H518]] the household [[H1004]] be [[H1961]] too little [[H4591]] for the lamb, [[H7716]] let him [[H1931]] and his neighbour [[H7934]] next [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] his house [[H1004]] take [[H3947]] according to the number [[H4373]] of the souls; [[H5315]] every man [[H376]] according to [[H6310]] his eating [[H400]] shall make your count [[H3699]] for [[H5921]] the lamb. [[H7716]]

### 5
Your lamb [[H7716]] shall be [[H1961]] without blemish, [[H8549]] a male [[H2145]] of the first [[H1121]] year: [[H8141]] ye shall take [[H3947]] out from [[H4480]] the sheep, [[H3532]] or from [[H4480]] the goats: [[H5795]]

### 6
And ye shall keep [[H4931]] it up until [[H5704]] the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the same [[H2088]] month: [[H2320]] and the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall kill [[H7819]] it in [[H996]] the evening. [[H6153]]

### 7
And they shall take [[H3947]] of [[H4480]] the blood, [[H1818]] and strike [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] side posts [[H4201]] and on [[H5921]] the upper door post [[H4947]] of [[H5921]] the houses, [[H1004]] wherein [[H834]] they shall eat [[H398]] it. [[H398]]

### 8
And they shall eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] in that [[H2088]] night, [[H3915]] roast [[H6748]] with fire, [[H784]] and unleavened bread; [[H4682]] with [[H5921]] bitter [[H4844]] they shall eat [[H398]] it. [[H398]]

### 9
Eat [[H398]] not [[H408]] of [[H4480]] it raw, [[H4995]] nor sodden [[H1310]] at all [[H1311]] with water, [[H4325]] but [[H518]] roast [[H6748]] fire; [[H784]] his head [[H7218]] with [[H5921]] his legs, [[H3767]] and with [[H5921]] the purtenance [[H7130]] thereof. [[H7130]]

### 10
And ye shall let nothing [[H3808]] of [[H4480]] it remain [[H3498]] until [[H5704]] the morning; [[H1242]] and that which remaineth [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] it until [[H5704]] the morning [[H1242]] ye shall burn [[H8313]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 11
And thus [[H3602]] shall ye eat [[H398]] it; your loins [[H4975]] girded, [[H2296]] your shoes [[H5275]] on your feet, [[H7272]] and your staff [[H4731]] in your hand; [[H3027]] and ye shall eat [[H398]] it in haste: [[H2649]] it [[H1931]] the Lord's [[H3068]] passover. [[H6453]]

### 12
For I will pass through [[H5674]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] this [[H2088]] night, [[H3915]] and will smite [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] both man [[H120]] and beast; [[H929]] and against all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of Egypt [[H4714]] I will execute [[H6213]] judgment: [[H8201]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And the blood [[H1818]] shall be [[H1961]] to you for a token [[H226]] upon [[H5921]] the houses [[H1004]] where [[H834]] ye [[H859]] and when I see [[H7200]] the blood, [[H1818]] I will pass [[H6452]] over [[H5921]] you, and the plague [[H5063]] shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] upon you to destroy [[H4889]] when I smite [[H5221]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 14
And this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] shall be [[H1961]] unto you for a memorial; [[H2146]] and ye shall keep [[H2287]] it a feast [[H2282]] to the Lord [[H3068]] throughout your generations; [[H1755]] ye shall keep it a feast [[H2287]] by an ordinance [[H2708]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 15
Seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] shall ye eat [[H398]] unleavened bread; [[H4682]] even [[H389]] the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] ye shall put away [[H7673]] leaven [[H7603]] out of your houses: [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] whosoever [[H3605]] eateth [[H398]] leavened bread [[H2557]] from the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] that [[H1931]] soul [[H5315]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from Israel. [[H3478]]

### 16
And in the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] an holy [[H6944]] convocation, [[H4744]] and in the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] there shall be [[H1961]] an holy [[H6944]] convocation [[H4744]] to you; no [[H3808]] manner [[H3605]] of work [[H4399]] shall be done [[H6213]] in them, save [[H389]] which [[H834]] every [[H3605]] man [[H5315]] must eat, [[H398]] that [[H1931]] only [[H905]] may be done [[H6213]] of you. [[H6213]]

### 17
And ye shall observe [[H8104]] unleavened bread; [[H4682]] for [[H3588]] in this [[H2088]] selfsame [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] have I brought [[H3318]] your armies [[H6635]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] therefore shall ye observe [[H8104]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] in your generations [[H1755]] by an ordinance [[H2708]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 18
In the first [[H7223]] on the fourteenth [[H6240]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] at even, [[H6153]] ye shall eat [[H398]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] until [[H5704]] the one [[H259]] and twentieth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] at even. [[H6153]]

### 19
Seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] shall there be no [[H3808]] leaven [[H7603]] found [[H4672]] in your houses: [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] whosoever [[H3605]] eateth [[H398]] that which is leavened, [[H2557]] even that [[H1931]] soul [[H5315]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whether he be a stranger, [[H1616]] or born [[H249]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 20
Ye shall eat [[H398]] nothing [[H3808]] leavened; [[H2557]] in all [[H3605]] your habitations [[H4186]] shall ye eat [[H398]] unleavened bread. [[H4682]]

### 21
Then Moses [[H4872]] called [[H7121]] for all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Draw out [[H4900]] and take [[H3947]] you a lamb [[H6629]] according to your families, [[H4940]] and kill [[H7819]] the passover. [[H6453]]

### 22
And ye shall take [[H3947]] a bunch [[H92]] of hyssop, [[H231]] and dip [[H2881]] in the blood [[H1818]] that [[H834]] in the bason, [[H5592]] and strike [[H5060]] the lintel [[H4947]] and the two [[H8147]] side posts [[H4201]] with [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] that [[H834]] in the bason; [[H5592]] and none [[H376]] of you [[H859]] shall go out [[H3318]] at the door [[H6607]] of his house [[H1004]] until [[H5704]] the morning. [[H1242]]

### 23
For the Lord [[H3068]] will pass through [[H5674]] to smite [[H5062]] the Egyptians; [[H4714]] and when he seeth [[H7200]] the blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] the lintel, [[H4947]] and on [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] side posts, [[H4201]] the Lord [[H3068]] will pass [[H6452]] over [[H5921]] the door, [[H6607]] and will not [[H3808]] suffer [[H5414]] the destroyer [[H7843]] to come in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] your houses [[H1004]] to smite [[H5062]]

### 24
And ye shall observe [[H8104]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] for an ordinance [[H2706]] to thee and to thy sons [[H1121]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 25
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] ye be come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] will give [[H5414]] you, according as [[H834]] he hath promised, [[H1696]] that ye shall keep [[H8104]] this [[H2063]] service. [[H5656]]

### 26
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] your children [[H1121]] shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, What [[H4100]] mean ye by this [[H2063]] service? [[H5656]]

### 27
That ye shall say, [[H559]] It [[H1931]] the sacrifice [[H2077]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] passover, [[H6453]] who [[H834]] passed [[H6452]] over [[H5921]] the houses [[H1004]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] when he smote [[H5062]] the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and delivered [[H5337]] our houses. [[H1004]] And the people [[H5971]] bowed the head [[H6915]] and worshipped. [[H7812]]

### 28
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went away, [[H1980]] and did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] they. [[H6213]]

### 29
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that at midnight [[H2677]] the Lord [[H3068]] smote [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the firstborn [[H1060]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] that sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne [[H3678]] unto [[H5704]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of the captive [[H7628]] that [[H834]] in the dungeon; [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of cattle. [[H929]]

### 30
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] rose up [[H6965]] in the night, [[H3915]] he, [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5650]] and all [[H3605]] the Egyptians; [[H4714]] and there was [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] cry [[H6818]] in Egypt; [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] not [[H369]] a house [[H1004]] where [[H8033]] not [[H369]] one dead. [[H4191]]

### 31
And he called [[H7121]] for Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] by night, [[H3915]] and said, [[H559]] Rise up, [[H6965]] get you forth [[H3318]] from among [[H8432]] my people, [[H5971]] both [[H1571]] ye [[H859]] and [[H1571]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and go, [[H1980]] serve [[H5647]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as ye have said. [[H1696]]

### 32
Also [[H1571]] take [[H3947]] your flocks [[H6629]] and [[H1571]] your herds, [[H1241]] as [[H834]] ye have said, [[H1696]] and be gone; [[H1980]] and bless [[H1288]] me also. [[H1571]]

### 33
And the Egyptians [[H4714]] were urgent [[H2388]] upon [[H5921]] the people, [[H5971]] that they might send [[H7971]] them out of [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] in haste; [[H4116]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] We all [[H3605]] dead [[H4191]]

### 34
And the people [[H5971]] took [[H5375]] their dough [[H1217]] before [[H2962]] it was leavened, [[H2556]] their kneadingtroughs [[H4863]] being bound up [[H6887]] in their clothes [[H8071]] upon [[H5921]] their shoulders. [[H7926]]

### 35
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Moses; [[H4872]] and they borrowed [[H7592]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] jewels [[H3627]] of silver, [[H3701]] and jewels [[H3627]] of gold, [[H2091]] and raiment: [[H8071]]

### 36
And the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] the people [[H5971]] favour [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Egyptians, [[H4714]] so that they lent [[H7592]] unto them And they spoiled [[H5337]] the Egyptians. [[H4714]]

### 37
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] journeyed [[H5265]] from Rameses [[H7486]] to Succoth, [[H5523]] about six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] on foot [[H7273]] men, [[H1397]] beside [[H905]] children. [[H2945]]

### 38
And a mixed [[H6154]] multitude [[H7227]] went up [[H5927]] also [[H1571]] with [[H854]] them; and flocks, [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] very [[H3966]] much [[H3515]] cattle. [[H4735]]

### 39
And they baked [[H644]] unleavened [[H4682]] cakes [[H5692]]  of [[H853]] the dough [[H1217]] which [[H834]] they brought forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] it was not leavened; [[H2556]] because [[H3588]] they were thrust out [[H1644]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] tarry, [[H4102]] neither [[H3808]] had they prepared [[H6213]] for themselves any victual. [[H6720]]

### 40
Now the sojourning [[H4186]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H834]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and thirty [[H7970]] years. [[H8141]]

### 41
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7093]] of the four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and thirty [[H7970]] years, [[H8141]] even the selfsame [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] it came to pass, [[H1961]] that all [[H3605]] the hosts [[H6635]] of the Lord [[H3068]] went out [[H3318]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 42
It [[H1931]] a night [[H3915]] to be much observed [[H8107]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] for bringing [[H3318]] them out from the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] this [[H2088]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to be observed [[H8107]] of all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in their generations. [[H1755]]

### 43
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] This [[H2063]] the ordinance [[H2708]] of the passover: [[H6453]] There shall no [[H3605]] stranger [[H1121]] eat [[H398]] thereof: [[H398]]

### 44
But every [[H3605]] man's [[H376]] servant [[H5650]] that is bought [[H4736]] for money, [[H3701]] when thou hast circumcised [[H4135]] him, then [[H227]] shall he eat [[H398]] thereof. [[H398]]

### 45
A foreigner [[H8453]] and an hired servant [[H7916]] shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] thereof. [[H398]]

### 46
In one [[H259]] house [[H1004]] shall it be eaten; [[H398]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] carry forth [[H3318]] ought of [[H4480]] the flesh [[H1320]] abroad [[H2351]] out of [[H4480]] the house; [[H1004]] neither [[H3808]] shall ye break [[H7665]] a bone [[H6106]] thereof. [[H6106]]

### 47
All [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall keep [[H6213]] it. [[H6213]]

### 48
And when [[H3588]] a stranger [[H1616]] shall sojourn [[H1481]] with [[H854]] thee, and will keep [[H6213]] the passover [[H6453]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] let all [[H3605]] his males [[H2145]] be circumcised, [[H4135]] and then [[H227]] let him come near [[H7126]] and keep [[H6213]] it; and he shall be [[H1961]] as one that is born in [[H249]] the land: [[H776]] for no uncircumcised person [[H6189]] shall eat [[H398]] thereof. [[H398]]

### 49
One [[H259]] law [[H8451]] shall be [[H1961]] to him that is homeborn, [[H249]] and unto the stranger [[H1616]] that sojourneth [[H1481]] among [[H8432]] you. [[H8432]]

### 50
Thus did [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] they. [[H6213]]

### 51
And it came to pass [[H1961]] the selfsame [[H6106]] day, [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] did bring [[H3318]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by [[H5921]] their armies. [[H6635]]
