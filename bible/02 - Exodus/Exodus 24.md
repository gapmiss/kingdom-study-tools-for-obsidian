### 10
And they saw [[H7200]] the God [[H430]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and under [[H8478]] his feet [[H7272]] as it were a paved [[H3840]] work [[H4639]] of a sapphire stone, [[H5601]] and as it were the body [[H6106]] of heaven [[H8064]] in clearness. [[H2892]]

[[H3384]]

### 13
And Moses [[H4872]] rose up, [[H6965]] and his minister [[H8334]] Joshua: [[H3091]] and Moses [[H4872]] went up [[H5927]] into [[H413]] the mount [[H2022]] of God. [[H430]]
