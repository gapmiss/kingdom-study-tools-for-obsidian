### 1
And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] journeyed [[H5265]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] of Sin, [[H5512]] after their journeys, [[H4550]] according to [[H5921]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and pitched [[H2583]] in Rephidim: [[H7508]] and no [[H369]] water [[H4325]] for the people [[H5971]] to drink. [[H8354]]

### 2
Wherefore the people [[H5971]] did chide [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] Moses, [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]] us water [[H4325]] that we may drink. [[H8354]] And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto them, Why [[H4100]] chide [[H7378]] ye with [[H5978]] me? wherefore [[H4100]] do ye tempt [[H5254]] the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 3
And the people [[H5971]] thirsted [[H6770]] there [[H8033]] for water; [[H4325]] and the people [[H5971]] murmured [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses, [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] thou hast brought [[H5927]] us up out of Egypt, [[H4714]] to kill [[H4191]] us and our children [[H1121]] and our cattle [[H4735]] with thirst? [[H6772]]

### 4
And Moses [[H4872]] cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] unto this [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] they be almost [[H4592]] ready [[H5750]] to stone [[H5619]] me. [[H5619]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Go on [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the people, [[H5971]] and take [[H3947]] with [[H854]] thee of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and thy rod, [[H4294]] wherewith [[H834]] thou smotest [[H5221]] the river, [[H2975]] take [[H3947]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] and go. [[H1980]]

### 6
Behold, [[H2005]] I will stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] thee there [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] the rock [[H6697]] in Horeb; [[H2722]] and thou shalt smite [[H5221]] the rock, [[H6697]] and there shall come [[H3318]] water [[H4325]] out of [[H4480]] it, that the people [[H5971]] may drink. [[H8354]] And Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the place [[H4725]] Massah, [[H4532]] and Meribah, [[H4809]] because of [[H5921]] the chiding [[H7379]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and because [[H5921]] they tempted [[H5254]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Is [[H3426]] the Lord [[H3068]] among [[H7130]] us, or [[H518]] not? [[H369]]

### 8
Then came [[H935]] Amalek, [[H6002]] and fought [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] Israel [[H3478]] in Rephidim. [[H7508]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Choose us out [[H977]] men, [[H376]] and go out, [[H3318]] fight [[H3898]] with Amalek: [[H6002]] to morrow [[H4279]] I [[H595]] will stand [[H5324]] on [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of the hill [[H1389]] with the rod [[H4294]] of God [[H430]] in mine hand. [[H3027]]

### 10
So Joshua [[H3091]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had said [[H559]] to him, and fought [[H3898]] with Amalek: [[H6002]] and Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and Hur [[H2354]] went up [[H5927]] to the top [[H7218]] of the hill. [[H1389]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] held up [[H7311]] his hand, [[H3027]] that Israel [[H3478]] prevailed: [[H1396]] and when [[H834]] he let down [[H5117]] his hand, [[H3027]] Amalek [[H6002]] prevailed. [[H1396]]

### 12
But Moses' [[H4872]] hands [[H3027]] heavy; [[H3515]] and they took [[H3947]] a stone, [[H68]] and put [[H7760]] under [[H8478]] him, and he sat [[H3427]] thereon; [[H5921]] and Aaron [[H175]] and Hur [[H2354]] stayed up [[H8551]] his hands, [[H3027]] the one [[H259]] on the one side, [[H2088]] and the other [[H259]] on the other side; [[H2088]] and his hands [[H3027]] were [[H1961]] steady [[H530]] until [[H5704]] the going down [[H935]] of the sun. [[H8121]]

### 13
And Joshua [[H3091]] discomfited [[H2522]] Amalek [[H6002]] and his people [[H5971]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Write [[H3789]] this [[H2063]] a memorial [[H2146]] in a book, [[H5612]] and rehearse [[H7760]] in the ears [[H241]] of Joshua: [[H3091]] for [[H3588]] I will utterly [[H4229]] put out [[H4229]] the remembrance [[H2143]] of Amalek [[H6002]] from under [[H8478]] heaven. [[H8064]]

### 15
And Moses [[H4872]] built [[H1129]] an altar, [[H4196]] and called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of it Jehovah-nissi: [[H3068]]

### 16
For he said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3050]] hath sworn [[H3027]] the Lord [[H3068]] war [[H4421]] with Amalek [[H6002]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]
