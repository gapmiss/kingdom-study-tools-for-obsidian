### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Go [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]]  Let [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may serve [[H5647]] me. [[H5647]]

### 2
And if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] refuse [[H3986]] to let go, [[H7971]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will smite [[H5062]] all [[H3605]] thy borders [[H1366]] with frogs: [[H6854]]

### 3
And the river [[H2975]] shall bring forth [[H8317]] frogs [[H6854]] abundantly, which shall go up [[H5927]] and come [[H935]] into thine house, [[H1004]] and into thy bedchamber, [[H2315]] and upon [[H5921]] thy bed, [[H4296]] and into the house [[H1004]] of thy servants, [[H5650]] and upon thy people, [[H5971]] and into thine ovens, [[H8574]] and into thy kneadingtroughs: [[H4863]]

### 4
And the frogs [[H6854]] shall come up [[H5927]] both on thee, and upon thy people, [[H5971]] and upon all [[H3605]] thy servants. [[H5650]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Stretch forth [[H5186]] thine hand [[H3027]] with thy rod [[H4294]] over [[H5921]] the streams, [[H5104]] over [[H5921]] the rivers, [[H2975]] and over [[H5921]] the ponds, [[H98]]  and cause [[H853]] frogs [[H6854]] to come up [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 6
And Aaron [[H175]] stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] and the frogs [[H6854]] came up, [[H5927]] and covered [[H3680]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 7
And the magicians [[H2748]] did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] with their enchantments, [[H3909]] and brought up [[H5927]] frogs [[H6854]] upon [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 8
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] called [[H7121]] for Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] and said, [[H559]] Intreat [[H6279]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that he may take away [[H5493]] the frogs [[H6854]] from [[H4480]] me, and from my people; [[H5971]]  and I will let [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may do sacrifice [[H2076]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Glory [[H6286]] over [[H5921]] me: when [[H4970]] shall I intreat [[H6279]] for thee, and for thy servants, [[H5650]] and for thy people, [[H5971]] to destroy [[H3772]] the frogs [[H6854]] from [[H4480]] thee and thy houses, [[H1004]] they may remain [[H7604]] in the river [[H2975]] only? [[H7535]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] To morrow. [[H4279]] And he said, [[H559]] according to thy word: [[H1697]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] none [[H369]] like unto the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 11
And the frogs [[H6854]] shall depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] thee, and from thy houses, [[H1004]] and from thy servants, [[H5650]] and from thy people; [[H5971]] they shall remain [[H7604]] in the river [[H2975]] only. [[H7535]]

### 12
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went out [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] and Moses [[H4872]] cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] because of [[H1697]] the frogs [[H6854]] which [[H834]] he had brought [[H7760]] against Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Moses; [[H4872]] and the frogs [[H6854]] died [[H4191]] out of [[H4480]] the houses, [[H1004]] out of [[H4480]] the villages, [[H2691]] and out of [[H4480]] the fields. [[H7704]]

### 14
And they gathered them together [[H6651]] upon heaps: [[H2563]] and the land [[H776]] stank. [[H887]]

### 15
But when Pharaoh [[H6547]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] there was [[H1961]] respite, [[H7309]] he hardened [[H3513]] his heart, [[H3820]] and hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] them; as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said. [[H1696]]

### 16
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Stretch out [[H5186]] thy rod, [[H4294]] and smite [[H5221]] the dust [[H6083]] of the land, [[H776]] that it may become [[H1961]] lice [[H3654]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 17
And they did [[H6213]] so; [[H3651]] for Aaron [[H175]] stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] with his rod, [[H4294]] and smote [[H5221]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] and it became [[H1961]] lice [[H3654]] in man, [[H120]] and in beast; [[H929]] all [[H3605]] the dust [[H6083]] of the land [[H776]] became [[H1961]] lice [[H3654]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 18
And the magicians [[H2748]] did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] with their enchantments [[H3909]] to bring forth [[H3318]] lice, [[H3654]] but they could [[H3201]] not: [[H3808]] so there were [[H1961]] lice [[H3654]] upon man, [[H120]] and upon beast. [[H929]]

### 19
Then the magicians [[H2748]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] This [[H1931]] the finger [[H676]] of God: [[H430]] and Pharaoh's [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] was hardened, [[H2388]] and he hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] them; as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said. [[H1696]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Rise up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh; [[H6547]] lo, [[H2009]] he cometh forth [[H3318]] to the water; [[H4325]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Let my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may serve [[H5647]] me. [[H5647]]

### 21
Else, [[H3588]] if [[H518]] thou wilt not [[H369]]  let [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] swarms [[H6157]] upon thee, and upon thy servants, [[H5650]] and upon thy people, [[H5971]] and into thy houses: [[H1004]] and the houses [[H1004]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall be full [[H4390]]  of [[H853]] swarms [[H6157]] and also [[H1571]] the ground [[H127]] whereon [[H5921]] they [[H1992]]

### 22
And I will sever [[H6395]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] in [[H5921]] which [[H834]] my people [[H5971]] dwell, [[H5975]] that no [[H1115]] swarms [[H6157]] shall be [[H1961]] there; [[H8033]] to the end [[H4616]] thou mayest know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 23
And I will put [[H7760]] a division [[H6304]] between [[H996]] my people [[H5971]] and thy people: [[H5971]] to morrow [[H4279]] shall this [[H2088]] sign [[H226]] be. [[H1961]]

### 24
And the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] so; [[H3651]] and there came [[H935]] a grievous [[H3515]] swarm [[H6157]] into the house [[H1004]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and his servants' [[H5650]] houses, [[H1004]] and into all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] the land [[H776]] was corrupted [[H7843]] by reason of [[H6440]] the swarm [[H6157]]

### 25
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] called [[H7121]] for [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and for Aaron, [[H175]] and said, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] ye, sacrifice [[H2076]] to your God [[H430]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 26
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] It is not [[H3808]] meet [[H3559]] so [[H3651]] to do; [[H6213]]  for [[H3588]] we shall sacrifice [[H2076]] the abomination [[H8441]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] to the Lord [[H3068]] our God: [[H430]] lo, [[H2005]] shall we sacrifice [[H2076]] the abomination [[H8441]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] before their eyes, [[H5869]] and will they not [[H3808]] stone [[H5619]] us? [[H5619]]

### 27
We will go [[H1980]] three [[H7969]] days' [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] into the wilderness, [[H4057]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] to the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] he shall command [[H559]] us. [[H413]]

### 28
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] will let you go, [[H7971]] that ye may sacrifice [[H2076]] to the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in the wilderness; [[H4057]] only [[H7535]] ye shall not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] very [[H7368]] far away: [[H7368]] intreat [[H6279]] for me. [[H1157]]

### 29
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] go out [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] thee, and I will intreat [[H6279]] the Lord [[H3068]] that the swarms [[H6157]] may depart [[H5493]] from Pharaoh, [[H6547]] from his servants, [[H5650]] and from his people, [[H5971]] to morrow: [[H4279]] but [[H7535]] let not [[H408]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] deal deceitfully [[H2048]] any more [[H3254]] in not [[H1115]]  letting [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] go [[H7971]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 30
And Moses [[H4872]] went out [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and intreated [[H6279]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 31
And the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Moses; [[H4872]] and he removed [[H5493]] the swarms [[H6157]] from Pharaoh, [[H6547]] from his servants, [[H5650]] and from his people; [[H5971]] there remained [[H7604]] not [[H3808]] one. [[H259]]

### 32
And Pharaoh [[H6547]] hardened [[H3513]] his heart [[H3820]] at this [[H2063]] time [[H6471]] also, [[H1571]] neither [[H3808]]  would he let [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] go. [[H7971]]
