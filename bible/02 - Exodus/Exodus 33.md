### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Depart, [[H1980]] go up [[H5927]] hence, [[H2088]] thou [[H859]] and the people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] thou hast brought up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto Abraham, [[H85]] to Isaac, [[H3327]] and to Jacob, [[H3290]] saying, [[H559]] Unto thy seed [[H2233]] will I give [[H5414]] it: [[H5414]]

### 2
And I will send [[H7971]] an angel [[H4397]] before [[H6440]] thee; and I will drive out [[H1644]] the Canaanite, [[H3669]] the Amorite, [[H567]] and the Hittite, [[H2850]] and the Perizzite, [[H6522]] the Hivite, [[H2340]] and the Jebusite: [[H2983]]

### 3
Unto [[H413]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey: [[H1706]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee; for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a stiffnecked [[H7186]] people: [[H5971]] lest [[H6435]] I consume [[H3615]] thee in the way. [[H1870]]

### 4
And when the people [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] these [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] tidings, [[H1697]] they mourned: [[H56]] and no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] did put [[H7896]] on [[H5921]] him his ornaments. [[H5716]]

### 5
For the Lord [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Ye [[H859]] a stiffnecked [[H7186]] people: [[H5971]] I will come up [[H5927]] into the midst [[H7130]] of thee in a [[H259]] moment, [[H7281]] and consume [[H3615]] thee: therefore now [[H6258]] put off [[H3381]] thy ornaments [[H5716]] from [[H5921]] thee, that I may know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] to do [[H6213]] unto thee. [[H6213]]

### 6
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] stripped themselves [[H5337]]  of [[H853]] their ornaments [[H5716]] by the mount [[H2022]] Horeb. [[H2722]]

### 7
And Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the tabernacle, [[H168]] and pitched [[H5186]] it without [[H2351]] the camp, [[H4264]] afar off [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] the camp, [[H4264]] and called [[H7121]] it the Tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]] And it came to pass, [[H1961]] every one [[H3605]] which sought [[H1245]] the Lord [[H3068]] went out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] which [[H834]] without [[H2351]] the camp. [[H4264]]

### 8
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Moses [[H4872]] went out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] the tabernacle, [[H168]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] rose up, [[H6965]] and stood [[H5324]] every man [[H376]] his tent [[H168]] door, [[H6607]] and looked [[H5027]] after [[H310]] Moses, [[H4872]] until [[H5704]] he was gone [[H935]] into the tabernacle. [[H168]]

### 9
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as Moses [[H4872]] entered into [[H935]] the tabernacle, [[H168]] the cloudy [[H6051]] pillar [[H5982]] descended, [[H3381]] and stood [[H5975]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle, [[H168]] and talked [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 10
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] the cloudy [[H6051]] pillar [[H5982]] stand [[H5975]] the tabernacle [[H168]] door: [[H6607]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] rose up [[H6965]] and worshipped, [[H7812]] every man [[H376]] his tent [[H168]] door. [[H6607]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face, [[H6440]] as [[H834]] a man [[H376]] speaketh [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] his friend. [[H7453]] And he turned again [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the camp: [[H4264]] but his servant [[H8334]] Joshua, [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] a young man, [[H5288]] departed [[H4185]] not [[H3808]] out [[H8432]] of the tabernacle. [[H168]]

### 12
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] See, [[H7200]] thou [[H859]] sayest [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Bring up [[H5927]] this [[H2088]] people: [[H5971]] and thou [[H859]] hast not [[H3808]] let me know [[H3045]] whom [[H834]] thou wilt send [[H7971]] with [[H5973]] me. Yet thou [[H859]] hast said, [[H559]] I know [[H3045]] thee by name, [[H8034]] and thou hast also [[H1571]] found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in my sight. [[H5869]]

### 13
Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] if [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] shew [[H3045]] me now [[H4994]] thy way, [[H1870]] that [[H4616]] I may know [[H3045]] thee, that I may find [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight: [[H5869]] and consider [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] nation [[H1471]] thy people. [[H5971]]

### 14
And he said, [[H559]] My presence [[H6440]] shall go [[H1980]] and I will give thee rest. [[H5117]]

### 15
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, If [[H518]] thy presence [[H6440]] go [[H1980]] not [[H369]] carry us not up [[H5927]] hence. [[H2088]]

### 16
For wherein [[H4100]] shall it be known [[H3045]] here [[H645]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] and thy people [[H5971]] have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight? [[H5869]] not [[H3808]] in that thou goest [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] us? so shall we be separated, [[H6395]] I [[H589]] and thy people, [[H5971]] from all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 17
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] I will do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] also [[H1571]] that [[H834]] thou hast spoken: [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] thou hast found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in my sight, [[H5869]] and I know [[H3045]] thee by name. [[H8034]]

### 18
And he said, [[H559]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] shew [[H7200]]  me [[H853]] thy glory. [[H3519]]

### 19
And he said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] will make all [[H3605]] my goodness [[H2898]] pass [[H5674]] before [[H5921]] thee, and I will proclaim [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] thee; and will be gracious [[H2603]] to whom [[H834]] I will be gracious, [[H2603]] and will shew mercy [[H7355]] on whom [[H834]] I will shew mercy. [[H7355]]

### 20
And he said, [[H559]] Thou canst [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face: [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] there shall no [[H3808]] man [[H120]] see [[H7200]] me, and live. [[H2425]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] a place [[H4725]] by [[H853]] me, and thou shalt stand [[H5324]] upon [[H5921]] a rock: [[H6697]]

### 22
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] while my glory [[H3519]] passeth by, [[H5674]] that I will put [[H7760]] thee in a clift [[H5366]] of the rock, [[H6697]] and will cover [[H5526]] thee with my hand [[H3709]] while [[H5704]] I pass by: [[H5674]]

### 23
And I will take away [[H5493]] mine hand, [[H3709]] and thou shalt see [[H7200]] my back parts: [[H268]] but my face [[H6440]] shall not [[H3808]] be seen. [[H7200]]
