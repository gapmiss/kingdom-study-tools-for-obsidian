### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Hew [[H6458]] thee two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone [[H68]] like unto the first: [[H7223]] and I will write [[H3789]] upon [[H5921]] tables [[H3871]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] in [[H5921]] the first [[H7223]] tables, [[H3871]] which [[H834]] thou brakest. [[H7665]]

### 2
And be [[H1961]] ready [[H3559]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and come up [[H5927]] in the morning [[H1242]] unto [[H413]] mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]] and present thyself [[H5324]] there [[H8033]] to me in [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of the mount. [[H2022]]

### 3
And no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] shall come up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] thee, neither [[H408]] let any man [[H376]] be seen [[H7200]] throughout all [[H3605]] the mount; [[H2022]] neither [[H408]] let the flocks [[H6629]] nor herds [[H1241]] feed [[H7462]] before [[H4136]] that [[H1931]] mount. [[H2022]]

### 4
And he hewed [[H6458]] two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone [[H68]] like unto the first; [[H7223]] and Moses [[H4872]] rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and went up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him, and took [[H3947]] in his hand [[H3027]] the two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone. [[H68]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] descended [[H3381]] in the cloud, [[H6051]] and stood [[H3320]] with [[H5973]] him there, [[H8033]] and proclaimed [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] passed by [[H5674]] before [[H5921]] him, [[H6440]] and proclaimed, [[H7121]] The Lord, [[H3068]] The Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H410]] merciful [[H7349]] and gracious, [[H2587]] longsuffering, [[H750]] and abundant [[H7227]] in goodness [[H2617]] and truth, [[H571]]

### 7
Keeping [[H5341]] mercy [[H2617]] for thousands, [[H505]] forgiving [[H5375]] iniquity [[H5771]] and transgression [[H6588]] and sin, [[H2403]] and that will by no means [[H5352]] clear [[H5352]] visiting [[H6485]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] upon [[H5921]] the children, [[H1121]] and upon [[H5921]] the children's [[H1121]] children, [[H1121]] unto [[H5921]] the third [[H8029]] and to [[H5921]] the fourth [[H7256]]

### 8
And Moses [[H4872]] made haste, [[H4116]] and bowed his head [[H6915]] toward the earth, [[H776]] and worshipped. [[H7812]]

### 9
And he said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] now [[H4994]] I have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] O Lord, [[H136]] let my Lord, [[H136]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] go [[H1980]] among [[H7130]] us; for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] a stiffnecked [[H7186]] people; [[H5971]] and pardon [[H5545]] our iniquity [[H5771]] and our sin, [[H2403]] and take us for thine inheritance. [[H5157]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] make [[H3772]] a covenant: [[H1285]] before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] thy people [[H5971]] I will do [[H6213]] marvels, [[H6381]] such as [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] been done [[H1254]] in all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] nor in any [[H3605]] nation: [[H1471]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] among [[H7130]] which [[H834]] thou [[H859]] shall see [[H7200]] the work [[H4639]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] a terrible thing [[H3372]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 11
Observe [[H8104]]  thou [[H853]] that which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day: [[H3117]] behold, [[H2005]] I drive out [[H1644]] before [[H6440]]  thee [[H853]] the Amorite, [[H567]] and the Canaanite, [[H3669]] and the Hittite, [[H2850]] and the Perizzite, [[H6522]] and the Hivite, [[H2340]] and the Jebusite. [[H2983]]

### 12
Take heed [[H8104]] to thyself, lest [[H6435]] thou make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest, [[H935]] lest [[H6435]] it be [[H1961]] for a snare [[H4170]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee: [[H7130]]

### 13
But [[H3588]] ye shall destroy [[H5422]] their altars, [[H4196]] break [[H7665]] their images, [[H4676]] and cut down [[H3772]] their groves: [[H842]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] thou shalt worship [[H7812]] no [[H3808]] other [[H312]] god: [[H410]] for [[H3588]] the Lord, [[H3068]] whose name [[H8034]] Jealous, [[H7067]] a jealous [[H7067]] God: [[H410]]

### 15
Lest [[H6435]] thou make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] and they go a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] their gods, [[H430]] and do sacrifice [[H2076]] unto their gods, [[H430]] and call [[H7121]] thee, and thou eat [[H398]] of his sacrifice; [[H2077]]

### 16
And thou take [[H3947]] of their daughters [[H1323]] unto thy sons, [[H1121]] and their daughters [[H1323]] go a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] their gods, [[H430]]  and make [[H853]] thy sons [[H1121]] go a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] their gods. [[H430]]

### 17
Thou shalt make [[H6213]] thee no [[H3808]] molten [[H4541]] gods. [[H430]]

### 18
The feast [[H2282]] of unleavened bread [[H4682]] shalt thou keep. [[H8104]] Seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] thou shalt eat [[H398]] unleavened bread, [[H4682]] as [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] thee, in the time [[H4150]] of the month [[H2320]] Abib: [[H24]] for [[H3588]] in the month [[H2320]] Abib [[H24]] thou camest out [[H3318]] from Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 19
All [[H3605]] that openeth [[H6363]] the matrix [[H7358]] mine; and every [[H3605]] firstling [[H6363]] among thy cattle, [[H4735]] ox [[H7794]] or sheep, [[H7716]] male. [[H2142]]

### 20
But the firstling [[H6363]] of an ass [[H2543]] thou shalt redeem [[H6299]] with a lamb: [[H7716]] and if [[H518]] thou redeem [[H6299]] not, [[H3808]] then shalt thou break his neck. [[H6202]] All [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of thy sons [[H1121]] thou shalt redeem. [[H6299]] And none [[H3808]] shall appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] me empty. [[H7387]]

### 21
Six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] thou shalt work, [[H5647]] but on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] thou shalt rest: [[H7673]] in earing time [[H2758]] and in harvest [[H7105]] thou shalt rest. [[H7673]]

### 22
And thou shalt observe [[H6213]] the feast [[H2282]] of weeks, [[H7620]] of the firstfruits [[H1061]] of wheat [[H2406]] harvest, [[H7105]] and the feast [[H2282]] of ingathering [[H614]] at the year's [[H8141]] end. [[H8622]]

### 23
Thrice [[H6471]] in the year [[H8141]] shall all [[H3605]] your men children [[H2138]] appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H113]] God, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] I will cast out [[H3423]] the nations [[H1471]] before [[H6440]] thee, and enlarge [[H7337]] thy borders: [[H1366]] neither [[H3808]] shall any man [[H376]] desire [[H2530]] thy land, [[H776]] when thou shalt go up [[H5927]] to appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] thrice [[H6471]] in the year. [[H8141]]

### 25
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] offer [[H7819]] the blood [[H1818]] of my sacrifice [[H2077]] with [[H5921]] leaven; [[H2557]] neither [[H3808]] shall the sacrifice [[H2077]] of the feast [[H2282]] of the passover [[H6453]] be left [[H3885]] unto the morning. [[H1242]]

### 26
The first [[H7225]] of the firstfruits [[H1061]] of thy land [[H127]] thou shalt bring [[H935]] unto the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] seethe [[H1310]] a kid [[H1423]] in his mother's [[H517]] milk. [[H2461]]

### 27
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Write [[H3789]]  thou [[H853]] these [[H428]] words: [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] after [[H5921]] the tenor [[H6310]] of these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] I have made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] thee and with [[H854]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 28
And he was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] with [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights; [[H3915]] he did neither [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water. [[H4325]] And he wrote [[H3789]] upon [[H5921]] the tables [[H3871]] the words [[H1697]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] the ten [[H6235]] commandments. [[H1697]]

### 29
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Moses [[H4872]] came down [[H3381]] from mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] with the two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of testimony [[H5715]] in Moses' [[H4872]] hand, [[H3027]] when he came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mount, [[H2022]] that Moses [[H4872]] wist [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] the skin [[H5785]] of his face [[H6440]] shone [[H7160]] while he talked [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 30
And when Aaron [[H175]] and all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] Moses, [[H4872]] behold, [[H2009]] the skin [[H5785]] of his face [[H6440]] shone; [[H7160]] and they were afraid [[H3372]] to come nigh [[H5066]] him. [[H5066]]

### 31
And Moses [[H4872]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] them; and Aaron [[H175]] and all [[H3605]] the rulers [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] him: and Moses [[H4872]] talked [[H1696]] with [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 32
And afterward [[H310]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] came nigh: [[H5066]] and he gave them in commandment [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him in mount [[H2022]] Sinai. [[H5514]]

### 33
And Moses [[H4872]] had done [[H3615]] speaking [[H1696]] with [[H854]] them, he put [[H5414]] a vail [[H4533]] on [[H5921]] his face. [[H6440]]

### 34
But when Moses [[H4872]] went in [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] to speak [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him, he took off, [[H5493]] the vail [[H4533]] until [[H5704]] he came out. [[H3318]] And he came out, [[H3318]] and spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] which [[H834]] he was commanded. [[H6680]]

### 35
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] the face [[H6440]] of Moses, [[H4872]] that [[H3588]] the skin [[H5785]] of Moses' [[H4872]] face [[H6440]] shone: [[H7160]] and Moses [[H4872]] put [[H7725]] the vail [[H4533]] upon [[H5921]] his face [[H6440]] again, until [[H5704]] he went in [[H935]] to speak [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]
