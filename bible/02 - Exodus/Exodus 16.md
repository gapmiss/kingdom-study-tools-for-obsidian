### 1
And they took their journey [[H5265]] from Elim, [[H362]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the wilderness [[H4057]] of Sin, [[H5512]] which [[H834]] between [[H996]] Elim [[H362]] and Sinai, [[H5514]] on the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] after their departing out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 2
And the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] murmured [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] in the wilderness: [[H4057]]

### 3
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Would to God [[H4310]] we had died [[H4191]] by the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] when we sat [[H3427]] by [[H5921]] the flesh [[H1320]] pots, [[H5518]] when we did eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] to the full; [[H7648]] for [[H3588]] ye have brought us forth [[H3318]] into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] wilderness, [[H4057]] to kill [[H4191]] this [[H2088]] whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] with hunger. [[H7458]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will rain [[H4305]] bread [[H3899]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] for you; and the people [[H5971]] shall go out [[H3318]] and gather [[H3950]] a certain rate [[H1697]] every day, [[H3117]] that [[H4616]] I may prove [[H5254]] them, whether they will walk [[H1980]] in my law, [[H8451]] or [[H518]] no. [[H3808]]

### 5
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] that on the sixth [[H8345]] day [[H3117]] they shall prepare [[H3559]] which [[H834]] they bring in; [[H935]] and it shall be [[H1961]] twice [[H4932]] as much as [[H834]] they gather [[H3950]] daily. [[H3117]]

### 6
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] At even, [[H6153]] then ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath brought you out [[H3318]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 7
And in the morning, [[H1242]] then ye shall see [[H7200]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] for that he heareth [[H8085]] your murmurings [[H8519]] against [[H5921]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and what [[H4100]] we, [[H5168]] that [[H3588]] ye murmur [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] us? [[H5921]]

### 8
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] when the Lord [[H3068]] shall give [[H5414]] you in the evening [[H6153]] flesh [[H1320]] to eat, [[H398]] and in the morning [[H1242]] bread [[H3899]] to the full; [[H7646]] for that the Lord [[H3068]] heareth [[H8085]] your murmurings [[H8519]] which [[H834]] ye [[H859]] murmur [[H8519]] against [[H5921]] him: and what [[H4100]] we? [[H5168]] your murmurings [[H8519]] not [[H3808]] against [[H5921]] us, but [[H3588]] against [[H5921]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Come near [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he hath heard [[H8085]] your murmurings. [[H8519]]

### 10
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as Aaron [[H175]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they looked [[H6437]] toward [[H413]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] in the cloud. [[H6051]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 12
I have heard [[H8085]] the murmurings [[H8519]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, saying, [[H559]] At [[H996]] even [[H6153]] ye shall eat [[H398]] flesh, [[H1320]] and in the morning [[H1242]] ye shall be filled [[H7646]] with bread; [[H3899]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 13
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that at even [[H6153]] the quails [[H7958]] came up, [[H5927]] and covered [[H3680]] the camp: [[H4264]] and in the morning [[H1242]] the dew [[H2919]] lay [[H7902]] round about [[H5439]] the host. [[H4264]]

### 14
And when the dew [[H2919]] that lay [[H7902]] was gone up, [[H5927]] behold, [[H2009]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] a small [[H1851]] round thing, [[H2636]] small [[H1851]] as the hoar frost [[H3713]] on [[H5921]] the ground. [[H776]]

### 15
And when the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H251]] It [[H1931]] manna: [[H4478]] for [[H3588]] they wist [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] it [[H1931]] And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, This [[H1931]] the bread [[H3899]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]] you to eat. [[H402]]

### 16
This [[H2088]] the thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath commanded, [[H6680]] Gather [[H3950]] of [[H4480]] it every man [[H376]] according to [[H6310]] his eating, [[H400]] an omer [[H6016]] for every man, [[H1538]] the number [[H4557]] of your persons; [[H5315]] take [[H3947]] ye every man [[H376]] for which [[H834]] in his tents. [[H168]]

### 17
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] so, [[H3651]] and gathered, [[H3950]] some more, [[H7235]] some less. [[H4591]]

### 18
And when they did mete [[H4058]] with an omer, [[H6016]] he that gathered much [[H7235]] had nothing over, [[H5736]] and he that gathered little [[H4591]] had no [[H3808]] lack; [[H2637]] they gathered [[H3950]] every man [[H376]] according to [[H6310]] his eating. [[H400]]

### 19
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] Let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] leave [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] it till [[H5704]] the morning. [[H1242]]

### 20
Notwithstanding they hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] Moses; [[H4872]] but some [[H582]] of them left [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] it until [[H5704]] the morning, [[H1242]] and it bred [[H7311]] worms, [[H8438]] and stank: [[H887]] and Moses [[H4872]] was wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 21
And they gathered [[H3950]] it every morning, [[H1242]] every man [[H376]] according to [[H6310]] his eating: [[H400]] and when the sun [[H8121]] waxed hot, [[H2552]] it melted. [[H4549]]

### 22
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] on the sixth [[H8345]] day [[H3117]] they gathered [[H3950]] twice [[H4932]] as much bread, [[H3899]] two [[H8147]] omers [[H6016]] for one [[H259]] and all [[H3605]] the rulers [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] came [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 23
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, This [[H1931]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said, [[H1696]] To morrow [[H4279]] the rest [[H7677]] of the holy [[H6944]] sabbath [[H7676]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] bake [[H644]] which [[H834]] ye will bake [[H644]] and seethe [[H1310]] that [[H834]] ye will seethe; [[H1310]] and that which [[H3605]] remaineth over [[H5736]] lay up [[H3240]] for you to be kept [[H4931]] until [[H5704]] the morning. [[H1242]]

### 24
And they laid it up [[H3240]] till [[H5704]] the morning, [[H1242]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] bade: [[H6680]] and it did not [[H3808]] stink, [[H887]] neither [[H3808]] was [[H1961]] there any worm [[H7415]] therein. [[H7415]]

### 25
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] Eat [[H398]] that to day; [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] to day [[H3117]] a sabbath [[H7676]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] to day [[H3117]] ye shall not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] it in the field. [[H7704]]

### 26
Six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] ye shall gather [[H3950]] it; but on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] the sabbath, [[H7676]] in it there shall be [[H1961]] none. [[H3808]]

### 27
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] there went out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] for to gather, [[H3950]] and they found [[H4672]] none. [[H3808]]

### 28
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] How long [[H575]] refuse [[H3985]] ye to keep [[H8104]] my commandments [[H4687]] and my laws? [[H8451]]

### 29
See, [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] that the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]] you the sabbath, [[H7676]] therefore [[H3651]] he [[H1931]] giveth [[H5414]] you on the sixth [[H8345]] day [[H3117]] the bread [[H3899]] of two days; [[H3117]] abide [[H3427]] ye every man [[H376]] in his place, [[H8478]] let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] go out [[H3318]] of his place [[H4725]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day. [[H3117]]

### 30
So the people [[H5971]] rested [[H7673]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day. [[H3117]]

### 31
And the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] thereof Manna: [[H4478]] and it [[H1931]] like coriander [[H1407]] seed, [[H2233]] white; [[H3836]] and the taste [[H2940]] of it like wafers [[H6838]] with honey. [[H1706]]

### 32
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] the thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commandeth, [[H6680]] Fill [[H4393]] an omer [[H6016]] of [[H4480]] it to be kept [[H4931]] for your generations; [[H1755]] that [[H4616]] they may see [[H7200]] the bread [[H3899]] wherewith [[H834]] I have fed [[H398]] you in the wilderness, [[H4057]] when I brought you forth [[H3318]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 33
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Take [[H3947]] a [[H259]] pot, [[H6803]] and put [[H5414]] an omer [[H6016]] full [[H4393]] of manna [[H4478]] therein, [[H8033]] and lay it up [[H3240]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to be kept [[H4931]] for your generations. [[H1755]]

### 34
As [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses, [[H4872]] so Aaron [[H175]] laid it up [[H3240]] before [[H6440]] the Testimony, [[H5715]] to be kept. [[H4931]]

### 35
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did eat [[H398]] manna [[H4478]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] inhabited; [[H3427]] they did eat [[H398]] manna, [[H4478]] until [[H5704]] they came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the borders [[H7097]] of the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 36
Now an omer [[H6016]] the tenth [[H6224]] of an ephah. [[H374]]
