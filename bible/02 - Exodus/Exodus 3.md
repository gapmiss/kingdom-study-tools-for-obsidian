### 1
Now Moses [[H4872]] kept [[H1961]] the flock [[H6629]] of Jethro [[H3503]] his father in law, [[H2859]] the priest [[H3548]] of Midian: [[H4080]] and he led [[H5090]] the flock [[H6629]] to the backside [[H310]] of the desert, [[H4057]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] of God, [[H430]] to Horeb. [[H2722]]

### 2
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him in a flame [[H3827]] of fire [[H784]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of a bush: [[H5572]] and he looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the bush [[H5572]] burned [[H1197]] with fire, [[H784]] and the bush [[H5572]] not [[H369]] consumed. [[H398]]

### 3
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] I will now [[H4994]] turn aside, [[H5493]] and see [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] sight, [[H4758]] why [[H4069]] the bush [[H5572]] is not [[H3808]] burnt. [[H1197]]

### 4
And when the Lord [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he turned aside [[H5493]] to see, [[H7200]] God [[H430]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] him out of the midst [[H8432]] of the bush, [[H5572]] and said, [[H559]] Moses, [[H4872]] Moses. [[H4872]] And he said, [[H559]] Here [[H2009]] I. [[H2009]]

### 5
And he said, [[H559]] Draw not nigh [[H7126]] hither: [[H1988]] put off [[H5394]] thy shoes [[H5275]] from off [[H5921]] thy feet, [[H7272]] for [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] whereon [[H834]] thou [[H859]] standest [[H5975]] holy [[H6944]] ground. [[H127]]

### 6
Moreover he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] the God [[H430]] of thy father, [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] the God [[H430]] of Isaac, [[H3327]] and the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] And Moses [[H4872]] hid [[H5641]] his face; [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] he was afraid [[H3372]] to look [[H5027]] upon [[H413]] God. [[H430]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] I have surely [[H7200]] seen [[H7200]] the affliction [[H6040]] of my people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and have heard [[H8085]] their cry [[H6818]] by reason of [[H6440]] their taskmasters; [[H5065]] for [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] their sorrows; [[H4341]]

### 8
And I am come down [[H3381]] to deliver [[H5337]] them out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and to bring [[H5927]] them up out of [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] unto [[H413]] a good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] and a large, [[H7342]] unto [[H413]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey; [[H1706]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] and the Hivites, [[H2340]] and the Jebusites. [[H2983]]

### 9
Now [[H6258]] therefore, behold, [[H2009]] the cry [[H6818]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] is come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me: and I have also [[H1571]] seen [[H7200]] the oppression [[H3906]] wherewith [[H834]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] oppress [[H3905]] them. [[H3905]]

### 10
Come [[H1980]] now [[H6258]] therefore, and I will send [[H7971]] thee unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] that thou mayest bring forth [[H3318]] my people [[H5971]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 11
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] Who [[H4310]] I, [[H595]] that [[H3588]] I should go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and that [[H3588]] I should bring forth [[H3318]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of Egypt? [[H4714]]

### 12
And he said, [[H559]] Certainly [[H3588]] I will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee; and this [[H2088]] a token [[H226]] unto thee, that [[H3588]] I [[H595]] have sent [[H7971]] thee: When thou hast brought forth [[H3318]] the people [[H5971]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] ye shall serve [[H5647]] God [[H430]] upon [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] mountain. [[H2022]]

### 13
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and shall say [[H559]] unto them, The God [[H430]] of your fathers [[H1]] hath sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] you; and they shall say [[H559]] to me, What [[H4100]] his name? [[H8034]] what [[H4100]] shall I say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them? [[H413]]

### 14
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] I AM [[H1961]] THAT [[H834]] I AM: [[H1961]] and he said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] shalt thou say [[H559]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I AM [[H1961]] hath sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 15
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] moreover [[H5750]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Thus [[H3541]] shalt thou say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] the God [[H430]] of Isaac, [[H3327]] and the God [[H430]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] hath sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] you: this [[H2088]] my name [[H8034]] for ever, [[H5769]] and this [[H2088]] my memorial [[H2143]] unto all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 16
Go, [[H1980]] and gather together, [[H622]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] of Isaac, [[H3327]] and of Jacob, [[H3290]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] I have surely [[H6485]] visited [[H6485]] you, and that which is done [[H6213]] to you in Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 17
And I have said, [[H559]] I will bring you up [[H5927]] out of the affliction [[H6040]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] and the Hivites, [[H2340]] and the Jebusites, [[H2983]] unto [[H413]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

### 18
And they shall hearken [[H8085]] to thy voice: [[H6963]] and thou shalt come, [[H935]] thou [[H859]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and ye shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of the Hebrews [[H5680]] hath met [[H7136]] with [[H5921]] us: and now [[H6258]] let us go, [[H1980]] we beseech thee, [[H4994]] three [[H7969]] days' [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] into the wilderness, [[H4057]] that we may sacrifice [[H2076]] to the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 19
And I [[H589]] am sure [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] you go, [[H1980]] no, [[H3808]] not by a mighty [[H2389]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 20
And I will stretch out [[H7971]] my hand, [[H3027]] and smite [[H5221]] Egypt [[H4714]] with all [[H3605]] my wonders [[H6381]] which [[H834]] I will do [[H6213]] in the midst [[H7130]] thereof: and after [[H310]] that [[H3651]] he will let you go. [[H7971]]

### 21
And I will give [[H5414]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] favour [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Egyptians: [[H4714]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] that, when [[H3588]] ye go, [[H1980]] ye shall not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] empty: [[H7387]]

### 22
But every woman [[H802]] shall borrow [[H7592]] of her neighbour, [[H7934]] and of her that sojourneth [[H1481]] in her house, [[H1004]] jewels [[H3627]] of silver, [[H3701]] and jewels [[H3627]] of gold, [[H2091]] and raiment: [[H8071]] and ye shall put [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] your sons, [[H1121]] and upon [[H5921]] your daughters; [[H1323]] and ye shall spoil [[H5337]] the Egyptians.
