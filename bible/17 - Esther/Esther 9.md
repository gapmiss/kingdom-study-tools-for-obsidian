### 1
Now in the twelfth [[H8147]] month, [[H2320]] that [[H1931]] the month [[H2320]] Adar, [[H143]] on the thirteenth [[H7969]] day [[H3117]] of the same, when [[H834]] the king's [[H4428]] commandment [[H1697]] and his decree [[H1881]] drew near [[H5060]] to be put in execution, [[H6213]] in the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] the enemies [[H341]] of the Jews [[H3064]] hoped [[H7663]] to have power [[H7980]] over them, (though it [[H1931]] was turned [[H2015]] to the contrary, that [[H834]] the Jews [[H3064]] had rule over [[H7980]] them [[H1992]] that hated [[H8130]] them;) [[H8130]]

### 2
The Jews [[H3064]] gathered themselves together [[H6950]] in their cities [[H5892]] throughout all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of the king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus, [[H325]] to lay [[H7971]] hand [[H3027]] on such as sought [[H1245]] their hurt: [[H7451]] and no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] could withstand [[H5975]] them; [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] the fear [[H6343]] of them fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] people. [[H5971]]

### 3
And all [[H3605]] the rulers [[H8269]] of the provinces, [[H4082]] and the lieutenants, [[H323]] and the deputies, [[H6346]] and officers [[H6213]] of [[H834]] the king, [[H4428]] helped [[H5375]] the Jews; [[H3064]] because [[H3588]] the fear [[H6343]] of Mordecai [[H4782]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] Mordecai [[H4782]] great [[H1419]] in the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and his fame [[H8089]] went out [[H1980]] throughout all [[H3605]] the provinces: [[H4082]] for [[H3588]] this man [[H376]] Mordecai [[H4782]] waxed [[H1980]] greater and greater. [[H1419]]

### 5
Thus the Jews [[H3064]] smote [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] their enemies [[H341]] with the stroke [[H4347]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and slaughter, [[H2027]] and destruction, [[H12]] and did [[H6213]] what they would [[H7522]] unto those that hated [[H8130]] them. [[H8130]]

### 6
And in Shushan [[H7800]] the palace [[H1002]] the Jews [[H3064]] slew [[H2026]] and destroyed [[H6]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] men. [[H376]]

### 7
And Parshandatha, [[H6577]] and Dalphon, [[H1813]] and Aspatha, [[H630]]

### 8
And Poratha, [[H6334]] and Adalia, [[H118]] and Aridatha, [[H743]]

### 9
And Parmashta, [[H6534]] and Arisai, [[H747]] and Aridai, [[H742]] and Vajezatha, [[H2055]]

### 10
The ten [[H6235]] sons [[H1121]] of Haman [[H2001]] the son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha, [[H4099]] the enemy [[H6887]] of the Jews, [[H3064]] slew [[H2026]] they; but on the spoil [[H961]] laid [[H7971]] they not [[H3808]] their hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the number [[H4557]] of those that were slain [[H2026]] in Shushan [[H7800]] the palace [[H1002]] was brought [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 12
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto Esther [[H635]] the queen, [[H4436]] The Jews [[H3064]] have slain [[H2026]] and destroyed [[H6]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] in Shushan [[H7800]] the palace, [[H1002]] and the ten [[H6235]] sons [[H1121]] of Haman; [[H2001]] what [[H4100]] have they done [[H6213]] in the rest [[H7605]] of the king's [[H4428]] provinces? [[H4082]] now what [[H4100]] thy petition? [[H7596]] and it shall be granted [[H5414]] thee: or what [[H4100]] thy request [[H1246]] further? [[H5750]] and it shall be done. [[H6213]]

### 13
Then said [[H559]] Esther, [[H635]] If [[H518]] it please [[H2896]] the king, [[H4428]] let it be granted [[H5414]] to the Jews [[H3064]] which [[H834]] in Shushan [[H7800]] to do [[H6213]] to morrow [[H4279]] also [[H1571]] according unto this day's [[H3117]] decree, [[H1881]] and let Haman's [[H2001]] ten [[H6235]] sons [[H1121]] be hanged [[H8518]] upon [[H5921]] the gallows. [[H6086]]

### 14
And the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H559]] it so [[H3651]] to be done: [[H6213]] and the decree [[H1881]] was given [[H5414]] at Shushan; [[H7800]] and they hanged [[H8518]] Haman's [[H2001]] ten [[H6235]] sons. [[H1121]]

### 15
For the Jews [[H3064]] that [[H834]] in Shushan [[H7800]] gathered themselves together [[H6950]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] also [[H1571]] of the month [[H2320]] Adar, [[H143]] and slew [[H2026]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] at Shushan; [[H7800]] but on the prey [[H961]] they laid [[H7971]] not [[H3808]] their hand. [[H3027]]

### 16
But the other [[H7605]] Jews [[H3064]] that [[H834]] in the king's [[H4428]] provinces [[H4082]] gathered themselves together, [[H6950]] and stood [[H5975]] for [[H5921]] their lives, [[H5315]] and had rest [[H5118]] from their enemies, [[H341]] and slew [[H2026]] of their foes [[H8130]] seventy [[H7657]] and five [[H2568]] thousand, [[H505]] but they laid [[H7971]] not [[H3808]] their hands [[H3027]] on the prey, [[H961]]

### 17
On the thirteenth [[H7969]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] Adar; [[H143]] and on the fourteenth [[H702]] day of the same rested [[H5117]] they, and made [[H6213]] it a day [[H3117]] of feasting [[H4960]] and gladness. [[H8057]]

### 18
But the Jews [[H3064]] that [[H834]] at Shushan [[H7800]] assembled together [[H6950]] on the thirteenth [[H7969]] thereof, and on the fourteenth [[H702]] thereof; and on the fifteenth [[H2568]] of the same they rested, [[H5117]] and made [[H6213]] it a day [[H3117]] of feasting [[H4960]] and gladness. [[H8057]]

### 19
Therefore [[H5921]] the Jews [[H3064]] of the villages, [[H6521]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in the unwalled [[H6519]] towns, [[H5892]] made [[H6213]] the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] Adar [[H143]] gladness [[H8057]] and feasting, [[H4960]] and a good [[H2896]] day, [[H3117]] and of sending [[H4916]] portions [[H4490]] one [[H376]] to another. [[H7453]]

### 20
And Mordecai [[H4782]] wrote [[H3789]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] and sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] that [[H834]] in all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of the king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus, [[H325]] nigh [[H7138]] and far, [[H7350]]

### 21
To stablish [[H6965]] among [[H5921]] them, that they should [[H1961]] keep [[H6213]] the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] Adar, [[H143]] and the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the same, yearly, [[H8141]]

### 22
As the days [[H3117]] wherein [[H834]] the Jews [[H3064]] rested [[H5117]] from their enemies, [[H341]] and the month [[H2320]] which [[H834]] was turned [[H2015]] unto them from sorrow [[H3015]] to joy, [[H8057]] and from mourning [[H60]] into a good [[H2896]] day: [[H3117]] that they should make [[H6213]] them days [[H3117]] of feasting [[H4960]] and joy, [[H8057]] and of sending [[H4916]] portions [[H4490]] one [[H376]] to another, [[H7453]] and gifts [[H4979]] to the poor. [[H34]]

### 23
And the Jews [[H3064]] undertook [[H6901]] to do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] they had begun, [[H2490]] and as [[H834]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had written [[H3789]] unto [[H413]] them; [[H413]]

### 24
Because [[H3588]] Haman [[H2001]] the son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha, [[H4099]] the Agagite, [[H91]] the enemy [[H6887]] of all [[H3605]] the Jews, [[H3064]] had devised [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] the Jews [[H3064]] to destroy [[H6]] them, and had cast [[H5307]] Pur, [[H6332]] that [[H1931]] the lot, [[H1486]] to consume [[H2000]] them, and to destroy [[H6]] them; [[H6]]

### 25
But when came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] he commanded [[H559]] by [[H5973]] letters [[H5612]] that his wicked [[H7451]] device, [[H4284]] which [[H834]] he devised [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] the Jews, [[H3064]] should return [[H7725]] upon [[H5921]] his own head, [[H7218]] and that he and his sons [[H1121]] should be hanged [[H8518]] on [[H5921]] the gallows. [[H6086]]

### 26
Wherefore [[H5921]] they called [[H7121]] these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] Purim [[H6332]] after [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of Pur. [[H6332]] Therefore [[H5921]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] letter, [[H107]] and which [[H4100]] they had seen [[H7200]] concerning [[H5921]] this matter, [[H3602]] and which [[H4100]] had come [[H5060]] unto [[H413]] them, [[H413]]

### 27
The Jews [[H3064]] ordained, [[H6965]] and took [[H6901]] upon [[H5921]] them, and upon [[H5921]] their seed, [[H2233]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] such as joined themselves [[H3867]] unto [[H5921]] them, so as it should not [[H3808]] fail, [[H5674]] that they would keep [[H6213]] these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] days [[H3117]] according to their writing, [[H3791]] and according to their time [[H2165]] every [[H3605]] year; [[H8141]]

### 28
And these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] remembered [[H2142]] and kept [[H6213]] throughout [[H1755]] every [[H3605]] generation, [[H1755]] every family, [[H4940]] every province, [[H4082]] and every city; [[H5892]] and these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] of Purim [[H6332]] should not [[H3808]] fail [[H5674]] from among [[H8432]] the Jews, [[H3064]] nor [[H3808]] the memorial [[H2143]] of them perish [[H5486]] from their seed. [[H2233]]

### 29
Then Esther [[H635]] the queen, [[H4436]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Abihail, [[H32]] and Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew, [[H3064]] wrote [[H3789]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] authority, [[H8633]] to confirm [[H6965]] this [[H2063]] second [[H8145]] letter [[H107]] of Purim. [[H6332]]

### 30
And he sent [[H7971]] the letters [[H5612]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Jews, [[H3064]] to [[H413]] the hundred [[H3967]] twenty [[H6242]] and seven [[H7651]] provinces [[H4082]] of the kingdom [[H4438]] of Ahasuerus, [[H325]] words [[H1697]] of peace [[H7965]] and truth, [[H571]]

### 31
To confirm [[H6965]] these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] of Purim [[H6332]] in their times [[H2165]] according as [[H834]] Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew [[H3064]] and Esther [[H635]] the queen [[H4436]] had enjoined [[H6965]] them, and as [[H834]] they had decreed [[H6965]] for [[H5921]] themselves [[H5315]] and for [[H5921]] their seed, [[H2233]] the matters [[H1697]] of the fastings [[H6685]] and their cry. [[H2201]]

### 32
And the decree [[H3982]] of Esther [[H635]] confirmed [[H6965]] these [[H428]] matters [[H1697]] of Purim; [[H6332]] and it was written [[H3789]] in the book. [[H5612]]
