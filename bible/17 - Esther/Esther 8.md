On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] did the king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] give [[H5414]] the house [[H1004]] of Haman [[H2001]] the Jews' [[H3064]] enemy [[H6887]] unto Esther [[H635]] the queen. [[H4436]] And Mordecai [[H4782]] came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king; [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] Esther [[H635]] had told [[H5046]] what [[H4100]] he [[H1931]] unto her. [[H1931]]

### 2
And the king [[H4428]] took off [[H5493]] his ring, [[H2885]] which [[H834]] he had taken [[H5674]] from Haman, [[H2001]] and gave [[H5414]] it unto Mordecai. [[H4782]] And Esther [[H635]] set [[H7760]] Mordecai [[H4782]] over [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Haman. [[H2001]]

### 3
And Esther [[H635]] spake [[H1696]] yet again [[H3254]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] and fell down [[H5307]] at [[H6440]] his feet, [[H7272]] and besought [[H2603]] him with tears [[H1058]] to put away [[H5674]] the mischief [[H7451]] of Haman [[H2001]] the Agagite, [[H91]] and his device [[H4284]] that [[H834]] he had devised [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] the Jews. [[H3064]]

### 4
Then the king [[H4428]] held out [[H3447]] the golden [[H2091]] sceptre [[H8275]] toward Esther. [[H635]] So Esther [[H635]] arose, [[H6965]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]]

### 5
And said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] it please [[H2896]] the king, [[H4428]] and if [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in his sight, [[H6440]] and the thing [[H1697]] right [[H3787]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] and I [[H589]] pleasing [[H2896]] in his eyes, [[H5869]] let it be written [[H3789]] to reverse [[H7725]] the letters [[H5612]] devised [[H4284]] by Haman [[H2001]] the son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha [[H4099]] the Agagite, [[H91]] which [[H834]] he wrote [[H3789]] to destroy [[H6]] the Jews [[H3064]] which [[H834]] in all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] provinces: [[H4082]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] how [[H349]] can I endure [[H3201]] to see [[H7200]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] shall come unto [[H4672]] my people? [[H5971]] or how [[H349]] can I endure [[H3201]] to see [[H7200]] the destruction [[H13]] of my kindred? [[H4138]]

Then the king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] said [[H559]] unto Esther [[H635]] the queen [[H4436]] and to Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew, [[H3064]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have given [[H5414]] Esther [[H635]] the house [[H1004]] of Haman, [[H2001]] and him they have hanged [[H8518]] upon [[H5921]] the gallows, [[H6086]] because [[H5921]] he laid [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] upon the Jews. [[H3064]]

### 8
Write [[H3789]] ye [[H859]] also for [[H5921]] the Jews, [[H3064]] as it liketh [[H2896]] you, [[H5869]] in the king's [[H4428]] name, [[H8034]] and seal [[H2856]] with the king's [[H4428]] ring: [[H2885]] for [[H3588]] the writing [[H3791]] which [[H834]] is written [[H3789]] in the king's [[H4428]] name, [[H8034]] and sealed [[H2856]] with the king's [[H4428]] ring, [[H2885]] may no [[H369]] man reverse.
