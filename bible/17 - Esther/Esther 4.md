When Mordecai [[H4782]] perceived [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was done, [[H6213]] Mordecai [[H4782]] rent [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] and put on [[H3847]] sackcloth [[H8242]] with ashes, [[H665]] and went out [[H3318]] into the midst [[H8432]] of the city, [[H5892]] and cried [[H2199]] with a loud [[H1419]] and a bitter [[H4751]] cry; [[H2201]]

### 2
And came [[H935]] even [[H5704]] before [[H6440]] the king's [[H4428]] gate: [[H8179]] for [[H3588]] none [[H369]] enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] gate [[H8179]] clothed [[H3830]] with sackcloth. [[H8242]]

### 3
And in every [[H3605]] province, [[H4082]] whithersoever [[H4725]] the king's [[H4428]] commandment [[H1697]] and his decree [[H1881]] came, [[H5060]] great [[H1419]] mourning [[H60]] among the Jews, [[H3064]] and fasting, [[H6685]] and weeping, [[H1065]] and wailing; [[H4553]] and many [[H7227]] lay [[H3331]] in sackcloth [[H8242]] and ashes. [[H665]]

### 4
So Esther's [[H635]] maids [[H5291]] and her chamberlains [[H5631]] came [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] her. Then was the queen [[H4436]] exceedingly [[H3966]] grieved; [[H2342]] and she sent [[H7971]] raiment [[H899]] to clothe [[H3847]] Mordecai, [[H4782]] and to take away [[H5493]] his sackcloth [[H8242]] from [[H5921]] him: but he received [[H6901]] not. [[H3808]]

### 5
Then called [[H7121]] Esther [[H635]] for Hatach, [[H2047]] of the king's [[H4428]] chamberlains, [[H5631]] whom [[H834]] he had appointed [[H5975]] to attend upon [[H6440]] her, and gave him a commandment [[H6680]] to [[H5921]] Mordecai, [[H4782]] to know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] it [[H2088]] and why [[H5921]] it [[H2088]]

### 6
So Hatach [[H2047]] went forth [[H3318]] to [[H413]] Mordecai [[H4782]] unto [[H413]] the street [[H7339]] of the city, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the king's [[H4428]] gate. [[H8179]]

### 7
And Mordecai [[H4782]] told [[H5046]]  him of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] had happened [[H7136]] unto him, and [[H853]] of the sum [[H6575]] of the money [[H3701]] that [[H834]] Haman [[H2001]] had promised [[H559]] to pay [[H8254]] to [[H5921]] the king's [[H4428]] treasuries [[H1595]] for the Jews, [[H3064]] to destroy [[H6]] them. [[H6]]

### 8
Also he gave [[H5414]] him the copy [[H6572]] of the writing [[H3791]] of the decree [[H1881]] that [[H834]] was given [[H5414]] at Shushan [[H7800]] to destroy [[H8045]] them, to shew [[H7200]]  unto [[H853]] Esther, [[H635]] and to declare [[H5046]] unto her, and to charge [[H6680]] her [[H5921]] that she should go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] to make supplication [[H2603]] unto him, and to make request [[H1245]] before [[H6440]] him for [[H5921]] her people. [[H5971]]

### 9
And Hatach [[H2047]] came [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] Esther [[H635]] the words [[H1697]] of Mordecai. [[H4782]]

### 10
Again Esther [[H635]] spake [[H559]] unto Hatach, [[H2047]] and gave him commandment [[H6680]] unto [[H413]] Mordecai; [[H4782]]

### 11
All [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] servants, [[H5650]] and the people [[H5971]] of the king's [[H4428]] provinces, [[H4082]] do know, [[H3045]] that [[H834]] whosoever, [[H3605]]  whether [[H834]] man [[H376]] or woman, [[H802]] shall come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] into [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] who [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] called, [[H7121]] one [[H259]] law [[H1881]] of his to put to death, [[H4191]] except [[H905]] such to whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] shall hold out [[H3447]] the golden [[H2091]] sceptre, [[H8275]] that he may live: [[H2421]] but I [[H589]] have not [[H3808]] been called [[H7121]] to come in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] these [[H2088]] thirty [[H7970]] days. [[H3117]]

### 12
And they told [[H5046]] to Mordecai [[H4782]] Esther's [[H635]] words. [[H1697]]

### 13
Then Mordecai [[H4782]] commanded [[H559]] to answer [[H7725]] Esther, [[H635]] Think [[H1819]] not [[H408]] with thyself [[H5315]] that thou shalt escape [[H4422]] in the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] more than all [[H3605]] the Jews. [[H3064]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] thou altogether [[H2790]] holdest thy peace [[H2790]] at this [[H2063]] time, [[H6256]] shall there enlargement [[H7305]] and deliverance [[H2020]] arise [[H5975]] to the Jews [[H3064]] from another [[H312]] place; [[H4725]] but thou [[H859]] and thy father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] shall be destroyed: [[H6]] and who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] whether [[H518]] thou art come [[H5060]] to the kingdom [[H4438]] for a time [[H6256]] as this? [[H2063]]

### 15
Then Esther [[H635]] bade [[H559]] return [[H7725]] Mordecai [[H4782]]

### 16
Go, [[H1980]] gather together [[H3664]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] that are present [[H4672]] in Shushan, [[H7800]] and fast [[H6684]] ye for [[H5921]] me, and neither [[H408]] eat [[H398]] nor [[H408]] drink [[H8354]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] night [[H3915]] or day: [[H3117]] I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] and my maidens [[H5291]] will fast [[H6684]] likewise; [[H3651]] and so [[H3651]] will I go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] which [[H834]] not [[H3808]] according to the law: [[H1881]] and if [[H834]] I perish, [[H6]] I perish. [[H6]]

### 17
So Mordecai [[H4782]] went his way, [[H5674]] and did [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Esther [[H635]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H5921]]
