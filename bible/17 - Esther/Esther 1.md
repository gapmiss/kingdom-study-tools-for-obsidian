Now it came to pass [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] of Ahasuerus, [[H325]] (this [[H1931]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] which reigned, [[H4427]] from India [[H1912]] even unto [[H5704]] Ethiopia, [[H3568]] an hundred [[H3967]] and seven [[H7651]] and twenty [[H6242]] provinces:) [[H4082]]

In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] he made [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] unto all [[H3605]] his princes [[H8269]] and his servants; [[H5650]] the power [[H2428]] of Persia [[H6539]] and Media, [[H4074]] the nobles [[H6579]] and princes [[H8269]] of the provinces, [[H4082]] before [[H6440]] him: [[H6440]]

### 4
When he shewed [[H7200]] the riches [[H6239]] of his glorious [[H3519]] kingdom [[H4438]] and the honour [[H3366]] of his excellent [[H8597]] majesty [[H1420]] many [[H7227]] days, [[H3117]] an hundred [[H3967]] and fourscore [[H8084]] days. [[H3117]]

### 6
white, [[H2353]] green, [[H3768]] and blue, [[H8504]] fastened [[H270]] with cords [[H2256]] of fine linen [[H948]] and purple [[H713]] to [[H5921]] silver [[H3701]] rings [[H1550]] and pillars [[H5982]] of marble: [[H8336]] the beds [[H4296]] gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] upon [[H5921]] a pavement [[H7531]] of red, [[H923]] and blue, [[H8336]] and white, [[H1858]] and black, marble. [[H5508]]

### 7
And they gave drink [[H8248]] in vessels [[H3627]] of gold, [[H2091]] (the vessels [[H3627]] being diverse [[H8138]] one from another,) [[H3627]] and royal [[H4438]] wine [[H3196]] in abundance, [[H7227]] according to the state [[H3027]] of the king. [[H4428]]

### 8
And the drinking [[H8360]] according to the law; [[H1881]] none [[H369]] did compel: [[H597]] for [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] the king [[H4428]] had appointed [[H3245]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the officers [[H7227]] of his house, [[H1004]] that they should do [[H6213]] according to every man's [[H376]] pleasure. [[H7522]]

### 9
Also [[H1571]] Vashti [[H2060]] the queen [[H4436]] made [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] for the women [[H802]] the royal [[H4438]] house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] to king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus. [[H325]]

### 10
On the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] when the heart [[H3820]] of the king [[H4428]] was merry [[H2896]] with wine, [[H3196]] he commanded [[H559]] Mehuman, [[H4104]] Biztha, [[H968]] Harbona, [[H2726]] Bigtha, [[H903]] and Abagtha, [[H5]] Zethar, [[H2242]] and Carcas, [[H3752]] the seven [[H7651]] chamberlains [[H5631]] that served [[H8334]] in the presence [[H6440]] of Ahasuerus [[H325]] the king, [[H4428]]

### 11
To bring [[H935]] Vashti [[H2060]] the queen [[H4436]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] with the crown [[H3804]] royal, [[H4438]] to shew [[H7200]] the people [[H5971]] and the princes [[H8269]] her beauty: [[H3308]] for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] fair [[H2896]] to look on. [[H4758]]

### 12
But the queen [[H4436]] Vashti [[H2060]] refused [[H3985]] to come [[H935]] at the king's [[H4428]] commandment [[H1697]] by [[H3027]] chamberlains: [[H5631]] therefore was the king [[H4428]] very [[H3966]] wroth, [[H7107]] and his anger [[H2534]] burned [[H1197]] in him. [[H1197]]

### 13
Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to the wise men, [[H2450]] which knew [[H3045]] the times, [[H6256]] (for [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] the king's [[H4428]] manner [[H1697]] toward [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] that knew [[H3045]] law [[H1881]] and judgment: [[H1779]]

### 14
And the next [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] him Carshena, [[H3771]] Shethar, [[H8369]] Admatha, [[H133]] Tarshish, [[H8659]] Meres, [[H4825]] Marsena, [[H4826]] Memucan, [[H4462]] the seven [[H7651]] princes [[H8269]] of Persia [[H6539]] and Media, [[H4074]] which saw [[H7200]] the king's [[H4428]] face, [[H6440]] which sat [[H3427]] the first [[H7223]] in the kingdom;) [[H4438]]

### 15
What [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] unto the queen [[H4436]] Vashti [[H2060]] according to law, [[H1881]] because [[H5921]] she hath not [[H3808]] performed [[H6213]] the commandment [[H3982]] of the king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] by [[H3027]] the chamberlains? [[H5631]]

### 16
And Memucan [[H4462]] answered [[H559]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] and the princes, [[H8269]] Vashti [[H2060]] the queen [[H4436]] hath not [[H3808]] done wrong [[H5753]] to [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] only, [[H905]] but [[H3588]] also to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the princes, [[H8269]] and to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] in all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of the king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus. [[H325]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] deed [[H1697]] of the queen [[H4436]] shall come abroad [[H3318]] unto [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] women, [[H802]] so that they shall despise [[H959]] their husbands [[H1167]] in their eyes, [[H5869]] when it shall be reported, [[H559]] The king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] commanded [[H559]] Vashti [[H2060]] the queen [[H4436]] to be brought in [[H935]] before [[H6440]] him, but she came [[H935]] not. [[H3808]]

### 18
shall the ladies [[H8282]] of Persia [[H6539]] and Media [[H4074]] say [[H559]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] unto all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] princes, [[H8269]] which [[H834]] have heard of [[H8085]] the deed [[H1697]] of the queen. [[H4436]] Thus too much [[H1767]] contempt [[H963]] and wrath. [[H7110]]

### 19
If [[H518]] it please [[H2895]] the king, [[H4428]] let there go [[H3318]] a royal [[H4438]] commandment [[H1697]] from [[H6440]] him, and let it be written [[H3789]] among the laws [[H1881]] of the Persians [[H6539]] and the Medes, [[H4074]] that it be not [[H3808]] altered, [[H5674]] That [[H834]] Vashti [[H2060]] come [[H935]] no [[H3808]] more before [[H6440]] king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus; [[H325]] and let the king [[H4428]] give [[H5414]] her royal estate [[H4438]] unto another [[H7468]] that is better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] she. [[H4480]]

### 20
And when the king's [[H4428]] decree [[H6599]] which [[H834]] he shall make [[H6213]] shall be published [[H8085]] throughout all [[H3605]] his empire, [[H4438]] (for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is great,) [[H7227]] all [[H3605]] the wives [[H802]] shall give [[H5414]] to their husbands [[H1167]] honour, [[H3366]] both to great [[H1419]] and small. [[H6996]]

### 21
And the saying [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] the king [[H4428]] and the princes; [[H8269]] and the king [[H4428]] did [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Memucan: [[H4462]]

### 22
For he sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] into [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] provinces, [[H4082]] into [[H413]] every province [[H4082]] according to the writing [[H3791]] thereof, and to [[H413]] every people [[H5971]] after their language, [[H3956]] that every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] should [[H1961]] bear rule [[H8323]] in his own house, [[H1004]] and that should be published [[H1696]] according to the language [[H3956]] of every people.
