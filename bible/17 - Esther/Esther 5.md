### 1
Now it came to pass [[H1961]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] that Esther [[H635]] put on [[H3847]] royal [[H4438]] and stood [[H5975]] in the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] over against [[H5227]] the king's [[H4428]] house: [[H1004]] and the king [[H4428]] sat [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] his royal [[H4438]] throne [[H3678]] in the royal [[H4438]] house, [[H1004]] over against [[H5227]] the gate [[H6607]] of the house. [[H1004]]

### 2
And it was [[H1961]] so, when the king [[H4428]] saw [[H7200]] Esther [[H635]] the queen [[H4436]] standing [[H5975]] in the court, [[H2691]] she obtained [[H5375]] favour [[H2580]] in his sight: [[H5869]] and the king [[H4428]] held out [[H3447]] to Esther [[H635]] the golden [[H2091]] sceptre [[H8275]] that [[H834]] in his hand. [[H3027]] So Esther [[H635]] drew near, [[H7126]] and touched [[H5060]] the top [[H7218]] of the sceptre. [[H8275]]

### 3
Then said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] unto her, What [[H4100]] wilt thou, queen [[H4436]] Esther? [[H635]] and what [[H4100]] thy request? [[H1246]] it shall be even given [[H5414]] thee to [[H5704]] the half [[H2677]] of the kingdom. [[H4438]]

### 4
And Esther [[H635]] answered, [[H559]] If [[H518]] good [[H2895]] unto [[H5921]] the king, [[H4428]] let the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] come [[H935]] this day [[H3117]] unto [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] that [[H834]] I have prepared [[H6213]] for him. [[H6213]]

### 5
Then the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]]  Cause [[H853]] Haman [[H2001]] to make haste, [[H4116]] that he may do [[H6213]] as Esther [[H635]] hath said. [[H1697]] So the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] that [[H834]] Esther [[H635]] had prepared. [[H6213]]

### 6
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto Esther [[H635]] at the banquet [[H4960]] of wine, [[H3196]] What [[H4100]] thy petition? [[H7596]] and it shall be granted [[H5414]] thee: and what [[H4100]] thy request? [[H1246]] even to [[H5704]] the half [[H2677]] of the kingdom [[H4438]] it shall be performed. [[H6213]]

### 7
Then answered [[H6030]] Esther, [[H635]] and said, [[H559]] My petition [[H7596]] and my request [[H1246]]

### 8
If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the king, [[H4428]] and if [[H518]] it please [[H2895]] the king [[H4428]] to grant [[H5414]] my petition, [[H7596]] and to perform [[H6213]] my request, [[H1246]] let the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] that [[H834]] I shall prepare [[H6213]] for them, and I will do [[H6213]] to morrow [[H4279]] as the king [[H4428]] hath said. [[H1697]]

### 9
Then went [[H3318]] Haman [[H2001]]  forth [[H2001]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] joyful [[H8056]] and with a glad [[H2896]] heart: [[H3820]] but when Haman [[H2001]] saw [[H7200]] Mordecai [[H4782]] in the king's [[H4428]] gate, [[H8179]] that he stood not up, [[H6965]] nor [[H3808]] moved [[H2111]] for [[H4480]] him, he was full [[H4390]] of indignation [[H2534]] against [[H5921]] Mordecai. [[H4782]]

### 10
Nevertheless Haman [[H2001]] refrained himself: [[H662]] and when he came [[H935]] home, [[H1004]] he sent [[H7971]] and called [[H935]]  for [[H853]] his friends, [[H157]] and Zeresh [[H2238]] his wife. [[H802]]

### 11
And Haman [[H2001]] told [[H5608]]  them of [[H853]] the glory [[H3519]] of his riches, [[H6239]] and the multitude [[H7230]] of his children, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] wherein [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] had promoted [[H1431]] him, and how [[H834]] he had advanced [[H5375]] him above [[H5921]] the princes [[H8269]] and servants [[H5650]] of the king. [[H4428]]

### 12
Haman [[H2001]] said [[H559]] moreover, [[H637]] Yea, Esther [[H635]] the queen [[H4436]] did let no [[H3808]] man come in [[H935]] with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] unto [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] that [[H834]] she had prepared [[H6213]] but [[H3588]] myself; and to morrow [[H4279]] am I [[H589]] invited [[H7121]] unto her also [[H1571]] with [[H5973]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 13
Yet all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] availeth [[H7737]] me nothing, [[H369]] so long [[H3605]] as [[H6256]] I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew [[H3064]] sitting [[H3427]] at the king's [[H4428]] gate. [[H8179]]

### 14
Then said [[H559]] Zeresh [[H2238]] his wife [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] his friends [[H157]] unto him, Let a gallows [[H6086]] be made [[H6213]] of fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H1364]] and to morrow [[H1242]] speak [[H559]] thou unto the king [[H4428]]  that [[H853]] Mordecai [[H4782]] may be hanged [[H8518]] thereon: [[H5921]] then go [[H935]] thou in merrily [[H8056]] with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] unto [[H413]] the banquet. [[H4960]] And the thing [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] Haman; [[H2001]] and he caused the gallows [[H6086]] to be made. [[H6213]]
