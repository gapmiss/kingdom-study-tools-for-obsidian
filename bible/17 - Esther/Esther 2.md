### 1
After [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] when the wrath [[H2534]] of king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] was appeased, [[H7918]] he remembered [[H2142]] Vashti, [[H2060]] and what [[H834]] she had done, [[H6213]] and what [[H834]] was decreed [[H1504]] against [[H5921]] her. [[H5921]]

### 2
Then said [[H559]] the king's [[H4428]] servants [[H5288]] that ministered [[H8334]] unto him, Let there be fair [[H2896]] young [[H5291]] virgins [[H1330]] sought [[H1245]] for the king: [[H4428]]

### 3
And let the king [[H4428]] appoint [[H6485]] officers [[H6496]] in all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of his kingdom, [[H4438]] that they may gather together [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the fair [[H2896]] young [[H5291]] virgins [[H1330]] unto [[H413]] Shushan [[H7800]] the palace, [[H1002]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the women, [[H802]] unto [[H413]] the custody [[H3027]] of Hege [[H1896]] the king's [[H4428]] chamberlain, [[H5631]] keeper [[H8104]] of the women; [[H802]] and let their things for purification [[H8562]] be given [[H5414]]

### 4
And let the maiden [[H5291]] which [[H834]] pleaseth [[H3190]] the king [[H4428]] be queen [[H4427]] instead [[H8478]] of Vashti. [[H2060]] And the thing [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] the king; [[H4428]] and he did so. [[H6213]]

### 5
in Shushan [[H7800]] the palace [[H1002]] there was [[H1961]] a certain [[H376]] Jew, [[H3064]] whose name [[H8034]] Mordecai, [[H4782]] the son [[H1121]] of Jair, [[H2971]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimei, [[H8096]] the son [[H1121]] of Kish, [[H7027]] a Benjamite; [[H1145]]

### 6
Who [[H834]] had been carried away [[H1540]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] with [[H5973]] the captivity [[H1473]] which [[H834]] had been carried away [[H1540]] with [[H5973]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] whom [[H834]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had carried away. [[H1540]]

### 7
And he brought up [[H539]] Hadassah, [[H1919]] that [[H1931]] Esther, [[H635]] his uncle's [[H1730]] daughter: [[H1323]] for [[H3588]] she had neither [[H369]] father [[H1]] nor mother, [[H517]] and the maid [[H5291]] fair [[H3303]] and beautiful; [[H2896]] whom Mordecai, [[H4782]] when her father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] were dead, [[H4194]] took [[H3947]] for his own daughter. [[H1323]]

### 8
So it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the king's [[H4428]] commandment [[H1697]] and his decree [[H1881]] was heard, [[H8085]] and when many [[H7227]] maidens [[H5291]] were gathered together [[H6908]] unto [[H413]] Shushan [[H7800]] the palace, [[H1002]] to [[H413]] the custody [[H3027]] of Hegai, [[H1896]] that Esther [[H635]] was brought [[H3947]] also unto [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] to [[H413]] the custody [[H3027]] of Hegai, [[H1896]] keeper [[H8104]] of the women. [[H802]]

### 9
And the maiden [[H5291]] pleased [[H3190]] him, and she obtained [[H5375]] kindness [[H2617]] of him; [[H6440]] and he speedily [[H926]] gave [[H5414]]  her [[H853]] her things for purification, [[H8562]] with [[H853]] such things as belonged [[H4490]] to her, and seven [[H7651]] maidens, [[H5291]] meet [[H7200]] to be given [[H5414]] her, out of the king's [[H4428]] house: [[H1004]] and he preferred [[H8138]] her and her maids [[H5291]] unto the best [[H2896]] of the house [[H1004]] of the women. [[H802]]

### 10
Esther [[H635]] had not [[H3808]] shewed [[H5046]] her people [[H5971]] nor her kindred: [[H4138]] for [[H3588]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had charged [[H6680]] her [[H5921]] that [[H834]] she should not [[H3808]] shew [[H5046]]

### 11
And Mordecai [[H4782]] walked [[H1980]] every day [[H3117]] before [[H6440]] the court [[H2691]] of the women's [[H802]] house, [[H1004]] to know [[H3045]] how Esther [[H635]] did, [[H7965]] and what [[H4100]] should become [[H6213]] of her. [[H6213]]

### 12
Now when every maid's [[H5291]] turn [[H8447]] was come [[H5060]] to go in [[H935]] to [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus, [[H325]] after [[H7093]] that she had been [[H1961]] twelve [[H8147]] months, [[H2320]] according to the manner [[H1881]] of the women, [[H802]] (for [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] were the days [[H3117]] of their purifications [[H4795]] accomplished, [[H4390]] six [[H8337]] months [[H2320]] with oil [[H8081]] of myrrh, [[H4753]] and six [[H8337]] months [[H2320]] with sweet odours, [[H1314]] and with things for the purifying [[H8562]] of the women;) [[H802]]

### 13
Then thus [[H2088]] came [[H935]] maiden [[H5291]] unto [[H413]] the king; [[H4428]] whatsoever [[H3605]] she desired [[H559]] was given [[H5414]] her to go [[H935]] with [[H5973]] her out of the house [[H1004]] of the women [[H802]] unto [[H5704]] the king's [[H4428]] house. [[H1004]]

### 14
In the evening [[H6153]] she [[H1931]] went, [[H935]] and on the morrow [[H1242]] she [[H1931]] returned [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the second [[H8145]] house [[H1004]] of the women, [[H802]] to [[H413]] the custody [[H3027]] of Shaashgaz, [[H8190]] the king's [[H4428]] chamberlain, [[H5631]] which kept [[H8104]] the concubines: [[H6370]] she came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] no [[H3808]] more, [[H5750]] except [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] delighted [[H2654]] in her, and that she were called [[H7121]] by name. [[H8034]]

### 15
Now when the turn [[H8447]] of Esther, [[H635]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Abihail [[H32]] the uncle [[H1730]] of Mordecai, [[H4782]] who [[H834]] had taken [[H3947]] her for his daughter, [[H1323]] was come [[H5060]] to go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] she required [[H1245]] nothing [[H1697]] but [[H3588]] what [[H834]] Hegai [[H1896]] the king's [[H4428]] chamberlain, [[H5631]] the keeper [[H8104]] of the women, [[H802]] appointed. [[H559]] And Esther [[H635]] obtained [[H5375]] favour [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] them that looked [[H7200]] upon her. [[H7200]]

### 16
So Esther [[H635]] was taken [[H3947]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] into [[H413]] his house [[H1004]] royal [[H4438]] in the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] which [[H1931]] the month [[H2320]] Tebeth, [[H2887]] in the seventh [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of his reign. [[H4438]]

### 17
And the king [[H4428]] loved [[H157]] Esther [[H635]] above all [[H3605]] the women, [[H802]] and she obtained [[H5375]] grace [[H2580]] and favour [[H2617]] in his sight [[H6440]] more than all [[H3605]] the virgins; [[H1330]] so that he set [[H7760]] the royal [[H4438]] crown [[H3804]] upon her head, [[H7218]] and made her queen [[H4427]] instead [[H8478]] of Vashti. [[H2060]]

### 18
Then the king [[H4428]] made [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] feast [[H4960]] unto all [[H3605]] his princes [[H8269]] and his servants, [[H5650]] Esther's [[H635]] feast; [[H4960]] and he made [[H6213]] a release [[H2010]] to the provinces, [[H4082]] and gave [[H5414]] gifts, [[H4864]] according to the state [[H3027]] of the king. [[H4428]]

### 19
And when the virgins [[H1330]] were gathered together [[H6908]] the second time, [[H8145]] then Mordecai [[H4782]] sat [[H3427]] in the king's [[H4428]] gate. [[H8179]]

### 20
Esther [[H635]] had not [[H369]] shewed [[H5046]] her kindred [[H4138]] nor her people; [[H5971]] as [[H834]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had charged [[H6680]] her: [[H5921]] for Esther [[H635]] did [[H6213]] the commandment [[H3982]] of Mordecai, [[H4782]] like as [[H834]] when she was [[H1961]] brought up [[H545]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 21
In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] while Mordecai [[H4782]] sat [[H3427]] in the king's [[H4428]] gate, [[H8179]] two [[H8147]] of the king's [[H4428]] chamberlains, [[H5631]] Bigthan [[H904]] and Teresh, [[H8657]] of those which kept [[H8104]] the door, [[H5592]] were wroth, [[H7107]] and sought [[H1245]] to lay [[H7971]] hand [[H3027]] on the king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus. [[H325]]

### 22
And the thing [[H1697]] was known [[H3045]] to Mordecai, [[H4782]] who told [[H5046]] unto Esther [[H635]] the queen; [[H4436]] and Esther [[H635]] certified [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] in Mordecai's [[H4782]] name. [[H8034]]

### 23
And when inquisition [[H1245]] was made of the matter, [[H1697]] it was found out; [[H4672]] therefore they were both [[H8147]] hanged [[H8518]] on [[H5921]] a tree: [[H6086]] and it was written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]
