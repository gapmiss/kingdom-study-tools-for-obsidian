After [[H310]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] did king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] promote [[H1431]] Haman [[H2001]] the son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha [[H4099]] the Agagite, [[H91]] and advanced [[H5375]] him, and set [[H7760]] his seat [[H3678]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 2
And all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] servants, [[H5650]] that [[H834]] in the king's [[H4428]] gate, [[H8179]] bowed, [[H3766]] and reverenced [[H7812]] Haman: [[H2001]] for [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] had so [[H3651]] commanded [[H6680]] concerning him. But Mordecai [[H4782]] bowed [[H3766]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] did reverence. [[H7812]]

### 3
Then the king's [[H4428]] servants, [[H5650]] which [[H834]] in the king's [[H4428]] gate, [[H8179]] said [[H559]] unto Mordecai, [[H4782]] Why [[H4069]] transgressest [[H5674]] thou [[H859]] the king's [[H4428]] commandment? [[H4687]]

### 4
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they spake [[H559]] daily [[H3117]] unto [[H413]] him, and he hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] them, that they told [[H5046]] Haman, [[H2001]] to see [[H7200]] whether Mordecai's [[H4782]] matters [[H1697]] would stand: [[H5975]] for [[H3588]] he had told [[H5046]] them that [[H834]] he [[H1931]] a Jew. [[H3064]]

### 5
And when Haman [[H2001]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Mordecai [[H4782]] bowed [[H3766]] not, [[H369]] nor did him reverence, [[H7812]] then was Haman [[H2001]] full [[H4390]] of wrath. [[H2534]]

### 6
And he thought [[H5869]] scorn [[H959]] to lay [[H7971]] hands [[H3027]] on Mordecai [[H4782]] alone; [[H905]] for [[H3588]] they had shewed [[H5046]]  him [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] of Mordecai: [[H4782]] wherefore Haman [[H2001]] sought [[H1245]] to destroy [[H8045]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] that [[H834]] throughout the whole [[H3605]] kingdom [[H4438]] of Ahasuerus, [[H325]] the people [[H5971]] of Mordecai. [[H4782]]

### 7
In the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] that [[H1931]] the month [[H2320]] Nisan, [[H5212]] in the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus, [[H325]] they cast [[H5307]] Pur, [[H6332]] that [[H1931]] the lot, [[H1486]] before [[H6440]] Haman [[H2001]] from day [[H3117]] to day, [[H3117]] and from month [[H2320]] to month, [[H2320]] the twelfth [[H8147]] that [[H1931]] the month [[H2320]] Adar. [[H143]]

### 8
And Haman [[H2001]] said [[H559]] unto king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus, [[H325]] There is [[H3426]] a certain [[H259]] people [[H5971]] scattered abroad [[H6340]] and dispersed [[H6504]] among [[H996]] the people [[H5971]] in all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of thy kingdom; [[H4438]] and their laws [[H1881]] diverse [[H8138]] from all [[H3605]] people; [[H5971]] neither [[H369]] keep [[H6213]] they the king's [[H4428]] laws: [[H1881]] therefore it not [[H369]] for the king's [[H4428]] profit [[H7737]] to suffer [[H3240]] them. [[H3240]]

### 9
If [[H518]] it please [[H2895]] the king, [[H4428]] let it be written [[H3789]] that they may be destroyed: [[H6]] and I will pay [[H8254]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] to [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of those that have the charge [[H6213]] of the business, [[H4399]] to bring [[H935]] into [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] treasuries. [[H1595]]

### 10
And the king [[H4428]] took [[H5493]] his ring [[H2885]] from [[H5921]] his hand, [[H3027]] and gave [[H5414]] it unto Haman [[H2001]] the son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha [[H4099]] the Agagite, [[H91]] the Jews' [[H3064]] enemy. [[H6887]]

### 11
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto Haman, [[H2001]] The silver [[H3701]] given [[H5414]] to thee, the people [[H5971]] also, to do [[H6213]] with them as it seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] to thee. [[H2896]]

### 12
Then were the king's [[H4428]] scribes [[H5608]] called [[H7121]] on the thirteenth [[H7969]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] and there was written [[H3789]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Haman [[H2001]] had commanded [[H6680]] unto [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] lieutenants, [[H323]] and to [[H413]] the governors [[H6346]] that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] every province, [[H4082]] and to [[H413]] the rulers [[H8269]] of every people [[H5971]] of every province [[H4082]] according to the writing [[H3791]] thereof, and every people [[H5971]] after their language; [[H3956]] in the name [[H8034]] of king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus [[H325]] was it written, [[H3789]] and sealed [[H2856]] with the king's [[H4428]] ring. [[H2885]]

### 13
And the letters [[H5612]] were sent [[H7971]] by [[H3027]] posts [[H7323]] into [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] provinces, [[H4082]] to destroy, [[H8045]] to kill, [[H2026]] and to cause to perish, [[H6]] all [[H3605]] Jews, [[H3064]] both young [[H5288]] and [[H5704]] old, [[H2205]] little children [[H2945]] and women, [[H802]] in one [[H259]] day, [[H3117]] upon the thirteenth [[H7969]] of the twelfth [[H8147]] month, [[H2320]] which [[H1931]] the month [[H2320]] Adar, [[H143]] and the spoil [[H7998]] of them for a prey. [[H962]]

### 14
The copy [[H6572]] of the writing [[H3791]] for a commandment [[H1881]] to be given [[H5414]] in every [[H3605]] province [[H4082]] was published [[H1540]] unto all [[H3605]] people, [[H5971]] that they should be [[H1961]] ready [[H6264]] against that [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 15
The posts [[H7323]] went out, [[H3318]] being hastened [[H1765]] by the king's [[H4428]] commandment, [[H1697]] and the decree [[H1881]] was given [[H5414]] in Shushan [[H7800]] the palace. [[H1002]] And the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] sat down [[H3427]] to drink; [[H8354]] but the city [[H5892]] Shushan [[H7800]] was perplexed. [[H943]]
