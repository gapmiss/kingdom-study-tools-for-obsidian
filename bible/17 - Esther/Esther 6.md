### 1
On that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] could not [[H5074]] the king [[H4428]] sleep, [[H8142]] and he commanded [[H559]] to bring [[H935]] the book [[H5612]] of records [[H2146]] of the chronicles; [[H1697]] and they were [[H1961]] read [[H7121]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 2
And it was found [[H4672]] written, [[H3789]] that [[H834]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had told [[H5046]] of [[H5921]] Bigthana [[H904]] and Teresh, [[H8657]] two [[H8147]] of the king's [[H4428]] chamberlains, [[H5631]] the keepers [[H8104]] of the door, [[H5592]] who [[H834]] sought [[H1245]] to lay [[H7971]] hand [[H3027]] on the king [[H4428]] Ahasuerus. [[H325]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] honour [[H3366]] and dignity [[H1420]] hath been done [[H6213]] to Mordecai [[H4782]] for [[H5921]] this? [[H2088]] Then said [[H559]] the king's [[H4428]] servants [[H5288]] that ministered [[H8334]] unto him, There is nothing [[H1697]] done [[H6213]] for [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] in the court? [[H2691]] Now Haman [[H2001]] was come [[H935]] into the outward [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] to speak [[H559]] unto the king [[H4428]] to hang [[H8518]] Mordecai [[H4782]] on [[H5921]] the gallows [[H6086]] that [[H834]] he had prepared [[H3559]] for him. [[H3559]]

### 5
And the king's [[H4428]] servants [[H5288]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] Haman [[H2001]] standeth [[H5975]] in the court. [[H2691]] And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Let him come in. [[H935]]

### 6
So Haman [[H2001]] came in. [[H935]] And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto him, What [[H4100]] shall be done [[H6213]] unto the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] delighteth [[H2654]] to honour? [[H3366]] Now Haman [[H2001]] thought [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] To whom [[H4310]] would the king [[H4428]] delight [[H2654]] to do [[H6213]] honour [[H3366]] more than [[H3148]] to [[H4480]] myself? [[H4480]]

### 7
And Haman [[H2001]] answered [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] For the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] delighteth [[H2654]] to honour, [[H3366]]

### 8
Let the royal [[H4438]] apparel [[H3830]] be brought [[H935]] which [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] to wear, [[H3847]] and the horse [[H5483]] that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] rideth [[H7392]] upon, [[H5921]] and the crown [[H3804]] royal [[H4438]] which [[H834]] is set [[H5414]] upon his head: [[H7218]]

### 9
And let this apparel [[H3830]] and horse [[H5483]] be delivered [[H5414]] to [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of one [[H376]] of the king's [[H4428]] most noble [[H6579]] princes, [[H8269]] that they may array [[H3847]] the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] delighteth [[H2654]] to honour, [[H3366]] and bring [[H7392]] him on [[H5921]] horseback [[H5483]] through the street [[H7339]] of the city, [[H5892]] and proclaim [[H7121]] before [[H6440]] him, Thus [[H3602]] shall it be done [[H6213]] to the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] delighteth [[H2654]] to honour. [[H3366]]

### 10
Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to Haman, [[H2001]] Make haste, [[H4116]] take [[H3947]] the apparel [[H3830]] and the horse, [[H5483]] as [[H834]] thou hast said, [[H1696]] and do [[H6213]] even so [[H3651]] to Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew, [[H3064]] that sitteth [[H3427]] at the king's [[H4428]] gate: [[H8179]] let nothing [[H1697]] fail [[H5307]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast spoken. [[H1696]]

### 11
Then took [[H3947]] Haman [[H2001]] the apparel [[H3830]] and the horse, [[H5483]] and arrayed [[H3847]] Mordecai, [[H4782]] and brought him on horseback [[H7392]] through the street [[H7339]] of the city, [[H5892]] and proclaimed [[H7121]] before [[H6440]] him, Thus [[H3602]] shall it be done [[H6213]] unto the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] delighteth [[H2654]] to honour. [[H3366]]

### 12
And Mordecai [[H4782]] came again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] gate. [[H8179]] But Haman [[H2001]] hasted [[H1765]] to [[H413]] his house [[H1004]] mourning, [[H57]] and having his head [[H7218]] covered. [[H2645]]

### 13
And Haman [[H2001]] told [[H5608]] Zeresh [[H2238]] his wife [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] his friends [[H157]] every [[H3605]] that [[H834]] had befallen [[H7136]] him. Then said [[H559]] his wise men [[H2450]] and Zeresh [[H2238]] his wife [[H802]] unto him, If [[H518]] Mordecai [[H4782]] of the seed [[H2233]] of the Jews, [[H3064]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] thou hast begun [[H2490]] to fall, [[H5307]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] prevail [[H3201]] against him, but [[H3588]] shalt surely [[H5307]] fall [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 14
And while they yet [[H5750]] talking [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] him, came [[H5060]] the king's [[H4428]] chamberlains, [[H5631]] and hasted [[H926]] to bring [[H935]] Haman [[H2001]] unto [[H413]] the banquet [[H4960]] that [[H834]] Esther [[H635]] had prepared. [[H6213]]
