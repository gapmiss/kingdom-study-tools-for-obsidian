### 1
Beloved, [[G27]] believe [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] every [[G3956]] spirit, [[G4151]] but [[G235]] try [[G1381]] the [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] whether [[G1487]] they are [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] God: [[G2316]] because [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] false prophets [[G5578]] are gone out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 2
Hereby [[G1722]] know ye [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God: [[G2316]] Every [[G3956]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3739]] confesseth that [[G3670]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] is the [[G4561]] come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] flesh [[G4561]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] God: [[G2316]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3739]] confesseth [[G3670]] not [[G3361]] that [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] is come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the flesh [[G4561]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] God: [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] that [[G3588]] of [[G500]] antichrist, [[G500]] whereof [[G3739]] ye have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it should come; [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] even now [[G3568]] already [[G2235]] is it [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 4
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] little children, [[G5040]] and [[G2532]] have overcome [[G3528]] them: [[G846]] because [[G3754]] greater [[G3187]] is [[G2076]] he that [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] than [[G2228]] he that [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 5
They [[G846]] are [[G1526]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world: [[G2889]] therefore [[G1223]]  they [[G5124]] speak [[G2980]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] heareth [[G191]] them. [[G846]]

### 6
We [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] of [[G1537]] God: [[G2316]] he [[G3588]] that knoweth [[G1097]] God [[G2316]] heareth [[G191]] us; [[G2257]] he that [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] heareth [[G191]] not [[G3756]] us. [[G2257]] Hereby [[G1537]] know we [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of [[G225]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of [[G4106]] error. [[G4106]]

### 7
Beloved, [[G27]] let us love [[G25]] one another: [[G240]] for [[G3754]] love [[G26]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] every one [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] loveth [[G25]] is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] knoweth [[G1097]] God. [[G2316]]

### 8
He that loveth [[G25]] not [[G3361]] knoweth [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] God; [[G2316]] for [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] love. [[G26]]

### 9
In [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] was manifested [[G5319]] the of [[G3588]] love [[G26]] God [[G2316]] toward [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] because [[G3754]] that [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] sent [[G649]] his [[G846]] only begotten [[G3439]] Son [[G5207]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] that [[G2443]] we might live [[G2198]] through [[G1223]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
Herein [[G1722]] is [[G2076]] love, [[G26]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] we [[G2249]] loved [[G25]] God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] that [[G3754]] he [[G846]] loved [[G25]] us, [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] the propitiation [[G2434]] for [[G4012]] our [[G2257]] sins. [[G266]]

### 11
Beloved, [[G27]] if [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] so [[G3779]] loved [[G25]] us, [[G2248]] we [[G2249]] ought [[G3784]] also [[G2532]] to love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]]

### 12
No man [[G3762]] hath seen [[G2300]] God [[G2316]] at any time. [[G4455]] If [[G1437]] we love [[G25]] one another, [[G240]] God [[G2316]] dwelleth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] love [[G26]] is [[G2076]] perfected [[G5048]] in [[G1722]] us. [[G2254]]

### 13
Hereby [[G1722]] know we [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we dwell [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] because [[G3754]] he hath given [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] have seen [[G2300]] and [[G2532]] do testify [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] sent [[G649]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] the Saviour [[G4990]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world. [[G2889]]

### 15
Whosoever [[G3739]] shall confess [[G3670]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] dwelleth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] in [[G1722]] God. [[G2316]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] have known [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] believed [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] that [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath [[G2192]] to [[G1722]] us. [[G2254]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] love; [[G26]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that dwelleth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] love [[G26]] dwelleth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 17
Herein [[G1722]] is made [[G5048]] our [[G2257]] love [[G26]] perfect, [[G5048]] that [[G2443]] we may have [[G2192]] boldness [[G3954]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G2920]] judgment: [[G2920]] because [[G3754]] as [[G2531]] he [[G1565]] is, [[G2076]] so [[G2532]] are [[G2070]] we [[G2249]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] world. [[G2889]]

### 18
There is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] fear [[G5401]] in [[G1722]] love; [[G26]] but [[G235]] perfect [[G5046]] love [[G26]] casteth [[G906]] out [[G1854]] fear: [[G5401]] because [[G3754]] fear [[G5401]] hath [[G2192]] torment. [[G2851]] He that feareth [[G5399]] not [[G3756]] is made [[G5048]] perfect [[G5048]] in [[G1722]] love. [[G26]]

### 19
We [[G2249]] love [[G25]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] he [[G846]] first [[G4413]] loved [[G25]] us. [[G2248]]

### 20
If [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] say, [[G2036]] I love [[G25]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] hateth [[G3404]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] he is [[G2076]] a liar: [[G5583]] for [[G1063]] he that loveth [[G25]] not [[G3361]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] whom [[G3739]] he hath seen, [[G3708]] how [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] he love [[G25]] God [[G2316]] whom [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] he hath [[G3708]] seen? [[G3708]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] commandment [[G1785]] have we [[G2192]] from [[G575]] him, [[G846]] That [[G2443]] he [[G3588]] who loveth [[G25]] God [[G2316]] love [[G25]] his [[G846]] brother also. [[G80]]
