### 1
Behold, [[G1492]] what manner of [[G4217]] love [[G26]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] hath bestowed [[G1325]] upon us, [[G2254]] that [[G2443]] we should be called [[G2564]] the sons [[G5043]] of God: [[G2316]] therefore [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] knoweth [[G1097]] us [[G2248]] not, [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] it knew [[G1097]] him [[G846]] not. [[G3756]]

### 2
Beloved, [[G27]] now [[G3568]] are we [[G2070]] the sons [[G5043]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] not yet [[G3768]] it doth [[G5319]] appear [[G5319]] what [[G5101]] we shall be: [[G2071]] but [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that, [[G3754]] when [[G1437]] he shall appear, [[G5319]] we shall be [[G2071]] like [[G3664]] him; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] we shall see [[G3700]] him [[G846]] as [[G2531]] he is. [[G2076]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] every man [[G3956]] that hath [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] hope [[G1680]] in [[G1909]] him [[G846]] purifieth [[G48]] himself, [[G1438]] even as [[G2531]] he [[G1565]] is [[G2076]] pure. [[G53]]

### 4
Whosoever [[G3956]] committeth [[G4160]] sin [[G266]] transgresseth [[G4160]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] law: [[G458]] for [[G2532]] sin [[G266]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] transgression of the law. [[G458]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he [[G1565]] was manifested [[G5319]] to [[G2443]] take away [[G142]] our [[G2257]] sins; [[G266]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] sin. [[G266]]

### 6
Whosoever [[G3956]] abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] sinneth [[G264]] not: [[G3756]] whosoever [[G3956]] sinneth [[G264]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] him, [[G846]] neither [[G3761]] known [[G1097]] him. [[G846]]

### 7
Little children, [[G5040]] no man [[G3367]] let [[G4105]] deceive [[G4105]] you: [[G5209]] he [[G3588]] that doeth [[G4160]] righteousness [[G1343]] is [[G2076]] righteous, [[G1342]] even as [[G2531]] he [[G1565]] is [[G2076]] righteous. [[G1342]]

### 8
He [[G3588]] that committeth [[G4160]] sin [[G266]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] devil; [[G1228]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] sinneth [[G264]] from [[G575]] the beginning. [[G746]] For [[G1519]] this purpose [[G5124]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] was manifested, [[G5319]] that [[G2443]] he might destroy [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] works of [[G2041]] the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]]

### 9
Whosoever [[G3956]] is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] doth [[G4160]] commit [[G4160]] sin; [[G266]] for [[G3754]] his [[G846]] seed [[G4690]] remaineth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he cannot [[G1410]] sin, [[G264]] because [[G3754]] he is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]]

### 10
In [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] are [[G2076]] manifest, [[G5318]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1228]] devil: [[G1228]] whosoever [[G3956]] doeth [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] righteousness [[G1343]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] neither [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] loveth [[G25]] not [[G3361]] his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]]

### 11
For [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] message [[G31]] that [[G3739]] ye heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] the beginning, [[G746]] that [[G2443]] we should love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]]

### 12
Not [[G3756]] as [[G2531]] Cain, [[G2535]] was [[G2258]] of [[G1537]] that wicked one, [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] slew [[G4969]] his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]] And [[G2532]] wherefore [[G5484]] slew he [[G4969]] him? [[G846]] Because [[G3754]] his own [[G846]] works [[G2041]] were [[G2258]] evil, [[G4190]] and [[G1161]] his [[G846]] brother's [[G80]] righteous. [[G1342]]

### 13
Marvel [[G2296]] not, [[G3361]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] hate [[G3404]] you. [[G5209]]

### 14
We [[G2249]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we have passed [[G3327]] from [[G1537]] death [[G2288]] unto [[G1519]] life, [[G2222]] because [[G3754]] we love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] brethren. [[G80]] He that loveth [[G25]] not [[G3361]] brother [[G80]] abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] death. [[G2288]]

### 15
Whosoever [[G3956]] hateth [[G3404]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] is [[G2076]] a murderer: [[G443]] and [[G2532]] ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] no [[G3756]] murderer [[G443]] hath [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] abiding [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
Hereby [[G1722]] perceive we [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] because [[G3754]] he [[G1565]] laid down [[G5087]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] us: [[G2257]] and [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] ought [[G3784]] to lay down [[G5087]] lives [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] whoso [[G3739]] hath [[G2192]] this [[G3588]] world's [[G2889]] good, [[G979]] and [[G2532]] seeth [[G2334]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] have [[G2192]] need, [[G5532]] and [[G2532]] shutteth up [[G2808]] his [[G846]] bowels [[G4698]] from [[G575]] him, [[G846]] how [[G4459]] dwelleth [[G3306]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] him? [[G846]]

### 18
My [[G3450]] little children, [[G5040]] not [[G3361]] let us [[G25]] love [[G25]] in word, [[G3056]] neither [[G3366]] in tongue; [[G1100]] but [[G235]] in deed [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] in truth. [[G225]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] hereby [[G1722]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] shall assure [[G3982]] our [[G2257]] hearts [[G2588]] before [[G1715]] him. [[G846]]

### 20
For [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] our [[G2257]] heart us, [[G2588]] condemn [[G2607]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] greater than [[G3187]] our [[G2257]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] knoweth [[G1097]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 21
Beloved, [[G27]] if [[G1437]] our [[G2257]] heart [[G2588]] condemn [[G2607]] us [[G2257]] not, [[G3361]] have we [[G2192]] confidence [[G3954]] toward [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G3739]] we ask, [[G154]] we receive [[G2983]] of [[G3844]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] we keep [[G5083]] his [[G846]] commandments, [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] those things that are pleasing [[G701]] in [[G1799]] his [[G846]] sight. [[G1799]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] his [[G846]] commandment, [[G1785]] That [[G2443]] we should believe [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] on [[G3686]] name [[G3686]] of his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] love [[G25]] one another, [[G240]] as [[G2531]] he gave [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] commandment. [[G1785]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that keepeth [[G5083]] his [[G846]] commandments [[G1785]] dwelleth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] hereby [[G1722]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] he abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] which [[G3739]] he hath given [[G1325]] us. [[G2254]]
