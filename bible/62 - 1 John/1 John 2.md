### 1
My [[G3450]] little children, [[G5040]] these things [[G5023]] write I [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] ye sin [[G264]] not. [[G3361]] And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] sin, [[G264]] we have [[G2192]] an advocate [[G3875]] with [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] the righteous: [[G1342]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] is [[G2076]] the propitiation [[G2434]] for [[G4012]] our [[G2257]] sins: [[G266]] and [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] for [[G4012]] ours [[G2251]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world. [[G2889]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] hereby [[G5129]]  we do [[G1722]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we know [[G1097]] him, [[G846]] if [[G1437]] we keep [[G5083]] his [[G846]] commandments. [[G1785]]

### 4
He [[G3588]] that saith, [[G3004]] I know [[G1097]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] keepeth [[G5083]] not [[G3361]] his [[G846]] commandments, [[G1785]] is [[G2076]] a liar, [[G5583]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G5129]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] whoso [[G3739]] keepeth [[G5083]] his [[G846]] word, [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] him [[G5129]] verily [[G230]] the [[G3588]] is [[G5048]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] perfected: [[G5048]] hereby [[G1722]] know we [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 6
He [[G3588]] that saith [[G3004]] he abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] ought [[G3784]] himself [[G846]] also [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] so [[G3779]] to walk, [[G4043]] even [[G2531]] he [[G1565]] walked. [[G4043]]

### 7
Brethren, [[G80]] I write [[G1125]] no [[G3756]] new [[G2537]] commandment [[G1785]] unto you, [[G5213]] but [[G235]] an [[G1785]] old [[G3820]] commandment [[G1785]] which [[G3739]] ye had [[G2192]] from [[G575]] the beginning. [[G746]] The [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] commandment [[G1785]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] which [[G3739]] ye have heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] the beginning. [[G746]]

### 8
Again, [[G3825]] a [[G1785]] new [[G2537]] commandment [[G1785]] I write [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] which thing [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] true [[G227]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] you: [[G5213]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] darkness [[G4653]] is past, [[G3855]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] true [[G228]] light [[G5457]] now [[G2235]] shineth. [[G5316]]

### 9
He [[G3588]] that saith [[G3004]] he is [[G1511]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] hateth [[G3404]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] darkness even [[G4653]] until [[G2193]] now. [[G737]]

### 10
He [[G3588]] that loveth [[G25]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G2076]] none [[G3756]] occasion of stumbling [[G4625]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] hateth [[G3404]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] darkness, [[G4653]] and [[G2532]] walketh [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] darkness, [[G4653]] and [[G2532]] knoweth [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] whither [[G4226]] he goeth, [[G5217]] because [[G3754]]  that [[G3588]] darkness [[G4653]] hath blinded [[G5186]] his [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]]

### 12
I write [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] little children, [[G5040]] because [[G3754]] your [[G5213]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven you [[G863]] for [[G1223]] his [[G846]] name's sake. [[G3686]]

### 13
I write [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] fathers, [[G3962]] because [[G3754]] ye have known [[G1097]] him [[G3588]] from [[G575]] the beginning. [[G746]] I write [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] young men, [[G3495]] because [[G3754]] ye have overcome [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] wicked one. [[G4190]] I write [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] little children, [[G3813]] because [[G3754]] ye have known [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 14
I have written [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] fathers, [[G3962]] because [[G3754]] ye have known [[G1097]] him [[G3588]] from [[G575]] the beginning. [[G746]] I have written [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] young men, [[G3495]] because [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] strong, [[G2478]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] God [[G2316]] of [[G1722]] abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] ye have overcome [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] wicked one. [[G4190]]

### 15
Love [[G25]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] neither [[G3366]] the things [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] If [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3962]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
For [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] the [[G3588]] lust [[G1939]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lust [[G1939]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3788]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] pride [[G212]] of [[G979]] life, [[G979]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] but [[G235]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] passeth away, [[G3855]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lust [[G1939]] thereof: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] he that doeth [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] abideth [[G3306]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 18
Little children, [[G3813]] it is [[G2076]] last [[G2078]] the [[G5610]] time: [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] ye have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] antichrist [[G500]] shall come, [[G2064]] even [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] are there [[G1096]] many [[G4183]] antichrists; [[G500]] whereby [[G3606]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] last [[G2078]] the [[G5610]] time. [[G5610]]

### 19
They went [[G1831]] out from [[G1537]] us, [[G2257]] but [[G235]] they were [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] us; [[G2257]] for [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] they had been [[G2258]] of [[G1537]] us, [[G2257]] they would [[G302]] have continued [[G3306]] with [[G3326]] us: [[G2257]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] they might be made manifest [[G5319]] that [[G3754]] they were [[G1526]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] of [[G1537]] us. [[G2257]]

### 20
But [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] have [[G2192]] an unction [[G5545]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Holy One, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] ye know [[G1492]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 21
not [[G3756]] I have [[G1125]] written [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] because [[G3754]] ye know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] but [[G235]] because [[G3754]] ye know [[G1492]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] no [[G3756]] lie [[G5579]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

### 22
Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] a [[G3588]] liar [[G5583]] but [[G1487]] he [[G3588]] that denieth [[G720]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Christ? [[G5547]] He [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] antichrist, [[G500]] that [[G3588]] denieth [[G720]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son. [[G5207]]

### 23
Whosoever [[G3956]] denieth [[G720]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] the same hath [[G2192]] not [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] Father: [[G3962]] he [[G3588]] that acknowledgeth [[G3670]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] hath [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] also. [[G2532]]

### 24
therefore [[G3767]] Let that [[G3306]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] which [[G3739]] ye have [[G5210]] heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] the beginning. [[G746]] If [[G1437]] that which [[G3739]] ye have heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] shall remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] shall continue [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] that [[G3739]] he [[G846]] hath promised [[G1861]] us, [[G2254]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 26
These [[G5023]] have I written [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] concerning [[G4012]] them that seduce [[G4105]] you. [[G5209]]

### 27
But [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] anointing [[G5545]] which [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] have received [[G2983]] of [[G575]] him [[G846]] abideth [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] need [[G5532]] ye [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] any man [[G5100]] teach [[G1321]] you: [[G5209]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] anointing [[G5545]] teacheth [[G1321]] you [[G5209]] of [[G4012]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] truth, [[G227]] and [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] lie, [[G5579]] and [[G2532]] even as [[G2531]] it hath taught [[G1321]] you, [[G5209]] ye shall abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] little children, [[G5040]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] him; [[G846]] that, [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] he shall appear, [[G5319]] we may have [[G2192]] confidence, [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] be ashamed [[G153]] before [[G575]] him [[G846]] at [[G1722]] his [[G846]] coming. [[G3952]]

### 29
If [[G1437]] ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] righteous, [[G1342]] ye know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] every one [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] doeth [[G4160]] righteousness [[G1343]] is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] him. [[G846]]
