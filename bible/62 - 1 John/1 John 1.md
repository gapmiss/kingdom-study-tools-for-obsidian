### 1
That which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] from [[G575]] the beginning, [[G746]] which [[G3739]] we have heard, [[G191]] which [[G3739]] we have seen with [[G3708]] our [[G2257]] eyes, [[G3788]] which [[G3739]] we have looked upon, [[G2300]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] hands have [[G5495]] handled, [[G5584]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] of [[G2222]] life; [[G2222]]

### 2
(For [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] was manifested, [[G5319]] and [[G2532]] we have seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] bear witness, [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] shew [[G518]] unto you [[G5213]] that [[G3588]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] which [[G3748]] was [[G2258]] with [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] was manifested [[G5319]] unto us;) [[G2254]]

### 3
That which [[G3739]] we have seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] declare we [[G518]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] may have [[G2192]] fellowship [[G2842]] with [[G3326]] us: [[G2257]] and [[G2532]] truly [[G1161]] our [[G2251]] fellowship [[G2842]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] these things [[G5023]] write we [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G2443]] your [[G5216]] joy may [[G5479]] be [[G5600]] full. [[G4137]]

### 5
This [[G3778]] then [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] message [[G1860]] which [[G3739]] we have heard [[G191]] of [[G575]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] declare [[G312]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] darkness [[G4653]] at all. [[G3762]]

### 6
If [[G1437]] we say [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] we have [[G2192]] fellowship [[G2842]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] darkness, [[G4655]] we lie, [[G5574]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] truth: [[G225]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] we walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] as [[G5613]] he [[G846]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] we have [[G2192]] fellowship [[G2842]] with [[G3326]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] cleanseth [[G2511]] us [[G2248]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] sin. [[G266]]

### 8
If [[G1437]] we say [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] we have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] sin, [[G266]] we deceive [[G4105]] ourselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] us. [[G2254]]

### 9
If [[G1437]] we confess [[G3670]] our [[G2257]] sins, [[G266]] he is [[G2076]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] just [[G1342]] to [[G2443]] forgive [[G863]] us [[G2254]] sins, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] to cleanse [[G2511]] us [[G2248]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] unrighteousness. [[G93]]

### 10
If [[G1437]] we say [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] we have [[G264]] sinned, [[G264]] we make [[G4160]] him [[G846]] a liar, [[G5583]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] word [[G3056]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] us. [[G2254]]
