### 1
Whosoever [[G3956]] believeth [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God: [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] every one [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] loveth [[G25]] him [[G3588]] that begat [[G1080]] loveth [[G25]] him also [[G3588]] that is begotten [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] him. [[G846]]

### 2
By [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] when [[G3752]] we love [[G25]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G5083]] his [[G846]] commandments. [[G1785]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] we keep [[G5083]] his [[G846]] commandments: [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] commandments [[G1785]] are [[G1526]] not [[G3756]] grievous. [[G926]]

### 4
For [[G3754]] whatsoever [[G3956]] is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] overcometh [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] world: [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] victory [[G3529]] that [[G3588]] overcometh [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] our [[G2257]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 5
Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] he [[G3588]] that overcometh [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G1487]] he [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God? [[G2316]]

### 6
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] he [[G3588]] that came [[G2064]] by [[G1223]] water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ; [[G5547]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1722]] water [[G5204]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] by [[G1722]] water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] blood. [[G129]] And [[G2532]] it is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Spirit that beareth [[G4151]] witness, [[G3140]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] is [[G2076]] truth. [[G225]]

### 7
For [[G3754]] there are [[G1526]] three [[G5140]] that bear record [[G3140]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] Word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost: [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] three [[G5140]] are [[G1526]] one. [[G1520]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] there are [[G1526]] three [[G5140]] that bear witness [[G3140]] in [[G1722]] earth, [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] blood: [[G129]] and [[G2532]] these [[G3588]] three [[G5140]] agree [[G1526]] in [[G1519]] one. [[G1520]]

### 9
If [[G1487]] we receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] witness [[G3141]] of [[G444]] men, [[G444]] the [[G3588]] witness [[G3141]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] greater: [[G3187]] for [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] witness [[G3141]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] he hath testified [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] his [[G846]] Son. [[G5207]]

### 10
He [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] hath [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] witness [[G3141]] in [[G1722]] himself: [[G1438]] he that believeth [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] God hath [[G2316]] made [[G4160]] him [[G846]] a liar; [[G5583]] because [[G3754]] he believeth [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] record [[G3141]] that [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G3140]] of [[G4012]] his [[G846]] Son. [[G5207]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] record, [[G3141]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] hath given [[G1325]] to us [[G2254]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] life [[G2222]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] Son. [[G5207]]

### 12
He [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] hath [[G2192]] life; [[G2222]] he that hath [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] hath [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] life. [[G2222]]

### 13
These things [[G5023]] have I written [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] that believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] ye may know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] ye have [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] ye may believe [[G4100]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] confidence [[G3954]] that [[G3739]] we have [[G2192]] in [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] that, [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] we ask [[G154]] any thing [[G5100]] according to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] he heareth [[G191]] us: [[G2257]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he hear [[G191]] us, [[G2257]] whatsoever [[G3739]] we ask, [[G154]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] petitions [[G155]] that [[G3739]] we desired [[G154]] of [[G3844]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
If [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] see [[G1492]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] sin [[G264]] a sin [[G266]] not [[G3361]] unto [[G4314]] death, [[G2288]] he shall ask, [[G154]] and [[G2532]] he shall give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] life [[G2222]] for them that sin [[G264]] not [[G3361]] unto [[G4314]] death. [[G2288]] There is [[G2076]] a sin [[G266]] unto [[G4314]] death: [[G2288]] not [[G3756]] I do [[G3004]] say [[G3004]] that [[G2443]] he shall pray [[G2065]] for [[G4012]] it. [[G1565]]

### 17
All [[G3956]] unrighteousness [[G93]] is [[G2076]] sin: [[G266]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G2076]] a sin [[G266]] not [[G3756]] unto [[G4314]] death. [[G2288]]

### 18
We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] whosoever [[G3956]] is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] sinneth [[G264]] not; [[G3756]] but [[G235]] he [[G3588]] that is begotten [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] keepeth [[G5083]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3588]] wicked one [[G4190]] toucheth [[G680]] him [[G846]] not. [[G3756]]

### 19
we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world [[G2889]] lieth [[G2749]] in [[G1722]] wickedness. [[G4190]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is come, [[G2240]] and [[G2532]] hath given [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] an understanding, [[G1271]] that [[G2443]] we may know [[G1097]] him [[G3588]] that is true, [[G228]] and [[G2532]] we are [[G2070]] in [[G1722]] him [[G3588]] that is true, [[G228]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] true [[G228]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 21
Little children, [[G5040]] keep [[G5442]] yourselves [[G1438]] from [[G575]] idols. [[G1497]] Amen. [[G281]]
