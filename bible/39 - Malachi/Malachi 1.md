### 1
The burden [[H4853]] of the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to [[H413]] Israel [[H3478]] by [[H3027]] Malachi. [[H4401]]

### 2
I have loved [[H157]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]] Yet ye say, [[H559]] Wherein [[H4100]] hast thou loved [[H157]] us? not [[H3808]] Esau [[H6215]] Jacob's [[H3290]] brother? [[H251]] saith [[H559]] the Lord: [[H3068]] yet I loved [[H157]] Jacob, [[H3290]]

### 3
And I hated [[H8130]] Esau, [[H6215]] and laid [[H7760]] his mountains [[H2022]] and his heritage [[H5159]] waste [[H8077]] for the dragons [[H8568]] of the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 4
Whereas [[H3588]] Edom [[H123]] saith, [[H559]] We are impoverished, [[H7567]] but we will return [[H7725]] and build [[H1129]] the desolate places; [[H2723]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] They [[H1992]] shall build, [[H1129]] but I [[H589]] will throw down; [[H2040]] and they shall call [[H7121]] them, The border [[H1366]] of wickedness, [[H7564]] and, The people [[H5971]] against whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath indignation [[H2194]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 5
And your eyes [[H5869]] shall see, [[H7200]] and ye [[H859]] shall say, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] will be magnified [[H1431]] from [[H5921]] the border [[H1366]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
A son [[H1121]] honoureth [[H3513]] father, [[H1]] and a servant [[H5650]] his master: [[H113]] if [[H518]] then I [[H589]] a father, [[H1]] where [[H346]] mine honour? [[H3519]] and if [[H518]] I [[H589]] a master, [[H113]] where [[H346]] my fear? [[H4172]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] unto you, O priests, [[H3548]] that despise [[H959]] my name. [[H8034]] And ye say, [[H559]] Wherein [[H4100]] have we despised [[H959]] thy name? [[H8034]]

### 7
Ye offer [[H5066]] polluted [[H1351]] bread [[H3899]] upon [[H5921]] mine altar; [[H4196]] and ye say, [[H559]] Wherein [[H4100]] have we polluted [[H1351]] thee? In that ye say, [[H559]] The table [[H7979]] of the Lord [[H3068]] contemptible. [[H959]]

### 8
And if [[H3588]] ye offer [[H5066]] the blind [[H5787]] for sacrifice, [[H2076]] not [[H369]] evil? [[H7451]] and if [[H3588]] ye offer [[H5066]] the lame [[H6455]] and sick, [[H2470]] not [[H369]] evil? [[H7451]] offer [[H7126]] it now [[H4994]] unto thy governor; [[H6346]] will he be pleased [[H7521]] with thee, or [[H176]] accept [[H5375]] thy person? [[H6440]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 9
And now, [[H6258]] I pray you, [[H4994]] beseech [[H2470]] God [[H410]] that he will be gracious [[H2603]] unto us: this [[H2063]] hath been [[H1961]] by your means: [[H3027]] will he regard [[H5375]] your [[H4480]] persons? [[H6440]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] even [[H1571]] among you that would shut [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] neither [[H3808]] do ye kindle [[H215]] on mine altar [[H4196]] for nought. [[H2600]] I have no [[H369]] pleasure [[H2656]] in you, saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] neither [[H3808]] will I accept [[H7521]] an offering [[H4503]] at your hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] from the rising [[H4217]] of the sun [[H8121]] even unto [[H5704]] the going down [[H3996]] of the same my name [[H8034]] great [[H1419]] among the Gentiles; [[H1471]] and in every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] incense [[H6999]] offered [[H5066]] unto my name, [[H8034]] and a pure [[H2889]] offering: [[H4503]] for [[H3588]] my name [[H8034]] great [[H1419]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 12
But ye [[H859]] have profaned [[H2490]] it, in that ye say, [[H559]] The table [[H7979]] of the Lord [[H136]] polluted; [[H1351]] and the fruit [[H5108]] thereof, his meat, [[H400]] contemptible. [[H959]]

### 13
Ye said [[H559]] also, Behold, [[H2009]] what a weariness [[H4972]] and ye have snuffed at [[H5301]] it, saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] and ye brought [[H935]] torn, [[H1497]] and the lame, [[H6455]] and the sick; [[H2470]] thus ye brought [[H935]] an offering: [[H4503]] should I accept [[H7521]] this of your hand? [[H3027]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
But cursed [[H779]] the deceiver, [[H5230]] which hath [[H3426]] in his flock [[H5739]] a male, [[H2145]] and voweth, [[H5087]] and sacrificeth [[H2076]] unto the Lord [[H136]] a corrupt thing: [[H7843]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] a great [[H1419]] King, [[H4428]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and my name [[H8034]] dreadful [[H3372]] among the heathen.
