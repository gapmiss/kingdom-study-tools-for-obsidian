### 1
And now, [[H6258]] O ye priests, [[H3548]] this [[H2063]] commandment [[H4687]] for [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 2
If [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] and if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] lay [[H7760]] to [[H5921]] heart, [[H3820]] to give [[H5414]] glory [[H3519]] unto my name, [[H8034]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] I will even send [[H7971]] a curse [[H3994]] upon you, and I will curse [[H779]] your blessings: [[H1293]] yea, [[H1571]] I have cursed [[H779]] them already, because [[H3588]] ye do not [[H369]] lay [[H7760]] to [[H5921]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 3
Behold, [[H2005]] I will corrupt [[H1605]] your seed, [[H2233]] and spread [[H2219]] dung [[H6569]] upon [[H5921]] your faces, [[H6440]] the dung [[H6569]] of your solemn feasts; [[H2282]] and shall take you away [[H5375]] with [[H413]] it. [[H413]]

### 4
And ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have sent [[H7971]] this [[H2063]] commandment [[H4687]] unto [[H413]] you, that my covenant [[H1285]] might be [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Levi, [[H3878]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 5
My covenant [[H1285]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] him of life [[H2416]] and peace; [[H7965]] and I gave [[H5414]] them to him the fear [[H4172]] wherewith he feared [[H3372]] me, and was afraid [[H2865]] before [[H6440]] my name. [[H8034]]

### 6
The law [[H8451]] of truth [[H571]] was [[H1961]] in his mouth, [[H6310]] and iniquity [[H5766]] was not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] in his lips: [[H8193]] he walked [[H1980]] with [[H854]] me in peace [[H7965]] and equity, [[H4334]] and did turn away [[H7725]] many [[H7227]] from iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the priest's [[H3548]] lips [[H8193]] should keep [[H8104]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and they should seek [[H1245]] the law [[H8451]] at his mouth: [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the messenger [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 8
But ye [[H859]] are departed [[H5493]] out of [[H4480]] the way; [[H1870]] ye have caused many [[H7227]] to stumble [[H3782]] at the law; [[H8451]] ye have corrupted [[H7843]] the covenant [[H1285]] of Levi, [[H3878]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 9
Therefore have I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] made [[H5414]] you contemptible [[H959]] and base [[H8217]] before all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] according as [[H6310]] ye have not [[H369]] kept [[H8104]] my ways, [[H1870]] but have been partial [[H5375]] in the law. [[H8451]]

### 10
Have we not [[H3808]] all [[H3605]] one [[H259]] father? [[H1]] hath not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] God [[H410]] created [[H1254]] us? why [[H4069]] do we deal treacherously [[H898]] every man [[H376]] against his brother, [[H251]] by profaning [[H2490]] the covenant [[H1285]] of our fathers? [[H1]]

### 11
Judah [[H3063]] hath dealt treacherously, [[H898]] and an abomination [[H8441]] is committed [[H6213]] in Israel [[H3478]] and in Jerusalem; [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] Judah [[H3063]] hath profaned [[H2490]] the holiness [[H6944]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he loved, [[H157]] and hath married [[H1166]] the daughter [[H1323]] of a strange [[H5236]] god. [[H410]]

### 12
The Lord [[H3068]] will cut off [[H3772]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] doeth [[H6213]] this, the master [[H5782]] and the scholar, [[H6030]] out of the tabernacles [[H168]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and him that offereth [[H5066]] an offering [[H4503]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 13
And this [[H2063]] have ye done [[H6213]] again, [[H8145]] covering [[H3680]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with tears, [[H1832]] with weeping, [[H1065]] and with crying out, [[H603]] insomuch that he regardeth [[H6437]] not [[H369]] the offering [[H4503]] any more, [[H5750]] or receiveth [[H3947]] with good will [[H7522]] at your hand. [[H3027]]

### 14
Yet ye say, [[H559]] Wherefore? [[H4100]] Because [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath been witness [[H5749]] between [[H996]] thee and the wife [[H802]] of thy youth, [[H5271]] against whom [[H834]] thou [[H859]] hast dealt treacherously: [[H898]] yet she [[H1931]] thy companion, [[H2278]] and the wife [[H802]] of thy covenant. [[H1285]]

### 15
And did not [[H3808]] he make [[H6213]] one? [[H259]] Yet had he the residue [[H7605]] of the spirit. [[H7307]] And wherefore [[H4100]] one? [[H259]] That he might seek [[H1245]] a godly [[H430]] seed. [[H2233]] Therefore take heed [[H8104]] to your spirit, [[H7307]] and let none [[H408]] deal treacherously [[H898]] against the wife [[H802]] of his youth. [[H5271]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H559]] that he hateth [[H8130]] putting away: [[H7971]] for covereth [[H3680]] violence [[H2555]] with [[H5921]] his garment, [[H3830]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]] therefore take heed [[H8104]] to your spirit, [[H7307]] that ye deal not treacherously. [[H898]]

### 17
Ye have wearied [[H3021]] the Lord [[H3068]] with your words. [[H1697]] Yet ye say, [[H559]] Wherein [[H4100]] have we wearied [[H3021]] When ye say, [[H559]] Every one [[H3605]] that doeth [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] good [[H2896]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and he [[H1931]] delighteth [[H2654]] in them; or, [[H176]] Where [[H346]] the God [[H430]] of judgment?
