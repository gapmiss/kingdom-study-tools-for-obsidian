### 1
Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] my messenger, [[H4397]] and he shall prepare [[H6437]] the way [[H1870]] before [[H6440]] me: and the Lord, [[H113]] whom [[H834]] ye [[H859]] seek, [[H1245]] shall suddenly [[H6597]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] his temple, [[H1964]] even the messenger [[H4397]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] whom [[H834]] ye [[H859]] delight [[H2655]] in: behold, [[H2009]] he shall come, [[H935]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 2
But who [[H4310]] may abide [[H3557]] the day [[H3117]] of his coming? [[H935]] and who [[H4310]] shall stand [[H5975]] when he appeareth? [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] like a refiner's [[H6884]] fire, [[H784]] and like fullers' [[H3526]] soap: [[H1287]]

### 3
And he shall sit [[H3427]] a refiner [[H6884]] and purifier [[H2891]] of silver: [[H3701]] and he shall purify [[H2891]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] and purge [[H2212]] them as gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] that they may offer [[H5066]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] an offering [[H4503]] in righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 4
Then shall the offering [[H4503]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] be pleasant [[H6149]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] as in the days [[H3117]] of old, [[H5769]] and as in former [[H6931]] years. [[H8141]]

### 5
And I will come near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] you to judgment; [[H4941]] and I will be [[H1961]] a swift [[H4116]] witness [[H5707]] against the sorcerers, [[H3784]] and against the adulterers, [[H5003]] and against false [[H8267]] swearers, [[H7650]] and against those that oppress [[H6231]] the hireling [[H7916]] in wages, [[H7939]] the widow, [[H490]] and the fatherless, [[H3490]] and that turn aside [[H5186]] the stranger [[H1616]] and fear [[H3372]] not [[H3808]] me, saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I change [[H8138]] not; [[H3808]] therefore ye [[H859]] sons [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] are not [[H3808]] consumed. [[H3615]]

### 7
Even from the days [[H3117]] of your fathers [[H1]] ye are gone away [[H5493]] from mine ordinances, [[H2706]] and have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] Return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] me, and I will return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] you, saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]] But ye said, [[H559]] Wherein [[H4100]] shall we return? [[H7725]]

### 8
Will a man [[H120]] rob [[H6906]] God? [[H430]] Yet [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] have robbed [[H6906]] me. But ye say, [[H559]] Wherein [[H4100]] have we robbed [[H6906]] thee? In tithes [[H4643]] and offerings. [[H8641]]

### 9
Ye [[H859]] cursed [[H779]] with a curse: [[H3994]] for ye [[H859]] have robbed [[H6906]] me, this whole [[H3605]] nation. [[H1471]]

### 10
Bring [[H935]]  ye [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the tithes [[H4643]] into [[H413]] the storehouse, [[H214]] that there may be [[H1961]] meat [[H2964]] in mine house, [[H1004]] and prove [[H974]] me now [[H4994]] herewith, [[H2063]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] if [[H518]] I will not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]]  you [[H853]] the windows [[H699]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and pour you out [[H7324]] a blessing, [[H1293]] that [[H5704]] not [[H1097]] enough [[H1767]]

### 11
And I will rebuke [[H1605]] the devourer [[H398]] for your sakes, and he shall not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] the fruits [[H6529]] of your ground; [[H127]] neither [[H3808]] shall your vine [[H1612]] cast her fruit [[H7921]] before the time in the field, [[H7704]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 12
And all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] shall call you blessed: [[H833]] for [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] a delightsome [[H2656]] land, [[H776]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 13
Your words [[H1697]] have been stout [[H2388]] against [[H5921]] me, saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]] Yet ye say, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have we spoken [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] thee? [[H5921]]

### 14
Ye have said, [[H559]] It vain [[H7723]] to serve [[H5647]] God: [[H430]] and what [[H4100]] profit [[H1215]] that [[H3588]] we have kept [[H8104]] his ordinance, [[H4931]] and that [[H3588]] we have walked [[H1980]] mournfully [[H6941]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts? [[H6635]]

### 15
And now [[H6258]] we [[H587]] call [[H833]] the proud [[H2086]] happy; yea, [[H1571]] they that work [[H6213]] wickedness [[H7564]] are set up; [[H1129]] yea, [[H1571]] tempt [[H974]] God [[H430]] are even delivered. [[H4422]]

### 16
Then [[H227]] they that feared [[H3373]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake often [[H1696]] one [[H376]] to [[H854]] another: [[H7453]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hearkened, [[H7181]] and heard [[H8085]] and a book [[H5612]] of remembrance [[H2146]] was written [[H3789]] before [[H6440]] him for them that feared [[H3372]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and that thought [[H2803]] upon his name. [[H8034]]

### 17
And they shall be [[H1961]] mine, saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] in that day [[H3117]] when [[H834]] I [[H589]] make up [[H6213]] my jewels; [[H5459]] and I will spare [[H2550]] them, as [[H834]] a man [[H376]] spareth [[H2550]] his own son [[H1121]] that serveth [[H5647]] him. [[H5647]]

### 18
Then shall ye return, [[H7725]] and discern [[H7200]] between [[H996]] the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked, [[H7563]] between [[H996]] him that serveth [[H5647]] God [[H430]] and him [[H834]] that serveth [[H5647]] him not. [[H5647]]
