### 1
And Joshua [[H3091]] gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] to Shechem, [[H7927]] and called [[H7121]] for the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and for their heads, [[H7218]] and for their judges, [[H8199]] and for their officers; [[H7860]] and they presented themselves [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]]

### 2
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Your fathers [[H1]] dwelt [[H3427]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the flood [[H5104]] in old time, [[H5769]] Terah, [[H8646]] the father [[H1]] of Abraham, [[H85]] and the father [[H1]] of Nachor: [[H5152]] and they served [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

### 3
And I took [[H3947]] your father [[H1]] Abraham [[H85]] from the other side [[H5676]] of the flood, [[H5104]] and led [[H1980]] him throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and multiplied [[H7235]] his seed, [[H2233]] and gave [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] Isaac. [[H3327]]

### 4
And I gave [[H5414]] unto Isaac [[H3327]] Jacob [[H3290]] and Esau: [[H6215]] and I gave [[H5414]] unto Esau [[H6215]] mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] to possess [[H3423]] it; but Jacob [[H3290]] and his children [[H1121]] went down [[H3381]] into Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 5
I sent [[H7971]] Moses [[H4872]] also and Aaron, [[H175]] and I plagued [[H5062]] Egypt, [[H4714]] according to that which [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] among [[H7130]] them: and afterward [[H310]] I brought you out. [[H3318]]

### 6
And I brought [[H3318]] your fathers [[H1]]  out [[H853]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] and ye came [[H935]] unto the sea; [[H3220]] and the Egyptians [[H4713]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] your fathers [[H1]] with chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] unto the Red [[H5488]] sea. [[H3220]]

### 7
And when they cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he put [[H7760]] darkness [[H3990]] between [[H996]] you and the Egyptians, [[H4713]] and brought [[H935]] the sea [[H3220]] upon [[H5921]] them, and covered [[H3680]] them; and your eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] what [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] in Egypt: [[H4714]] and ye dwelt [[H3427]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] a long [[H7227]] season. [[H3117]]

### 8
And I brought [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which dwelt [[H3427]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan; [[H3383]] and they fought [[H3898]] with [[H854]] you: and I gave [[H5414]] them into your hand, [[H3027]] that ye might possess [[H3423]] their land; [[H776]] and I destroyed [[H8045]] them from before [[H6440]] you. [[H6440]]

### 9
Then Balak [[H1111]] the son [[H1121]] of Zippor, [[H6834]] king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] arose [[H6965]] and warred [[H3898]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] Balaam [[H1109]] the son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] to curse [[H7043]] you: [[H7043]]

### 10
But I would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto Balaam; [[H1109]] therefore he blessed [[H1288]] you still: [[H1288]] so I delivered [[H5337]] you out of his hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
And ye went over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Jericho: [[H3405]] and the men [[H1167]] of Jericho [[H3405]] fought [[H3898]] against you, the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] and the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Girgashites, [[H1622]] the Hivites, [[H2340]] and the Jebusites; [[H2983]] and I delivered [[H5414]] them into your hand. [[H3027]]

### 12
And I sent [[H7971]] the hornet [[H6880]] before [[H6440]] you, which drave them out [[H1644]] from before [[H6440]] you, the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites; [[H567]] not [[H3808]] with thy sword, [[H2719]] nor [[H3808]] with thy bow. [[H7198]]

### 13
And I have given [[H5414]] you a land [[H776]] for which [[H834]] ye did not [[H3808]] labour, [[H3021]] and cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] ye built [[H1129]] not, [[H3808]] and ye dwell [[H3427]] in them; of the vineyards [[H3754]] and oliveyards [[H2132]] which [[H834]] ye planted [[H5193]] not [[H3808]] do ye [[H859]] eat. [[H398]]

### 14
Now therefore [[H6258]] fear [[H3372]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] him in sincerity [[H8549]] and in truth: [[H571]] and put away [[H5493]] the gods [[H430]] which [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] served [[H5647]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the flood, [[H5104]] and in Egypt; [[H4714]] and serve [[H5647]]  ye [[H853]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
And if [[H518]] it seem evil [[H7451]] unto you [[H4310]] to serve [[H5647]] the Lord, [[H3068]] choose [[H977]] you this day [[H3117]] whom [[H5869]] ye will serve; [[H5647]] whether [[H518]] the gods [[H430]] which [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] served [[H5647]] that [[H834]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the flood, [[H5104]] or [[H518]] the gods [[H430]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] in whose land [[H776]] ye [[H859]] dwell: [[H3427]] but as for me [[H595]] and my house, [[H1004]] we will serve [[H5647]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
And the people [[H5971]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] God forbid [[H2486]] that we should forsake [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods; [[H430]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] that brought up [[H5927]] us and our fathers [[H1]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the house [[H1004]] of bondage, [[H5650]] and which [[H834]] did [[H6213]] those [[H428]] great [[H1419]] signs [[H226]] in our sight, [[H5869]] and preserved [[H8104]] us in all [[H3605]] the way [[H1870]] wherein [[H834]] we went, [[H1980]] and among all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] through [[H7130]] whom we passed: [[H5674]]

### 18
And the Lord [[H3068]] drave out [[H1644]] from before [[H6440]]  us [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] even the Amorites [[H567]] which dwelt [[H3427]] in the land: [[H776]] will we [[H587]] also [[H1571]] serve [[H5647]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] our God. [[H430]]

### 19
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Ye cannot [[H3201]] serve [[H5647]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] an holy [[H6918]] God; [[H430]] he [[H1931]] a jealous [[H7072]] God; [[H410]] he will not [[H3808]] forgive [[H5375]] your transgressions [[H6588]] nor your sins. [[H2403]]

### 20
If [[H3588]] ye forsake [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] strange [[H5236]] gods, [[H430]] then he will turn [[H7725]] and do you hurt, [[H7489]] and consume [[H3615]] you, after [[H310]] that [[H834]] he hath done you good. [[H3190]]

### 21
And the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] we will serve [[H5647]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Ye [[H859]] witnesses [[H5707]] against yourselves that [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] have chosen [[H977]]  you [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to serve [[H5647]] him. And they said, [[H559]] witnesses. [[H5707]]

### 23
Now [[H6258]] therefore put away, [[H5493]]  the [[H853]] strange [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] which [[H834]] among [[H7130]] you, and incline [[H5186]] your heart [[H3824]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
And the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] The Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] will we serve, [[H5647]] and his voice [[H6963]] will we obey. [[H8085]]

### 25
So Joshua [[H3091]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with the people [[H5971]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and set [[H7760]] them a statute [[H2706]] and an ordinance [[H4941]] in Shechem. [[H7927]]

### 26
And Joshua [[H3091]] wrote [[H3789]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of God, [[H430]] and took [[H3947]] a great [[H1419]] stone, [[H68]] and set it up [[H6965]] there [[H8033]] under [[H8478]] an oak, [[H427]] that [[H834]] by the sanctuary [[H4720]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] Behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] stone [[H68]] shall be [[H1961]] a witness [[H5713]] unto us; for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] hath heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H561]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H5973]] us: it shall be [[H1961]] therefore a witness [[H5713]] unto you, lest [[H6435]] ye deny [[H3584]] your God. [[H430]]

### 28
So Joshua [[H3091]]  let [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] depart, [[H7971]] every man [[H376]] unto his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 29
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] that Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] died, [[H4191]] an hundred [[H3967]] and ten [[H6235]] years [[H8141]] old. [[H1121]]

### 30
And they buried [[H6912]] him in the border [[H1366]] of his inheritance [[H5159]] in Timnath-serah, [[H8556]] which [[H834]] in mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] on the north side [[H6828]] of the hill [[H2022]] of Gaash. [[H1608]]

### 31
And Israel [[H3478]] served [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Joshua, [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the elders [[H2205]] that [[H834]] overlived [[H3117]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and which [[H834]] had known [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 32
And the bones [[H6106]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] which [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] brought up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] buried [[H6912]] they in Shechem, [[H7927]] in a parcel [[H2513]] of ground [[H7704]] which [[H834]] Jacob [[H3290]] bought [[H7069]] of [[H853]] the sons [[H1121]] of Hamor [[H2544]] the father [[H1]] of Shechem [[H7927]] for an hundred [[H3967]] pieces of silver: [[H7192]] and it became [[H1961]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of the children [[H1121]] of Joseph. [[H3130]]

### 33
And Eleazar [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] died; [[H4191]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in a hill [[H1389]] Phinehas [[H6372]] his son, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] was given [[H5414]] him in mount [[H2022]] Ephraim. [[H669]]
