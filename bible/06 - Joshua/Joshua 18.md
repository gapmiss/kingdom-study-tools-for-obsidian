And the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] assembled together [[H6950]] at Shiloh, [[H7887]] and set up [[H7931]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] there. [[H8033]] And the land [[H776]] was subdued [[H3533]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 2
And there remained [[H3498]] among the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] seven [[H7651]] tribes, [[H7626]] which [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] yet received [[H2505]] their inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 3
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] How long [[H5704]] ye [[H859]] slack [[H7503]] to go [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers [[H1]] hath given [[H5414]] you? [[H5414]]

### 4
Give out [[H3051]] from among you three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] for tribe: [[H7626]] and I will send [[H7971]] them, and they shall rise, [[H6965]] and go [[H1980]] through the land, [[H776]] and describe [[H3789]] it according [[H6310]] to the inheritance [[H5159]] of them; and they shall come [[H935]] to [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 5
And they shall divide [[H2505]] it into seven [[H7651]] parts: [[H2506]] Judah [[H3063]] shall abide [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] their coast [[H1366]] on the south, [[H5045]] and the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] shall abide [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] their coasts [[H1366]] on the north. [[H6828]]

### 6
Ye [[H859]] shall therefore describe [[H3789]] the land [[H776]] seven [[H7651]] parts, [[H2506]] and bring [[H935]] hither [[H2008]] to [[H413]] me, that I may cast [[H3384]] lots [[H1486]] for you here [[H6311]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 7
But [[H3588]] the Levites [[H3881]] have no [[H369]] part [[H2506]] among [[H7130]] you; for [[H3588]] the priesthood [[H3550]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their inheritance: [[H5159]] and Gad, [[H1410]] and Reuben, [[H7205]] and half [[H2677]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] have received [[H3947]] their inheritance [[H5159]] beyond [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] on the east, [[H4217]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] them. [[H5414]]

### 8
And the men [[H582]] arose, [[H6965]] and went away: [[H1980]] and Joshua [[H3091]] charged [[H6680]] them that went [[H1980]] to describe [[H3789]] the land, [[H776]] saying, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and walk [[H1980]] through the land, [[H776]] and describe [[H3789]] it, and come again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] me, that I may here [[H6311]] cast [[H7993]] lots [[H1486]] for you before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] in Shiloh. [[H7887]]

### 9
And the men [[H582]] went [[H1980]] and passed through [[H5674]] the land, [[H776]] and described [[H3789]] it by cities [[H5892]] into seven [[H7651]] parts [[H2506]] in [[H5921]] a book, [[H5612]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] to [[H413]] the host [[H4264]] at Shiloh. [[H7887]]

### 10
And Joshua [[H3091]] cast [[H7993]] lots [[H1486]] for them in Shiloh [[H7887]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and there [[H8033]] Joshua [[H3091]] divided [[H2505]] the land [[H776]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] according to their divisions. [[H4256]]
