### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H1471]] were clean [[H8552]] passed over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] that the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Take [[H3947]] you twelve [[H8147]] men [[H582]] out of [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] out of every [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] a man, [[H376]]

### 3
And command [[H6680]] ye them, saying, [[H559]] Take [[H5375]] you hence [[H2088]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] out of the place where the priests' [[H3548]] feet [[H7272]] stood [[H4673]] firm, [[H3559]] twelve [[H8147]] stones, [[H68]] and ye shall carry them over [[H5674]] with [[H5973]] you, and leave [[H3240]] them in the lodging place, [[H4411]] where [[H834]] ye shall lodge [[H3885]] this night. [[H3915]]

### 4
Then Joshua [[H3091]] called [[H7121]] the twelve [[H8147]] men, [[H376]] whom [[H834]] he had prepared [[H3559]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] out of every [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] a man: [[H376]]

### 5
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto them, Pass over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] and take ye up [[H7311]] every [[H259]] man [[H376]] of you a stone [[H68]] upon [[H5921]] his shoulder, [[H7926]] according unto the number [[H4557]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 6
That [[H4616]] this [[H2063]] may be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] among [[H7130]] you, when [[H3588]] your children [[H1121]] ask [[H7592]] in time to come, [[H4279]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] ye by these [[H428]] stones? [[H68]]

### 7
Then ye shall answer [[H559]] them, That [[H834]] the waters [[H4325]] of Jordan [[H3383]] were cut off [[H3772]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] when it passed over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] the waters [[H4325]] of Jordan [[H3383]] were cut off: [[H3772]] and these [[H428]] stones [[H68]] shall be [[H1961]] for a memorial [[H2146]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 8
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] as [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] commanded, [[H6680]] and took up [[H5375]] twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] according to the number [[H4557]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and carried them over [[H5674]] with [[H5973]] them unto [[H413]] the place where they lodged, [[H4411]] and laid them down [[H3240]] there. [[H8033]]

### 9
And Joshua [[H3091]] set up [[H6965]] twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] in the place [[H8478]] where the feet [[H7272]] of the priests [[H3548]] which bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] stood: [[H4673]] and they are [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 10
For the priests [[H3548]] which bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] stood [[H5975]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] until [[H5704]] every thing [[H1697]] was finished [[H8552]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Joshua [[H3091]] to speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] Joshua: [[H3091]] and the people [[H5971]] hasted [[H4116]] and passed over. [[H5674]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] were clean [[H8552]] passed over, [[H5674]] that the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] passed over, [[H5674]] and the priests, [[H3548]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 12
And the children [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] and the children [[H1121]] of Gad, [[H1410]] and half [[H2677]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] passed over [[H5674]] armed [[H2571]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them: [[H413]]

### 13
About forty [[H705]] thousand [[H505]] prepared [[H2502]] for war [[H6635]] passed over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto battle, [[H4421]] to [[H413]] the plains [[H6160]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 14
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] magnified [[H1431]] Joshua [[H3091]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel; [[H3478]] and they feared [[H3372]] him, as [[H834]] they feared [[H3372]] Moses, [[H4872]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life. [[H2416]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Command [[H6680]] the priests [[H3548]] that bear [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the testimony, [[H5715]] that they come up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 17
Joshua [[H3091]] therefore commanded [[H6680]] the priests, [[H3548]] saying, [[H559]] Come ye up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 18
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the priests [[H3548]] that bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] were come up [[H5927]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] the soles [[H3709]] of the priests' [[H3548]] feet [[H7272]] were lifted up [[H5423]] unto [[H413]] the dry land, [[H2724]] that the waters [[H4325]] of Jordan [[H3383]] returned [[H7725]] unto their place, [[H4725]] and flowed [[H1980]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his banks, [[H1415]] as [[H8543]] before. [[H8032]]

### 19
And the people [[H5971]] came up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] Jordan [[H3383]] on the tenth [[H6218]] of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] and encamped [[H2583]] in Gilgal, [[H1537]] in the east [[H4217]] border [[H7097]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 20
And those [[H428]] twelve [[H8147]] stones, [[H68]] which [[H834]] they took out [[H3947]] of [[H4480]] Jordan, [[H3383]] did Joshua [[H3091]] pitch [[H6965]] in Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 21
And he spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] When [[H834]] your children [[H1121]] shall ask [[H7592]] their fathers [[H1]] in time to come, [[H4279]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] these [[H428]] stones? [[H68]]

### 22
Then ye shall let [[H853]] your children [[H1121]] know, [[H3045]] saying, [[H559]] Israel [[H3478]] came over [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] Jordan [[H3383]] on dry land. [[H3004]]

### 23
For [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] dried up [[H3001]] the waters [[H4325]] of Jordan [[H3383]] from before [[H6440]] you, until [[H5704]] ye were passed over, [[H5674]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] did [[H6213]] to the Red [[H5488]] sea, [[H3220]] which [[H834]] he dried up [[H3001]] from before [[H6440]] us, until [[H5704]] we were gone over: [[H5674]]

### 24
That [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] might know [[H3045]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] mighty: [[H2389]] that [[H4616]] ye might fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] for ever. [[H3117]]
