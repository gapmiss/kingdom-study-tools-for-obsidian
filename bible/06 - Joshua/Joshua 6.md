### 1
Now Jericho [[H3405]] was straitly [[H5462]] shut up [[H5462]] because [[H6440]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] none [[H369]] went out, [[H3318]] and none [[H369]] came in. [[H935]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] See, [[H7200]] I have given [[H5414]] into thine hand [[H3027]] Jericho, [[H3405]] and the king [[H4428]] thereof, the mighty men [[H1368]] of valour. [[H2428]]

### 3
And ye shall compass [[H5437]] the city, [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] men [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] go round about [[H5362]] the city [[H5892]] once. [[H6471]] Thus [[H3541]] shalt thou do [[H6213]] six [[H8337]] days. [[H3117]]

### 4
And seven [[H7651]] priests [[H3548]] shall bear [[H5375]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] seven [[H7651]] trumpets [[H7782]] of rams' horns: [[H3104]] and the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] ye shall compass [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] seven [[H7651]] times, [[H6471]] and the priests [[H3548]] shall blow [[H8628]] with the trumpets. [[H7782]]

### 5
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] that when they make a long [[H4900]] with the ram's [[H3104]] horn, [[H7161]] when ye hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] shall shout [[H7321]] with a great [[H1419]] shout; [[H8643]] and the wall [[H2346]] of the city [[H5892]] shall fall down [[H5307]] flat, [[H8478]] and the people [[H5971]] shall ascend up [[H5927]] every man [[H376]] straight before [[H5048]] him. [[H5048]]

### 6
And Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] called [[H7121]] the priests, [[H3548]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Take up [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] and let seven [[H7651]] priests [[H3548]] bear [[H5375]] seven [[H7651]] trumpets [[H7782]] of rams' horns [[H3104]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Pass on, [[H5674]] and compass [[H5437]] the city, [[H5892]] and let him that is armed [[H2502]] pass on [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Joshua [[H3091]] had spoken [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] that the seven [[H7651]] priests [[H3548]] bearing [[H5375]] the seven [[H7651]] trumpets [[H7782]] of rams' horns [[H3104]] passed on [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and blew [[H8628]] with the trumpets: [[H7782]] and the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] followed [[H1980]] them. [[H310]]

### 9
And the armed men [[H2502]] went [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] the priests [[H3548]] that blew [[H8628]] with the trumpets, [[H7782]] and the rereward [[H622]] came [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the ark, [[H727]] going on, [[H1980]] and blowing [[H8628]] with the trumpets. [[H7782]]

### 10
And Joshua [[H3091]] had commanded [[H6680]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] shout, [[H7321]] nor [[H3808]] make any noise [[H8085]] with [[H853]] your voice, [[H6963]] neither [[H3808]] shall word [[H1697]] proceed out [[H3318]] of your mouth, [[H6310]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] I bid [[H559]] you shout; [[H7321]] then shall ye shout. [[H7321]]

### 11
So the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] compassed [[H5437]] the city, [[H5892]] going about [[H5362]] once: [[H6471]] and they came [[H935]] into the camp, [[H4264]] and lodged [[H3885]] in the camp. [[H4264]]

### 12
And Joshua [[H3091]] rose early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and the priests [[H3548]] took up [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And seven [[H7651]] priests [[H3548]] bearing [[H5375]] seven [[H7651]] trumpets [[H7782]] of rams' horns [[H3104]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] went on [[H1980]] continually, [[H1980]] and blew [[H8628]] with the trumpets: [[H7782]] and the armed men [[H2502]] went [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] them; but the rereward [[H622]] came [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] going on, [[H1980]] and blowing [[H8628]] with the trumpets. [[H7782]]

### 14
And the second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] they compassed [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] once, [[H6471]] and returned [[H7725]] into the camp: [[H4264]] so [[H3541]] they did [[H6213]] six [[H8337]] days. [[H3117]]

### 15
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] that they rose early [[H7925]] about the dawning [[H5927]] of the day, [[H7837]] and compassed [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] after the same [[H2088]] manner [[H4941]] seven [[H7651]] times: [[H6471]] only [[H7535]] on that day [[H3117]] they compassed [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] seven [[H7651]] times. [[H6471]]

### 16
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the seventh [[H7637]] time, [[H6471]] when the priests [[H3548]] blew [[H8628]] with the trumpets, [[H7782]] Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Shout; [[H7321]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 17
And the city [[H5892]] shall be [[H1961]] accursed, [[H2764]] it, [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein, to the Lord: [[H3068]] only [[H7535]] Rahab [[H7343]] the harlot [[H2181]] shall live, [[H2421]] she [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] her in the house, [[H1004]] because [[H3588]] she hid [[H2244]] the messengers [[H4397]] that [[H834]] we sent. [[H7971]]

### 18
And ye, [[H859]] in any wise [[H7535]] keep [[H8104]] from [[H4480]] the accursed thing, [[H2764]] lest [[H6435]] ye make accursed, [[H2763]] when ye take [[H3947]] of [[H4480]] the accursed thing, [[H2764]] and make [[H7760]] the camp [[H4264]] of Israel [[H3478]] a curse, [[H2764]] and trouble [[H5916]] it. [[H5916]]

### 19
But all [[H3605]] the silver, [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and vessels [[H3627]] of brass [[H5178]] and iron, [[H1270]] consecrated [[H6944]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] they shall come [[H935]] into the treasury [[H214]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
So the people [[H5971]] shouted [[H7321]] when blew [[H8628]] with the trumpets: [[H7782]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the people [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] and the people [[H5971]] shouted [[H7321]] with a great [[H1419]] shout, [[H8643]] that the wall [[H2346]] fell down flat, [[H5307]] so that the people [[H5971]] went up [[H5927]] into the city, [[H5892]] every man [[H376]] straight before [[H5048]] him, and they took [[H3920]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 21
And they utterly destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in the city, [[H5892]] both man [[H376]] and woman, [[H802]] young [[H5288]] and old, [[H2205]] and ox, [[H7794]] and sheep, [[H7716]] and ass, [[H2543]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 22
But Joshua [[H3091]] had said [[H559]] unto the two [[H8147]] men [[H582]] that had spied out [[H7270]] the country, [[H776]] Go into [[H935]] the harlot's [[H2181]] house, [[H1004]] and bring out [[H3318]] thence [[H8033]] the woman, [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] she hath, as [[H834]] ye sware [[H7650]] unto her. [[H7650]]

### 23
And the young men [[H5288]] that were spies [[H7270]] went in, [[H935]] and brought out [[H3318]] Rahab, [[H7343]] and her father, [[H1]] and her mother, [[H517]] and her brethren, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] she had; and they brought out [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] her kindred, [[H4940]] and left [[H3240]] them without [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
And they burnt [[H8313]] the city [[H5892]] with fire, [[H784]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein: only [[H7535]] the silver, [[H3701]] and the gold, [[H2091]] and the vessels [[H3627]] of brass [[H5178]] and of iron, [[H1270]] they put [[H5414]] into the treasury [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 25
And Joshua [[H3091]] saved [[H2421]] Rahab [[H7343]] the harlot [[H2181]] alive, and her father's [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] she had; and she dwelleth [[H3427]] in [[H7130]] Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] she hid [[H2244]] the messengers, [[H4397]] which [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] sent [[H7971]] to spy out [[H7270]] Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 26
And Joshua [[H3091]] adjured [[H7650]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saying, [[H559]] Cursed [[H779]] the man [[H376]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] riseth up [[H6965]] and buildeth [[H1129]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] Jericho: [[H3405]] he shall lay the foundation [[H3245]] thereof in his firstborn, [[H1060]] and in his youngest [[H6810]] shall he set up [[H5324]] the gates [[H1817]] of it. [[H1817]]

### 27
So the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Joshua; [[H3091]] and his fame [[H8089]] was [[H1961]] throughout all [[H3605]] the country. [[H776]]
