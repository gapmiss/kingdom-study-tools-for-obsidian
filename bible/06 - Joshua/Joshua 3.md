And Joshua [[H3091]] rose early [[H7925]] in the morning; [[H1242]] and they removed [[H5265]] from Shittim, [[H7851]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Jordan, [[H3383]] he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and lodged [[H3885]] there [[H8033]] before [[H2962]] they passed over. [[H5674]]

### 2
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H7097]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] that the officers [[H7860]] went [[H5674]] through [[H7130]] the host; [[H4264]]

### 3
And they commanded [[H6680]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] When ye see [[H7200]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and the priests [[H3548]] the Levites [[H3881]] bearing [[H5375]] it, then ye [[H859]] shall remove [[H5265]] from your place, [[H4725]] and go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] it. [[H310]]

### 4
Yet [[H389]] there shall be [[H1961]] a space [[H7350]] between [[H996]] you and it, about two thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] by measure: [[H4060]] come not near [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] it, that [[H4616]] ye may know [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] by which [[H834]] ye must go: [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] ye have not [[H3808]] passed [[H5674]] way [[H1870]] heretofore. [[H8543]]

### 5
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Sanctify yourselves: [[H6942]] for [[H3588]] to morrow [[H4279]] the Lord [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] wonders [[H6381]] among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 6
And Joshua [[H3091]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the priests, [[H3548]] saying, [[H559]] Take up [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] and pass over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the people. [[H5971]] And they took up [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] and went [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] will I begin [[H2490]] to magnify [[H1431]] thee in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H834]] they may know [[H3045]] that, [[H3588]] as [[H834]] I was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Moses, [[H4872]] I will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 8
And thou [[H859]] shalt command [[H6680]] the priests [[H3548]] that bear [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] saying, [[H559]] When ye are come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the brink [[H7097]] of the water [[H4325]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] ye shall stand still [[H5975]] in Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 9
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Come hither, [[H5066]] and hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 10
And Joshua [[H3091]] said, [[H559]] Hereby [[H2063]] ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the living [[H2416]] God [[H410]] among [[H7130]] you, and he will without fail [[H3423]] drive out [[H3423]] from before [[H6440]]  you [[H853]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Hivites, [[H2340]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] and the Girgashites, [[H1622]] and the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Jebusites. [[H2983]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2009]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] passeth over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] you into Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 12
Now [[H6258]] therefore take [[H3947]] you twelve [[H8147]] men [[H376]] out of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] out of every [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] a man. [[H376]]

### 13
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] as soon as the soles [[H3709]] of the feet [[H7272]] of the priests [[H3548]] that bear [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the Lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] shall rest [[H5117]] in the waters [[H4325]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] the waters [[H4325]] of Jordan [[H3383]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] the waters [[H4325]] that come down [[H3381]] from above; [[H4605]] and they shall stand [[H5975]] upon an [[H259]] heap. [[H5067]]

### 14
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the people [[H5971]] removed [[H5265]] from their tents, [[H168]] to pass over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and the priests [[H3548]] bearing [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] the people; [[H5971]]

### 15
And as they that bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] were come [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and the feet [[H7272]] of the priests [[H3548]] that bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] were dipped [[H2881]] in the brim [[H7097]] of the water, [[H4325]] (for Jordan [[H3383]] overfloweth [[H4390]] all [[H3605]] his banks [[H1415]] all [[H3605]] the time [[H3117]] of harvest,) [[H7105]]

### 16
That the waters [[H4325]] which came down [[H3381]] from above [[H4605]] stood [[H5975]] rose up [[H6965]] upon an [[H259]] heap [[H5067]] very [[H3966]] far [[H7368]] from the city [[H5892]] Adam, [[H121]] that [[H834]] beside [[H6654]] Zaretan: [[H6891]] and those that came down [[H3381]] toward [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] of the plain, [[H6160]] the salt [[H4417]] sea, [[H3220]] failed, [[H8552]] were cut off: [[H3772]] and the people [[H5971]] passed over [[H5674]] right against [[H5048]] Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 17
And the priests [[H3548]] that bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] stood [[H5975]] firm [[H3559]] on dry ground [[H2724]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] passed over [[H5674]] on dry ground, [[H2724]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H1471]] were passed [[H5674]] clean [[H8552]]  over [[H853]] Jordan.
