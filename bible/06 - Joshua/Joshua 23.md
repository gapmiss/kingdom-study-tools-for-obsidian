### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] a long [[H7227]] time [[H3117]] after [[H310]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had given rest [[H5117]] unto Israel [[H3478]] from all [[H3605]] their enemies [[H341]] round about, [[H5439]] that Joshua [[H3091]] waxed old [[H2204]] stricken [[H935]] in age. [[H3117]]

### 2
And Joshua [[H3091]] called [[H7121]] for all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] for their elders, [[H2205]] and for their heads, [[H7218]] and for their judges, [[H8199]] and for their officers, [[H7860]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I [[H589]] am old [[H2204]] stricken [[H935]] in age: [[H3117]]

### 3
And ye [[H859]] have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath done [[H6213]] unto all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] because [[H6440]] of you; for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] he [[H1931]] that hath fought [[H3898]] for you. [[H3898]]

### 4
Behold, [[H7200]] I have divided [[H5307]]  unto you by lot [[H853]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] that remain, [[H7604]] to be an inheritance [[H5159]] for your tribes, [[H7626]] from [[H4480]] Jordan, [[H3383]] with all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] I have cut off, [[H3772]] even unto the great [[H1419]] sea [[H3220]] westward. [[H3996]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] shall expel [[H1920]] them from before [[H6440]] you, and drive [[H3423]] them from out of your sight; [[H6440]] and ye shall possess [[H3423]] their land, [[H776]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath promised [[H1696]] unto you. [[H1696]]

### 6
Be ye therefore very [[H3966]] courageous [[H2388]] to keep [[H8104]] and to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] that ye turn [[H5493]] not [[H1115]] aside therefrom [[H4480]] the right hand [[H3225]] or the left; [[H8040]]

### 7
That ye come [[H935]] not [[H1115]] among these [[H428]] nations, [[H1471]] these [[H428]] that remain [[H7604]] among you; neither [[H3808]] make mention [[H2142]] of the name [[H8034]] of their gods, [[H430]] nor [[H3808]] cause to swear [[H7650]] neither [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] them, nor [[H3808]] bow yourselves [[H7812]] unto them: [[H7812]]

### 8
But [[H3588]] cleave [[H1692]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] ye have done [[H6213]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 9
For the Lord [[H3068]] hath driven out [[H3423]] from before [[H6440]] you great [[H1419]] nations [[H1471]] and strong: [[H6099]] but you, [[H859]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] hath been able to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] you unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 10
One [[H259]] man [[H376]] of [[H4480]] you shall chase [[H7291]] a thousand: [[H505]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] that fighteth [[H3898]] for you, as [[H834]] he hath promised [[H1696]] you. [[H1696]]

### 11
Take good [[H3966]] heed [[H8104]] therefore unto yourselves, [[H5315]] that ye love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 12
Else [[H3588]] if [[H518]] ye do in any wise [[H7725]] go back, [[H7725]] and cleave [[H1692]] unto the remnant [[H3499]] of these [[H428]] nations, [[H1471]] these [[H428]] that remain [[H7604]] among [[H854]] you, and shall make marriages [[H2859]] with them, and go in [[H935]] unto them, and they [[H1992]] to you: [[H1992]]

### 13
Know [[H3045]] for a certainty [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] drive out [[H3423]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] from before [[H6440]] you; but they shall be [[H1961]] snares [[H6341]] and traps [[H4170]] unto you, and scourges [[H7850]] in your sides, [[H6654]] and thorns [[H6796]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] until [[H5704]] ye perish [[H6]] from off [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] you. [[H5414]]

### 14
And, behold, [[H2009]] this day [[H3117]] I [[H595]] going [[H1980]] the way [[H1870]] of all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] and ye know [[H3045]] in all [[H3605]] your hearts [[H3824]] and in all [[H3605]] your souls, [[H5315]] that [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] thing [[H1697]] hath failed [[H5307]] of all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] things [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] spake [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] you; all [[H3605]] are come to pass [[H935]] unto you, not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] thing [[H1697]] hath failed [[H5307]] thereof. [[H4480]]

### 15
Therefore it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] as [[H834]] all [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] things [[H1697]] are come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] you, which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] promised [[H1696]] you; so [[H3651]] shall the Lord [[H3068]] bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]]  you [[H853]] all [[H3605]] evil [[H7451]] things, [[H1697]] until [[H5704]] he have destroyed [[H8045]] you from off [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] you. [[H5414]]

### 16
When ye have transgressed [[H5674]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] you, and have gone [[H1980]] and served [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and bowed yourselves [[H7812]] to them; then shall the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] be kindled [[H2734]] against you, and ye shall perish [[H6]] quickly [[H4120]] from off [[H5921]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] which [[H834]] he hath given [[H5414]] unto you.
