### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Jabin [[H2985]] king [[H4428]] of Hazor [[H2674]] had heard [[H8085]] that he sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Jobab [[H3103]] king [[H4428]] of Madon, [[H4068]] and to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Shimron, [[H8110]] and to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Achshaph, [[H407]]

### 2
And to [[H413]] the kings [[H4428]] that [[H834]] on the north [[H6828]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] and of the plains [[H6160]] south [[H5045]] of Chinneroth, [[H3672]] and in the valley, [[H8219]] and in the borders [[H5299]] of Dor [[H1756]] on the west, [[H3220]]

### 3
the Canaanite [[H3669]] on the east [[H4217]] and on the west, [[H3220]] and the Amorite, [[H567]] and the Hittite, [[H2850]] and the Perizzite, [[H6522]] and the Jebusite [[H2983]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] and the Hivite [[H2340]] under [[H8478]] Hermon [[H2768]] in the land [[H776]] of Mizpeh. [[H4709]]

### 4
And they went out, [[H3318]] they [[H1992]] and all [[H3605]] their hosts [[H4264]] with [[H5973]] them, much [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] even as the sand [[H2344]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] shore [[H8193]] in multitude, [[H7230]] with horses [[H5483]] and chariots [[H7393]] very [[H3966]] many. [[H7227]]

### 5
And when all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] kings [[H4428]] were met together, [[H3259]] they came [[H935]] and pitched [[H2583]] together [[H3162]] at [[H413]] the waters [[H4325]] of Merom, [[H4792]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Be not [[H408]] afraid [[H3372]] because [[H6440]] of them: for [[H3588]] to morrow [[H4279]] about this [[H2063]] time [[H6256]] will I [[H595]] deliver them up [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] slain [[H2491]] before [[H6440]] Israel: [[H3478]] thou shalt hough [[H6131]] their horses, [[H5483]] and burn [[H8313]] their chariots [[H4818]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 7
So Joshua [[H3091]] came, [[H935]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of war [[H4421]] with [[H5973]] him, against [[H5921]] them by [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Merom [[H4792]] suddenly; [[H6597]] and they fell upon [[H5307]] them. [[H5307]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who smote [[H5221]] them, and chased [[H7291]] them unto [[H5704]] great [[H7227]] Zidon, [[H6721]] and unto [[H5704]] Misrephoth-maim, [[H4956]] and unto [[H5704]] the valley [[H1237]] of Mizpeh [[H4708]] eastward; [[H4217]] and they smote [[H5221]] them, until [[H5704]] they left [[H7604]] them none [[H1115]] remaining. [[H8300]]

### 9
And Joshua [[H3091]] did [[H6213]] unto them as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] bade [[H559]] him: he houghed [[H6131]] their horses, [[H5483]] and burnt [[H8313]] their chariots [[H4818]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 10
And Joshua [[H3091]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] turned back, [[H7725]] and took [[H3920]] Hazor, [[H2674]] and smote [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] thereof with the sword: [[H2719]] for [[H3588]] Hazor [[H2674]] beforetime [[H6440]] was the head [[H7218]] of all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] kingdoms. [[H4467]]

### 11
And they smote [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] therein with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] utterly destroying [[H2763]] there was not [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] left [[H3498]] to breathe: [[H5397]] and he burnt [[H8313]] Hazor [[H2674]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 12
And all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of those [[H428]] kings, [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of them, did Joshua [[H3091]] take, [[H3920]] and smote [[H5221]] them with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] he utterly destroyed [[H2763]] them, as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] commanded. [[H6680]]

### 13
But [[H7535]] the cities [[H5892]] that stood still [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] their strength, [[H8510]] Israel [[H3478]] burned [[H8313]] none [[H3808]] of them, save [[H2108]] Hazor [[H2674]] only; [[H905]] did Joshua [[H3091]] burn. [[H8313]]

### 14
And all [[H3605]] the spoil [[H7998]] of these [[H428]] cities, [[H5892]] and the cattle, [[H929]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] took for a prey [[H962]] unto themselves; but [[H7535]] every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] they smote [[H5221]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] until [[H5704]] they had destroyed [[H8045]] them, neither [[H3808]] left [[H7604]] they any [[H3605]] to breathe. [[H5397]]

### 15
As [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] his servant, [[H5650]] so [[H3651]] did Moses [[H4872]] command [[H6680]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] Joshua; [[H3091]] he left [[H5493]] nothing [[H1697]] undone [[H3808]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 16
So Joshua [[H3091]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] that [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] the hills, [[H2022]] and all [[H3605]] the south country, [[H5045]] and all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] and the valley, [[H8219]] and the plain, [[H6160]] and the mountain [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the valley [[H8219]] of the same; [[H8219]]

### 17
from [[H4480]] the mount [[H2022]] Halak, [[H2510]] that goeth up [[H5927]] to Seir, [[H8165]] even unto [[H5704]] Baal-gad [[H1171]] in the valley [[H1237]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] under [[H8478]] mount [[H2022]] Hermon: [[H2768]] and all [[H3605]] their kings [[H4428]] he took, [[H3920]] and smote [[H5221]] them, and slew [[H4191]] them. [[H4191]]

### 18
Joshua [[H3091]] made [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] a long [[H7227]] time [[H3117]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] kings. [[H4428]]

### 19
There was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] a city [[H5892]] that [[H834]] made peace [[H7999]] with [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] save [[H1115]] the Hivites [[H2340]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Gibeon: [[H1391]] all [[H3605]] they took [[H3947]] in battle. [[H4421]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] it was [[H1961]] of [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] to harden [[H2388]] their hearts, [[H3820]] that they should come against [[H7125]] Israel [[H3478]] in battle, [[H4421]] that [[H4616]] he might destroy utterly, [[H2763]] them that they might have [[H1961]] no [[H1115]] favour, [[H8467]] but [[H3588]] that [[H4616]] he might destroy [[H8045]] them, as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 21
And at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] came [[H935]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and cut off [[H3772]] the Anakims [[H6062]] from [[H4480]] the mountains, [[H2022]] from [[H4480]] Hebron, [[H2275]] from [[H4480]] Debir, [[H1688]] from [[H4480]] Anab, [[H6024]] and from all [[H3605]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and from all [[H3605]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel: [[H3478]] Joshua [[H3091]] destroyed utterly [[H2763]] them with [[H5973]] their cities. [[H5892]]

### 22
There was none [[H3808]] of the Anakims [[H6062]] left [[H3498]] in the land [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] only [[H7535]] in Gaza, [[H5804]] in Gath, [[H1661]] and in Ashdod, [[H795]] there remained. [[H7604]]

### 23
So Joshua [[H3091]] took [[H3947]] the whole [[H3605]] land, [[H776]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses; [[H4872]] and Joshua [[H3091]] gave [[H5414]] it for an inheritance [[H5159]] unto Israel [[H3478]] according to their divisions [[H4256]] by their tribes. [[H7626]] And the land [[H776]] rested [[H8252]] from war. [[H4421]]
