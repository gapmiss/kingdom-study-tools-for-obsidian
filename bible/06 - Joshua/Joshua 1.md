Now after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] it came to pass, [[H1961]] that the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] Moses' [[H4872]] minister, [[H8334]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Moses [[H4872]] my servant [[H5650]] is dead; [[H4191]] now [[H6258]] therefore arise, [[H6965]] go over [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] Jordan, [[H3383]] thou, [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] do give [[H5414]] to them, to the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
Every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] that [[H834]] the sole [[H3709]] of your foot [[H7272]] shall tread upon, [[H1869]] that have I given [[H5414]] unto you, as [[H834]] I said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 4
From the wilderness [[H4057]] and this [[H2088]] Lebanon [[H3844]] even unto [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] river, [[H5104]] the river [[H5104]] Euphrates, [[H6578]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of the Hittites, [[H2850]] and unto [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] sea [[H3220]] toward the going down [[H3996]] of the sun, [[H8121]] shall be [[H1961]] your coast. [[H1366]]

### 5
There shall not [[H3808]] any man [[H376]] be able to stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] thee all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of thy life: [[H2416]] as [[H834]] I was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Moses, [[H4872]] I will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee: I will not [[H3808]] fail [[H7503]] thee, nor [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] thee. [[H5800]]

### 6
Be strong [[H2388]] and of a good courage: [[H553]] for [[H3588]]  unto [[H853]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] shalt thou [[H859]] divide for an inheritance [[H5157]] the land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto their fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] them. [[H5414]]

### 7
Only [[H7535]] be thou strong [[H2388]] and very [[H3966]] courageous, [[H553]] that thou mayest observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] the law, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] my servant [[H5650]] commanded [[H6680]] thee: turn [[H5493]] not [[H408]] from [[H4480]] it the right hand [[H3225]] or the left, [[H8040]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest prosper [[H7919]] whithersoever [[H3605]] thou goest. [[H1980]]

### 8
This [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] shall not [[H3808]] depart [[H4185]] out of thy mouth; [[H6310]] but thou shalt meditate [[H1897]] therein day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] therein: for [[H3588]] then [[H227]]  thou shalt make [[H853]] thy way [[H1870]] prosperous, [[H6743]] and then [[H227]] thou shalt have good success. [[H7919]]

### 9
Have not [[H3808]] I commanded [[H6680]] thee? Be strong [[H2388]] and of a good courage; [[H553]] be not afraid, [[H6206]] neither [[H408]] be thou dismayed: [[H2865]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] thee whithersoever [[H3605]] thou goest. [[H1980]]

### 10
Then Joshua [[H3091]] commanded [[H6680]] the officers [[H7860]] of the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]]

### 11
Pass [[H5674]] through [[H7130]] the host, [[H4264]] and command [[H6680]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Prepare [[H3559]] you victuals; [[H6720]] for [[H3588]] within [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] ye [[H859]] shall pass over [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] Jordan, [[H3383]] to go in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] you to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 12
And to the Reubenites, [[H7206]] and to the Gadites, [[H1425]] and to half [[H2677]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] spake [[H559]] Joshua, [[H3091]] saying, [[H559]]

### 13
Remember [[H2142]] the word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] you, saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath given you rest, [[H5117]] and hath given [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]]

### 14
Your wives, [[H802]] your little ones, [[H2945]] and your cattle, [[H4735]] shall remain [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H5414]] you on this side [[H5676]] Jordan; [[H3383]] but ye [[H859]] shall pass [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] your brethren [[H251]] armed, [[H2571]] all [[H3605]] the mighty men [[H1368]] of valour, [[H2428]] and help [[H5826]] them; [[H5826]]

### 15
Until [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] have given your brethren [[H251]] rest, [[H5117]] as you, and they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] have possessed [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] them: then ye shall return [[H7725]] unto the land [[H776]] of your possession, [[H3425]] and enjoy [[H3423]] it, which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the Lord's [[H3068]] servant [[H5650]] gave [[H5414]] you on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] toward the sunrising. [[H4217]]

### 16
And they answered [[H6030]] Joshua, [[H3091]] saying, [[H559]] All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou commandest [[H6680]] us we will do, [[H6213]] and whithersoever [[H413]] thou sendest [[H7971]] us, we will go. [[H1980]]

### 17
According as we hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in all [[H3605]] things, [[H834]] so [[H3651]] will we hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] thee: only [[H7535]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee, as [[H834]] he was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 18
Whosoever [[H376]] that doth rebel against [[H4784]] thy commandment, [[H6310]] and will not [[H3808]] hearken unto [[H8085]] thy words [[H1697]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou commandest [[H6680]] him, he shall be put to death: [[H4191]] only [[H7535]] be strong [[H2388]] and of a good courage.
