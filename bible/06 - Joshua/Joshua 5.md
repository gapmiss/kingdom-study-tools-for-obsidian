### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which [[H834]] on the side [[H5676]] of Jordan [[H3383]] westward, [[H3220]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had dried up [[H3001]] the waters [[H4325]] of Jordan [[H3383]] from before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] until [[H5704]] we were passed over, [[H5674]] that their heart [[H3824]] melted, [[H4549]] neither [[H3808]] was [[H1961]] there spirit [[H7307]] in them any more, [[H5750]] because [[H6440]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Make [[H6213]] thee sharp [[H6697]] knives, [[H2719]] and circumcise [[H4135]] again [[H7725]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] the second time. [[H8145]]

### 3
And Joshua [[H3091]] made [[H6213]] him sharp [[H6697]] knives, [[H2719]] and circumcised [[H4135]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] at [[H413]] the hill [[H1389]] of the foreskins. [[H6190]]

### 4
And this [[H2088]] the cause [[H1697]] why [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] did circumcise: [[H4135]] All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that came out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] males, [[H2145]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of war, [[H4421]] died [[H4191]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] by the way, [[H1870]] after they came out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 5
Now [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that came out [[H3318]] were [[H1961]] circumcised: [[H4135]] but all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] born [[H3209]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] by the way [[H1870]] as they came forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] they had not [[H3808]] circumcised. [[H4135]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] walked [[H1980]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] till [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H1471]] men [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] which came out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] were consumed, [[H8552]] because [[H834]] they obeyed [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] unto whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] that he would not [[H1115]] shew [[H7200]]  them [[H853]] the land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto their fathers [[H1]] that he would give [[H5414]] us, a land [[H776]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

### 7
And their children, [[H1121]] he raised up [[H6965]] in their stead, [[H8478]] them Joshua [[H3091]] circumcised: [[H4135]] for [[H3588]] they were [[H1961]] uncircumcised, [[H6189]] because [[H3588]] they had not [[H3808]] circumcised [[H4135]] them by the way. [[H1870]]

### 8
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] they had done [[H8552]] circumcising [[H4135]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H1471]] that they abode [[H3427]] in their places [[H8478]] in the camp, [[H4264]] till [[H5704]] they were whole. [[H2421]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] This day [[H3117]] have I rolled away [[H1556]] the reproach [[H2781]] of Egypt [[H4714]] from off [[H5921]] you. Wherefore the name [[H8034]] of the place [[H4725]] is called [[H7121]] Gilgal [[H1537]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 10
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] encamped [[H2583]] in Gilgal, [[H1537]] and kept [[H6213]] the passover [[H6453]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] at even [[H6153]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 11
And they did eat [[H398]] of the old corn [[H5669]] of the land [[H776]] on the morrow [[H4283]] after the passover, [[H6453]] unleavened cakes, [[H4682]] and parched [[H7033]] in the selfsame [[H6106]] day. [[H3117]]

### 12
And the manna [[H4478]] ceased [[H7673]] on the morrow [[H4283]] after they had eaten [[H398]] of the old corn [[H5669]] of the land; [[H776]] neither [[H3808]] had [[H1961]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] manna [[H4478]] any more; [[H5750]] but they did eat [[H398]] of the fruit [[H8393]] of the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] that [[H1931]] year. [[H8141]]

### 13
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Joshua [[H3091]] was [[H1961]] by Jericho, [[H3405]] that he lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there stood [[H5975]] a man [[H376]] over against [[H5048]] him with his sword [[H2719]] drawn [[H8025]] in his hand: [[H3027]] and Joshua [[H3091]] went [[H1980]] unto him, [[H413]] and said [[H559]] unto him, thou [[H859]] for us, or [[H518]] for our adversaries? [[H6862]]

### 14
And he said, [[H559]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] of the Lord [[H3068]] am I [[H589]] now [[H6258]] come. [[H935]] And Joshua [[H3091]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H413]] his face [[H6440]] to the earth, [[H776]] and did worship, [[H7812]] and said [[H559]] unto him, What [[H4100]] saith [[H1696]] my lord [[H113]] unto [[H413]] his servant? [[H5650]]

### 15
And the captain [[H8269]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] host [[H6635]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Loose [[H5394]] thy shoe [[H5275]] from off [[H5921]] thy foot; [[H7272]] for [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] whereon [[H834]] thou [[H859]] standest [[H5975]] holy. [[H6944]] And Joshua [[H3091]] did [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]]
