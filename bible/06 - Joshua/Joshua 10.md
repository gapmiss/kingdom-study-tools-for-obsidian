### 1
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Adoni-zedek [[H139]] king [[H4428]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] had heard [[H8085]] how [[H3588]] Joshua [[H3091]] had taken [[H3920]] Ai, [[H5857]] and had utterly destroyed [[H2763]] it; as [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] to Jericho [[H3405]] and her king, [[H4428]] so [[H3651]] he had done [[H6213]] to Ai [[H5857]] and her king; [[H4428]] and how [[H3588]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Gibeon [[H1391]] had made peace [[H7999]] with [[H854]] Israel, [[H3478]] and were [[H1961]] among [[H7130]] them; [[H7130]]

### 2
That they feared [[H3372]] greatly, [[H3966]] because [[H3588]] Gibeon [[H1391]] a great [[H1419]] city, [[H5892]] as one [[H259]] of the royal [[H4467]] cities, [[H5892]] and because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] greater [[H1419]] than [[H4480]] Ai, [[H5857]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] thereof mighty. [[H1368]]

### 3
Wherefore Adoni-zedek [[H139]] king [[H4428]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] Hoham [[H1944]] king [[H4428]] of Hebron, [[H2275]] and unto [[H413]] Piram [[H6502]] king [[H4428]] of Jarmuth, [[H3412]] and unto [[H413]] Japhia [[H3309]] king [[H4428]] of Lachish, [[H3923]] and unto [[H413]] Debir [[H1688]] king [[H4428]] of Eglon, [[H5700]] saying, [[H559]]

### 4
Come up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] me, and help [[H5826]] me, that we may smite [[H5221]] Gibeon: [[H1391]] for [[H3588]] it hath made peace [[H7999]] with [[H854]] Joshua [[H3091]] and with [[H854]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Therefore the five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] the king [[H4428]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the king [[H4428]] of Hebron, [[H2275]] the king [[H4428]] of Jarmuth, [[H3412]] the king [[H4428]] of Lachish, [[H3923]] the king [[H4428]] of Eglon, [[H5700]] gathered themselves together, [[H622]] and went up, [[H5927]] they [[H1992]] and all [[H3605]] their hosts, [[H4264]] and encamped [[H2583]] before [[H5921]] Gibeon, [[H1391]] and made war [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 6
And the men [[H376]] of Gibeon [[H1391]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] to Gilgal, [[H1537]] saying, [[H559]] Slack [[H7503]] not [[H408]] thy hand [[H3027]] from thy servants; [[H5650]] come up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] us quickly, [[H4120]] and save [[H3467]] us, and help [[H5826]] us: for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] that dwell [[H3427]] in the mountains [[H2022]] are gathered together [[H6908]] against [[H413]] us. [[H413]]

### 7
So Joshua [[H3091]] ascended [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal, [[H1537]] he, [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of war [[H4421]] with [[H5973]] him, and all [[H3605]] the mighty men [[H1368]] of valour. [[H2428]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Fear [[H3372]] them not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I have delivered [[H5414]] them into thine hand; [[H3027]] there shall not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] of them stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 9
Joshua [[H3091]] therefore came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] them suddenly, [[H6597]] went up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal [[H1537]] all [[H3605]] night. [[H3915]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] discomfited [[H2000]] them before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] and slew [[H5221]] them with a great [[H1419]] slaughter [[H4347]] at Gibeon, [[H1391]] and chased [[H7291]] them along the way [[H1870]] that goeth up [[H4608]] to Beth-horon, [[H1032]] and smote [[H5221]] them to [[H5704]] Azekah, [[H5825]] and unto [[H5704]] Makkedah. [[H4719]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as they fled [[H5127]] from before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] were in the going down [[H4174]] to Beth-horon, [[H1032]] that the Lord [[H3068]] cast down [[H7993]] great [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] upon [[H5921]] them unto [[H5704]] Azekah, [[H5825]] and they died: [[H4191]] more [[H7227]] which [[H834]] died [[H4191]] with hailstones [[H1259]] than whom [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] slew [[H2026]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 12
Then [[H227]] spake [[H1696]] Joshua [[H3091]] to the Lord [[H3068]] in the day [[H3117]] when the Lord [[H3068]] delivered up [[H5414]] the Amorites [[H567]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and he said [[H559]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Sun, [[H8121]] stand thou still [[H1826]] upon Gibeon; [[H1391]] and thou, Moon, [[H3394]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Ajalon. [[H357]]

### 13
And the sun [[H8121]] stood still, [[H1826]] and the moon [[H3394]] stayed, [[H5975]] until [[H5704]] the people [[H1471]] had avenged [[H5358]] themselves upon their enemies. [[H341]] not [[H3808]] this [[H1931]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of Jasher? [[H3477]] So the sun [[H8121]] stood still [[H5975]] in the midst [[H2677]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and hasted [[H213]] not [[H3808]] to go down [[H935]] about a whole [[H8549]] day. [[H3117]]

### 14
And there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] day [[H3117]] like that [[H1931]] before [[H6440]] it or after [[H310]] it, that the Lord [[H3068]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of a man: [[H376]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] fought [[H3898]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
And Joshua [[H3091]] returned, [[H7725]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, unto [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] to Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 16
But these [[H428]] five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] fled, [[H5127]] and hid themselves [[H2244]] in a cave [[H4631]] at Makkedah. [[H4719]]

### 17
And it was told [[H5046]] Joshua, [[H3091]] saying, [[H559]] The five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] are found [[H4672]] hid [[H2244]] in a cave [[H4631]] at Makkedah. [[H4719]]

### 18
And Joshua [[H3091]] said, [[H559]] Roll [[H1556]] great [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] upon [[H413]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the cave, [[H4631]] and set [[H6485]] men [[H582]] by [[H5921]] it for to keep [[H8104]] them: [[H8104]]

### 19
And stay [[H5975]] ye [[H859]] not, [[H408]] pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] your enemies, [[H341]] and smite the hindmost [[H2179]] of them; suffer [[H5414]] them not [[H408]] to enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] their cities: [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath delivered [[H5414]] them into your hand. [[H3027]]

### 20
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Joshua [[H3091]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] had made an end [[H3615]] of slaying [[H5221]] them with a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] slaughter, [[H4347]] till [[H5704]] they were consumed, [[H8552]] that the rest [[H8300]] remained [[H8277]] of them entered [[H935]] into [[H413]] fenced [[H4013]] cities. [[H5892]]

### 21
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] at Makkedah [[H4719]] in peace: [[H7965]] none [[H3808]] moved [[H2782]] his tongue [[H3956]] against any [[H376]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 22
Then said [[H559]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Open [[H6605]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the cave, [[H4631]] and bring out [[H3318]] those [[H428]] five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] unto [[H413]] me out of [[H4480]] the cave. [[H4631]]

### 23
And they did [[H6213]] so, [[H3651]] and brought forth [[H3318]] those [[H428]] five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] unto [[H413]] him out of [[H4480]] the cave, [[H4631]] the king [[H4428]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the king [[H4428]] of Hebron, [[H2275]] the king [[H4428]] of Jarmuth, [[H3412]] the king [[H4428]] of Lachish, [[H3923]] the king [[H4428]] of Eglon. [[H5700]]

### 24
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they brought out [[H3318]] those [[H428]] kings [[H4428]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] that Joshua [[H3091]] called [[H7121]] for [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the captains [[H7101]] of the men [[H582]] of war [[H4421]] which went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] him, Come near, [[H7126]] put [[H7760]] your feet [[H7272]] upon [[H5921]] the necks [[H6677]] of these [[H428]] kings. [[H4428]] And they came near, [[H7126]] and put [[H7760]] their feet [[H7272]] upon [[H5921]] the necks [[H6677]] of them. [[H6677]]

### 25
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] nor [[H408]] be dismayed, [[H2865]] be strong [[H2388]] and of good courage: [[H553]] for [[H3588]] thus [[H3602]] shall the Lord [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] to all [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] against whom [[H834]] ye [[H859]] fight. [[H3898]]

### 26
And afterward [[H310]] Joshua [[H3091]] smote [[H5221]] them, and slew [[H4191]] them, and hanged [[H8518]] them on [[H5921]] five [[H2568]] trees: [[H6086]] and they were [[H1961]] hanging [[H8518]] upon [[H5921]] the trees [[H6086]] until [[H5704]] the evening. [[H6153]]

### 27
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the time [[H6256]] of the going down [[H935]] of the sun, [[H8121]] Joshua [[H3091]] commanded, [[H6680]] and they took them down [[H3381]] off the trees, [[H6086]] and cast [[H7993]] them into [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] wherein [[H834]] they had been hid, [[H2244]] and laid [[H7760]] great [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] in [[H5921]] the cave's [[H4631]] mouth, [[H6310]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day. [[H3117]]

### 28
And that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Joshua [[H3091]] took [[H3920]] Makkedah, [[H4719]] and smote [[H5221]] it with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and the king [[H4428]] thereof he utterly destroyed, [[H2763]] them, and all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] therein; he let [[H7604]] none [[H3808]] remain: [[H8300]] and he did [[H6213]] to the king [[H4428]] of Makkedah [[H4719]] as [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] unto the king [[H4428]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 29
Then Joshua [[H3091]] passed [[H5674]] from Makkedah, [[H4719]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, unto Libnah, [[H3841]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Libnah: [[H3841]]

### 30
And the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] it also, [[H1571]] and the king [[H4428]] thereof, into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and he smote [[H5221]] it with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] therein; he let [[H7604]] none [[H3808]] remain [[H8300]] in it; but did [[H6213]] unto the king [[H4428]] thereof as [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] unto the king [[H4428]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 31
And Joshua [[H3091]] passed [[H5674]] from Libnah, [[H3841]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, unto Lachish, [[H3923]] and encamped [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] it, and fought [[H3898]] against it: [[H3898]]

### 32
And the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] Lachish [[H3923]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which took [[H3920]] it on the second [[H8145]] day, [[H3117]] and smote [[H5221]] it with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] therein, according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] to Libnah. [[H3841]]

### 33
Then [[H227]] Horam [[H2036]] king [[H4428]] of Gezer [[H1507]] came up [[H5927]] to help [[H5826]] Lachish; [[H3923]] and Joshua [[H3091]] smote [[H5221]] him and his people, [[H5971]] until [[H5704]] he had left [[H7604]] him none [[H1115]] remaining. [[H8300]]

### 34
And from Lachish [[H3923]] Joshua [[H3091]] passed [[H5674]] unto Eglon, [[H5700]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him; and they encamped [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] it, and fought [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] it: [[H5921]]

### 35
And they took [[H3920]] it on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and smote [[H5221]] it with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] therein he utterly destroyed [[H2763]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] to Lachish. [[H3923]]

### 36
And Joshua [[H3091]] went up [[H5927]] from Eglon, [[H5700]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, unto Hebron; [[H2275]] and they fought [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] it: [[H5921]]

### 37
And they took [[H3920]] it, and smote [[H5221]] it with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and the king [[H4428]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] therein; he left [[H7604]] none [[H3808]] remaining, [[H8300]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] to Eglon; [[H5700]] but destroyed [[H2763]] it utterly, and all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] therein. [[H834]]

### 38
And Joshua [[H3091]] returned, [[H7725]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, to Debir; [[H1688]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] it: [[H5921]]

### 39
And he took [[H3920]] it, and the king [[H4428]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] thereof; and they smote [[H5221]] them with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and utterly destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] the souls [[H5315]] that [[H834]] therein; he left [[H7604]] none [[H3808]] remaining: [[H8300]] as [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] to Hebron, [[H2275]] so [[H3651]] he did [[H6213]] to Debir, [[H1688]] and to the king [[H4428]] thereof; as [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] also to Libnah, [[H3841]] and to her king. [[H4428]]

### 40
So Joshua [[H3091]] smote [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the country [[H776]] of the hills, [[H2022]] and of the south, [[H5045]] and of the vale, [[H8219]] and of the springs, [[H794]] and all [[H3605]] their kings: [[H4428]] he left [[H7604]] none [[H3808]] remaining, [[H8300]] but utterly destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] that breathed, [[H5397]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] commanded. [[H6680]]

### 41
And Joshua [[H3091]] smote [[H5221]] them from Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] even unto [[H5704]] Gaza, [[H5804]] and all [[H3605]] the country [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] even unto [[H5704]] Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 42
And all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] kings [[H4428]] and their land [[H776]] did Joshua [[H3091]] take [[H3920]] at one [[H259]] time, [[H6471]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] fought [[H3898]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 43
And Joshua [[H3091]] returned, [[H7725]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, unto [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] to Gilgal. [[H1537]]
