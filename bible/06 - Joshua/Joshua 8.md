### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] neither [[H408]] be thou dismayed: [[H2865]] take [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of war [[H4421]] with [[H5973]] thee, and arise, [[H6965]] go up [[H5927]] to Ai: [[H5857]] see, [[H7200]] I have given [[H5414]] into thy hand [[H3027]] the king [[H4428]] of Ai, [[H5857]] and his people, [[H5971]] and his city, [[H5892]] and his land: [[H776]]

### 2
And thou shalt do [[H6213]] to Ai [[H5857]] and her king [[H4428]] as [[H834]] thou didst [[H6213]] unto Jericho [[H3405]] and her king: [[H4428]] only [[H7535]] the spoil [[H7998]] thereof, and the cattle [[H929]] thereof, shall ye take for a prey [[H962]] unto yourselves: lay [[H7760]] thee an ambush [[H693]] for the city [[H5892]] behind [[H310]] it. [[H310]]

### 3
So Joshua [[H3091]] arose, [[H6965]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of war, [[H4421]] to go up [[H5927]] against Ai: [[H5857]] and Joshua [[H3091]] chose out [[H977]] thirty [[H7970]] thousand [[H505]] mighty [[H1368]] men [[H376]] of valour, [[H2428]] and sent them away [[H7971]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 4
And he commanded [[H6680]] them, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H7200]] ye [[H859]] shall lie in wait [[H693]] against the city, [[H5892]] behind [[H310]] the city: [[H5892]] go [[H7368]] not [[H408]] very [[H3966]] far from [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] but be [[H1961]] ye all [[H3605]] ready: [[H3559]]

### 5
And I, [[H589]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] me, will approach [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] the city: [[H5892]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] they come out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] us, as [[H834]] at the first, [[H7223]] that we will flee [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] them, [[H6440]]

### 6
(For they will come out [[H3318]] after [[H310]] us) till [[H5704]] we have drawn [[H5423]] them from [[H4480]] the city; [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] they will say, [[H559]] They flee [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] us, as [[H834]] at the first: [[H7223]] therefore we will flee [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 7
Then ye [[H859]] shall rise up [[H6965]] from the ambush, [[H693]] and seize upon [[H3423]] the city: [[H5892]] for the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will deliver [[H5414]] it into your hand. [[H3027]]

### 8
And it shall be, [[H1961]] when ye have taken [[H8610]] the city, [[H5892]] ye shall set [[H3341]] the city [[H5892]] on fire: [[H784]] according to the commandment [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall ye do. [[H6213]] See, [[H7200]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you. [[H6680]]

### 9
Joshua [[H3091]] therefore sent them forth: [[H7971]] and they went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] lie in ambush, [[H3993]] and abode [[H3427]] between [[H996]] Beth-el [[H1008]] and Ai, [[H5857]] on the west side [[H3220]] of Ai: [[H5857]] but Joshua [[H3091]] lodged [[H3885]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] among [[H8432]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 10
And Joshua [[H3091]] rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and numbered [[H6485]] the people, [[H5971]] and went up, [[H5927]] he [[H1931]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] before [[H6440]] the people [[H5971]] to Ai. [[H5857]]

### 11
And all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] of war [[H4421]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, went up, [[H5927]] and drew nigh, [[H5066]] and came [[H935]] before [[H5048]] the city, [[H5892]] and pitched [[H2583]] on the north side [[H6828]] of Ai: [[H5857]] now a valley [[H1516]] between [[H996]] them and Ai. [[H5857]]

### 12
And he took [[H3947]] about five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] men, [[H376]] and set [[H7760]] them to lie in ambush [[H693]] between [[H996]] Beth-el [[H1008]] and Ai, city. [[H5857]] on the west side [[H3220]]  of the [[H5892]]

### 13
And when they had set [[H7760]] the people, [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H4264]] that [[H834]] on the north [[H6828]] of the city, [[H5892]] and their liers in wait [[H6119]] on the west [[H3220]] of the city, [[H5892]] Joshua [[H3091]] went [[H1980]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] into the midst [[H8432]] of the valley. [[H6010]]

### 14
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the king [[H4428]] of Ai [[H5857]] saw [[H7200]] that they hasted [[H4116]] and rose up early, [[H7925]] and the men [[H582]] of the city [[H5892]] went out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] Israel [[H3478]] to battle, [[H4421]] he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] at a time appointed, [[H4150]] before [[H6440]] the plain; [[H6160]] but he [[H1931]] wist [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] liers in ambush [[H693]] against him behind [[H310]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 15
And Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] made as if they were beaten [[H5060]] before [[H6440]] them, and fled [[H5127]] by the way [[H1870]] of the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 16
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] in Ai [[H5892]] were called together [[H2199]] to pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] them: and they pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and were drawn away [[H5423]] from [[H4480]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 17
And there was not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] left [[H7604]] in Ai [[H5857]] or Beth-el, [[H1008]] that [[H834]] went not out [[H3318]] after [[H310]] Israel: [[H3478]] and they left [[H5800]] the city [[H5892]] open, [[H6605]] and pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 18
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Stretch out [[H5186]] the spear [[H3591]] that [[H834]] in thy hand [[H3027]] toward [[H413]] Ai; [[H5857]] for [[H3588]] I will give [[H5414]] it into thine hand. [[H3027]] And Joshua [[H3091]] stretched out [[H5186]] the spear [[H3591]] that [[H834]] in his hand [[H3027]] toward [[H413]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 19
And the ambush [[H693]] arose [[H6965]] quickly [[H4120]] out of their place, [[H4725]] and they ran [[H7323]] as soon as he had stretched out [[H5186]] his hand: [[H3027]] and they entered [[H935]] into the city, [[H5892]] and took [[H3920]] it, and hasted [[H4116]] and set [[H3341]] the city [[H5892]] on fire. [[H784]]

### 20
And when the men [[H376]] of Ai [[H5857]] looked [[H6437]] behind [[H310]] them, they saw, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the smoke [[H6227]] of the city [[H5892]] ascended up [[H5927]] to heaven, [[H8064]] and they had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] power [[H3027]] to flee [[H5127]] this way [[H2008]] or that way: [[H2008]] and the people [[H5971]] that fled [[H5127]] to the wilderness [[H4057]] turned back [[H2015]] upon [[H413]] the pursuers. [[H7291]]

### 21
And when Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the ambush [[H693]] had taken [[H3920]] the city, [[H5892]] and that [[H3588]] the smoke [[H6227]] of the city [[H5892]] ascended, [[H5927]] then they turned again, [[H7725]] and slew [[H5221]] the men [[H582]] of Ai. [[H5857]]

### 22
And the other [[H428]] issued out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] against [[H7125]] them; so they were [[H1961]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Israel, [[H3478]] some [[H428]] on this side, [[H2088]] and some [[H428]] on that side: [[H2088]] and they smote [[H5221]] them, so that [[H5704]] they let [[H7604]] none [[H1115]] of them remain [[H8300]] or escape. [[H6412]]

### 23
And the king [[H4428]] of Ai [[H5857]] they took [[H8610]] alive, [[H2416]] and brought [[H7126]] him to [[H413]] Joshua. [[H3091]]

### 24
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Israel [[H3478]] had made an end [[H3615]] of slaying [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Ai [[H5857]] in the field, [[H7704]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] wherein [[H834]] they chased [[H7291]] them, and when they were all [[H3605]] fallen [[H5307]] on the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] until [[H5704]] they were consumed, [[H8552]] that all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] returned [[H7725]] unto Ai, [[H5857]] and smote [[H5221]] it with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 25
And it was, [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] that fell [[H5307]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] both of men [[H376]] and women, [[H802]] twelve [[H8147]] thousand, [[H505]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Ai. [[H5857]]

### 26
For Joshua [[H3091]] drew [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] his hand [[H3027]] back, wherewith [[H834]] he stretched out [[H5186]] the spear, [[H3591]] until [[H5704]] he had utterly destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Ai. [[H5857]]

### 27
Only [[H7535]] the cattle [[H929]] and the spoil [[H7998]] of that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] Israel [[H3478]] took for a prey [[H962]] unto themselves, according unto the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] Joshua. [[H3091]]

### 28
And Joshua [[H3091]] burnt [[H8313]] Ai, [[H5857]] and made [[H7760]] it an heap [[H8510]] for ever, [[H5769]] a desolation [[H8077]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 29
And the king [[H4428]] of Ai [[H5857]] he hanged [[H8518]] on [[H5921]] a tree [[H6086]] until [[H5704]] eventide: [[H6256]] and as soon as the sun [[H8121]] was down, [[H935]] Joshua [[H3091]] commanded [[H6680]] that they should take [[H3381]] his carcase [[H5038]]  down [[H853]] from [[H4480]] the tree, [[H6086]] and cast [[H7993]] it at [[H413]] the entering [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the city, [[H5892]] and raise [[H6965]] thereon [[H5921]] a great [[H1419]] heap [[H1530]] of stones, [[H68]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 30
Then [[H227]] Joshua [[H3091]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] in mount [[H2022]] Ebal, [[H5858]]

### 31
As [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as it is written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] an altar [[H4196]] of whole [[H8003]] stones, [[H68]] over [[H5921]] which [[H834]] no [[H3808]] man hath lift up [[H5130]] iron: [[H1270]] and they offered [[H5927]] thereon [[H5921]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] peace offerings. [[H8002]]

### 32
And he wrote [[H3789]] there [[H8033]] upon [[H5921]] the stones [[H68]] a copy [[H4932]] of the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] which [[H834]] he wrote [[H3789]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 33
And all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and their elders, [[H2205]] and officers, [[H7860]] and their judges, [[H8199]] stood [[H5975]] on this side [[H2088]] the ark [[H727]] and on that side [[H2088]] before [[H5048]] the priests [[H3548]] the Levites, [[H3881]] which bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] as well the stranger, [[H1616]] as he that was born [[H249]] among them; half [[H2677]] of them over [[H413]] against [[H4136]] mount [[H2022]] Gerizim, [[H1630]] and half [[H2677]] of them over [[H413]] against [[H4136]] mount [[H2022]] Ebal; [[H5858]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] before, [[H7223]] that they should bless [[H1288]] the people [[H5971]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 34
And afterward [[H310]] he read [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the law, [[H8451]] the blessings [[H1293]] and cursings, [[H7045]] according to all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of the law. [[H8451]]

### 35
There was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] a word [[H1697]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded, [[H6680]] which [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] read [[H7121]] not [[H3808]] before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] with the women, [[H802]] and the little ones, [[H2945]] and the strangers [[H1616]] that were conversant [[H1980]] among [[H7130]] them. [[H7130]]
