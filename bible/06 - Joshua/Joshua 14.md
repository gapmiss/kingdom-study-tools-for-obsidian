### 1
And these [[H428]] which [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] inherited [[H5157]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] which [[H834]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and the heads [[H7218]] of the fathers [[H1]] of the tribes [[H4294]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] distributed for inheritance [[H5157]] to them. [[H5157]]

### 2
By lot [[H1486]] their inheritance, [[H5159]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses, [[H4872]] for the nine [[H8672]] tribes, [[H4294]] and the half [[H2677]] tribe. [[H4294]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] Moses [[H4872]] had given [[H5414]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of two [[H8147]] tribes [[H4294]] and an half [[H2677]] tribe [[H4294]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan: [[H3383]] but unto the Levites [[H3881]] he gave [[H5414]] none [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] were [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] tribes, [[H4294]] Manasseh [[H4519]] and Ephraim: [[H669]] therefore they gave [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] part [[H2506]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] in the land, [[H776]] save [[H3588]] cities [[H5892]] to dwell [[H3427]] with their suburbs [[H4054]] for their cattle [[H4735]] and for their substance. [[H7075]]

### 5
As [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses, [[H4872]] so [[H3651]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did, [[H6213]] and they divided [[H2505]] the land. [[H776]]

### 6
Then the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] came [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] in Gilgal: [[H1537]] and Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] the Kenezite [[H7074]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] concerning [[H5921]] me [[H182]] and thee [[H182]] in Kadesh-barnea. [[H6947]]

### 7
Forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] I [[H595]] when Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] me from Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] to espy out [[H7270]] the land; [[H776]] and I brought [[H7725]] him word [[H1697]] again as [[H834]] in [[H5973]] mine heart. [[H3824]]

### 8
Nevertheless my brethren [[H251]] that [[H834]] went up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]]  me made [[H853]] the heart [[H3820]] of the people [[H5971]] melt: [[H4529]] but I [[H595]] wholly [[H4390]] followed [[H310]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God. [[H430]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] sware [[H7650]] on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saying, [[H559]] Surely [[H518]] the land [[H776]] whereon [[H834]] thy feet [[H7272]] have trodden [[H1869]] shall be [[H1961]] thine inheritance, [[H5159]] and thy children's [[H1121]] for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] because [[H3588]] thou hast wholly [[H4390]] followed [[H310]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God. [[H430]]

### 10
And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath kept me alive, [[H2421]] as [[H834]] he said, [[H1696]] these [[H2088]] forty [[H705]] and five [[H2568]] years, [[H8141]] even since [[H227]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] while [[H834]] Israel [[H3478]] wandered [[H1980]] in the wilderness: [[H4057]] and now, [[H6258]] lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] this day [[H3117]] fourscore [[H8084]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old. [[H1121]]

### 11
As yet [[H5750]] I strong [[H2389]] this day [[H3117]] as [[H834]] in the day [[H3117]] that Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] me: as my strength [[H3581]] then, [[H227]] even so my strength [[H3581]] now, [[H6258]] for war, [[H4421]] both to go out, [[H3318]] and to come in. [[H935]]

### 12
Now [[H6258]] therefore give [[H5414]]  me [[H853]] this [[H2088]] mountain, [[H2022]] whereof [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] in that [[H1931]] day; [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] heardest [[H8085]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] how [[H3588]] the Anakims [[H6062]] there, [[H8033]] and the cities [[H5892]] great [[H1419]] fenced: [[H1219]] if [[H194]] so be the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H854]] me, then I shall be able to drive them out, [[H3423]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] said. [[H1696]]

### 13
And Joshua [[H3091]] blessed [[H1288]] him, and gave [[H5414]] unto Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] Hebron [[H2275]] for an inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 14
Hebron [[H2275]] therefore [[H5921]] became [[H1961]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] the Kenezite [[H7074]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] because [[H3282]] that [[H834]] he wholly [[H4390]] followed [[H310]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
And the name [[H8034]] of Hebron [[H2275]] before [[H6440]] Kirjath-arba; [[H7153]] a great [[H1419]] man [[H120]] among the Anakims. [[H6062]] And the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] from war. [[H4421]]
