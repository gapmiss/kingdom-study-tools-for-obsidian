### 1
But the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] committed [[H4603]] a trespass [[H4604]] in the accursed thing: [[H2764]] for Achan, [[H5912]] the son [[H1121]] of Carmi, [[H3756]] the son [[H1121]] of Zabdi, [[H2067]] the son [[H1121]] of Zerah, [[H2226]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah, [[H3063]] took [[H3947]] of [[H4480]] the accursed thing: [[H2764]] and the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
And Joshua [[H3091]] sent [[H7971]] men [[H376]] from Jericho [[H3405]] to Ai, [[H5857]] which [[H834]] beside [[H5973]] Beth-aven, [[H1007]] on the east side [[H6924]] of Beth-el, [[H1008]] and spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, saying, [[H559]] Go up [[H5927]] and view [[H7270]] the country. [[H776]] And the men [[H376]] went up [[H5927]] and viewed [[H7270]] Ai. [[H5857]]

### 3
And they returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Let not [[H408]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] go up; [[H5927]] but let about two [[H505]] or [[H176]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] go up [[H5927]] and smite [[H5221]] Ai; [[H5857]] make not [[H408]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] to labour [[H3021]] thither; [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] few. [[H4592]]

### 4
So there went up [[H5927]] thither [[H8033]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] about three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] men: [[H376]] and they fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] the men [[H376]] of Ai. [[H5857]]

### 5
And the men [[H582]] of Ai [[H5857]] smote [[H5221]] of them about thirty [[H7970]] and six [[H8337]] men: [[H376]] for they chased [[H7291]] them before [[H6440]] the gate [[H8179]] unto [[H5704]] Shebarim, [[H7671]] and smote [[H5221]] them in the going down: [[H4174]] wherefore the hearts [[H3824]] of the people [[H5971]] melted, [[H4549]] and became [[H1961]] as water. [[H4325]]

### 6
And Joshua [[H3091]] rent [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H8071]] and fell [[H5307]] to the earth [[H776]] upon [[H5921]] his face [[H6440]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] the eventide, [[H6153]] he [[H1931]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and put [[H5927]] dust [[H6083]] upon [[H5921]] their heads. [[H7218]]

### 7
And Joshua [[H3091]] said, [[H559]] Alas, O [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] wherefore [[H4100]] hast thou at all brought [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] to deliver [[H5414]] us into the hand [[H3027]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] to destroy [[H6]] us? would to God [[H3863]] we had been content, [[H2974]] and dwelt [[H3427]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan! [[H3383]]

### 8
O [[H994]] Lord, [[H136]] what [[H4100]] shall I say, [[H559]] when [[H310]] Israel [[H3478]] turneth [[H2015]] their backs [[H6203]] before [[H6440]] their enemies! [[H341]]

### 9
For the Canaanites [[H3669]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] shall hear [[H8085]] and shall environ us round, [[H5437]] and cut off [[H3772]] our name [[H8034]] from [[H4480]] the earth: [[H776]] and what [[H4100]] wilt thou do [[H6213]] unto thy great [[H1419]] name? [[H8034]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Get thee up; [[H6965]] wherefore [[H4100]] liest [[H5307]] thou [[H859]] thus [[H2088]] upon [[H5921]] thy face? [[H6440]]

### 11
Israel [[H3478]] hath sinned, [[H2398]] and they have also [[H1571]] transgressed [[H5674]] my covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] them: for they have even [[H1571]] taken [[H3947]] of [[H4480]] the accursed thing, [[H2764]] and have also [[H1571]] stolen, [[H1589]] and dissembled [[H3584]] also, [[H1571]] and they have put [[H7760]] even [[H1571]] among their own stuff. [[H3627]]

### 12
Therefore the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] stand [[H6965]] before [[H6440]] their enemies, [[H341]] turned [[H6437]] backs [[H6203]] before [[H6440]] their enemies, [[H341]] because [[H3588]] they were [[H1961]] accursed: [[H2764]] neither [[H3808]] will I be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] you any more, [[H3254]] except [[H3808]] ye destroy [[H8045]] the accursed [[H2764]] from among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 13
Up, [[H6965]] sanctify [[H6942]] the people, [[H5971]] and say, [[H559]] Sanctify yourselves [[H6942]] against to morrow: [[H4279]] for [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] an accursed thing [[H2764]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thee, O Israel: [[H3478]] thou canst [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] stand [[H6965]] before [[H6440]] thine enemies, [[H341]] until [[H5704]] ye take away [[H5493]] the accursed thing [[H2764]] from among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 14
In the morning [[H1242]] therefore ye shall be brought [[H7126]] according to your tribes: [[H7626]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] the tribe [[H7626]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] taketh [[H3920]] shall come [[H7126]] according to the families [[H4940]] and the family [[H4940]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall take [[H3920]] shall come [[H7126]] by households; [[H1004]] and the household [[H1004]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall take [[H3920]] shall come [[H7126]] man by man. [[H1397]]

### 15
And it shall be, [[H1961]] he that is taken [[H3920]] with the accursed thing [[H2764]] shall be burnt [[H8313]] with fire, [[H784]] he and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath: because [[H3588]] he hath transgressed [[H5674]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and because [[H3588]] he hath wrought [[H6213]] folly [[H5039]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 16
So Joshua [[H3091]] rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and brought [[H7126]] Israel [[H3478]] by their tribes; [[H7626]] and the tribe [[H7626]] of Judah [[H3063]] was taken: [[H3920]]

### 17
And he brought [[H7126]] the family [[H4940]] of Judah; [[H3063]] and he took [[H3920]] the family [[H4940]] of the Zarhites: [[H2227]] and he brought [[H7126]] the family [[H4940]] of the Zarhites [[H2227]] man by man; [[H1397]] and Zabdi [[H2067]] was taken: [[H3920]]

### 18
And he brought [[H7126]] his household [[H1004]] man by man; [[H1397]] and Achan, [[H5912]] the son [[H1121]] of Carmi, [[H3756]] the son [[H1121]] of Zabdi, [[H2067]] the son [[H1121]] of Zerah, [[H2226]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah, [[H3063]] was taken. [[H3920]]

### 19
And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Achan, [[H5912]] My son, [[H1121]] give, [[H7760]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] glory [[H3519]] to the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and make [[H5414]] confession [[H8426]] unto him; and tell [[H5046]] me now [[H4994]] what [[H4100]] thou hast done; [[H6213]] hide [[H3582]] not [[H408]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 20
And Achan [[H5912]] answered [[H6030]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and said, [[H559]] Indeed [[H546]] I [[H595]] have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and thus [[H2063]] and thus [[H2063]] have I done: [[H6213]]

### 21
When I saw [[H7200]] among the spoils [[H7998]] a [[H259]] goodly [[H2896]] Babylonish [[H8152]] garment, [[H155]] and two hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver, [[H3701]] and a [[H259]] wedge [[H3956]] of gold [[H2091]] of fifty [[H2572]] shekels [[H8255]] weight, [[H4948]] then I coveted [[H2530]] them, and took [[H3947]] them; and, behold, [[H2009]] they hid [[H2934]] in the earth [[H776]] in the midst [[H8432]] of my tent, [[H168]] and the silver [[H3701]] under [[H8478]] it. [[H8478]]

### 22
So Joshua [[H3091]] sent [[H7971]] messengers, [[H4397]] and they ran [[H7323]] unto the tent; [[H168]] and, behold, [[H2009]] hid [[H2934]] in his tent, [[H168]] and the silver [[H3701]] under [[H8478]] it. [[H8478]]

### 23
And they took [[H3947]] them out of the midst [[H8432]] of the tent, [[H168]] and brought [[H935]] them unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and laid them out [[H3332]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 24
And Joshua, [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, took [[H3947]] Achan [[H5912]] the son [[H1121]] of Zerah, [[H2226]] and the silver, [[H3701]] and the garment, [[H155]] and the wedge [[H3956]] of gold, [[H2091]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and his daughters, [[H1323]] and his oxen, [[H7794]] and his asses, [[H2543]] and his sheep, [[H6629]] and his tent, [[H168]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had: and they brought [[H5927]] them unto the valley [[H6010]] of Achor. [[H5911]]

### 25
And Joshua [[H3091]] said, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] hast thou troubled [[H5916]] us? the Lord [[H3068]] shall trouble [[H5916]] thee this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] stoned [[H7275]] him with stones, [[H68]] and burned [[H8313]] them with fire, [[H784]] after they had stoned [[H5619]] them with stones. [[H68]]

### 26
And they raised [[H6965]] over [[H5921]] him a great [[H1419]] heap [[H1530]] of stones [[H68]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] So the Lord [[H3068]] turned [[H7725]] from the fierceness [[H2740]] of his anger. [[H639]] Wherefore [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] was called, [[H7121]] The valley [[H6010]] of Achor, [[H5911]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]
