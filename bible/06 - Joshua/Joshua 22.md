### 1
Then [[H227]] Joshua [[H3091]] called [[H7121]] the Reubenites, [[H7206]] and the Gadites, [[H1425]] and the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]]

### 2
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Ye [[H859]] have kept [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] you, and have obeyed [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] you: [[H6680]]

### 3
Ye have not [[H3808]] left [[H5800]] your brethren [[H251]] these [[H2088]] many [[H7227]] days [[H3117]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] but have kept [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of the commandment [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 4
And now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath given rest [[H5117]] unto your brethren, [[H251]] as [[H834]] he promised [[H1696]] them: therefore now [[H6258]] return [[H6437]] ye, and get [[H1980]] you unto your tents, [[H168]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of your possession, [[H272]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] you on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 5
But [[H7535]] take diligent [[H3966]] heed [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] the commandment [[H4687]] and the law, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] charged [[H6680]] you, to love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and to walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] and to keep [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H4687]] and to cleave [[H1692]] unto him, and to serve [[H5647]] him with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] your soul. [[H5315]]

### 6
So Joshua [[H3091]] blessed [[H1288]] them, and sent them away: [[H7971]] and they went [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] their tents. [[H168]]

### 7
Now to the half [[H2677]] of the tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] Moses [[H4872]] had given [[H5414]] in Bashan: [[H1316]] but unto the half [[H2677]] thereof gave [[H5414]] Joshua [[H3091]] among [[H5973]] their brethren [[H251]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] westward. [[H3220]] And when [[H3588]] Joshua [[H3091]] sent them away [[H7971]] also [[H1571]] unto [[H413]] their tents, [[H168]] then he blessed [[H1288]] them, [[H1288]]

### 8
And he spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, saying, [[H559]] Return [[H7725]] with much [[H7227]] riches [[H5233]] unto [[H413]] your tents, [[H168]] and with very [[H3966]] much [[H7227]] cattle, [[H4735]] with silver, [[H3701]] and with gold, [[H2091]] and with brass, [[H5178]] and with iron, [[H1270]] and with very [[H3966]] much [[H7235]] raiment: [[H8008]] divide [[H2505]] the spoil [[H7998]] of your enemies [[H341]] with [[H5973]] your brethren. [[H251]]

### 9
And the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] returned, [[H7725]] and departed [[H1980]] from [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of Shiloh, [[H7887]] which [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] to go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] the country [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of their possession, [[H272]] whereof [[H834]] they were possessed, [[H270]] according [[H5921]] to the word [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]

### 10
And when they came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the borders [[H1552]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] that [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] built [[H1129]] there [[H8033]] an altar [[H4196]] by [[H5921]] Jordan, [[H3383]] a great [[H1419]] altar [[H4196]] to see to. [[H4758]]

### 11
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] say, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] have built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] over against [[H4136]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] in [[H413]] the borders [[H1552]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] at [[H413]] the passage [[H5676]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 12
And when the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] gathered themselves together [[H6950]] at Shiloh, [[H7887]] to go up [[H5927]] to war [[H6635]] against [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 13
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] and to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Gad, [[H1410]] and to [[H413]] the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] Phinehas [[H6372]] the son [[H1121]] of Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]]

### 14
And with [[H5973]] him ten [[H6235]] princes, [[H5387]] of each [[H259]] chief [[H5387]] house [[H1004]] a prince [[H1]] throughout all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H4294]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and each one [[H376]] an head [[H7218]] of the house [[H1004]] of their fathers [[H1]] among the thousands [[H505]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
And they came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] and to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Gad, [[H1410]] and to [[H413]] the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] and they spake [[H1696]] with [[H854]] them, saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] What [[H4100]] trespass [[H4604]] this [[H2088]] that [[H834]] ye have committed [[H4603]] against the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to turn away [[H7725]] this day [[H3117]] from following [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] in that ye have builded [[H1129]] you an altar, [[H4196]] that ye might rebel [[H4775]] this day [[H3117]] against the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 17
the iniquity [[H5771]] of Peor [[H6465]] too little [[H4592]] for us, from [[H4480]] which [[H834]] we are not [[H3808]] cleansed [[H2891]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] although there was [[H1961]] a plague [[H5063]] in the congregation [[H5712]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 18
But that ye [[H859]] must turn away [[H7725]] this day [[H3117]] from following [[H310]] the Lord? [[H3068]] and it will be, [[H1961]] ye [[H859]] rebel [[H4775]] to day [[H3117]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] that to morrow [[H4279]] he will be wroth [[H7107]] with [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 19
Notwithstanding, [[H389]] if [[H518]] the land [[H776]] of your possession [[H272]] unclean, [[H2931]] pass ye over [[H5674]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the possession [[H272]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] wherein [[H834]] the Lord's [[H3068]] tabernacle [[H4908]] dwelleth, [[H7931]] and take possession [[H270]] among [[H8432]] us: but rebel [[H4775]] not [[H408]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] nor [[H408]] rebel [[H4775]] against us, in building [[H1129]] you an altar [[H4196]] beside [[H1107]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 20
Did not [[H3808]] Achan [[H5912]] the son [[H1121]] of Zerah [[H2226]] commit [[H4603]] a trespass [[H4604]] in the accursed thing, [[H2764]] and wrath [[H7110]] fell [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel? [[H3478]] and that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] perished [[H1478]] not [[H3808]] alone [[H259]] in his iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 21
Then the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] answered, [[H6030]] and said [[H1696]]  unto [[H853]] the heads [[H7218]] of the thousands [[H505]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 22
The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H410]] of gods, [[H430]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H410]] of gods, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] knoweth, [[H3045]] and Israel [[H3478]] he [[H1931]] shall know; [[H3045]] if [[H518]] in rebellion, [[H4777]] or if [[H518]] in transgression [[H4604]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] (save [[H3467]] us not [[H408]] this [[H2088]] day,) [[H3117]]

### 23
That we have built [[H1129]] us an altar [[H4196]] to turn [[H7725]] from following [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] or if [[H518]] to offer [[H5927]] thereon [[H5921]] burnt offering [[H5930]] or meat offering, [[H4503]] or if [[H518]] to offer [[H6213]] peace [[H8002]] offerings [[H2077]] thereon, [[H5921]] let the Lord [[H3068]] himself [[H1931]] require [[H1245]]

### 24
And if [[H518]] we have not [[H3808]] done [[H6213]] it [[H2063]] for fear [[H1674]] of thing, [[H1697]] saying, [[H559]] In time to come [[H4279]] your children [[H1121]] might speak [[H559]] unto our children, [[H1121]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have ye to do with the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 25
For the Lord [[H3068]] hath made [[H5414]] Jordan [[H3383]] a border [[H1366]] between [[H996]] us and you, ye children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and children [[H1121]] of Gad; [[H1410]] ye have no [[H369]] part [[H2506]] in the Lord: [[H3068]] so shall your children [[H1121]]  make [[H853]] our children [[H1121]] cease [[H7673]] from [[H1115]] fearing [[H3372]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 26
Therefore we said, [[H559]] Let us now [[H4994]] prepare [[H6213]] to build [[H1129]]  us [[H853]] an altar, [[H4196]] not [[H3808]] for burnt offering, [[H5930]] nor [[H3808]] for sacrifice: [[H2077]]

### 27
But [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] a witness [[H5707]] between [[H996]] us, and you, and our generations [[H1755]] after [[H310]] us, that we might do [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the Lord [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] him with our burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and with our sacrifices, [[H2077]] and with our peace offerings; [[H8002]] that your children [[H1121]] may not [[H3808]] say [[H559]] to our children [[H1121]] in time to come, [[H4279]] Ye have no [[H369]] part [[H2506]] in the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 28
Therefore said [[H559]] we, that it shall be, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] they should say [[H559]] to [[H413]] us or to [[H413]] our generations [[H1755]] in time to come, [[H4279]] that we may say [[H559]] Behold [[H7200]] the pattern [[H8403]] of the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] our fathers [[H1]] made, [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] for burnt offerings, [[H5930]] nor [[H3808]] for sacrifices; [[H2077]] but [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] a witness [[H5707]] between [[H996]] us and you. [[H996]]

### 29
God forbid [[H2486]] that we [[H4480]] should rebel [[H4775]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] and turn [[H7725]] this day [[H3117]] from following [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to build [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] for burnt offerings, [[H5930]] for meat offerings, [[H4503]] or for sacrifices, [[H2077]] beside [[H905]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] his tabernacle. [[H4908]]

### 30
And when Phinehas [[H6372]] the priest, [[H3548]] and the princes [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] and heads [[H7218]] of the thousands [[H505]] of Israel [[H3478]] which [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the children [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] spake, [[H1696]] it pleased [[H3190]] them. [[H5869]]

### 31
And Phinehas [[H6372]] the son [[H1121]] of Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] and to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Gad, [[H1410]] and to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] This day [[H3117]] we perceive [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] among [[H8432]] us, because [[H834]] ye have not [[H3808]] committed [[H4603]] this [[H2088]] trespass [[H4604]] against the Lord: [[H3068]] now [[H227]] ye have delivered [[H5337]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 32
And Phinehas [[H6372]] the son [[H1121]] of Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and the princes, [[H5387]] returned [[H7725]]  from [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]]  and from [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Gad, [[H1410]] out of the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and brought [[H7725]] them word [[H1697]]  again. [[H854]]

### 33
And the thing [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] blessed [[H1288]] God, [[H430]] and did not [[H3808]] intend [[H559]] to go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] them in battle, [[H6635]] to destroy [[H7843]] the land [[H776]] wherein [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and Gad [[H1410]] dwelt. [[H3427]]

### 34
And the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] called [[H7121]] the altar [[H4196]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] a witness [[H5707]] between [[H996]] us that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God. [[H430]]
