### 1
And Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] sent [[H7971]] out of [[H4480]] Shittim [[H7851]] two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] to spy [[H7270]] secretly, [[H2791]] saying, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] view [[H7200]] the land, [[H776]] even Jericho. [[H3405]] And they went, [[H1980]] and came into [[H935]] an harlot's [[H2181]] house, [[H802]] named [[H8034]] Rahab, [[H7343]] and lodged [[H7901]] there. [[H8033]]

### 2
And it was told [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Jericho, [[H3405]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H935]] men [[H582]] in hither [[H2008]] to night [[H3915]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] to search out [[H2658]] the country. [[H776]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] of Jericho [[H3405]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] Rahab, [[H7343]] saying, [[H559]] Bring forth [[H3318]] the men [[H376]] that are come [[H935]] to [[H413]] thee, which [[H834]] are entered [[H935]] into thine house: [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] they be come [[H935]] to search out [[H2658]] all [[H3605]] the country. [[H776]]

### 4
And the woman [[H802]] took [[H3947]] the two [[H8147]] men, [[H376]] and hid [[H6845]] them, and said [[H559]] thus, [[H3651]] There came [[H935]] men [[H376]] unto [[H413]] me, but I wist [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] whence [[H370]] they [[H1992]]

### 5
And it came to pass [[H1961]] of shutting [[H5462]] of the gate, [[H8179]] when it was dark, [[H2822]] that the men [[H376]] went out: [[H3318]] whither [[H575]] the men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] I wot [[H3045]] not: [[H3808]] pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] them quickly; [[H4118]] for [[H3588]] ye shall overtake [[H5381]] them. [[H5381]]

### 6
But she [[H1931]] had brought them up [[H5927]] to the roof [[H1406]] of the house, and hid [[H2934]] them with the stalks [[H6086]] of flax, [[H6593]] which she had laid in order [[H6186]] upon [[H5921]] the roof. [[H1406]]

### 7
And the men [[H376]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] them the way [[H1870]] to Jordan [[H3383]] unto [[H5921]] the fords: [[H4569]] and as soon as [[H310]] they which pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] them were gone out, [[H3318]] they shut [[H5462]] the gate. [[H8179]]

### 8
And before [[H2962]] they [[H1992]] were laid down, [[H7901]] she [[H1931]] came up [[H5927]] unto [[H5921]] them upon [[H5921]] the roof; [[H1406]]

### 9
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the men, [[H376]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] the land, [[H776]] and that [[H3588]] your terror [[H367]] is fallen [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] us, and that [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] faint [[H4127]] because [[H6440]] of you. [[H6440]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] we have heard [[H8085]] how [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] dried up [[H3001]] the water [[H4325]] of the Red [[H5488]] sea [[H3220]] for you, [[H6440]] when ye came out [[H3318]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] and what [[H834]] ye did [[H6213]] unto the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] that [[H834]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] Sihon [[H5511]] and Og, [[H5747]] whom [[H834]] ye utterly destroyed. [[H2763]]

### 11
And as soon as we had heard [[H8085]] our hearts [[H3824]] did melt, [[H4549]] neither [[H3808]] did there remain [[H6965]] any more [[H5750]] courage [[H7307]] in any man, [[H376]] because [[H6440]] of you: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] God [[H430]] in heaven [[H8064]] above, [[H4605]] and in [[H5921]] earth [[H776]] beneath. [[H8478]]

### 12
Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray [[H4994]] you, swear [[H7650]] unto me by the Lord, [[H3068]] since [[H3588]] I have shewed [[H6213]] you kindness, [[H2617]] that ye [[H859]] will also [[H1571]] shew [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] unto [[H5973]] my father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] and give [[H5414]] me a true [[H571]] token: [[H226]]

### 13
And ye will save alive [[H2421]] my father, [[H1]] and my mother, [[H517]] and my brethren, [[H251]] and my sisters, [[H269]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they have, and deliver [[H5337]] our lives [[H5315]] from death. [[H4194]]

### 14
And the men [[H376]] answered [[H559]] her, Our life [[H5315]] for [[H8478]] yours, [[H4191]] if [[H518]] ye utter [[H5046]] not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] our business. [[H1697]] And it shall be, [[H1961]] when the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]]  us [[H853]] the land, [[H776]] that we will deal [[H6213]] kindly [[H2617]] and truly [[H571]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 15
Then she let them down [[H3381]] by a cord [[H2256]] through [[H1157]] the window: [[H2474]] for [[H3588]] her house [[H1004]] upon the town [[H7023]] wall, [[H2346]] and she [[H1931]] dwelt [[H3427]] upon the wall. [[H2346]]

### 16
And she said [[H559]] unto them, Get [[H1980]] you to the mountain, [[H2022]] lest [[H6435]] the pursuers [[H7291]] meet [[H6293]] you; and hide yourselves [[H2247]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] the pursuers [[H7291]] be returned: [[H7725]] and afterward [[H310]] may ye go [[H1980]] your way. [[H1870]]

### 17
And the men [[H376]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, We [[H587]] blameless [[H5355]] of this thine oath [[H7621]] which [[H834]] thou hast made us swear. [[H7650]]

### 18
Behold, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] come [[H935]] into the land, [[H776]] thou shalt bind [[H7194]] this [[H2088]] line [[H8615]] of scarlet [[H8144]] thread [[H2339]] in the window [[H2474]] which [[H834]] thou didst let us down by: [[H3381]] and thou shalt bring [[H622]] thy father, [[H1]] and thy mother, [[H517]] and thy brethren, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] thy father's [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] home [[H1004]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 19
And it shall be, [[H1961]] whosoever [[H834]] shall go out [[H3318]] of the doors [[H1817]] of thy house [[H1004]] into the street, [[H2351]] his blood [[H1818]] upon his head, [[H7218]] and we [[H587]] guiltless: [[H5355]] and whosoever [[H3605]] shall be [[H1961]] with [[H854]] thee in the house, [[H1004]] his blood [[H1818]] on our head, [[H7218]] if [[H518]] hand [[H3027]] be [[H1961]] upon him. [[H1961]]

### 20
And if [[H518]] thou utter [[H5046]] this [[H2088]] our business, [[H1697]] then we will be [[H1961]] quit [[H5355]] of thine oath [[H7621]] which [[H834]] thou hast made us to swear. [[H7650]]

### 21
And she said, [[H559]] According unto your words, [[H1697]] so [[H3651]] it. [[H1931]] And she sent them away, [[H7971]] and they departed: [[H1980]] and she bound [[H7194]] the scarlet [[H8144]] line [[H8615]] in the window. [[H2474]]

### 22
And they went, [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] unto the mountain, [[H2022]] and abode [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] the pursuers [[H7291]] were returned: [[H7725]] and the pursuers [[H7291]] sought [[H1245]] throughout all [[H3605]] the way, [[H1870]] but found [[H4672]] not. [[H3808]]

### 23
So the two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] returned, [[H7725]] and descended [[H3381]] from the mountain, [[H2022]] and passed over, [[H5674]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and told [[H5608]]  him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that befell [[H4672]] them: [[H4672]]

### 24
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] Truly [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] into our hands [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] the land; [[H776]] for even [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the country [[H776]] do faint [[H4127]] because [[H6440]] of us.
