### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] which [[H834]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] in the hills, [[H2022]] and in the valleys, [[H8219]] and in all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H2348]] of the great [[H1419]] sea [[H3220]] over [[H413]] against [[H4136]] Lebanon, [[H3844]] the Hittite, [[H2850]] and the Amorite, [[H567]] the Canaanite, [[H3669]] the Perizzite, [[H6522]] the Hivite, [[H2340]] and the Jebusite, [[H2983]] heard [[H8085]]

### 2
That they gathered themselves [[H6908]] together, [[H3162]] to fight [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] Joshua [[H3091]] and with [[H5973]] Israel, [[H3478]] with one [[H259]] accord. [[H6310]]

### 3
And when the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Gibeon [[H1391]] heard [[H8085]] what [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] had done [[H6213]] unto Jericho [[H3405]] and to Ai, [[H5857]]

### 4
They [[H1992]] did work [[H6213]] wilily, [[H6195]] and went [[H1980]] and made as if they had been ambassadors, [[H6737]] and took [[H3947]] old [[H1087]] sacks [[H8242]] upon their asses, [[H2543]] and wine [[H3196]] bottles, [[H4997]] old, [[H1087]] and rent, [[H1234]] and bound up; [[H6887]]

### 5
And old [[H1087]] shoes [[H5275]] and clouted [[H2921]] upon their feet, [[H7272]] and old [[H1087]] garments [[H8008]] upon [[H5921]] them; and all [[H3605]] the bread [[H3899]] of their provision [[H6718]] was dry [[H3001]] mouldy. [[H5350]]

### 6
And they went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] unto [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] at Gilgal, [[H1537]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, and to [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] We be come [[H935]] from a far [[H7350]] country: [[H776]] now [[H6258]] therefore make [[H3772]] ye a league [[H1285]] with us. [[H1285]]

### 7
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Hivites, [[H2340]] Peradventure [[H194]] ye [[H859]] dwell [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] us; and how [[H349]] shall we make [[H3772]] a league [[H1285]] with you? [[H1285]]

### 8
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] We [[H587]] thy servants. [[H5650]] And Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Who [[H4310]] ye? [[H859]] and from whence [[H370]] come [[H935]] ye? [[H935]]

### 9
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, From a very [[H3966]] far [[H7350]] country [[H776]] thy servants [[H5650]] are come [[H935]] because of the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] we have heard [[H8085]] the fame [[H8089]] of him, and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] in Egypt, [[H4714]]

### 10
And all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] to the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] that [[H834]] beyond [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] to Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] and to Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] which [[H834]] at Ashtaroth. [[H6252]]

### 11
Wherefore our elders [[H2205]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of our country [[H776]] spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] us, saying, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] victuals [[H6720]] with you [[H3027]] for the journey, [[H1870]] and go [[H1980]] to meet [[H7125]] them, and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, We [[H587]] your servants: [[H5650]] therefore now [[H6258]] make [[H3772]] ye a league [[H1285]] with us. [[H1285]]

### 12
This [[H2088]] our bread [[H3899]] we took hot [[H2525]] our provision [[H6679]] out of our houses [[H1004]] on the day [[H3117]] we came forth [[H3318]] to go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] you; but now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] it is dry, [[H3001]] and it is [[H1961]] mouldy: [[H5350]]

### 13
And these [[H428]] bottles [[H4997]] of wine, [[H3196]] which [[H834]] we filled, [[H4390]] new; [[H2319]] and, behold, [[H2009]] they be rent: [[H1234]] and these [[H428]] our garments [[H8008]] and our shoes [[H5275]] are become old [[H1086]] by reason of the very [[H3966]] long [[H7230]] journey. [[H1870]]

### 14
And the men [[H582]] took [[H3947]] of their victuals, [[H6718]] and asked [[H7592]] not [[H3808]] at the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
And Joshua [[H3091]] made [[H6213]] peace [[H7965]] with them, and made [[H3772]] a league [[H1285]] with them, to let them live: [[H2421]] and the princes [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] sware [[H7650]] unto them. [[H7650]]

### 16
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7097]] of three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] after [[H310]] they had made [[H3772]] a league [[H1285]] with them, that they heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] their [[H413]] neighbours, [[H7138]] and they [[H1992]] dwelt [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] them. [[H7130]]

### 17
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] journeyed, [[H5265]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] their cities [[H5892]] on the third [[H7992]] day. [[H3117]] Now their cities [[H5892]] Gibeon, [[H1391]] and Chephirah, [[H3716]] and Beeroth, [[H881]] and Kirjath-jearim. [[H7157]]

### 18
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] smote [[H5221]] them not, [[H3808]] because [[H3588]] the princes [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] had sworn [[H7650]] unto them by the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] murmured [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] the princes. [[H5387]]

### 19
But all [[H3605]] the princes [[H5387]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the congregation, [[H5712]] We [[H587]] have sworn [[H7650]] unto them by the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel: [[H3478]] now [[H6258]] therefore we may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] touch [[H5060]] them. [[H5060]]

### 20
This [[H2063]] we will do [[H6213]] to them; we will even let them live, [[H2421]] lest [[H3808]] wrath [[H7110]] be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] us, because of [[H5921]] the oath [[H7621]] which [[H834]] we sware [[H7650]] unto them. [[H7650]]

### 21
And the princes [[H5387]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Let them live; [[H2421]] but let them be [[H1961]] hewers [[H2404]] of wood [[H6086]] and drawers [[H7579]] of water [[H4325]] unto all [[H3605]] the congregation; [[H5712]] as [[H834]] the princes [[H5387]] had promised [[H1696]] them. [[H1696]]

### 22
And Joshua [[H3091]] called [[H7121]] for them, and he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, saying, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] have ye beguiled [[H7411]] us, saying, [[H559]] We [[H587]] very [[H3966]] far [[H7350]] from [[H4480]] you; when ye [[H859]] dwell [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] us? [[H7130]]

### 23
Now [[H6258]] therefore ye [[H859]] cursed, [[H779]] and there shall none [[H3808]] of [[H4480]] you be freed [[H3772]] from being bondmen, [[H5650]] and hewers [[H2404]] of wood [[H6086]] and drawers [[H7579]] of water [[H4325]] for the house [[H1004]] of my God. [[H430]]

### 24
And they answered [[H6030]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] it was certainly [[H5046]] told [[H5046]] thy servants, [[H5650]] how that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] his servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] to give [[H5414]] you all [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] and to destroy [[H8045]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] from before [[H6440]] you, therefore we were sore [[H3966]] afraid [[H3372]] of our lives [[H5315]] because [[H6440]] of you, and have done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 25
And now, [[H6258]] behold, we [[H2009]] in thine hand: [[H3027]] as it seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] and right [[H3477]] unto thee to do [[H6213]] unto us, do. [[H6213]]

### 26
And so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] he unto them, and delivered [[H5337]] them out of the hand [[H3027]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they slew [[H2026]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 27
And Joshua [[H3091]] made [[H5414]] them that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] hewers [[H2404]] of wood [[H6086]] and drawers [[H7579]] of water [[H4325]] for the congregation, [[H5712]] and for the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] even unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] in [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] he should choose.
