There was [[H1961]] also a lot [[H1486]] for the tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh; [[H4519]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Joseph; [[H3130]] for Machir [[H4353]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] the father [[H1]] of Gilead: [[H1568]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] therefore he had [[H1961]] Gilead [[H1568]] and Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 2
There was [[H1961]] also for the rest [[H3498]] of the children [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] by their families; [[H4940]] for the children [[H1121]] of Abiezer, [[H44]] and for the children [[H1121]] of Helek, [[H2507]] and for the children [[H1121]] of Asriel, [[H844]] and for the children [[H1121]] of Shechem, [[H7928]] and for the children [[H1121]] of Hepher, [[H2660]] and for the children [[H1121]] of Shemida: [[H8061]] these [[H428]] the male [[H2145]] children [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] the son [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] by their families. [[H4940]]

### 3
But Zelophehad, [[H6765]] the son [[H1121]] of Hepher, [[H2660]] the son [[H1121]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] the son [[H1121]] of Machir, [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sons, [[H1121]] but [[H3588]] daughters: [[H1323]] and these [[H428]] the names [[H8034]] of his daughters, [[H1323]] Mahlah, [[H4244]] and Noah, [[H5270]] Hoglah, [[H2295]] Milcah, [[H4435]] and Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 4
And they came near [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and before [[H6440]] Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and before [[H6440]] the princes, [[H5387]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] to give [[H5414]] us an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] our brethren. [[H251]] Therefore according [[H413]] to the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] he gave [[H5414]] them an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] the brethren [[H251]] of their father. [[H1]]

### 5
And there fell [[H5307]] ten [[H6235]] portions [[H2256]] to Manasseh, [[H4519]] beside [[H905]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] and Bashan, [[H1316]] which [[H834]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan; [[H3383]]

### 6
Because [[H3588]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] had [[H5157]] an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] his sons: [[H1121]] and the rest [[H3498]] of Manasseh's [[H4519]] sons [[H1121]] had [[H1961]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 7
And the coast [[H1366]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] was [[H1961]] from Asher [[H836]] to Michmethah, [[H4366]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] Shechem; [[H7927]] and the border [[H1366]] went along [[H1980]] on [[H413]] the right hand [[H3225]] unto [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of En-tappuah. [[H5887]]

### 8
Manasseh [[H4519]] had [[H1961]] the land [[H776]] of Tappuah: [[H8599]] but Tappuah [[H8599]] on [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] to the children [[H1121]] of Ephraim; [[H669]]

### 9
And the coast [[H1366]] descended [[H3381]] unto the river [[H5158]] Kanah, [[H7071]] southward [[H5045]] of the river: [[H5158]] these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] of Ephraim [[H669]] among [[H8432]] the cities [[H5892]] of Manasseh: [[H4519]] the coast [[H1366]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] also on the north side [[H6828]] of the river, [[H5158]] and the outgoings [[H8444]] of it were [[H1961]] at the sea: [[H3220]]

### 10
Southward [[H5045]] Ephraim's, [[H669]] and northward [[H6828]] Manasseh's, [[H4519]] and the sea [[H3220]] is [[H1961]] his border; [[H1366]] and they met together [[H6293]] in Asher [[H836]] on the north, [[H6828]] and in Issachar [[H3485]] on the east. [[H4217]]

### 11
And Manasseh [[H4519]] had [[H1961]] in Issachar [[H3485]] and in Asher [[H836]] Beth-shean [[H1052]] and her towns, [[H1323]] and Ibleam [[H2991]] and her towns, [[H1323]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Dor [[H1756]] and her towns, [[H1323]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Endor [[H5874]] and her towns, [[H1323]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Taanach [[H8590]] and her towns, [[H1323]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Megiddo [[H4023]] and her towns, [[H1323]] three [[H7969]] countries. [[H5316]]

### 12
Yet the children [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] those [[H428]] cities; [[H5892]] but the Canaanites [[H3669]] would [[H2974]] dwell [[H3427]] in that [[H2063]] land. [[H776]]

### 13
Yet it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were waxen strong, [[H2388]] that they put [[H5414]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] to tribute; [[H4522]] but did not [[H3808]] utterly [[H3423]] drive them out. [[H3423]]

### 14
And the children [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H854]] Joshua, [[H3091]] saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4069]] hast thou given [[H5414]] me one [[H259]] lot [[H1486]] and one [[H259]] portion [[H2256]] to inherit, [[H5159]] seeing I [[H589]] a great [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] forasmuch [[H5704]] as [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath blessed [[H1288]] me hitherto? [[H3541]]

### 15
And Joshua [[H3091]] answered [[H559]] them, If [[H518]] thou [[H859]] a great [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] get thee up [[H5927]] to the wood [[H3293]] and cut down [[H1254]] for thyself there [[H8033]] in the land [[H776]] of the Perizzites [[H6522]] and of the giants, [[H7497]] if [[H3588]] mount [[H2022]] Ephraim [[H669]] be too narrow [[H213]] for thee. [[H213]]

### 16
And the children [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] said, [[H559]] The hill [[H2022]] is not [[H3808]] enough [[H4672]] for us: and all [[H3605]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] that dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of the valley [[H6010]] have chariots [[H7393]] of iron, [[H1270]] who [[H834]] of Beth-shean [[H1052]] and her towns, [[H1323]] and who [[H834]] of the valley [[H6010]] of Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 17
And Joshua [[H3091]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] to Ephraim [[H669]] and to Manasseh, [[H4519]] saying, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] a great [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] and hast great [[H1419]] power: [[H3581]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] one [[H259]] lot [[H1486]]

### 18
But [[H3588]] the mountain [[H2022]] shall be [[H1961]] thine; for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] a wood, [[H3293]] and thou shalt cut it down: [[H1254]] and the outgoings [[H8444]] of it shall be thine: for [[H3588]] thou shalt drive out [[H3423]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] though [[H3588]] they have iron [[H1270]] chariots, [[H7393]] though [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] strong.
