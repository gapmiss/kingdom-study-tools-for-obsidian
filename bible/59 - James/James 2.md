### 1
My [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] of [[G1391]] glory, [[G1391]] with [[G1722]] respect of persons. [[G4382]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] there come [[G1525]] unto [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] assembly [[G4864]] a [[G3588]] man [[G435]] with a gold ring, [[G5554]] in [[G1722]] goodly [[G2986]] apparel, [[G2066]] and [[G1161]] there come in [[G1525]] also [[G2532]] a poor man [[G4434]] in [[G1722]] vile [[G4508]] raiment; [[G2066]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] ye have respect [[G1914]] to [[G1909]] him that [[G3588]] weareth [[G5409]] the [[G3588]] gay [[G2986]] clothing, [[G2066]] and [[G2532]] say [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Sit [[G2521]] thou [[G4771]] here [[G5602]] in a good place; [[G2573]] and [[G2532]] say [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4434]] poor, [[G4434]] Stand [[G2476]] thou [[G4771]] there, [[G1563]] or [[G2228]] sit [[G2521]] here [[G5602]] under [[G5259]] my [[G3450]] footstool: [[G5286]]

### 4
not [[G3756]] Are ye [[G1252]] then [[G2532]] partial [[G1252]] in [[G1722]] yourselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] are become [[G1096]] judges [[G2923]] of evil [[G4190]] thoughts? [[G1261]]

### 5
Hearken, [[G191]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] brethren, [[G80]] not [[G3756]] Hath [[G1586]] God [[G2316]] chosen [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] of this [[G5127]] world [[G2889]] rich [[G4145]] in [[G1722]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] heirs [[G2818]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom [[G932]] which [[G3739]] he hath promised [[G1861]] to them that [[G3588]] love [[G25]] him? [[G846]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] have despised [[G818]] the [[G3588]] poor. [[G4434]] not [[G3756]] Do [[G2616]] rich men [[G4145]] oppress [[G2616]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] draw [[G1670]] you [[G5209]] before [[G1519]] the judgment seats? [[G2922]]

### 7
not [[G3756]] Do [[G987]] they [[G846]] blaspheme [[G987]] that worthy [[G2570]] name [[G3686]] by [[G1909]] the which [[G3588]] ye [[G5209]] are called? [[G1941]]

### 8
If [[G1487]] ye fulfil [[G5055]] the royal [[G937]] law [[G3551]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] scripture, [[G1124]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] thy [[G4675]] neighbour [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] thyself, [[G4572]] ye do [[G4160]] well: [[G2573]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye have respect to persons, [[G4380]] ye commit [[G2038]] sin, [[G266]] and are convinced [[G1651]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] as [[G5613]] transgressors. [[G3848]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3748]] shall keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] law, [[G3551]] and yet [[G1161]] offend [[G4417]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] he is [[G1096]] guilty of [[G1777]] all. [[G3956]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] he that [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] not [[G3361]] Do commit [[G3431]] adultery, [[G3431]] said [[G2036]] also, [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] Do [[G5407]] kill. [[G5407]] Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] no [[G3756]] thou commit [[G3431]] adultery, [[G3431]] yet [[G1161]] if thou kill, [[G5407]] thou art become [[G1096]] a transgressor [[G3848]] of the law. [[G3551]]

### 12
So [[G3779]] speak ye, [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] do, [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] they that shall be [[G3195]] judged [[G2919]] by [[G1223]] the law [[G3551]] of liberty. [[G1657]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] shall have judgment [[G2920]] he that hath [[G4160]] without mercy, [[G448]] shewed [[G4160]] no [[G3361]] mercy; [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] mercy [[G1656]] rejoiceth against [[G2620]] judgment. [[G2920]]

### 14
What [[G5101]] profit, [[G3786]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] though [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] say [[G3004]] he hath [[G2192]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G1161]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] works? [[G2041]] can [[G1410]] faith [[G4102]] save [[G4982]] him? [[G846]]

### 15
If [[G1437]] a brother [[G80]] or [[G2228]] sister [[G79]] be [[G5225]] naked, [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] destitute [[G3007]]  of [[G5600]] daily [[G2184]] food, [[G5160]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] say [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Depart [[G5217]] in [[G1722]] peace, [[G1515]] be warmed [[G2328]] and [[G2532]] filled; [[G5526]] notwithstanding [[G1161]] ye give [[G1325]] them [[G846]] not [[G3361]] those things which are needful [[G2006]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4983]] body; [[G4983]] what [[G5101]] profit? [[G3786]]

### 17
Even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] faith, [[G4102]] if [[G1437]] it hath [[G2192]] not [[G3361]] works, [[G2041]] is [[G2076]] dead, [[G3498]] being [[G2596]] alone. [[G1438]]

### 18
Yea, [[G235]] a man [[G5100]] may say, [[G2046]] Thou [[G4771]] hast [[G2192]] faith, [[G4102]] and I [[G2504]] have [[G2192]] works: [[G2041]] shew [[G1166]] me [[G3427]] thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] without [[G5565]] thy [[G4675]] works, [[G2041]] and I [[G2504]] will shew [[G1166]] thee [[G4671]] my [[G3450]] faith [[G4102]] by [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] works. [[G2041]]

### 19
Thou [[G4771]] believest [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] there is [[G2076]] one [[G1520]] God; [[G2316]] thou doest [[G4160]] well: [[G2573]] the [[G3588]] devils [[G1140]] also [[G2532]] believe, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] tremble. [[G5425]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] wilt thou [[G2309]] know, [[G1097]] O [[G5599]] vain [[G2756]] man, [[G444]] that [[G3754]] faith [[G4102]] without [[G5565]] works [[G2041]] is [[G2076]] dead? [[G3498]]

### 21
Was not [[G3756]] Abraham [[G11]] our [[G2257]] father [[G3962]] justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] works, [[G2041]] when he had offered [[G399]] Isaac [[G2464]] his [[G846]] son [[G5207]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] altar? [[G2379]]

### 22
Seest thou [[G991]] how [[G3754]] faith [[G4102]] wrought with [[G4903]] his [[G846]] works, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] was made [[G5048]] faith [[G4102]] perfect? [[G5048]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scripture was [[G1124]] fulfilled [[G4137]] which saith, [[G3004]] Abraham [[G11]] believed [[G4100]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] it was imputed [[G3049]] unto him [[G846]] for [[G1519]] righteousness: [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] he was called [[G2564]] the Friend [[G5384]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 24
Ye see [[G3708]] then [[G5106]] how that [[G3754]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] a is [[G1344]] man [[G444]] justified, [[G1344]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] only. [[G3441]]

### 25
Likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] was [[G1344]] Rahab [[G4460]] the [[G3588]] harlot [[G4204]] justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] works, [[G2041]] when she had received [[G5264]] the [[G3588]] messengers, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] had sent out [[G1544]] another [[G2087]] way? [[G3598]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] without [[G5565]] the spirit [[G4151]] is [[G2076]] dead, [[G3498]] so [[G3779]] faith [[G4102]] without [[G5565]] works [[G2041]] is [[G2076]] dead [[G3498]] also. [[G2532]]
