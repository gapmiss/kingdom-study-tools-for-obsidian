From whence [[G4159]] wars [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] fightings [[G3163]] among [[G1722]] you? [[G5213]] not [[G3756]] hence, [[G1782]] of [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] lusts [[G2237]] that [[G3588]] war [[G4754]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] members? [[G3196]]

Ye lust, [[G1937]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] not: [[G3756]] ye kill, [[G5407]] and [[G2532]] desire to have, [[G2206]] and [[G2532]] cannot [[G1410]] obtain: [[G2013]] ye fight [[G3164]] and [[G2532]] war, [[G4170]] yet [[G1161]] ye have [[G2192]] not, [[G3756]] because [[G1223]] ye [[G5209]] ask [[G154]] not. [[G3361]]

### 3
Ye ask, [[G154]] and [[G2532]] receive [[G2983]] not, [[G3756]] because [[G1360]] ye ask [[G154]] amiss, [[G2560]] that [[G2443]] ye may consume [[G1159]] upon [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] lusts. [[G2237]]

### 5
Do ye think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] scripture [[G1124]] saith [[G3004]] in vain, [[G2761]] The [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] that [[G3739]] dwelleth [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] us [[G2254]] lusteth [[G1971]] to [[G4314]] envy? [[G5355]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] he giveth [[G1325]] more [[G3173]] grace. [[G5485]] Wherefore [[G1352]] he saith, [[G3004]] God [[G2316]] resisteth [[G498]] the proud, [[G5244]] but [[G1161]] giveth [[G1325]] grace [[G5485]] unto the humble. [[G5011]]

### 7
Submit yourselves [[G5293]] therefore [[G3767]] to [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]] Resist [[G436]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] he will flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] you. [[G5216]]

### 9
Be afflicted, [[G5003]] and [[G2532]] mourn, [[G3996]] and [[G2532]] weep: [[G2799]] your [[G5216]] let be [[G3344]] laughter [[G1071]] turned [[G3344]] to [[G1519]] mourning, [[G3997]] and [[G2532]] joy [[G5479]] to [[G1519]] heaviness. [[G2726]]

### 10
Humble yourselves [[G5013]] in the sight of [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] he shall lift up. [[G5312]] you [[G5209]]

### 11
not [[G3361]] Speak [[G2635]] evil [[G2635]] one of another, [[G240]] brethren.

[[G2923]]

There is [[G2076]] one [[G1520]] lawgiver, [[G3550]] who [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to save [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] to destroy: [[G622]] who [[G5101]] art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] that [[G3739]] judgest [[G2919]] another? [[G2087]]

### 13
Go to [[G71]] now, [[G3568]] ye [[G3588]] that say, [[G3004]] To day [[G4594]] or [[G2532]] to morrow [[G839]] we will go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] such [[G3592]]  a [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] continue [[G4160]] there [[G1563]] a [[G1520]] year, [[G1763]] and [[G2532]] buy and sell, [[G1710]] and [[G2532]] get gain: [[G2770]]

### 14
Whereas [[G3748]] ye know [[G1987]] not [[G3756]] what [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] on [[G839]] morrow. [[G839]] For [[G1063]] what [[G4169]] your [[G5216]] life? [[G2222]] It is [[G2076]] even [[G1063]] a vapour, [[G822]] that appeareth [[G5316]] for [[G4314]] a [[G3588]] little time, [[G3641]] and [[G1161]] then [[G1899]] vanisheth away. [[G853]]

### 15
For that [[G473]] ye [[G5209]] to say, [[G3004]] If [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] will, [[G2309]] we shall live, [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] this, [[G5124]] or [[G2228]] that. [[G1565]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] ye rejoice [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] boastings: [[G212]] all [[G3956]] such [[G5108]] rejoicing [[G2746]] is [[G2076]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 17
Therefore [[G3767]] to him that knoweth [[G1492]] to do [[G4160]] good, [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] doeth [[G4160]] not, [[G3361]] to him [[G846]] it is [[G2076]] sin. [[G266]]
