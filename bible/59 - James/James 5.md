Go to [[G71]] now, [[G3568]] rich men, [[G4145]] weep [[G2799]] and howl [[G3649]] for [[G1909]] your [[G5216]] miseries [[G5004]] that [[G3588]] shall come upon [[G1904]]

### 2
Your [[G5216]] riches are [[G4149]] corrupted, [[G4595]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] garments [[G2440]] are [[G1096]] motheaten. [[G4598]]

### 3
Your [[G5216]] gold [[G5557]] and [[G2532]] silver [[G696]] is cankered; [[G2728]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rust [[G2447]] of them [[G846]] shall be [[G2071]] a witness against [[G3142]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] shall eat [[G5315]] your [[G5216]] flesh [[G4561]] as it were [[G5613]] fire. [[G4442]] Ye have heaped treasure together [[G2343]] for [[G1722]] the last [[G2078]] days. [[G2250]]

### 4
Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] hire [[G3408]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2040]] labourers [[G2040]] who [[G3588]] have reaped down [[G270]] your [[G5216]] fields, [[G5561]] which is of [[G575]] you [[G5216]] kept back by fraud, [[G650]] crieth: [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cries [[G995]] them [[G3588]] of which have [[G2325]] reaped [[G2325]] are entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ears [[G3775]] of the Lord [[G2962]] of sabaoth. [[G4519]]

### 5
Ye have lived in pleasure [[G5171]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] been wanton; [[G4684]] ye have nourished [[G5142]] your [[G5216]] hearts, [[G2588]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] a day [[G2250]] of slaughter. [[G4967]]

### 6
Ye have condemned [[G2613]] killed [[G5407]] the [[G3588]] just; [[G1342]] not [[G3756]] he doth [[G498]] resist [[G498]] you. [[G5213]]

### 7
Be patient [[G3114]] therefore, [[G3767]] brethren, [[G80]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]] Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] husbandman [[G1092]] waiteth for [[G1551]] the [[G3588]] precious [[G5093]] fruit [[G2590]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] and hath long patience [[G3114]] for [[G1909]] it, [[G846]] until [[G2193]] he receive [[G2983]] the early [[G4406]] and [[G2532]] latter [[G3797]] rain. [[G5205]]

### 8
Be [[G3114]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] patient; [[G3114]] stablish [[G4741]] your [[G5216]] hearts: [[G2588]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] draweth nigh. [[G1448]]

### 9
Grudge [[G4727]] not [[G3361]] one against [[G2596]] another, [[G240]] brethren, [[G80]] lest [[G3361]] ye be condemned: [[G2632]] behold, [[G2400]] the judge [[G2923]] standeth [[G2476]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] door. [[G2374]]

### 10
Take, [[G2983]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] who [[G3739]] have spoken [[G2980]] in the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] for an example [[G5262]]  of suffering [[G3588]] affliction, [[G2552]] and [[G2532]] of [[G3115]] patience. [[G3115]]

### 11
Behold, [[G2400]] we count [[G3106]] them [[G3588]] happy [[G3106]] which endure. [[G5278]] Ye have heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5281]] patience [[G5281]] of Job, [[G2492]] and [[G2532]] have seen [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] of the Lord; [[G2962]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G2076]] very pitiful, [[G4184]] and [[G2532]] of tender mercy. [[G3629]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] above [[G4253]] all things, [[G3956]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] swear [[G3660]] not, [[G3361]] neither [[G3383]] by heaven, [[G3772]] neither [[G3383]]  by [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] neither [[G3383]] by [[G243]] any [[G5100]] other [[G243]] oath: [[G3727]] but [[G1161]] let [[G2277]] your [[G5216]] the [[G3588]] yea [[G3483]] be [[G2277]] yea; [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] nay, [[G3756]] nay; [[G3756]] lest [[G2443]] ye [[G5272]] fall [[G4098]] into [[G1519]] condemnation. [[G5272]]

### 13
Is [[G2553]] any [[G5100]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] afflicted? [[G2553]] let him pray. [[G4336]] Is [[G2114]] any [[G5100]] merry? [[G2114]] let him sing psalms. [[G5567]]

### 14
Is [[G770]] any [[G5100]] sick [[G770]] among [[G1722]] you? [[G5213]] let him call [[G4341]] for [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] church; [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] let them pray [[G4336]] over [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] anointing [[G218]] him [[G846]] with oil [[G1637]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord: [[G2962]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prayer [[G2171]] of [[G4102]] faith [[G4102]] shall save [[G4982]] the [[G3588]] sick, [[G2577]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] shall raise up; [[G1453]] him [[G846]] and if [[G2579]] he have committed [[G4160]] sins, [[G266]] shall be [[G5600]] they [[G863]] forgiven [[G863]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
Confess [[G1843]] faults [[G3900]] one to another, [[G240]] and [[G2532]] pray [[G2172]] for [[G5228]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] that [[G3704]] ye may be healed. [[G2390]] The effectual fervent [[G1754]] prayer [[G1162]] of a righteous man [[G1342]] availeth [[G2480]] much. [[G4183]]

### 17
Elias [[G2243]] was [[G2258]] a man [[G444]] subject to like passions [[G3663]] as we are, [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] he prayed [[G4336]] earnestly [[G4335]] that it might [[G1026]] not [[G3361]] rain: [[G1026]] and [[G2532]] it rained [[G1026]] not [[G3756]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] by the space of three [[G5140]] years [[G1763]] and [[G2532]] six [[G1803]] months. [[G3376]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] he prayed [[G4336]] again, [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] gave [[G1325]] rain, [[G5205]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] brought forth [[G985]] her [[G846]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 19
Brethren, [[G80]] if [[G1437]] any [[G5100]] of [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] do err [[G4105]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] and [[G2532]] one [[G5100]] convert [[G1994]] him; [[G846]]

### 20
Let him know, [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] he [[G3588]] which converteth [[G1994]] the sinner [[G268]] from [[G1537]] the error [[G4106]] of his [[G846]] way [[G3598]] shall save [[G4982]] a soul [[G5590]] from [[G1537]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] shall hide [[G2572]] a multitude [[G4128]] of sins.
