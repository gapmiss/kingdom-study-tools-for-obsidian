### 1
James, [[G2385]] a servant [[G1401]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] to [[G5443]] twelve [[G1427]] tribes [[G5443]] which [[G3588]] are [[G3588]] scattered abroad, [[G1290]] greeting. [[G5463]]

### 2
My [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] count it [[G2233]] all [[G3956]] joy [[G5479]] when [[G3752]] ye fall into [[G4045]] divers [[G4164]] temptations; [[G3986]]

### 3
Knowing [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] trying [[G1383]] of your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] worketh [[G2716]] patience. [[G5281]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] let patience [[G5281]] have [[G2192]] perfect [[G5046]] work, [[G2041]] that [[G2443]] ye may be [[G5600]] perfect [[G5046]] and [[G2532]] entire, [[G3648]] wanting [[G3007]] nothing. [[G3367]]

### 5
If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] of you [[G5216]] lack [[G3007]] wisdom, [[G4678]] let him ask [[G154]] of [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] that giveth [[G1325]] to all [[G3956]] liberally, [[G574]] and [[G2532]] upbraideth [[G3679]] not; [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] it shall be given [[G1325]] him. [[G846]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] let him ask [[G154]] in [[G1722]] faith, [[G4102]] nothing [[G3367]] wavering. [[G1252]] For [[G1063]] he that wavereth [[G1252]] is like [[G1503]] a wave [[G2830]] of the sea [[G2281]] driven with the wind [[G416]] and [[G2532]] tossed. [[G4494]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] let not [[G3361]] that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] think [[G3633]] that [[G3754]] he shall receive [[G2983]] any thing [[G5100]] of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 8
A double minded [[G1374]] man [[G435]] unstable [[G182]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] ways. [[G3598]]

### 9
Let [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] of low [[G5011]] degree [[G5011]] rejoice [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] that he [[G846]] is [[G5311]] exalted: [[G5311]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] rich, [[G4145]] in [[G1722]] that he [[G846]]  is made [[G3588]] low: [[G5014]] because [[G3754]] as [[G5613]] the flower [[G438]] of the grass [[G5528]] he shall pass away. [[G3928]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] is no sooner risen [[G393]] with [[G4862]]  a burning [[G3588]] heat, [[G2742]] but [[G2532]] it withereth [[G3583]] the [[G3588]] grass, [[G5528]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] flower [[G438]] thereof [[G846]] falleth, [[G1601]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G2143]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4383]] fashion [[G4383]] of it [[G846]] perisheth: [[G622]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] shall away [[G3133]] rich man [[G4145]] fade [[G3133]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] ways. [[G4197]]

### 12
Blessed [[G3107]] the man [[G435]] that [[G3739]] endureth [[G5278]] temptation: [[G3986]] for [[G3754]] when he is [[G1096]] tried, [[G1384]] he shall receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of [[G2222]] life, [[G2222]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath promised [[G1861]] them [[G3588]] to that [[G25]] love [[G25]] him. [[G846]]

### 13
Let no man [[G3367]] say [[G3004]] when he is tempted, [[G3985]] I am tempted [[G3985]] of [[G575]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] cannot be tempted [[G551]] with evil, [[G2556]] neither [[G1161]] tempteth [[G3985]] he [[G846]] any man: [[G3762]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] every man [[G1538]] is tempted, [[G3985]] when he is drawn away [[G1828]] of [[G5259]] his own [[G2398]] lust, [[G1939]] and [[G2532]] enticed. [[G1185]]

### 15
Then when [[G1534]] lust [[G1939]] hath conceived, [[G4815]] it bringeth forth [[G5088]] sin: [[G266]] and [[G1161]] sin, [[G266]] when it is finished, [[G658]] bringeth forth [[G616]] death. [[G2288]]

### 16
not [[G3361]] Do [[G4105]] err, [[G4105]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 17
Every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] gift [[G1394]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] perfect [[G5046]] gift [[G1434]] is [[G2076]] from above, [[G509]] and cometh down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] of [[G5457]] lights, [[G5457]] with [[G3844]] whom [[G3739]] is [[G1762]] no [[G3756]] variableness, [[G3883]] neither [[G2228]] shadow [[G644]] of turning. [[G5157]]

### 18
Of his own will [[G1014]] begat he [[G616]] us [[G2248]] with the word [[G3056]] of truth, [[G225]] that we [[G2248]] should be [[G1511]] a kind [[G5100]] of firstfruits [[G536]] of his [[G846]] creatures. [[G2938]]

### 19
Wherefore, [[G5620]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] brethren, [[G80]] let every [[G3956]] man [[G444]] be [[G2077]] swift [[G5036]] to [[G1519]] hear, [[G191]] slow [[G1021]] to [[G1519]] speak, [[G2980]] slow [[G1021]] to [[G1519]] wrath: [[G3709]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] the wrath [[G3709]] of man [[G435]] worketh [[G2716]] not [[G3756]] the righteousness [[G1343]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 21
Wherefore [[G1352]] lay apart [[G659]] all [[G3956]] filthiness [[G4507]] and [[G2532]] superfluity [[G4050]] of naughtiness, [[G2549]] and receive [[G1209]] with [[G1722]] meekness [[G4240]] the [[G3588]] engrafted [[G1721]] word, [[G3056]] which [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to save [[G4982]] your [[G5216]] souls. [[G5590]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] be [[G1096]] ye doers [[G4163]] of the word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] hearers [[G202]] only, [[G3440]] deceiving [[G3884]] your own selves. [[G1438]]

### 23
For [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] be [[G2076]] a hearer [[G202]] of the word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] a doer, [[G4163]] he [[G3778]] is like unto [[G1503]] a man [[G435]] beholding [[G2657]] his [[G846]] natural [[G1078]] face [[G4383]] in [[G1722]] a glass: [[G2072]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] he beholdeth [[G2657]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] goeth his way, [[G565]] and [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] forgetteth [[G1950]] what manner of man [[G3697]] he was. [[G2258]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] whoso [[G3588]] looketh [[G3879]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] perfect [[G5046]] law [[G3551]] of [[G1657]] liberty, [[G1657]] and [[G2532]] continueth [[G3887]] he [[G3778]] being [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] a forgetful [[G1953]] hearer, [[G202]] but [[G235]] a doer [[G4163]] of the work, [[G2041]] this man [[G3778]] shall be [[G2071]] blessed [[G3107]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] deed. [[G4162]]

### 26
If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] seem [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] religious, [[G2357]] and bridleth [[G5468]] not [[G3361]] his [[G846]] tongue, [[G1100]] but [[G235]] deceiveth [[G538]] his own [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] this man's [[G5127]] religion [[G2356]] vain. [[G3152]]

### 27
Pure [[G2513]] religion [[G2356]] and [[G2532]] undefiled [[G283]] before [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the Father [[G3962]] is [[G2076]] this, [[G3778]] To visit [[G1980]] the fatherless [[G3737]] and [[G2532]] widows [[G5503]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] affliction, [[G2347]] to keep [[G5083]] himself [[G1438]] unspotted [[G784]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] world.
