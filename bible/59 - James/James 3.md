### 1
My [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] be [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] many [[G4183]] masters, [[G1320]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we shall receive [[G2983]] the greater [[G3173]] condemnation. [[G2917]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] in many things [[G4183]] we offend [[G4417]] all. [[G537]] If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] offend [[G4417]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] word, [[G3056]] the same [[G3778]] a perfect [[G5046]] man, [[G435]] able [[G1415]] also [[G2532]] to bridle [[G5468]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] body. [[G4983]]

### 3
Behold, [[G2400]] we put [[G906]] bits [[G5469]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] horses' [[G2462]] mouths, [[G4750]] that [[G4314]] they [[G846]] may obey [[G3982]] us; [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] we turn about [[G3329]] their [[G846]] whole [[G3650]] body. [[G4983]]

### 4
Behold [[G2400]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ships, [[G4143]] which though they be [[G5607]] so great, [[G5082]] and [[G2532]] driven [[G1643]] of [[G5259]] fierce [[G4642]] winds, [[G417]] yet are they turned about [[G3329]] with [[G5259]] a very small [[G1646]] helm, [[G4079]] whithersoever [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2116]] listeth. [[G1014]]

### 5
Even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] tongue [[G1100]] is [[G2076]] a little [[G3398]] member, [[G3196]] and [[G2532]] boasteth great things. [[G3166]] Behold, [[G2400]] how great [[G2245]] a matter [[G5208]] a little [[G3641]] fire [[G4442]] kindleth! [[G381]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] the a [[G3588]] tongue [[G1100]] a fire, [[G4442]] world [[G2889]] of [[G93]] iniquity: [[G93]] so [[G3779]] is [[G2525]] the [[G3588]] tongue [[G1100]] among [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] members, [[G3196]] that it defileth [[G4695]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] setteth on fire [[G5394]] the [[G3588]] course [[G5164]] of [[G1078]] nature; [[G1078]] and [[G2532]] it is set on fire [[G5394]] of [[G5259]] hell. [[G1067]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] every [[G3956]] kind [[G5449]] of beasts, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] of birds, [[G4071]] and [[G5037]] of serpents, [[G2062]] and [[G2532]] of things in the sea, [[G1724]] is tamed, [[G1150]] and [[G2532]] hath been tamed [[G1150]] of [[G442]] mankind: [[G442]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] tongue [[G1100]] can [[G1410]] no [[G3762]] man [[G444]] tame; [[G1150]] an unruly [[G183]] evil, [[G2556]] full [[G3324]] of deadly [[G2287]] poison. [[G2447]]

### 9
Therewith [[G1722]]  we [[G846]] bless [[G2127]] God, [[G2316]] even [[G2532]] the Father; [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] therewith [[G1722]]  we [[G846]] curse [[G2672]] men, [[G444]] which [[G3588]] are made [[G1096]] after [[G2596]] the similitude [[G3669]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 10
Out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] proceedeth [[G1831]] blessing [[G2129]] and [[G2532]] cursing. [[G2671]] My [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] these things [[G5023]] ought [[G5534]] not [[G3756]] so [[G3779]] to be. [[G1096]]

### 11
Doth [[G3385]] a [[G3588]] fountain [[G4077]] send forth [[G1032]] at [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] place [[G3692]] sweet [[G1099]] and [[G2532]] bitter? [[G4089]]

### 12
Can [[G1410]] the fig tree, [[G4808]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] bear [[G4160]] olive berries? [[G1636]] either [[G2228]] a vine, [[G288]] figs? [[G4810]] so [[G3779]] no [[G3762]] fountain [[G4077]] both yield [[G4160]] salt [[G252]] water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] fresh. [[G1099]]

### 13
Who [[G5101]] a wise man [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] endued with knowledge [[G1990]] among [[G1722]] you? [[G5213]] let him shew [[G1166]] out of [[G1537]] a [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] conversation [[G391]] his [[G846]] works [[G2041]] with [[G1722]] meekness [[G4240]] of wisdom. [[G4678]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye have [[G2192]] bitter [[G4089]] envying [[G2205]] and [[G2532]] strife [[G2052]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] hearts, [[G2588]] glory [[G2620]] not, [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] lie [[G5574]] not against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

### 15
This [[G3778]] wisdom [[G4678]] descendeth [[G2718]] not [[G3756]] from above, [[G509]] but [[G235]] earthly, [[G1919]] sensual, [[G5591]] devilish. [[G1141]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] where [[G3699]] envying [[G2205]] and [[G2532]] strife [[G2052]] there [[G1563]] confusion [[G181]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] evil [[G5337]] work. [[G4229]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] that is from above [[G509]] is [[G2076]] first [[G4412]] pure, [[G53]] then [[G1899]] peaceable, [[G1516]] gentle, [[G1933]] easy to be intreated, [[G2138]] full [[G3324]] of mercy [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] good [[G18]] fruits, [[G2590]] without partiality, [[G87]] and [[G2532]] without hypocrisy. [[G505]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] the fruit [[G2590]]  of [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] is sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] peace [[G1515]] them [[G3588]] of that [[G4160]] make [[G4160]] peace. [[G1515]]
