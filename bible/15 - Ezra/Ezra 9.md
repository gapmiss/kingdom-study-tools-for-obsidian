### 1
Now when these things [[H428]] were done, [[H3615]] the princes [[H8269]] came [[H5066]] to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] The people [[H5971]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the priests, [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] have not [[H3808]] separated themselves [[H914]] from the people [[H5971]] of the lands, [[H776]] according to their abominations, [[H8441]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] the Hittites, [[H2850]] the Perizzites, [[H6522]] the Jebusites, [[H2983]] the Ammonites, [[H5984]] the Moabites, [[H4125]] the Egyptians, [[H4713]] and the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] they have taken [[H5375]] of their daughters [[H1323]] for themselves, and for their sons: [[H1121]] so that the holy [[H6944]] seed [[H2233]] have mingled themselves [[H6148]] with the people [[H5971]] of lands: [[H776]] yea, the hand [[H3027]] of the princes [[H8269]] and rulers [[H5461]] hath been [[H1961]] chief [[H7223]] in this [[H2088]] trespass. [[H4604]]

### 3
And when I heard [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] I rent [[H7167]] my garment [[H899]] and my mantle, [[H4598]] and plucked off [[H4803]] the hair [[H8181]] of my head [[H7218]] and of my beard, [[H2206]] and sat down [[H3427]] astonied. [[H8074]]

### 4
Then were assembled [[H622]] unto [[H413]] me every one [[H3605]] that trembled [[H2730]] at the words [[H1697]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H5921]] of the transgression [[H4604]] of those that had been carried away; [[H1473]] and I [[H589]] sat [[H3427]] astonied [[H8074]] until [[H5704]] the evening [[H6153]] sacrifice. [[H4503]]

### 5
And at the evening [[H6153]] sacrifice [[H4503]] I arose up [[H6965]] from my heaviness; [[H8589]] and having rent [[H7167]] my garment [[H899]] and my mantle, [[H4598]] I fell [[H3766]] upon [[H5921]] my knees, [[H1290]] and spread out [[H6566]] my hands [[H3709]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]]

### 6
And said, [[H559]] O my God, [[H430]] I am ashamed [[H954]] and blush [[H3637]] to lift up [[H7311]] my face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] thee, my God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] our iniquities [[H5771]] are increased [[H7235]] over [[H4605]] head, [[H7218]] and our trespass [[H819]] is grown up [[H1431]] unto [[H5704]] the heavens. [[H8064]]

### 7
Since the days [[H3117]] of our fathers [[H1]] we [[H587]] in a great [[H1419]] trespass [[H819]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]] and for our iniquities [[H5771]] have we, [[H587]] our kings, [[H4428]] our priests, [[H3548]] been delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the kings [[H4428]] of the lands, [[H776]] to the sword, [[H2719]] to captivity, [[H7628]] and to a spoil, [[H961]] and to confusion [[H1322]] of face, [[H6440]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 8
And now [[H6258]] for a little [[H4592]] space [[H7281]] grace [[H8467]] hath been [[H1961]] from [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] to leave [[H7604]] us a remnant to escape, [[H6413]] and to give [[H5414]] us a nail [[H3489]] in his holy [[H6944]] place, [[H4725]] that our God [[H430]] may lighten [[H215]] our eyes, [[H5869]] and give [[H5414]] us a little [[H4592]] reviving [[H4241]] in our bondage. [[H5659]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] we [[H587]] bondmen; [[H5650]] yet our God [[H430]] hath not [[H3808]] forsaken [[H5800]] us in our bondage, [[H5659]] but hath extended [[H5186]] mercy [[H2617]] unto [[H5921]] us in the sight [[H6440]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Persia, [[H6539]] to give [[H5414]] us a reviving, [[H4241]] to set up [[H7311]] the house [[H1004]] of our God, [[H430]] and to repair [[H5975]] the desolations [[H2723]] thereof, and to give [[H5414]] us a wall [[H1447]] in Judah [[H3063]] and in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
And now, [[H6258]] O our God, [[H430]] what [[H4100]] shall we say [[H559]] after [[H310]] this? [[H2063]] for [[H3588]] we have forsaken [[H5800]] thy commandments, [[H4687]]

### 11
Which [[H834]] thou hast commanded [[H6680]] by [[H3027]] thy servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]] The land, [[H776]] unto which [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it, is an unclean [[H5079]] land [[H776]] with the filthiness [[H5079]] of the people [[H5971]] of the lands, [[H776]] with their abominations, [[H8441]] which [[H834]] have filled [[H4390]] it from one end [[H6310]] to [[H413]] another [[H6310]] with their uncleanness. [[H2932]]

### 12
Now [[H6258]] therefore give [[H5414]] not [[H408]] your daughters [[H1323]] unto their sons, [[H1121]] neither [[H408]] take [[H5375]] their daughters [[H1323]] unto your sons, [[H1121]] nor [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] their peace [[H7965]] or their wealth [[H2896]] for [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]] that [[H4616]] ye may be strong, [[H2388]] and eat [[H398]] the good [[H2898]] of the land, [[H776]] and leave for an inheritance [[H3423]] to your children [[H1121]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 13
And after [[H310]] all [[H3605]] that is come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us for our evil [[H7451]] deeds, [[H4639]] and for our great [[H1419]] trespass, [[H819]] seeing [[H3588]] that thou [[H859]] our God [[H430]] hast punished [[H2820]] us less [[H4295]] than our iniquities [[H5771]] and hast given [[H5414]] us deliverance [[H6413]] as this; [[H2063]]

### 14
Should we again [[H7725]] break [[H6565]] thy commandments, [[H4687]] and join in affinity [[H2859]] with the people [[H5971]] of these [[H428]] abominations? [[H8441]] wouldest not [[H3808]] thou be angry [[H599]] with us till [[H5704]] thou hadst consumed [[H3615]] so that no [[H369]] remnant [[H7611]] nor escaping? [[H6413]]

### 15
O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] thou [[H859]] righteous: [[H6662]] for [[H3588]] we remain [[H7604]] yet escaped, [[H6413]] as this [[H2063]] day: [[H3117]] behold, [[H2005]] we before [[H6440]] thee in our trespasses: [[H819]] for [[H3588]] we cannot [[H369]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] thee because [[H5921]] of this.
