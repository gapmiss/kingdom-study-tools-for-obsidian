And I gathered them together [[H6908]] to [[H413]] the river [[H5104]] that runneth [[H935]] to [[H413]] Ahava; [[H163]] and there [[H8033]] abode we in tents [[H2583]] three [[H7969]] days: [[H3117]] and I viewed [[H995]] the people, [[H5971]] and the priests, [[H3548]] and found [[H4672]] there [[H8033]] none [[H3808]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Levi. [[H3878]]

### 16
Then sent [[H7971]] I for Eliezer, [[H461]] for Ariel, [[H740]] for Shemaiah, [[H8098]] and for Elnathan, [[H494]] and for Jarib, [[H3402]] and for Elnathan, [[H494]] and for Nathan, [[H5416]] and for Zechariah, [[H2148]] and for Meshullam, [[H4918]] chief men; [[H7218]] also for Joiarib, [[H3114]] and for Elnathan, [[H494]] men of understanding. [[H995]]

### 17
And I sent them with commandment [[H6680]] unto [[H5921]] Iddo [[H112]] the chief [[H7218]] at the place [[H4725]] Casiphia, [[H3703]] and I told [[H7760]] them what [[H1697]] they should say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Iddo, [[H112]] to his brethren [[H251]] the Nethinims, [[H5411]] at the place [[H4725]] Casiphia, [[H3703]] that they should bring [[H935]] unto us ministers [[H8334]] for the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 18
And by the good [[H2896]] hand [[H3027]] of our God [[H430]] upon [[H5921]] us they brought [[H935]] us a man [[H376]] of understanding, [[H7922]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Mahli, [[H4249]] the son [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] the son [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and Sherebiah, [[H8274]] with his sons [[H1121]] and his brethren, [[H251]] eighteen; [[H8083]]

### 19
And Hashabiah, [[H2811]] and with [[H854]] him Jeshaiah [[H3470]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Merari, [[H4847]] his brethren [[H251]] and their sons, [[H1121]] twenty; [[H6242]]

### 20
Also of [[H4480]] the Nethinims, [[H5411]] whom David [[H1732]] and the princes [[H8269]] had appointed [[H5414]] for the service [[H5656]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] two hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] Nethinims: [[H5411]] all [[H3605]] of them were expressed [[H5344]] by name. [[H8034]]

### 21
Then I proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast [[H6685]] there, [[H8033]] at [[H5921]] the river [[H5104]] of Ahava, [[H163]] that we might afflict ourselves [[H6031]] before [[H6440]] our God, [[H430]] to seek [[H1245]] of [[H4480]] him a right [[H3477]] way [[H1870]] for us, and for our little ones, [[H2945]] and for all [[H3605]] our substance. [[H7399]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] I was ashamed [[H954]] to require [[H7592]] of [[H4480]] the king [[H4428]] a band of soldiers [[H2428]] and horsemen [[H6571]] to help [[H5826]] us against the enemy [[H341]] in the way: [[H1870]] because [[H3588]] we had spoken [[H559]] unto the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] The hand [[H3027]] of our God [[H430]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] them for good [[H2896]] that seek [[H1245]] him; but his power [[H5797]] and his wrath [[H639]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] them that forsake [[H5800]] him. [[H5800]]

### 23
So we fasted [[H6684]] and besought [[H1245]] our God [[H430]] for [[H5921]] this: [[H2063]] and he was intreated [[H6279]] of us. [[H6279]]

### 24
Then I separated [[H914]] twelve [[H8147]] of the chief [[H8269]] of the priests, [[H3548]] Sherebiah, [[H8274]] Hashabiah, [[H2811]] and ten [[H6235]] of their brethren [[H251]] with [[H5973]] them, [[H5973]]

### 25
And weighed [[H8254]]  unto them [[H853]] the silver, [[H3701]] and the gold, [[H2091]] and the vessels, [[H3627]] the offering [[H8641]] of the house [[H1004]] of our God, [[H430]] which the king, [[H4428]] and his counsellers, [[H3289]] and his lords, [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] present, [[H4672]] had offered: [[H7311]]

### 26
I even weighed [[H8254]] unto [[H5921]] their hand [[H3027]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] and silver [[H3701]] vessels [[H3627]] an hundred [[H3967]] talents, [[H3603]] of gold [[H2091]] an hundred [[H3967]] talents; [[H3603]]

### 27
Also twenty [[H6242]] basons [[H3713]] of gold, [[H2091]] of a thousand [[H505]] drams; [[H150]] and two [[H8147]] vessels [[H3627]] of fine [[H2896]] copper, [[H5178]] precious [[H2532]] as gold. [[H2091]]

### 28
And I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Ye [[H859]] holy [[H6944]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] the vessels [[H3627]] holy [[H6944]] also; and the silver [[H3701]] and the gold [[H2091]] a freewill offering [[H5071]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers. [[H1]]

### 29
Watch [[H8245]] ye, and keep [[H8104]] until [[H5704]] ye weigh [[H8254]] before [[H6440]] the chief [[H8269]] of the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] and chief [[H8269]] of the fathers [[H1]] of Israel, [[H3478]] at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] in the chambers [[H3957]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 30
So took [[H6901]] the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites [[H3881]] the weight [[H4948]] of the silver, [[H3701]] and the gold, [[H2091]] and the vessels, [[H3627]] to bring [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 31
Then we departed [[H5265]] from the river [[H5104]] of Ahava [[H163]] on the twelfth [[H8147]] of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] to go [[H1980]] unto Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and the hand [[H3027]] of our God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] us, and he delivered [[H5337]] us from the hand [[H3709]] of the enemy, [[H341]] and of such as lay in wait [[H693]] by [[H5921]] the way. [[H1870]]

### 32
And we came [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and abode [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]]

### 33
Now on the fourth [[H7243]] day [[H3117]] was the silver [[H3701]] and the gold [[H2091]] and the vessels [[H3627]] weighed [[H8254]] in the house [[H1004]] of our God [[H430]] by [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of Meremoth [[H4822]] the son [[H1121]] of Uriah [[H223]] the priest; [[H3548]] and with [[H5973]] him Eleazar [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Phinehas; [[H6372]] and with [[H5973]] them Jozabad [[H3107]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeshua, [[H3442]] and Noadiah [[H5129]] the son [[H1121]] of Binnui, [[H1131]] Levites; [[H3881]]

### 34
By number [[H4557]] by weight [[H4948]] of every one: [[H3605]] and all [[H3605]] the weight [[H4948]] was written [[H3789]] at that [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

### 35
the children [[H1121]] of those that had been carried away, [[H1473]] which were come out [[H935]] of the captivity, [[H7628]] offered [[H7126]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] unto the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] twelve [[H8147]] bullocks [[H6499]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] ninety [[H8673]] and six [[H8337]] rams, [[H352]] seventy [[H7657]] and seven [[H7651]] lambs, [[H3532]] twelve [[H8147]] he goats [[H6842]] a sin offering: [[H2403]] all [[H3605]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 36
And they delivered [[H5414]] the king's [[H4428]] commissions [[H1881]] unto the king's [[H4428]] lieutenants, [[H323]] and to the governors [[H6346]] on this side [[H5676]] the river: [[H5104]] and they furthered [[H5375]] the people, [[H5971]] and the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]
