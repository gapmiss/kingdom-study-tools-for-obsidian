At the same time [[H2166]] came [[H858]] to [[H5922]] them Tatnai, [[H8674]] governor [[H6347]] on this side [[H5675]] the river, [[H5103]] and Shethar-boznai, [[H8370]] and their companions, [[H3675]] and said [[H560]] thus [[H3652]] unto them, Who [[H4479]] hath commanded [[H7761]] you to build [[H1124]] this [[H1836]] house, [[H1005]] and to make up [[H3635]] this [[H1836]] wall? [[H846]]

### 4
Then [[H116]] said [[H560]] we unto them after this manner, [[H3660]] What [[H4479]] are [[H581]] the names [[H8036]] of the men [[H1400]] that [[H1768]] make [[H1124]] this [[H1836]] building? [[H1147]]

### 5
But the eye [[H5870]] of their God [[H426]] was [[H1934]] upon [[H5922]] the elders [[H7868]] of the Jews, [[H3062]] that they could not [[H3809]] cause them [[H1994]] to cease, [[H989]] till [[H5705]] the matter [[H2941]] came [[H1946]] to Darius: [[H1868]] and then [[H116]] they returned answer [[H8421]] by letter [[H5407]] concerning [[H5922]] this [[H1836]]

### 6
The copy [[H6573]] of the letter [[H104]] that [[H1768]] Tatnai, [[H8674]] governor [[H6347]] on this side [[H5675]] the river, [[H5103]] and Shethar-boznai, [[H8370]] and his companions [[H3675]] the Apharsachites, [[H671]] which [[H1768]] on this side [[H5675]] the river, [[H5103]] sent [[H7972]] unto [[H5922]] Darius [[H1868]] the king: [[H4430]]

### 7
They sent [[H7972]] a letter [[H6600]] unto [[H5922]] him, wherein [[H1459]] was written [[H3790]] thus; [[H1836]] Unto Darius [[H1868]] the king, [[H4430]] all [[H3606]] peace. [[H8001]]

### 8
Be known [[H1934]]  it [[H3046]] unto the king, [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] we went [[H236]] into the province [[H4083]] of Judea, [[H3061]] to the house [[H1005]] of the great [[H7229]] God, [[H426]] which [[H1932]] is builded [[H1124]] with great [[H1560]] stones, [[H69]] and timber [[H636]] is laid [[H7761]] in the walls, [[H3797]] and this [[H1791]] work [[H5673]] goeth [[H5648]] fast on, [[H629]] and prospereth [[H6744]] in their hands. [[H3028]]

### 9
Then [[H116]] asked [[H7593]] we those [[H479]] elders, [[H7868]] said [[H560]] unto them thus, [[H3660]] Who [[H4479]] commanded [[H7761]] you to build [[H1124]] this [[H1836]] house, [[H1005]] and to make up [[H3635]] these [[H1836]] walls? [[H846]]

### 10
We asked [[H7593]] their names [[H8036]] also, [[H638]] to certify [[H3046]] thee, that [[H1768]] we might write [[H3790]] the names [[H8036]] of the men [[H1400]] that [[H1768]] the chief [[H7217]] of them. [[H7217]]

### 11
And thus [[H3660]] they returned [[H8421]] us answer, [[H6600]] saying, [[H560]] We [[H586]] are [[H1994]] the servants [[H5649]] of [[H1768]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] and earth, [[H772]] and build [[H1124]] the house [[H1005]] that [[H1768]] was [[H1934]] builded [[H1124]] these [[H1836]] many [[H7690]] years [[H8140]] ago, [[H6928]] which a great [[H7229]] king [[H4430]] of Israel [[H3479]] builded [[H1124]] and set up. [[H3635]]

### 12
But [[H3861]] after [[H4481]] that [[H1768]] our fathers [[H2]] had provoked [[H7265]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] unto wrath, he gave [[H3052]] them [[H1994]] into the hand [[H3028]] of Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] the king [[H4430]] of Babylon, [[H895]] the Chaldean, [[H3679]] who destroyed [[H5642]] this [[H1836]] house, [[H1005]] and carried [[H1541]] the people [[H5972]] away into Babylon. [[H895]]

### 13
But [[H1297]] in the first [[H2298]] year [[H8140]] of Cyrus [[H3567]] the king [[H4430]] of [[H1768]] Babylon [[H895]] king [[H4430]] Cyrus [[H3567]] made [[H7761]] a decree [[H2942]] to build [[H1124]] this [[H1836]] house [[H1005]] of God. [[H426]]

### 14
And the vessels [[H3984]] also [[H638]] of [[H1768]] gold [[H1722]] and silver [[H3702]] of [[H1768]] the house [[H1005]] of God, [[H426]] which [[H1768]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] took [[H5312]] out of [[H4481]] the temple [[H1965]] that [[H1768]] in Jerusalem, [[H3390]] and brought [[H2987]] them [[H1994]] into the temple [[H1965]] of [[H1768]] Babylon, [[H895]] those [[H1994]] did Cyrus [[H3567]] the king [[H4430]] take [[H5312]] out of [[H4481]] the temple [[H1965]] of [[H1768]] Babylon, [[H895]] and they were delivered [[H3052]] unto whose name [[H8036]] Sheshbazzar, [[H8340]] whom [[H1768]] he had made [[H7761]] governor; [[H6347]]

### 15
And said [[H560]] unto him, Take [[H5376]] these [[H412]] vessels, [[H3984]] go, [[H236]] carry [[H5182]] them [[H1994]] into the temple [[H1965]] that [[H1768]] in Jerusalem, [[H3390]] and let the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] be builded [[H1124]] in [[H5922]] his place. [[H870]]

### 16
Then [[H116]] came [[H858]] the same [[H1791]] Sheshbazzar, [[H8340]] laid [[H3052]] the foundation [[H787]] of [[H1768]] the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] which [[H1768]] in Jerusalem: [[H3390]] and since [[H4481]] that time [[H116]] even until [[H5705]] now [[H3705]] hath it been in building, [[H1124]] and it is not [[H3809]] finished. [[H8000]]

### 17
Now [[H3705]] therefore, if [[H2006]] good [[H2869]] to [[H5922]] the king, [[H4430]] let there be search made [[H1240]] in the king's [[H4430]] treasure [[H1596]] house, [[H1005]] which [[H1768]] there [[H8536]] at Babylon, [[H895]] whether [[H2006]] it be [[H383]] that [[H1768]] a decree [[H2942]] was made [[H7761]] of [[H4481]] Cyrus [[H3567]] the king [[H4430]] to build [[H1124]] this [[H1791]] house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] at Jerusalem, [[H3390]] and let the king [[H4430]] send [[H7972]] his pleasure [[H7470]] to [[H5922]] us concerning [[H5922]] this matter.
