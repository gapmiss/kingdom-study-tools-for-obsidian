### 1
Now when Ezra [[H5830]] had prayed, [[H6419]] and when he had confessed, [[H3034]] weeping [[H1058]] and casting himself down [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] there assembled [[H6908]] unto [[H413]] him out of Israel [[H3478]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H7227]] congregation [[H6951]] of men [[H582]] and women [[H802]] and children: [[H3206]] for [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] wept [[H1058]] very [[H7235]] sore. [[H1059]]

### 2
And Shechaniah [[H7935]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehiel, [[H3171]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Elam, [[H5867]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto Ezra, [[H5830]] We [[H587]] have trespassed [[H4603]] against our God, [[H430]] and have taken [[H3427]] strange [[H5237]] wives [[H802]] of the people [[H5971]] of the land: [[H776]] yet now [[H6258]] there is [[H3426]] hope [[H4723]] in Israel [[H3478]] concerning [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] thing. [[H2063]]

### 3
Now [[H6258]] therefore let us make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with our God [[H430]] to put away [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] the wives, [[H802]] and such as are born [[H3205]] of them, according to the counsel [[H6098]] of my lord, [[H113]] and of those that tremble [[H2730]] at the commandment [[H4687]] of our God; [[H430]] and let it be done [[H6213]] according to the law. [[H8451]]

### 4
Arise; [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] matter [[H1697]] unto [[H5921]] thee: we [[H587]] also with [[H5973]] thee: be of good courage, [[H2388]] and do [[H6213]]

### 5
Then arose [[H6965]] Ezra, [[H5830]]  and made [[H853]] the chief [[H8269]] priests, [[H3548]] the Levites, [[H3881]] and all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] to swear [[H7650]] that they should do [[H6213]] according to this [[H2088]] word. [[H1697]] And they sware. [[H7650]]

### 6
Then Ezra [[H5830]] rose up [[H6965]] from before [[H6440]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and went [[H1980]] into [[H413]] the chamber [[H3957]] of Johanan [[H3076]] the son [[H1121]] of Eliashib: [[H475]] and he came [[H1980]] thither, [[H8033]] he did eat [[H398]] no [[H3808]] bread, [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water: [[H4325]] for [[H3588]] he mourned [[H56]] because [[H5921]] of the transgression [[H4604]] of them that had been carried away. [[H1473]]

### 7
And they made proclamation [[H5674]] throughout Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of the captivity, [[H1473]] that they should gather themselves together [[H6908]] unto Jerusalem; [[H3389]]

### 8
And that whosoever [[H3605]] would not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] within three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] according to the counsel [[H6098]] of the princes [[H8269]] and the elders, [[H2205]] all [[H3605]] his substance [[H7399]] should be forfeited, [[H2763]] and himself [[H1931]] separated [[H914]] from the congregation [[H6951]] of those that had been carried away. [[H1473]]

### 9
Then all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] gathered themselves together [[H6908]] unto Jerusalem [[H3389]] within three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]] It [[H1931]] the ninth [[H8671]] month, [[H2320]] on the twentieth [[H6242]] of the month; [[H2320]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] sat [[H3427]] in the street [[H7339]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] trembling [[H7460]] because [[H5921]] of matter, [[H1697]] and for the great rain. [[H1653]]

### 10
And Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] stood up, [[H6965]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Ye [[H859]] have transgressed, [[H4603]] and have taken [[H3427]] strange [[H5237]] wives, [[H802]] to increase [[H3254]] the trespass [[H819]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
Now [[H6258]] therefore make [[H5414]] confession [[H8426]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] and do [[H6213]] his pleasure: [[H7522]] and separate yourselves [[H914]] from the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and from [[H4480]] the strange [[H5237]] wives. [[H802]]

### 12
Then all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] As thou hast said, [[H1697]] so [[H3651]] must we do. [[H6213]]

### 13
But [[H61]] the people [[H5971]] many, [[H7227]] and a time [[H6256]] of much rain, [[H1653]] and we are not [[H369]] able [[H3581]] to stand [[H5975]] without, [[H2351]] neither [[H3808]] a work [[H4399]] of one [[H259]] day [[H3117]] or [[H3808]] two: [[H8147]] for [[H3588]] we are many [[H7235]] that have transgressed [[H6586]] in this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 14
Let now [[H4994]] our rulers [[H8269]] of all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] stand, [[H5975]] and let all [[H3605]] them which [[H834]] have taken [[H3427]] strange [[H5237]] wives [[H802]] in our cities [[H5892]] come [[H935]] at appointed [[H2163]] times, [[H6256]] and with [[H5973]] them the elders [[H2205]] of every city, [[H5892]] and the judges [[H8199]] thereof, until [[H5704]] the fierce [[H2740]] wrath [[H639]] of our God [[H430]] for [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] matter [[H1697]] be turned [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] us. [[H4480]]

### 15
Only [[H389]] Jonathan [[H3129]] the son [[H1121]] of Asahel [[H6214]] and Jahaziah [[H3167]] the son [[H1121]] of Tikvah [[H8616]] were employed [[H5975]] about [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] and Meshullam [[H4918]] and Shabbethai [[H7678]] the Levite [[H3881]] helped [[H5826]] them. [[H5826]]

### 16
And the children [[H1121]] of the captivity [[H1473]] did so. [[H6213]] And Ezra [[H5830]] the priest, [[H3548]] certain [[H376]] chief [[H7218]] of the fathers, [[H1]] after the house [[H1004]] of their fathers, [[H1]] and all [[H3605]] of them by names, [[H8034]] were separated, [[H914]] and sat down [[H3427]] in the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the tenth [[H6224]] month [[H2320]] to examine [[H1875]] the matter. [[H1697]]

### 17
And they made an end [[H3615]] with all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] that had taken [[H3427]] strange [[H5237]] wives [[H802]] by [[H5704]] the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month. [[H2320]]
