[[H4503]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 15
If [[H3588]] a soul [[H5315]] commit [[H4603]] a trespass, [[H4604]] and sin [[H2398]] through ignorance, [[H7684]] in the holy things [[H6944]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] then he shall bring [[H935]] for his trespass [[H817]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] a ram [[H352]] without blemish [[H8549]] out of [[H4480]] the flocks, [[H6629]] with thy estimation [[H6187]] by shekels [[H8255]] of silver, [[H3701]] after the shekel [[H8255]] of the sanctuary, [[H6944]] for a trespass offering: [[H817]]

### 16
And he shall make amends [[H7999]] for the harm [[H2398]] that he hath done [[H834]] in [[H4480]] the holy thing, [[H6944]] and shall add [[H3254]] the fifth part [[H2549]] thereto, [[H5921]] and give [[H5414]] it unto the priest: [[H3548]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] him with the ram [[H352]] of the trespass offering, [[H817]] and it shall be forgiven [[H5545]] him. [[H5545]]

### 17
And if [[H518]] a soul [[H5315]] sin, [[H2398]] and commit [[H6213]] any [[H259]] of these things [[H3605]] which [[H834]] are forbidden [[H3808]] to be done [[H6213]] by the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] though he wist [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] yet is he guilty, [[H816]] and shall bear [[H5375]] his iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 18
And he shall bring [[H935]] a ram [[H352]] without blemish [[H8549]] out of [[H4480]] the flock, [[H6629]] with thy estimation, [[H6187]] for a trespass offering, [[H817]] unto [[H413]] the priest: [[H3548]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] him concerning [[H5921]] his ignorance [[H7684]] wherein [[H834]] he erred [[H7683]] and wist [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] and it shall be forgiven [[H5545]] him. [[H5545]]

### 19
It [[H1931]] a trespass offering: [[H817]] he hath certainly [[H816]] trespassed [[H816]] against the Lord. [[H3068]]
