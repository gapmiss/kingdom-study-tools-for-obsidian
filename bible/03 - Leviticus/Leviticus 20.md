### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Again, thou shalt say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Whosoever [[H376]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] or of [[H4480]] the strangers [[H1616]] that sojourn [[H1481]] in Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H834]] giveth [[H5414]] of his seed [[H2233]] unto Molech; [[H4432]] he shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death: [[H4191]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] shall stone [[H7275]] him with stones. [[H68]]

### 3
And I [[H589]] will set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] against that [[H1931]] man, [[H376]] and will cut him off [[H3772]] from among [[H7130]] his people; [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] he hath given [[H5414]] of his seed [[H2233]] unto Molech, [[H4432]] to [[H4616]] defile [[H2930]] my sanctuary, [[H4720]] and to profane [[H2490]] my holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]]

### 4
And if [[H518]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] do any ways [[H5956]] hide [[H5956]] their eyes [[H5869]] from the man, [[H376]] when he giveth [[H5414]] of his seed [[H2233]] unto Molech, [[H4432]] and kill [[H4191]] him not: [[H1115]]

### 5
Then I [[H589]] will set [[H7760]] my face [[H6440]] against that [[H1931]] man, [[H376]] and against his family, [[H4940]] and will cut him off, [[H3772]] and all [[H3605]] that go a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] him, to commit whoredom [[H2181]] with [[H310]] Molech, [[H4432]] from among [[H7130]] their people. [[H5971]]

### 6
And the soul [[H5315]] that [[H834]] turneth [[H6437]] after [[H413]] such as have familiar spirits, [[H178]] and after [[H413]] wizards, [[H3049]] to go a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] them, I will even set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] against that [[H1931]] soul, [[H5315]] and will cut him off [[H3772]] from among [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 7
Sanctify yourselves [[H6942]] therefore, and be [[H1961]] ye holy: [[H6918]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 8
And ye shall keep [[H8104]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and do [[H6213]] them: I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] which sanctify [[H6942]] you. [[H6942]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] every [[H376]] one [[H376]] that [[H834]] curseth [[H7043]] his father [[H1]] or his mother [[H517]] shall be surely [[H4191]] put to death: [[H4191]] he hath cursed [[H7043]] his father [[H1]] or his mother; [[H517]] his blood [[H1818]] upon him. [[H1818]]

### 10
And the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] committeth adultery [[H5003]] with [[H854]] man's [[H376]] wife, [[H802]] that [[H834]] committeth adultery [[H5003]] with [[H854]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife, [[H802]] the adulterer [[H5003]] and the adulteress [[H5003]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 11
And the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] lieth [[H7901]] with [[H854]] his father's [[H1]] wife [[H802]] hath uncovered [[H1540]] his father's [[H1]] nakedness: [[H6172]] both [[H8147]] of them shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death; [[H4191]] their blood [[H1818]] upon them. [[H1818]]

### 12
And if [[H834]] a man [[H376]] lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] his daughter in law, [[H3618]] both [[H8147]] of them shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death: [[H4191]] they have wrought [[H6213]] confusion; [[H8397]] their blood [[H1818]] upon them. [[H1818]]

### 13
If [[H834]] a man [[H376]] also lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] mankind, [[H2145]] as he lieth [[H4904]] with a woman, [[H802]] both [[H8147]] of them have committed [[H6213]] an abomination: [[H8441]] they shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death; [[H4191]] their blood [[H1818]] upon them. [[H1818]]

### 14
And if [[H834]] a man [[H376]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] and her mother, [[H517]] it [[H1931]] wickedness: [[H2154]] they shall be burnt [[H8313]] with fire, [[H784]] both he and they; that there be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] wickedness [[H2154]] among [[H8432]] you. [[H8432]]

### 15
And if [[H834]] a man [[H376]] lie [[H5414]] with a beast, [[H929]] he shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death: [[H4191]] and ye shall slay [[H2026]] the beast. [[H929]]

### 16
And if [[H834]] a woman [[H802]] approach [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] any [[H3605]] beast, [[H929]] and lie down [[H7250]] thereto, thou shalt kill [[H2026]] the woman, [[H802]] and the beast: [[H929]] they shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death; [[H4191]] their blood [[H1818]] upon them. [[H1818]]

### 17
And if [[H834]] a man [[H376]] shall take [[H3947]] his sister, [[H269]] his father's [[H1]] daughter, [[H1323]] or [[H176]] his mother's [[H517]] daughter, [[H1323]] and see [[H7200]] her nakedness, [[H6172]] and she [[H1931]] see [[H7200]] his nakedness; [[H6172]] it [[H1931]] a wicked thing; [[H2617]] and they shall be cut off [[H3772]] in the sight [[H5869]] of their people: [[H5971]] he hath uncovered [[H1540]] his sister's [[H269]] nakedness; [[H6172]] he shall bear [[H5375]] his iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 18
And if [[H834]] a man [[H376]] shall lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] a woman [[H802]] having her sickness, [[H1739]] and shall uncover [[H1540]] her nakedness; [[H6172]] he hath discovered [[H6168]] her fountain, [[H4726]] and she [[H1931]] hath uncovered [[H1540]] the fountain [[H4726]] of her blood: [[H1818]] and both [[H8147]] of them shall be cut off [[H3772]] from among [[H7130]] their people. [[H5971]]

### 19
And thou shalt not [[H3808]] uncover [[H1540]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of thy mother's [[H517]] sister, [[H269]] nor of thy father's [[H1]] sister: [[H269]] for [[H3588]] he uncovereth [[H6168]] his near kin: [[H7607]] they shall bear [[H5375]] their iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 20
And if [[H834]] a man [[H376]] shall lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] his uncle's wife, [[H1733]] he hath uncovered [[H1540]] his uncle's [[H1730]] nakedness: [[H6172]] they shall bear [[H5375]] their sin; [[H2399]] they shall die [[H4191]] childless. [[H6185]]

### 21
And if [[H834]] a man [[H376]] shall take [[H3947]] his brother's [[H251]] wife, [[H802]] it [[H1931]] an unclean thing: [[H5079]] he hath uncovered [[H1540]] his brother's [[H251]] nakedness; [[H6172]] they shall be [[H1961]] childless. [[H6185]]

### 22
Ye shall therefore keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and all [[H3605]] my judgments, [[H4941]] and do [[H6213]] them: that the land, [[H776]] whither [[H834]] I [[H589]] bring [[H935]] you to dwell [[H3427]] therein, spue you not out. [[H6958]]

### 23
And ye shall not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in the manners [[H2708]] of the nation, [[H1471]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] cast out [[H7971]] before [[H6440]] you: for [[H3588]] they committed [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these things, [[H428]] and therefore I abhorred [[H6973]] them. [[H6973]]

### 24
But I have said [[H559]] unto you, Ye [[H859]] shall inherit [[H3423]] their land, [[H127]] and I [[H589]] will give [[H5414]] it unto you to possess [[H3423]] it, a land [[H776]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey: [[H1706]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] have separated [[H914]] you from [[H4480]] people. [[H5971]]

### 25
Ye shall therefore put difference [[H914]] between [[H996]] clean [[H2889]] beasts [[H929]] and unclean, [[H2931]] and between [[H996]] unclean [[H2931]] fowls [[H5775]] and clean: [[H2889]] and ye shall not [[H3808]] make your souls [[H5315]] abominable [[H8262]] by beast, [[H929]] or by fowl, [[H5775]] or by any manner [[H3605]] of living thing that creepeth [[H7430]] on the ground, [[H127]] which [[H834]] I have separated [[H914]] from you as unclean. [[H2930]]

### 26
And ye shall be [[H1961]] holy [[H6918]] unto me: for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] holy, [[H6918]] and have severed [[H914]] you from [[H4480]] people, [[H5971]] that ye should be [[H1961]] mine. [[H1961]]

### 27
A man [[H376]] also or [[H176]] woman [[H802]] that hath [[H3588]] a familiar spirit, [[H178]] or [[H176]] that is a wizard, [[H3049]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death: [[H4191]] they shall stone [[H7275]] them with stones: [[H68]] their blood [[H1818]] upon them. [[H1818]]
