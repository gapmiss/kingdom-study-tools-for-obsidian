And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] If [[H3588]] a woman [[H802]] have conceived seed, [[H2232]] and born [[H3205]] a man child: [[H2145]] then she shall be unclean [[H2930]] seven [[H7651]] days; [[H3117]] according to the days [[H3117]] of the separation [[H5079]] for her infirmity [[H1738]] shall she be unclean. [[H2930]]

### 3
And in the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] the flesh [[H1320]] of his foreskin [[H6190]] shall be circumcised. [[H4135]]

### 4
And she shall then continue [[H3427]] in the blood [[H1818]] of her purifying [[H2893]] three [[H7969]] and thirty [[H7970]] days; [[H3117]] she shall touch [[H5060]] no [[H3808]] hallowed thing, [[H6944]] nor [[H3808]] come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the sanctuary, [[H4720]] until [[H5704]] the days [[H3117]] of her purifying [[H2893]] be fulfilled. [[H4390]]

### 5
But if [[H518]] she bear [[H3205]] a maid child, [[H5347]] then she shall be unclean [[H2930]] two weeks, [[H7620]] as in her separation: [[H5079]] and she shall continue [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the blood [[H1818]] of her purifying [[H2893]] threescore [[H8346]] and six [[H8337]] days. [[H3117]]

### 6
And when the days [[H3117]] of her purifying [[H2893]] are fulfilled, [[H4390]] for a son, [[H1121]] or [[H176]] for a daughter, [[H1323]] she shall bring [[H935]] a lamb [[H3532]] of the first [[H1121]] year [[H8141]] for a burnt offering, [[H5930]] and a young [[H1121]] pigeon, [[H3123]] or [[H176]] a turtledove, [[H8449]] for a sin offering, [[H2403]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] unto [[H413]] the priest: [[H3548]]

### 7
Who shall offer [[H7126]] it before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] her; and she shall be cleansed [[H2891]] from the issue [[H4726]] of her blood. [[H1818]] This [[H2063]] the law [[H8451]] for her that hath born [[H3205]] a male [[H2145]] or [[H176]] a female. [[H5347]]

### 8
And if [[H518]] she be not [[H3808]] able to bring [[H1767]] a lamb, [[H7716]] then she shall bring [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] turtles, [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons; [[H3123]] the one [[H259]] for the burnt offering, [[H5930]] and the other [[H259]] for a sin offering: [[H2403]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] her, and she shall be clean.
