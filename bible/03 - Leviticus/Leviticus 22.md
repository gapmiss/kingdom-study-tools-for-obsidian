### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and to [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] that they separate themselves [[H5144]] from the holy things [[H6944]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and that they profane [[H2490]] not [[H3808]] my holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] hallow [[H6942]] unto me: I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
Say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Whosoever [[H376]] of all [[H3605]] your seed [[H2233]] among your generations, [[H1755]] that [[H834]] goeth [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] the holy things, [[H6944]] which [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] hallow [[H6942]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] having his uncleanness [[H2932]] upon [[H5921]] him, that [[H1931]] soul [[H5315]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from my presence: [[H6440]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
What man soever [[H376]] of the seed [[H2233]] of Aaron [[H175]] a leper, [[H6879]] or [[H176]] hath a running issue; [[H2100]] he shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of the holy things, [[H6944]] until [[H5704]] he be clean. [[H2891]] And whoso toucheth [[H5060]] any thing [[H3605]] unclean [[H2931]] the dead, [[H5315]] or [[H176]] a man [[H376]] whose [[H834]] seed [[H2233]] goeth [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] him; [[H4480]]

### 5
Or [[H176]] whosoever [[H376]] toucheth [[H5060]] any [[H3605]] creeping thing, [[H8318]] whereby [[H834]] he may be made unclean, [[H2930]] or [[H176]] a man [[H120]] of whom [[H834]] he may take uncleanness, [[H2930]] whatsoever [[H3605]] uncleanness [[H2932]] he hath; [[H2932]]

### 6
The soul [[H5315]] which [[H834]] hath touched [[H5060]] any such shall be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] even, [[H6153]] and shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of [[H4480]] the holy things, [[H6944]] unless [[H518]] he wash [[H7364]] his flesh [[H1320]] with water. [[H4325]]

### 7
And when the sun [[H8121]] is down, [[H935]] he shall be clean, [[H2891]] and shall afterward [[H310]] eat [[H398]] of [[H4480]] the holy things; [[H6944]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] his food. [[H3899]]

### 8
That which dieth of itself, [[H5038]] or is torn [[H2966]] he shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] to defile [[H2930]] himself therewith: I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
They shall therefore keep [[H8104]] mine ordinance, [[H4931]] lest [[H3808]] they bear [[H5375]] sin [[H2399]] for [[H5921]] it, and die [[H4191]] therefore, if [[H3588]] they profane [[H2490]] it: I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] do sanctify [[H6942]] them. [[H6942]]

### 10
There shall no [[H3808]] stranger [[H2114]] eat [[H398]] the holy thing: [[H6944]] a sojourner [[H8453]] of the priest, [[H3548]] or an hired servant, [[H7916]] shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the holy thing. [[H6944]]

### 11
But if [[H3588]] the priest [[H3548]] buy [[H7069]] soul [[H5315]] with [[H7075]] his money, [[H3701]] he [[H1931]] shall eat [[H398]] of it, and he that is born [[H3211]] in his house: [[H1004]] they [[H1992]] shall eat [[H398]] of his meat. [[H3899]]

### 12
If [[H3588]] the priest's [[H3548]] daughter [[H1323]] also be [[H1961]] unto a stranger, [[H376]] she [[H1931]] may not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of an offering [[H8641]] of the holy things. [[H6944]]

### 13
But if [[H3588]] the priest's [[H3548]] daughter [[H1323]] be [[H1961]] a widow, [[H490]] or divorced, [[H1644]] and have no [[H369]] child, [[H2233]] and is returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] her father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] as in her youth, [[H5271]] she shall eat [[H398]] of her father's [[H1]] meat: [[H3899]] but there shall no [[H3605]] stranger [[H2114]] eat [[H398]] thereof. [[H398]]

### 14
And if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] eat [[H398]] the holy thing [[H6944]] unwittingly, [[H7684]] then he shall put [[H3254]] the fifth [[H2549]] thereof unto [[H5921]] it, and shall give [[H5414]] unto the priest [[H3548]] with the holy thing. [[H6944]]

### 15
And they shall not [[H3808]] profane [[H2490]] the holy things [[H6944]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] they offer [[H7311]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]]

### 16
Or suffer them to bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of trespass, [[H819]] when they eat [[H398]] their holy things: [[H6944]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] do sanctify [[H6942]] them. [[H6942]]

### 17
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] and to [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Whatsoever [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] or of [[H4480]] the strangers [[H1616]] in Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H834]] will offer [[H7126]] his oblation [[H7133]] for all [[H3605]] his vows, [[H5088]] and for all [[H3605]] his freewill offerings, [[H5071]] which [[H834]] they will offer [[H7126]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] for a burnt offering; [[H5930]]

### 19
at your own will [[H7522]] a male [[H2145]] without blemish, [[H8549]] of the beeves, [[H1241]] of the sheep, [[H3775]] or of the goats. [[H5795]]

### 20
whatsoever [[H3605]] hath a blemish, [[H3971]] shall ye not [[H3808]] offer: [[H7126]] for [[H3588]] it shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] acceptable [[H7522]] for you. [[H7522]]

### 21
And whosoever [[H376]] offereth [[H7126]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] of peace offerings [[H8002]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] to accomplish [[H6381]] vow, [[H5088]] or [[H176]] a freewill offering [[H5071]] in beeves [[H1241]] or [[H176]] sheep, [[H6629]] it shall be [[H1961]] perfect [[H8549]] to be accepted; [[H7522]] there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] blemish [[H3971]] therein. [[H3971]]

### 22
Blind, [[H5788]] or [[H176]] broken, [[H7665]] or [[H176]] maimed, [[H2782]] or [[H176]] having a wen, [[H2990]] or [[H176]] scurvy, [[H1618]] or [[H176]] scabbed, [[H3217]] ye shall not [[H3808]] offer [[H7126]] these [[H428]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] nor [[H3808]] make [[H5414]] an offering by fire [[H801]] of them upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
Either a bullock [[H7794]] or a lamb [[H7716]] that hath any thing superfluous [[H8311]] or lacking in his parts, [[H7038]] that mayest thou offer [[H6213]] a freewill offering; [[H5071]] but for a vow [[H5088]] it shall not [[H3808]] be accepted. [[H7521]]

### 24
Ye shall not [[H3808]] offer [[H7126]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] that which is bruised, [[H4600]] or crushed, [[H3807]] or broken, [[H5423]] or cut; [[H3772]] neither [[H3808]] shall ye make [[H6213]] in your land. [[H776]]

### 25
Neither [[H3808]] from a stranger's [[H5236]] hand [[H3027]] shall ye offer [[H7126]] the bread [[H3899]] of your God [[H430]] of any [[H3605]] of these; [[H428]] because [[H3588]] their corruption [[H4893]] in them, blemishes [[H3971]] in them: they shall not [[H3808]] be accepted [[H7521]] for you. [[H7521]]

### 26
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 27
When [[H3588]] a bullock, [[H7794]] or [[H176]] a sheep, [[H3775]] or [[H176]] a goat, [[H5795]] is brought forth, [[H3205]] then it shall be [[H1961]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] under [[H8478]] the dam; [[H517]] and from the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] and thenceforth [[H1973]] it shall be accepted [[H7521]] for an offering [[H7133]] made by fire [[H801]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 28
And cow [[H7794]] or [[H176]] ewe, [[H7716]] ye shall not [[H3808]] kill [[H7819]] it and her young [[H1121]] both in one [[H259]] day. [[H3117]]

### 29
And when [[H3588]] ye will offer [[H2076]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] of thanksgiving [[H8426]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] offer [[H2076]] at your own will. [[H7522]]

On the same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] it shall be eaten up; [[H398]] ye shall leave [[H3498]] none [[H3808]] of [[H4480]] it until [[H5704]] the morrow: [[H1242]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 31
Therefore shall ye keep [[H8104]] my commandments, [[H4687]] and do [[H6213]] them: I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 32
Neither [[H3808]] shall ye profane [[H2490]] my holy [[H6944]] name; [[H8034]] but I will be hallowed [[H6942]] among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] which hallow [[H6942]] you, [[H6942]]

### 33
That brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] to be [[H1961]] your God: [[H430]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
