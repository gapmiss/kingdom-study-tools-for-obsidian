### 1
And Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu, [[H30]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] took [[H3947]] either [[H376]] of them his censer, [[H4289]] and put [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] therein, [[H2004]] and put [[H7760]] incense [[H7004]] thereon, [[H5921]] and offered [[H7126]] strange [[H2114]] fire [[H784]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 2
And there went out [[H3318]] fire [[H784]] from [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and devoured [[H398]] them, and they died [[H4191]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] This [[H1931]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake, [[H1696]] saying, [[H559]] I will be sanctified [[H6942]] in them that come nigh [[H7138]] me, and before [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] I will be glorified. [[H3513]] And Aaron [[H175]] held his peace. [[H1826]]

### 4
And Moses [[H4872]] called [[H7121]] Mishael [[H4332]] and Elzaphan, [[H469]] the sons [[H1121]] of Uzziel [[H5816]] the uncle [[H1730]] of Aaron, [[H175]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Come near, [[H7126]] carry [[H5375]] your brethren [[H251]] from [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the sanctuary [[H6944]] out [[H2351]] of [[H413]] the camp. [[H4264]]

### 5
So they went near, [[H7126]] and carried [[H5375]] them in their coats [[H3801]] out [[H2351]] of [[H413]] the camp; [[H4264]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had said. [[H1696]]

### 6
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] and unto Eleazar [[H499]] and unto Ithamar, [[H385]] his sons, [[H1121]] Uncover [[H6544]] not [[H408]] your heads, [[H7218]] neither [[H3808]] rend [[H6533]] your clothes; [[H899]] lest [[H3808]] ye die, [[H4191]] and lest wrath come [[H7107]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people: [[H5712]] but let your brethren, [[H251]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] bewail [[H1058]] the burning [[H8316]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath kindled. [[H8313]]

### 7
And ye shall not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] from the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] lest [[H6435]] ye die: [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H5921]] you. And they did [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Moses. [[H4872]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] saying, [[H559]]

### 9
Do not [[H408]] drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] nor strong drink, [[H7941]] thou, [[H859]] nor thy sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] thee, when ye go [[H935]] into [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] lest [[H3808]] ye die: [[H4191]] a statute [[H2708]] for ever [[H5769]] throughout your generations: [[H1755]]

### 10
And that ye may put difference [[H914]] between [[H996]] holy [[H6944]] and unholy, [[H2455]] and between [[H996]] unclean [[H2931]] and clean; [[H2889]]

### 11
And that ye may teach [[H3384]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the statutes [[H2706]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]

### 12
And Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] and unto [[H413]] Eleazar [[H499]] and unto [[H413]] Ithamar, [[H385]] his sons [[H1121]] that were left, [[H3498]] Take [[H3947]] the meat offering [[H4503]] that remaineth [[H3498]] of the offerings [[H801]] of the Lord [[H3068]] made by fire, and eat [[H398]] it without leaven [[H4682]] beside [[H681]] the altar: [[H4196]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy: [[H6944]]

### 13
And ye shall eat [[H398]] it in the holy [[H6918]] place, [[H4725]] because [[H3588]] it thy due, [[H2706]] and thy sons' [[H1121]] due, [[H2706]] of the sacrifices [[H801]] of the Lord [[H3068]] made by fire: for [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] I am commanded. [[H6680]]

### 14
And the wave [[H8573]] breast [[H2373]] and heave [[H8641]] shoulder [[H7785]] shall ye eat [[H398]] in a clean [[H2889]] place; [[H4725]] thou, [[H859]] and thy sons, [[H1121]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] with [[H854]] thee: for [[H3588]] thy due, [[H2706]] and thy sons' [[H1121]] due, [[H2706]] are given [[H5414]] out of the sacrifices [[H2077]] of peace offerings [[H8002]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
The heave [[H8641]] shoulder [[H7785]] and the wave [[H8573]] breast [[H2373]] shall they bring [[H935]] with [[H5921]] the offerings made by fire [[H801]] of the fat, [[H2459]] to wave [[H5130]] a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and it shall be [[H1961]] thine, and thy sons' [[H1121]] with [[H854]] thee, by a statute [[H2706]] for ever; [[H5769]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath commanded. [[H6680]]

### 16
And Moses [[H4872]] diligently [[H1875]] sought [[H1875]] the goat [[H8163]] of the sin offering, [[H2403]] and, behold, [[H2009]] it was burnt: [[H8313]] and he was angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] Eleazar [[H499]] and Ithamar, [[H385]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] left [[H3498]] saying, [[H559]]

### 17
Wherefore [[H4069]] have ye not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] the sin offering [[H2403]] in the holy [[H6944]] place, [[H4725]] seeing [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy, [[H6944]] and hath given [[H5414]] it you to bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the congregation, [[H5712]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] them before [[H6440]] the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 18
Behold, [[H2005]] the blood [[H1818]] of it was not [[H3808]] brought in [[H935]] within [[H6441]] the holy [[H6944]] ye should indeed [[H398]] have eaten [[H398]] it in the holy [[H6944]] as [[H834]] I commanded. [[H6680]]

### 19
And Aaron [[H175]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Behold, [[H2005]] this day [[H3117]] have they offered [[H7126]] their sin offering [[H2403]] and their burnt offering [[H5930]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and such things [[H428]] have befallen [[H7122]] me: and I had eaten [[H398]] the sin offering [[H2403]] to day, [[H3117]] should it have been accepted [[H3190]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 20
And when Moses [[H4872]] heard [[H8085]] he was content. [[H3190]]
