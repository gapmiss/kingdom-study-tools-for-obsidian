### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, When [[H3588]] ye come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] give [[H5414]] you, then shall the land [[H776]] keep [[H7673]] a sabbath [[H7676]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
Six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] thou shalt sow [[H2232]] thy field, [[H7704]] and six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] thou shalt prune [[H2168]] thy vineyard, [[H3754]] and gather in [[H622]] the fruit [[H8393]] thereof; [[H8393]]

### 4
But in the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] shall be [[H1961]] a sabbath [[H7676]] of rest [[H7677]] unto the land, [[H776]] a sabbath [[H7676]] for the Lord: [[H3068]] thou shalt neither [[H3808]] sow [[H2232]] thy field, [[H7704]] nor [[H3808]] prune [[H2168]] thy vineyard. [[H3754]]

### 5
That which groweth of its own accord [[H5599]] of thy harvest [[H7105]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] reap, [[H7114]] neither [[H3808]] gather [[H1219]] the grapes [[H6025]] of thy vine undressed: [[H5139]] it is [[H1961]] a year [[H8141]] of rest [[H7677]] unto the land. [[H776]]

### 6
And the sabbath [[H7676]] of the land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] meat [[H402]] for you; for thee, and for thy servant, [[H5650]] and for thy maid, [[H519]] and for thy hired servant, [[H7916]] and for thy stranger [[H8453]] that sojourneth [[H1481]] with [[H5973]] thee, [[H5973]]

### 7
And for thy cattle, [[H929]] and for the beast [[H2416]] that [[H834]] in thy land, [[H776]] shall all [[H3605]] the increase [[H8393]] thereof be [[H1961]] meat. [[H398]]

### 8
And thou shalt number [[H5608]] seven [[H7651]] sabbaths [[H7676]] of years [[H8141]] unto thee, seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] seven [[H7651]] years; [[H8141]] and the space [[H3117]] of the seven [[H7651]] sabbaths [[H7676]] of years [[H8141]] shall be [[H1961]] unto thee forty [[H705]] and nine [[H8672]] years. [[H8141]]

### 9
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet [[H7782]] of the jubile [[H8643]] to sound [[H5674]] on the tenth [[H6218]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] in the day [[H3117]] of atonement [[H3725]] shall ye make the trumpet [[H7782]] sound [[H5674]] throughout all [[H3605]] your land. [[H776]]

### 10
And ye shall hallow [[H6942]] the fiftieth [[H2572]] year, [[H8141]] and proclaim [[H7121]] liberty [[H1865]] throughout the land [[H776]] unto all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof: it [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] a jubile [[H3104]] unto you; and ye shall return [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] unto [[H413]] his possession, [[H272]] and ye shall return [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] unto [[H413]] his family. [[H4940]]

### 11
A jubile [[H3104]] shall that [[H1931]] fiftieth [[H2572]] year [[H8141]] be [[H1961]] unto you: ye shall not [[H3808]] sow, [[H2232]] neither [[H3808]] reap [[H7114]] that [[H854]] which groweth [[H5599]] of itself in it, nor [[H3808]] gather [[H1219]]  in it [[H853]] of thy vine undressed. [[H5139]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] the jubile; [[H3104]] it shall be [[H1961]] holy [[H6944]] unto you: ye shall eat [[H398]] the increase [[H8393]] thereof out of [[H4480]] the field. [[H7704]]

### 13
In the year [[H8141]] of this [[H2063]] jubile [[H3104]] ye shall return [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] unto [[H413]] his possession. [[H272]]

### 14
And if [[H3588]] thou sell [[H4376]] ought [[H4465]] unto thy neighbour, [[H5997]] or [[H176]] buyest [[H7069]] of thy neighbour's [[H5997]] hand, [[H3027]] ye shall not [[H408]] oppress [[H3238]] one [[H376]] another: [[H251]]

### 15
According to the number [[H4557]] of years [[H8141]] after [[H310]] the jubile [[H3104]] thou shalt buy [[H7069]] of [[H853]] thy neighbour, [[H5997]] according unto the number [[H4557]] of years [[H8141]] of the fruits [[H8393]] he shall sell [[H4376]] unto thee: [[H4376]]

### 16
According to [[H6310]] the multitude [[H7230]] of years [[H8141]] thou shalt increase [[H7235]] the price [[H4736]] thereof, and according to [[H6310]] the fewness [[H4591]] of years [[H8141]] thou shalt diminish [[H4591]] the price [[H4736]] of it: for [[H3588]] to the number [[H4557]] of the fruits [[H8393]] doth he [[H1931]] sell [[H4376]] unto thee. [[H4376]]

### 17
Ye shall not [[H3808]] therefore oppress [[H3238]] one [[H376]] another; [[H5997]] but thou shalt fear [[H3372]] thy God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 18
Wherefore ye shall do [[H6213]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and keep [[H8104]] my judgments, [[H4941]] and do [[H6213]] them; and ye shall dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] in safety. [[H983]]

### 19
And the land [[H776]] shall yield [[H5414]] her fruit, [[H6529]] and ye shall eat [[H398]] your fill, [[H7648]] and dwell [[H3427]] therein [[H5921]] in safety. [[H983]]

### 20
And if [[H3588]] ye shall say, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall we eat [[H398]] the seventh [[H7637]] year? [[H8141]] behold, [[H2005]] we shall not [[H3808]] sow, [[H2232]] nor [[H3808]] gather in [[H622]] our increase: [[H8393]]

### 21
Then I will command [[H6680]] my blessing [[H1293]] upon you in the sixth [[H8345]] year, [[H8141]] and it shall bring forth [[H6213]] fruit [[H8393]] for three [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]]

### 22
And ye shall sow [[H2232]]  the [[H853]] eighth [[H8066]] year, [[H8141]] and eat [[H398]] of [[H4480]] old [[H3465]] fruit [[H8393]] until [[H5704]] the ninth [[H8671]] year; [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] her fruits [[H8393]] come in [[H935]] ye shall eat [[H398]] the old [[H3465]]

### 23
The land [[H776]] shall not [[H3808]] be sold [[H4376]] for ever: [[H6783]] for [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] mine; for [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] strangers [[H1616]] and sojourners [[H8453]] with me. [[H8453]]

### 24
And in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of your possession [[H272]] ye shall grant [[H5414]] a redemption [[H1353]] for the land. [[H776]]

### 25
If [[H3588]] thy brother [[H251]] be waxen poor, [[H4134]] and hath sold away [[H4376]] of his possession, [[H272]] and if any of his kin [[H7138]] come [[H935]] to redeem [[H1350]] it, then shall he redeem [[H1350]] that which his brother [[H251]] sold. [[H4465]]

### 26
And if [[H3588]] the man [[H376]] have [[H1961]] none to redeem [[H1350]] it, and himself [[H3027]] be able [[H1767]] to redeem [[H4672]]  it; [[H1353]]

### 27
Then let him count [[H2803]] the years [[H8141]] of the sale [[H4465]] thereof, and restore [[H7725]] the overplus [[H5736]] unto the man [[H376]] to whom [[H834]] he sold [[H4376]] it; that he may return [[H7725]] unto his possession. [[H272]]

### 28
But if [[H518]] he [[H3027]] be not able [[H1767]] to restore [[H4672]] to him, then that which is sold [[H4465]] shall remain [[H1961]] in the hand [[H3027]] of him that hath bought [[H7069]] it until [[H5704]] the year [[H8141]] of jubile: [[H3104]] and in the jubile [[H3104]] it shall go out, [[H3318]] and he shall return [[H7725]] unto his possession. [[H272]]

### 29
And if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] sell [[H4376]] a dwelling [[H4186]] house [[H1004]] in a walled [[H2346]] city, [[H5892]] then he may redeem [[H1353]] it within [[H5704]] a whole [[H8552]] year [[H8141]] after it is sold; [[H4465]] a full year [[H3117]] may he redeem [[H1353]] it. [[H1961]]

### 30
And if [[H518]] it be not [[H3808]] redeemed [[H1350]] within [[H5704]] the space [[H4390]] of a full [[H8549]] year, [[H8141]] then the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] in the walled [[H2346]] city [[H5892]] shall be established [[H6965]] for ever [[H6783]] to him that bought [[H7069]] it throughout his generations: [[H1755]] it shall not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] in the jubile. [[H3104]]

### 31
But the houses [[H1004]] of the villages [[H2691]] which [[H834]] have no [[H369]] wall [[H2346]] round about [[H5439]] them shall be counted [[H2803]] as [[H5921]] the fields [[H7704]] of the country: [[H776]] they may be [[H1961]] redeemed, [[H1353]] and they shall go out [[H3318]] in the jubile. [[H3104]]

### 32
Notwithstanding the cities [[H5892]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] the houses [[H1004]] of the cities [[H5892]] of their possession, [[H272]] may the Levites [[H3881]] redeem [[H1353]] at any time. [[H5769]]

### 33
And if a man [[H834]] purchase [[H1350]] of [[H4480]] the Levites, [[H3881]] then the house [[H1004]] that was sold, [[H4465]] and the city [[H5892]] of his possession, [[H272]] shall go out [[H3318]] in jubile: [[H3104]] for [[H3588]] the houses [[H1004]] of the cities [[H5892]] of the Levites [[H3881]] their possession [[H272]] among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 34
But the field [[H7704]] of the suburbs [[H4054]] of their cities [[H5892]] may not [[H3808]] be sold; [[H4376]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] their perpetual [[H5769]] possession. [[H272]]

### 35
And if [[H3588]] thy brother [[H251]] be waxen poor, [[H4134]] and fallen in decay [[H4131]] with [[H5973]] thee; [[H3027]] then thou shalt relieve [[H2388]] him: a stranger, [[H1616]] or a sojourner; [[H8453]] that he may live [[H2421]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 36
Take [[H3947]] thou no [[H408]] usury [[H5392]] of [[H853]] him, or increase: [[H8636]] but fear [[H3372]] thy God; [[H430]] that thy brother [[H251]] may live [[H2421]] with thee. [[H5973]]

### 37
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] thy money [[H3701]] upon usury, [[H5392]] nor [[H3808]] lend [[H5414]] him thy victuals [[H400]] for increase. [[H4768]]

### 38
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] brought you forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] to give [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] to be [[H1961]] your God. [[H430]]

### 39
And if [[H3588]] thy brother [[H251]] by [[H5973]] thee be waxen poor, [[H4134]] and be sold [[H4376]] unto thee; thou shalt not [[H3808]] compel [[H5647]] him to serve [[H5656]] as a bondservant: [[H5650]]

### 40
as an hired servant, [[H7916]] as a sojourner, [[H8453]] he shall be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee, shall serve [[H5647]] thee unto [[H5704]] the year [[H8141]] of jubile: [[H3104]]

### 41
And shall he depart [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] thee, he [[H1931]] and his children [[H1121]] with [[H5973]] him, and shall return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] his own family, [[H4940]] and unto [[H413]] the possession [[H272]] of his fathers [[H1]] shall he return. [[H7725]]

### 42
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] my servants, [[H5650]] which [[H834]] I brought forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] they shall not [[H3808]] be sold [[H4376]] as [[H4466]] bondmen. [[H5650]]

### 43
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] rule [[H7287]] over him with rigour; [[H6531]] but shalt fear [[H3372]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 44
Both thy bondmen, [[H5650]] and thy bondmaids, [[H519]] which [[H834]] thou shalt have, [[H1961]] of [[H853]] the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] are round about [[H5439]] you; of them shall ye buy [[H7069]] bondmen [[H5650]] and bondmaids. [[H519]]

### 45
Moreover [[H1571]] of the children [[H1121]] of the strangers [[H8453]] that do sojourn [[H1481]] among [[H5973]] you, of them shall ye buy, [[H7069]] and of their families [[H4940]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] you, which [[H834]] they begat [[H3205]] in your land: [[H776]] and they shall be [[H1961]] your possession. [[H272]]

### 46
And ye shall take them as an inheritance [[H5157]] for your children [[H1121]] after [[H310]] you, to inherit [[H3423]] a possession; [[H272]] they shall be your bondmen [[H5647]] for ever: [[H5769]] but over your brethren [[H251]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] ye shall not [[H3808]] rule [[H7287]] one [[H376]] over another [[H251]] with rigour. [[H6531]]

### 47
And if [[H3588]] a sojourner [[H1616]] or stranger [[H8453]] wax rich [[H5381]] by [[H5973]] thee, [[H3027]] and thy brother [[H251]] by [[H5973]] him wax poor, [[H4134]] and sell himself [[H4376]] unto the stranger [[H1616]] sojourner [[H8453]] by [[H5973]] thee, or [[H176]] to the stock [[H6133]] of the stranger's [[H1616]] family: [[H4940]]

### 48
After that [[H310]] he is sold [[H4376]] he may be [[H1961]] redeemed again; [[H1353]] one [[H259]] of his brethren [[H251]] may redeem [[H1350]] him: [[H1350]]

### 49
Either [[H176]] his uncle, [[H1730]] or [[H176]] his uncle's [[H1730]] son, [[H1121]] may redeem [[H1350]] him, or [[H176]] that is nigh [[H7607]] of kin [[H1320]] unto him of his family [[H4940]] may redeem [[H1350]] him; or [[H176]] if he be able, [[H5381]] he may redeem [[H1350]] himself. [[H3027]]

### 50
And he shall reckon [[H2803]] with [[H5973]] him that bought [[H7069]] him from the year [[H8141]] that he was sold [[H4376]] to him unto [[H5704]] the year [[H8141]] of jubile: [[H3104]] and the price [[H3701]] of his sale [[H4465]] shall be [[H1961]] according unto the number [[H4557]] of years, [[H8141]] according to the time [[H3117]] of an hired servant [[H7916]] shall it be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 51
If [[H518]] yet [[H5750]] many [[H7227]] years [[H8141]] according unto [[H6310]] them he shall give again [[H7725]] the price of his redemption [[H1353]] out of the money [[H3701]] that he was bought [[H4736]] for. [[H4736]]

### 52
And if [[H518]] there remain [[H7604]] but few [[H4592]] years [[H8141]] unto [[H5704]] the year [[H8141]] of jubile, [[H3104]] then he shall count [[H2803]] with him, according unto [[H6310]] his years [[H8141]] shall he give him again [[H7725]] the price of his redemption. [[H1353]]

### 53
as a yearly [[H8141]] hired servant [[H7916]] shall he be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] him: shall not [[H3808]] rule [[H7287]] with rigour [[H6531]] over him in thy sight. [[H5869]]

### 54
And if [[H518]] he be not [[H3808]] redeemed [[H1350]] in these [[H428]] then he shall go out [[H3318]] in the year [[H8141]] of jubile, [[H3104]] he, [[H1931]] and his children [[H1121]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 55
For [[H3588]] unto me the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] servants; [[H5650]] they [[H1992]] my servants [[H5650]] whom [[H834]] I brought forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]
