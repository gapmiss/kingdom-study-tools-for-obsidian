### 1
Ye shall make [[H6213]] you no [[H3808]] idols [[H457]] nor graven image, [[H6459]] neither [[H3808]] rear you up [[H6965]] a standing image, [[H4676]] neither [[H3808]] shall ye set up [[H5414]] image [[H4906]] of stone [[H68]] in your land, [[H776]] to bow down [[H7812]] unto [[H5921]] it: for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 2
Ye shall keep [[H8104]] my sabbaths, [[H7676]] and reverence [[H3372]] my sanctuary: [[H4720]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
If [[H518]] ye walk [[H1980]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] and keep [[H8104]] my commandments, [[H4687]] and do [[H6213]] them; [[H6213]]

### 4
Then I will give [[H5414]] you rain [[H1653]] in due season, [[H6256]] and the land [[H776]] shall yield [[H5414]] her increase, [[H2981]] and the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] shall yield [[H5414]] their fruit. [[H6529]]

### 5
And your threshing [[H1786]] shall reach [[H5381]] unto the vintage, [[H1210]] and the vintage [[H1210]] shall reach [[H5381]] unto the sowing time: [[H2233]] and ye shall eat [[H398]] your bread [[H3899]] to the full, [[H7648]] and dwell [[H3427]] in your land [[H776]] safely. [[H983]]

### 6
And I will give [[H5414]] peace [[H7965]] in the land, [[H776]] and ye shall lie down, [[H7901]] and none [[H369]] shall make afraid: [[H2729]] and I will rid [[H7673]] evil [[H7451]] beasts [[H2416]] out of [[H4480]] the land, [[H776]] neither [[H3808]] shall the sword [[H2719]] go [[H5674]] through your land. [[H776]]

### 7
And ye shall chase [[H7291]] your enemies, [[H341]] and they shall fall [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] you by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 8
And five [[H2568]] of [[H4480]] you shall chase [[H7291]] an hundred, [[H3967]] and an hundred [[H3967]] of [[H4480]] you shall put ten thousand [[H7233]] to flight: [[H7291]] and your enemies [[H341]] shall fall [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] you by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 9
For I will have respect [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] you, and make you fruitful, [[H6509]] and multiply [[H7235]] you, and establish [[H6965]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] you. [[H854]]

### 10
And ye shall eat [[H398]] old store, [[H3462]] and bring forth [[H3318]] the old [[H3465]] because [[H6440]] of the new. [[H2319]]

### 11
And I will set [[H5414]] my tabernacle [[H4908]] among [[H8432]] you: and my soul [[H5315]] shall not [[H3808]] abhor [[H1602]] you. [[H1602]]

### 12
And I will walk [[H1980]] among [[H8432]] you, and will be [[H1961]] your God, [[H430]] and ye [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] my people. [[H5971]]

### 13
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] brought you forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] that ye should not be [[H1961]] their bondmen; [[H5650]] and I have broken [[H7665]] the bands [[H4133]] of your yoke, [[H5923]] and made you go [[H1980]] upright. [[H6968]]

### 14
But if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me, and will not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] commandments; [[H4687]]

### 15
And if [[H518]] ye shall despise [[H3988]] my statutes, [[H2708]] or if [[H518]] your soul [[H5315]] abhor [[H1602]] my judgments, [[H4941]] so that ye will not [[H1115]] do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] my commandments, [[H4687]] that ye break [[H6565]] my covenant: [[H1285]]

### 16
I [[H589]] also [[H637]] will do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] unto you; I will even appoint [[H6485]] over [[H5921]] you terror, [[H928]] consumption, [[H7829]] and the burning ague, [[H6920]] that shall consume [[H3615]] the eyes, [[H5869]] and cause sorrow [[H1727]] of heart: [[H5315]] and ye shall sow [[H2232]] your seed [[H2233]] in vain, [[H7385]] for your enemies [[H341]] shall eat [[H398]] it. [[H398]]

### 17
And I will set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] against you, and ye shall be slain [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] your enemies: [[H341]] they that hate [[H8130]] you shall reign [[H7287]] over you; and ye shall flee [[H5127]] when none [[H369]] pursueth [[H7291]] you. [[H7291]]

### 18
And if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] yet for [[H5704]] all this [[H428]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me, then I will punish [[H3256]] you seven times [[H7651]] more [[H3254]] for [[H5921]] your sins. [[H2403]]

### 19
And I will break [[H7665]] the pride [[H1347]] of your power; [[H5797]] and I will make [[H5414]] your heaven [[H8064]] as iron, [[H1270]] and your earth [[H776]] as brass: [[H5154]]

### 20
And your strength [[H3581]] shall be spent [[H8552]] in vain: [[H7385]] for your land [[H776]] shall not [[H3808]] yield [[H5414]] her increase, [[H2981]] neither [[H3808]] shall the trees [[H6086]] of the land [[H776]] yield [[H5414]] their fruits. [[H6529]]

### 21
And if [[H518]] ye walk [[H1980]] contrary [[H7147]] unto [[H5973]] me, and will [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me; I will bring [[H3254]] seven times [[H7651]] more plagues [[H4347]] upon [[H5921]] you according to your sins. [[H2403]]

### 22
I will also send [[H7971]] wild [[H7704]] beasts [[H2416]] among you, which shall rob you of your children, [[H7921]] and destroy [[H3772]] your cattle, [[H929]] and make you few in number; [[H4591]] and your ways [[H1870]] shall be desolate. [[H8074]]

### 23
And if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] be reformed [[H3256]] by me by these things, [[H428]] but will walk [[H1980]] contrary [[H7147]] unto [[H5973]] me; [[H5973]]

### 24
Then will I [[H589]] also [[H637]] walk [[H1980]] contrary [[H7147]] unto [[H5973]] you, and will punish [[H5221]] you yet [[H1571]] seven times [[H7651]] for [[H5921]] your sins. [[H2403]]

### 25
And I will bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] you, that shall avenge [[H5358]] the quarrel [[H5359]] of covenant: [[H1285]] and when ye are gathered together [[H622]] within [[H413]] your cities, [[H5892]] I will send [[H7971]] the pestilence [[H1698]] among [[H8432]] you; and ye shall be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy. [[H341]]

### 26
when I have broken [[H7665]] the staff [[H4294]] of your bread, [[H3899]] ten [[H6235]] women [[H802]] shall bake [[H644]] your bread [[H3899]] in one [[H259]] oven, [[H8574]] and they shall deliver [[H7725]] your bread [[H3899]] again by weight: [[H4948]] and ye shall eat, [[H398]] and not [[H3808]] be satisfied. [[H7646]]

### 27
And if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] for all this [[H2063]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me, but walk [[H1980]] contrary [[H7147]] unto [[H5973]] me; [[H5973]]

### 28
Then I will walk [[H1980]] contrary [[H7147]] unto [[H5973]] you also in fury; [[H2534]] and I, even [[H637]] I, [[H589]] will chastise [[H3256]] you seven times [[H7651]] for [[H5921]] your sins. [[H2403]]

### 29
And ye shall eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of your sons, [[H1121]] and the flesh [[H1320]] of your daughters [[H1323]] shall ye eat. [[H398]]

### 30
And I will destroy [[H8045]] your high places, [[H1116]] and cut down [[H3772]] your images, [[H2553]] and cast [[H5414]] your carcases [[H6297]] upon [[H5921]] the carcases [[H6297]] of your idols, [[H1544]] and my soul [[H5315]] shall abhor [[H1602]] you. [[H1602]]

### 31
And I will make [[H5414]] your cities [[H5892]] waste, [[H2723]] and bring your sanctuaries [[H4720]] unto desolation, [[H8074]] and I will not [[H3808]] smell [[H7306]] the savour [[H7381]] of your sweet odours. [[H5207]]

### 32
And I [[H589]] will bring the land [[H776]] into desolation: [[H8074]] and your enemies [[H341]] which dwell [[H3427]] therein shall be astonished [[H8074]] at it. [[H5921]]

### 33
And I will scatter [[H2219]] you among the heathen, [[H1471]] and will draw out [[H7324]] a sword [[H2719]] after [[H310]] you: and your land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8077]] and your cities [[H5892]] waste. [[H2723]]

### 34
Then [[H227]] shall the land [[H776]] enjoy [[H7521]] her sabbaths, [[H7676]] as long [[H3117]] as [[H3605]] it lieth desolate, [[H8074]] and ye [[H859]] in your enemies' [[H341]] land; [[H776]] then [[H227]] shall the land [[H776]] rest, [[H7673]] and enjoy [[H7521]] her sabbaths. [[H7676]]

### 35
As long as [[H3117]] it lieth desolate [[H8074]] it shall rest; [[H7673]] because [[H834]] it did not [[H3808]] rest [[H7673]] in your sabbaths, [[H7676]] when ye dwelt [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 36
And upon them that are left [[H7604]] of you I will send [[H935]] a faintness [[H4816]] into their hearts [[H3824]] in the lands [[H776]] of their enemies; [[H341]] and the sound [[H6963]] of a shaken [[H5086]] leaf [[H5929]] shall chase [[H7291]] them; and they shall flee, [[H5127]] as fleeing [[H4499]] from a sword; [[H2719]] and they shall fall [[H5307]] when none [[H369]] pursueth. [[H7291]]

### 37
And they shall fall [[H3782]] one [[H376]] upon another, [[H251]] as it were before [[H6440]] a sword, [[H2719]] when none [[H369]] pursueth: [[H7291]] and ye shall have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] power to stand [[H8617]] before [[H6440]] your enemies. [[H341]]

### 38
And ye shall perish [[H6]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] and the land [[H776]] of your enemies [[H341]] shall eat you up. [[H398]]

### 39
And they that are left [[H7604]] of you shall pine away [[H4743]] in their iniquity [[H5771]] in your enemies' [[H341]] lands; [[H776]] and also [[H637]] in the iniquities [[H5771]] of their fathers [[H1]] shall they pine away [[H4743]] with [[H854]] them. [[H854]]

### 40
If they shall confess [[H3034]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] and the iniquity [[H5771]] of their fathers, [[H1]] with their trespass [[H4604]] which [[H834]] they trespassed [[H4603]] against me, and that [[H834]] also [[H637]] they have walked [[H1980]] contrary [[H7147]] unto [[H5973]] me; [[H5973]]

### 41
And I [[H589]] also [[H637]] have walked [[H1980]] contrary [[H7147]] unto [[H5973]] them, and have brought [[H935]] them into the land [[H776]] of their enemies; [[H341]] if then [[H176]] their uncircumcised [[H6189]] hearts [[H3824]] be humbled, [[H3665]] and they then [[H227]] accept [[H7521]]  of [[H853]] the punishment of their iniquity: [[H5771]]

### 42
Then will I remember [[H2142]] my covenant [[H1285]] with Jacob, [[H3290]] and also [[H637]] my covenant [[H1285]] with Isaac, [[H3327]] and also [[H637]] my covenant [[H1285]] with Abraham [[H85]] will I remember; [[H2142]] and I will remember [[H2142]] the land. [[H776]]

### 43
The land [[H776]] also shall be left [[H5800]] of them, and shall enjoy [[H7521]] her sabbaths, [[H7676]] while she lieth desolate [[H8074]] without them: and they [[H1992]] shall accept [[H7521]] of the punishment of their iniquity: [[H5771]] because, [[H3282]] even because [[H3282]] they despised [[H3988]] my judgments, [[H4941]] and because their soul [[H5315]] abhorred [[H1602]] my statutes. [[H2708]]

### 44
And yet [[H637]] for all that, [[H2063]] when they be [[H1571]] in the land [[H776]] of their enemies, [[H341]] I will not [[H3808]] cast them away, [[H3988]] neither [[H3808]] will I abhor [[H1602]] them, to destroy them utterly, [[H3615]] and to break [[H6565]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] them: for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]]

### 45
But I will for their sakes remember [[H2142]] the covenant [[H1285]] of their ancestors, [[H7223]] whom [[H834]] I brought forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] that I might be [[H1961]] their God: [[H430]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 46
These [[H428]] the statutes [[H2706]] and judgments [[H4941]] and laws, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] made [[H5414]] between [[H996]] him and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]
