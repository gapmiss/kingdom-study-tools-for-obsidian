And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Take [[H3947]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] him, and the garments, [[H899]] and the anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] and a bullock [[H6499]] for the sin offering, [[H2403]] and two [[H8147]] rams, [[H352]] and a basket [[H5536]] of unleavened bread; [[H4682]]

### 3
And gather together [[H6950]] thou all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 4
And Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] him; and the assembly [[H5712]] was gathered together [[H6950]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 5
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the congregation, [[H5712]] This [[H2088]] the thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] to be done. [[H6213]]

### 6
And Moses [[H4872]] brought [[H7126]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and washed [[H7364]] them with water. [[H4325]]

### 7
And he put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]]  him [[H853]] the coat, [[H3801]] and girded [[H2296]] him with the girdle, [[H73]] and clothed [[H3847]] him with [[H854]] the robe, [[H4598]] and put [[H5414]] the ephod [[H646]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he girded [[H2296]] him with the curious girdle [[H2805]] of the ephod, [[H646]] and bound [[H640]] unto him therewith. [[H640]]

### 8
And he put [[H7760]] the breastplate [[H2833]] upon [[H5921]] him: also he put [[H5414]] in [[H413]] the breastplate [[H2833]] the Urim [[H224]] and the Thummim. [[H8550]]

### 9
And he put [[H7760]] the mitre [[H4701]] upon [[H5921]] his head; [[H7218]] also upon [[H5921]] the mitre, [[H4701]] upon [[H413]] his forefront, [[H6440]] did he put [[H7760]] the golden [[H2091]] plate, [[H6731]] the holy [[H6944]] crown; [[H5145]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 10
And Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] and anointed [[H4886]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein, and sanctified [[H6942]] them. [[H6942]]

### 11
And he sprinkled [[H5137]] thereof [[H4480]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] seven [[H7651]] times, [[H6471]] and anointed [[H4886]] the altar [[H4196]] and all [[H3605]] his vessels, [[H3627]] both the laver [[H3595]] and his foot, [[H3653]] to sanctify [[H6942]] them. [[H6942]]

### 12
And he poured [[H3332]] of the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] upon [[H5921]] Aaron's [[H175]] head, [[H7218]] and anointed [[H4886]] him, to sanctify [[H6942]] him. [[H6942]]

### 13
And Moses [[H4872]] brought [[H7126]] Aaron's [[H175]] sons, [[H1121]] and put [[H3847]] coats [[H3801]] upon them, and girded [[H2296]] them with girdles, [[H73]] and put [[H2280]] bonnets [[H4021]] upon them; as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 14
And he brought [[H5066]] the bullock [[H6499]] for the sin offering: [[H2403]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] laid [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the bullock [[H6499]] for the sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 15
And he slew [[H7819]] and Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the blood, [[H1818]] and put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] round about [[H5439]] with his finger, [[H676]] and purified [[H2398]] the altar, [[H4196]] and poured [[H3332]] the blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the bottom [[H3247]] of the altar, [[H4196]] and sanctified [[H6942]] it, to make reconciliation [[H3722]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 16
And he took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the inwards, [[H7130]] and the caul [[H3508]] the liver, [[H3516]] and the two [[H8147]] kidneys, [[H3629]] and their fat, [[H2459]] and Moses [[H4872]] burned [[H6999]] upon the altar. [[H4196]]

### 17
But the bullock, [[H6499]] and his hide, [[H5785]] his flesh, [[H1320]] and his dung, [[H6569]] he burnt [[H8313]] with fire [[H784]] without [[H2351]] the camp; [[H4264]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 18
And he brought [[H7126]] the ram [[H352]] for the burnt offering: [[H5930]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] laid [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the ram. [[H352]]

### 19
And he killed [[H7819]] and Moses [[H4872]] sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 20
And he cut [[H5408]] the ram [[H352]] into pieces; [[H5409]] and Moses [[H4872]] burnt [[H6999]] the head, [[H7218]] and the pieces, [[H5409]] and the fat. [[H6309]]

### 21
And he washed [[H7364]] the inwards [[H7130]] and the legs [[H3767]] in water; [[H4325]] and Moses [[H4872]] burnt [[H6999]] the whole [[H3605]] ram [[H352]] upon the altar: [[H4196]] it [[H1931]] a burnt sacrifice [[H5930]] for a sweet [[H5207]] savour, [[H7381]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 22
And he brought [[H7126]] the other [[H8145]] ram, [[H352]] the ram [[H352]] of consecration: [[H4394]] and Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] laid [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the ram. [[H352]]

### 23
And he slew [[H7819]] and Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] of the blood [[H1818]] of it, and put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] the tip [[H8571]] of Aaron's [[H175]] right [[H3233]] ear, [[H241]] and upon [[H5921]] the thumb [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] hand, [[H3027]] and upon [[H5921]] the great toe [[H931]] of his right [[H3233]] foot. [[H7272]]

### 24
And he brought [[H7126]] Aaron's [[H175]] sons, [[H1121]] and Moses [[H4872]] put [[H5414]] of [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] the tip [[H8571]] of their right [[H3233]] ear, [[H241]] and upon [[H5921]] the thumbs [[H931]] of their right [[H3233]] hands, [[H3027]] and upon [[H5921]] the great toes [[H931]] of their right [[H3233]] feet: [[H7272]] and Moses [[H4872]] sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 25
And he took [[H3947]] the fat, [[H2459]] and the rump, [[H451]] and all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the inwards, [[H7130]] and the caul [[H3508]] the liver, [[H3516]] and the two [[H8147]] kidneys, [[H3629]] and their fat, [[H2459]] and the right [[H3225]] shoulder: [[H7785]]

### 26
And out of the basket [[H5536]] of unleavened bread, [[H4682]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he took [[H3947]] one [[H259]] unleavened [[H4682]] cake, [[H2471]] and a [[H259]] cake [[H2471]] of oiled [[H8081]] bread, [[H3899]] and one [[H259]] wafer, [[H7550]] and put [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] the fat, [[H2459]] and upon [[H5921]] the right [[H3225]] shoulder: [[H7785]]

### 27
And he put [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] upon [[H5921]] Aaron's [[H175]] hands, [[H3709]] and upon [[H5921]] his sons' [[H1121]] hands, [[H3709]] and waved [[H5130]] them a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 28
And Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] them from off [[H5921]] their hands, [[H3709]] and burnt [[H6999]] on the altar [[H4196]] upon [[H5921]] the burnt offering: [[H5930]] they [[H1992]] consecrations [[H4394]] for a sweet [[H5207]] savour: [[H7381]] it [[H1931]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 29
And Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the breast, [[H2373]] and waved [[H5130]] it a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] of the ram [[H352]] of consecration [[H4394]] it was [[H1961]] Moses' [[H4872]] part; [[H4490]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 30
And Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] of the anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] and of [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and sprinkled [[H5137]] upon [[H5921]] Aaron, [[H175]] upon [[H5921]] his garments, [[H899]] and upon [[H5921]] his sons, [[H1121]] and upon [[H5921]] his sons' [[H1121]] garments [[H899]] with [[H854]] him; and sanctified [[H6942]] Aaron, [[H175]] his garments, [[H899]] and his sons, [[H1121]] and his sons' [[H1121]] garments [[H899]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 31
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and to [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] Boil [[H1310]] the flesh [[H1320]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation: [[H4150]] and there [[H8033]] eat [[H398]] it with the bread [[H3899]] that [[H834]] in the basket [[H5536]] of consecrations, [[H4394]] as [[H834]] I commanded, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] shall eat [[H398]] it. [[H398]]

### 32
And that which remaineth [[H3498]] of the flesh [[H1320]] and of the bread [[H3899]] shall ye burn [[H8313]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 33
And ye shall not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] of the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] the days [[H3117]] of your consecration [[H4394]] be at an end: [[H4390]] for [[H3588]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] shall he consecrate [[H4390]] you. [[H853]]

### 34
As [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath commanded [[H6680]] to do, [[H6213]] to make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 35
Therefore shall ye abide [[H3427]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and keep [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that ye die [[H4191]] not: [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] I am commanded. [[H6680]]

### 36
So Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] things [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]
