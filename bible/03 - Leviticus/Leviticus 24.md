And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Command [[H6680]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they bring [[H3947]] unto [[H413]] thee pure [[H2134]] oil [[H8081]] olive [[H2132]] beaten [[H3795]] for the light, [[H3974]] to cause the lamps [[H5216]] to burn [[H5927]] continually. [[H8548]]

### 3
Without [[H2351]] the vail [[H6532]] of the testimony, [[H5715]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] shall Aaron [[H175]] order [[H6186]] it from the evening [[H6153]] unto [[H5704]] the morning [[H1242]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] continually: [[H8548]] a statute [[H2708]] for ever [[H5769]] in your generations. [[H1755]]

### 4
He shall order [[H6186]] the lamps [[H5216]] upon [[H5921]] the pure [[H2889]] candlestick [[H4501]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] continually. [[H8548]]

### 5
And thou shalt take [[H3947]] fine flour, [[H5560]] and bake [[H644]] twelve [[H6240]] cakes [[H2471]] thereof: two [[H8147]] tenth deals [[H6241]] shall be [[H1961]] in one [[H259]] cake. [[H2471]]

### 6
And thou shalt set [[H7760]] them in two [[H8147]] rows, [[H4634]] six [[H8337]] on a row, [[H4635]] upon [[H5921]] the pure [[H2889]] table [[H7979]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
And thou shalt put [[H5414]] pure [[H2134]] frankincense [[H3828]] upon [[H5921]] row, [[H4635]] that it may be [[H1961]] on the bread [[H3899]] for a memorial, [[H234]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
Every sabbath [[H7676]] he shall set it [[H3117]] in order [[H6186]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] continually, [[H8548]] from [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] by an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant. [[H1285]]

### 9
And it shall be [[H1961]] Aaron's [[H175]] and his sons'; [[H1121]] and they shall eat [[H398]] it in the holy [[H6918]] place: [[H4725]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] unto him of the offerings [[H801]] of the Lord [[H3068]] made by fire by a perpetual [[H5769]] statute. [[H2706]]

### 10
And the son [[H1121]] of an Israelitish [[H3482]] woman, [[H802]] whose [[H1931]] father [[H1121]] an Egyptian, [[H376]] went out [[H3318]] among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and this son [[H1121]] of the Israelitish [[H3482]] and a man [[H376]] of Israel [[H3481]] strove together [[H5327]] in the camp; [[H4264]]

### 11
And the Israelitish [[H3482]] woman's [[H802]] son [[H1121]] blasphemed [[H5344]] the name [[H8034]] and cursed. [[H7043]] And they brought [[H935]] him unto [[H413]] Moses: [[H4872]] (and his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Shelomith, [[H8019]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Dibri, [[H1704]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan:) [[H1835]]

### 12
And they put [[H3240]] him in ward, [[H4929]] that [[H5921]] the mind [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] might be shewed [[H6567]] them. [[H6567]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 14
Bring forth [[H3318]] him that hath cursed [[H7043]] without [[H2351]] the camp; [[H4264]] and let all [[H3605]] that heard [[H8085]] lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and let all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] stone [[H7275]] him. [[H7275]]

### 15
And thou shalt speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Whosoever [[H376]] curseth [[H3588]] his God [[H430]] shall bear [[H5375]] his sin. [[H2399]]

### 16
And he that blasphemeth [[H5344]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] he shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death, [[H4191]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] shall certainly [[H7275]] stone [[H7275]] him: as well the stranger, [[H1616]] as he that is born in the land, [[H249]] when he blasphemeth [[H5344]] the name [[H8034]] shall be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 17
And he [[H376]] that [[H3588]] killeth [[H5221]] any [[H5315]] man [[H120]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 18
And he that killeth [[H5221]] a beast [[H5315]] shall make it good; [[H7999]] beast [[H5315]] for [[H8478]] beast. [[H5315]]

### 19
And if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] cause [[H5414]] a blemish [[H3971]] in his neighbour; [[H5997]] as [[H834]] he hath done, [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] shall it be done [[H6213]] to him; [[H6213]]

### 20
Breach [[H7667]] for [[H8478]] breach, [[H7667]] eye [[H5869]] for [[H8478]] eye, [[H5869]] tooth [[H8127]] for [[H8478]] tooth: [[H8127]] as [[H834]] he hath caused [[H5414]] a blemish [[H3971]] in a man, [[H120]] so [[H3651]] shall it be done [[H5414]] to him [[H5414]]

### 21
And he that killeth [[H5221]] a beast, [[H929]] he shall restore [[H7999]] it: and he that killeth [[H5221]] a man, [[H120]] he shall be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 22
Ye shall have [[H1961]] one [[H259]] manner of law, [[H4941]] as well [[H1961]] for the stranger, [[H1616]] as for one of your own country: [[H249]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 23
And Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they should bring forth [[H3318]] him that had cursed [[H7043]] out [[H2351]] of [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] and stone [[H7275]] him with stones. [[H68]] And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]
