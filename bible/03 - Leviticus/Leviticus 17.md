And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] and unto [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them; This [[H2088]] the thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath commanded, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
What man soever [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H834]] killeth [[H7819]] an ox, [[H7794]] or [[H176]] lamb, [[H3775]] or [[H176]] goat, [[H5795]] in the camp, [[H4264]] or [[H176]] that [[H834]] killeth [[H7819]] out [[H2351]] of the camp, [[H4264]]

### 4
And bringeth [[H935]] it not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] to offer [[H7126]] an offering [[H7133]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] blood [[H1818]] shall be imputed [[H2803]] unto that [[H1931]] man; [[H376]] he hath shed [[H8210]] blood; [[H1818]] and that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from among [[H7130]] his people: [[H5971]]

### 5
To the end [[H4616]] that [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] may bring [[H935]] their sacrifices, [[H2077]] which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] offer [[H2076]] in [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field, [[H7704]] even that they may bring [[H935]] them unto the Lord, [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] unto [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] and offer [[H2076]] them peace [[H8002]] offerings [[H2077]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And the priest [[H3548]] shall sprinkle [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and burn [[H6999]] the fat [[H2459]] for a sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
And they shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] offer [[H2076]] their sacrifices [[H2077]] unto devils, [[H8163]] after [[H310]] whom [[H834]] they [[H1992]] have gone a whoring. [[H2181]] This [[H2063]] shall be [[H1961]] a statute [[H2708]] for ever [[H5769]] unto them throughout their generations. [[H1755]]

### 8
And thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Whatsoever man [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] or of [[H4480]] the strangers [[H1616]] which [[H834]] sojourn [[H1481]] among [[H8432]] you, that [[H834]] offereth [[H5927]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] or [[H176]] sacrifice, [[H2077]]

### 9
And bringeth [[H935]] it not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] to offer [[H6213]] it unto the Lord; [[H3068]] even that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from among his people. [[H5971]]

### 10
And whatsoever man [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] or of [[H4480]] the strangers [[H1616]] that sojourn [[H1481]] among [[H8432]] you, that [[H834]] eateth [[H398]] any manner [[H3605]] of blood; [[H1818]] I will even set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] against that soul [[H5315]] that eateth [[H398]] blood, [[H1818]] and will cut him off [[H3772]] from among [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the life [[H5315]] of the flesh [[H1320]] in the blood: [[H1818]] and I [[H589]] have given [[H5414]] it to you upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] to make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] your souls: [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] the blood [[H1818]] maketh an atonement [[H3722]] for the soul. [[H5315]]

### 12
Therefore [[H5921]] I said [[H559]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] No [[H3808]] soul [[H5315]] of [[H4480]] you shall eat [[H398]] blood, [[H1818]] neither [[H3808]] shall any stranger [[H1616]] that sojourneth [[H1481]] among [[H8432]] you eat [[H398]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 13
And whatsoever man [[H376]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] or of [[H4480]] the strangers [[H1616]] that sojourn [[H1481]] among [[H8432]] you, which [[H834]] hunteth [[H6679]] and catcheth [[H6718]] any beast [[H2416]] or [[H176]] fowl [[H5775]] that [[H834]] may be eaten; [[H398]] he shall even pour out [[H8210]] the blood [[H1818]] thereof, and cover [[H3680]] it with dust. [[H6083]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] the life [[H5315]] of all [[H3605]] flesh; [[H1320]] the blood [[H1818]] of it for the life [[H5315]] thereof: therefore I said [[H559]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Ye shall eat [[H398]] the blood [[H1818]] of no manner [[H3808]] of flesh: [[H1320]] for [[H3588]] the life [[H5315]] of all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] the blood [[H1818]] thereof: whosoever [[H3605]] eateth [[H398]] it shall be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 15
And every [[H3605]] soul [[H5315]] that [[H834]] eateth [[H398]] that which died [[H5038]] or that which was torn [[H2966]] one of your own country, [[H249]] or a stranger, [[H1616]] he shall both wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] in water, [[H4325]] and be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] the even: [[H6153]] then shall he be clean. [[H2891]]

### 16
But if [[H518]] he wash [[H3526]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] bathe [[H7364]] his flesh; [[H1320]] then he shall bear [[H5375]] his iniquity. [[H5771]]
