### 5
And the priest [[H3548]] shall look on [[H7200]] him the seventh [[H7637]] day: [[H3117]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the plague [[H5061]] in his sight [[H5869]] be at a stay, [[H5975]] the plague [[H5061]] spread [[H6581]] not [[H3808]] in the skin; [[H5785]] then the priest [[H3548]] shall shut [[H5462]] him up seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] more: [[H8145]]

### 6
And the priest [[H3548]] shall look on [[H7200]] him again [[H8145]] the seventh [[H7637]] day: [[H3117]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the plague [[H5061]] somewhat dark, [[H3544]] the plague [[H5061]] spread [[H6581]] not [[H3808]] in the skin, [[H5785]] the priest [[H3548]] shall pronounce him clean: [[H2891]] it [[H1931]] a scab: [[H4556]] and he shall wash [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] and be clean.
