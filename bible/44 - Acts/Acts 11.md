### 1
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] brethren [[G80]] that [[G3588]] were [[G5607]] in [[G2596]] Judaea [[G2449]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] also [[G2532]] had [[G1209]] received [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] Peter [[G4074]] was come up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] they that [[G3588]] were of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] circumcision [[G4061]] contended [[G1252]] with [[G4314]] him, [[G846]]

### 3
Saying, [[G3004]] Thou wentest in [[G1525]] to [[G4314]] men [[G435]] uncircumcised, [[G203]] and [[G2532]] didst eat with [[G4906]] them. [[G846]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] rehearsed from the beginning, [[G756]] and expounded [[G1620]] by order [[G2517]] unto them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 5
I [[G1473]] was [[G2252]] in [[G1722]] the city [[G4172]] of Joppa [[G2445]] praying: [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] a trance [[G1611]] I saw [[G1492]] a vision, [[G3705]] A certain [[G5100]] vessel [[G4632]] descend, [[G2597]] as it had been [[G5613]] a great [[G3173]] sheet, [[G3607]] let down [[G2524]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] by four [[G5064]] corners; [[G746]] and [[G2532]] it came [[G2064]] even to [[G891]] me: [[G1700]]

### 6
Upon [[G1519]] the which [[G3739]] when I had fastened mine eyes, [[G816]] I considered, [[G2657]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] fourfooted beasts [[G5074]] of [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]]  wild [[G3588]] beasts, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]]  creeping things, [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] fowls [[G4071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] air. [[G3772]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] saying [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Arise, [[G450]] Peter; [[G4074]] slay [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] eat. [[G5315]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] I said, [[G2036]] Not so, [[G3365]] Lord: [[G2962]] for [[G3754]] nothing [[G3956]] common [[G2839]] or [[G2228]] unclean [[G169]] hath at any time [[G3763]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] mouth. [[G4750]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] the voice [[G5456]] answered [[G611]] me [[G3427]] again [[G1537]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] What [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath cleansed, [[G2511]] call common. [[G2840]] not [[G3361]] thou [[G4771]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] was done [[G1096]] three times: [[G5151]] and [[G2532]] all [[G537]] were drawn up [[G385]] again [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 11
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] immediately [[G1824]] there were three [[G5140]] men [[G435]] already come [[G2186]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] where [[G3739]] I was, [[G1510]] sent [[G649]] from [[G575]] Caesarea [[G2542]] unto [[G4314]] me. [[G3165]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] bade [[G2036]] me [[G3427]] go with [[G4905]] them, [[G846]] nothing [[G3367]] doubting. [[G1252]] Moreover [[G1161]] these [[G3778]] six [[G1803]] brethren [[G80]] accompanied [[G2064]] me, [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] we entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] man's [[G435]] house: [[G3624]]

### 13
And [[G5037]] he shewed [[G518]] us [[G2254]] how [[G4459]] he had seen [[G1492]]  an [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] which stood [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Send [[G649]] men [[G435]] to [[G1519]] Joppa, [[G2445]] and [[G2532]] call for [[G3343]] Simon, [[G4613]] whose surname is [[G1941]] Peter; [[G4074]]

### 14
Who [[G3739]] shall tell [[G2980]] thee [[G4571]] words, [[G4487]] whereby [[G1722]] thou [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] thy [[G4675]] house shall be [[G3624]] saved. [[G4982]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] as [[G1722]] I [[G3165]] began [[G756]] to speak, [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] as [[G5618]] on [[G1909]] us [[G2248]] at [[G1722]] the beginning. [[G746]]

### 16
Then [[G1161]] remembered I [[G3415]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] how that [[G5613]] he said, [[G3004]] John [[G2491]] indeed [[G3303]] baptized [[G907]] with water; [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] shall be baptized [[G907]] with [[G1722]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 17
Forasmuch [[G1487]] then [[G3767]] as [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] like [[G2470]] gift [[G1431]] as [[G5613]] unto us, [[G2254]] who believed [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ; [[G5547]] what [[G5101]] was [[G2252]] I, [[G1473]] that I could [[G1415]] withstand [[G2967]] God? [[G2316]]

### 18
When [[G1161]] they heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] they held their peace, [[G2270]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] saying, [[G3004]] Then [[G686]] hath [[G1325]] God also [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1484]] Gentiles [[G1484]] granted [[G1325]] repentance [[G3341]] unto [[G1519]] life. [[G2222]]

### 19
Now [[G3767]] they [[G3588]] which were scattered abroad [[G1289]] upon [[G575]] the [[G3588]] persecution that [[G2347]] arose [[G1096]] about [[G1909]] Stephen [[G4736]] travelled [[G1330]] as far as [[G2193]] Phenice, [[G5403]] and [[G2532]] Cyprus, [[G2954]] and [[G2532]] Antioch, [[G490]] preaching [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] to none [[G3367]] but [[G1487]] unto the Jews [[G2453]] only. [[G3440]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] were [[G2258]] men [[G435]] of Cyprus [[G2953]] and [[G2532]] Cyrene, [[G2956]] which, [[G3748]] when they were come [[G1525]] to [[G1519]] Antioch, [[G490]] spake [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Grecians, [[G1675]] preaching [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] the hand [[G5495]] of the Lord [[G2962]] was [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] them: [[G846]] and [[G5037]] a great [[G4183]] number [[G706]] believed, [[G4100]] and turned [[G1994]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 22
Then [[G1161]] tidings [[G3056]] of [[G4012]] these things [[G846]] came [[G191]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ears [[G3775]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] church [[G1577]] which [[G3588]] was [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem: [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] they sent forth [[G1821]] Barnabas, [[G921]] that he should go [[G1330]] as far as [[G2193]] Antioch. [[G490]]

### 23
Who, [[G3739]] when he came, [[G3854]] and [[G2532]] had seen [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] was glad, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] exhorted [[G3870]] them all, [[G3956]]  with [[G3588]] that they would [[G4357]] purpose [[G4286]]  of [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] cleave [[G4357]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 24
For [[G3754]] he was [[G2258]] a good [[G18]] man, [[G435]] and [[G2532]] full [[G4134]] of the Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] of faith: [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] much [[G2425]] people [[G3793]] was added [[G4369]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 25
Then [[G1161]] departed [[G1831]] Barnabas [[G921]] to [[G1519]] Tarsus, [[G5019]] for to seek [[G327]] Saul: [[G4569]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] when he had found [[G2147]] him, [[G846]] he brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] Antioch. [[G490]] And [[G1161]] it came to pass, that [[G1096]] a whole [[G3650]] year [[G1763]] they [[G846]] assembled themselves [[G4863]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] taught [[G1321]] much [[G2425]] people. [[G3793]] And [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were called [[G5537]] Christians [[G5546]] first [[G4412]] in [[G1722]] Antioch. [[G490]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] days [[G2250]] came [[G2718]] prophets [[G4396]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] unto [[G1519]] Antioch. [[G490]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] there stood up [[G450]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] named [[G3686]] Agabus, [[G13]] and signified [[G4591]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] that there should [[G3195]] be [[G2071]] great [[G3173]] dearth [[G3042]] throughout [[G1909]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] world: [[G3625]] which [[G3748]] came to pass [[G1096]] in [[G1909]] the days of Claudius [[G2804]] Caesar. [[G2541]]

### 29
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] every [[G1538]] man [[G5100]] according to [[G2531]] his [[G846]] ability, [[G2141]] determined [[G3724]] to send [[G3992]] relief [[G1248]] unto [[G1519]] the brethren [[G80]] which [[G3588]] dwelt [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Judaea: [[G2449]]

### 30
Which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] they did, [[G4160]] and sent it [[G649]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] by [[G1223]] the hands [[G5495]] of Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Saul. [[G4569]]
