### 1
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] uproar [[G2351]] was ceased, [[G3973]] Paul [[G3972]] called unto [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] embraced [[G782]] and departed [[G1831]] for to go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] Macedonia. [[G3109]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] when he had gone over [[G1330]] those [[G1565]] parts, [[G3313]] and [[G2532]] had given [[G3870]] them [[G846]] much [[G4183]] exhortation, [[G3056]] he came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] Greece, [[G1671]]

### 3
And [[G5037]] abode [[G4160]] three [[G5140]] months. [[G3376]] And when for [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] laid wait [[G1917]] him, [[G846]] as he was about [[G3195]] to sail [[G321]] into [[G1519]] Syria, [[G4947]] he to [[G1096]] purposed [[G1106]] return [[G5290]] through [[G1223]] Macedonia. [[G3109]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] there accompanied [[G4902]] him [[G846]] into [[G891]] Asia [[G773]] Sopater [[G4986]] of Berea; [[G961]] and [[G1161]] of the Thessalonians, [[G2331]] Aristarchus [[G708]] and [[G2532]] Secundus; [[G4580]] and [[G2532]] Gaius [[G1050]] of Derbe, [[G1190]] and [[G2532]] Timotheus; [[G5095]] and [[G1161]] of Asia, [[G774]] Tychicus [[G5190]] and [[G2532]] Trophimus. [[G5161]]

### 5
These [[G3778]] going before [[G4281]] tarried [[G3306]] for us [[G2248]] at [[G1722]] Troas. [[G5174]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] sailed away [[G1602]] from [[G575]] Philippi [[G5375]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] days of unleavened [[G2250]] bread, [[G106]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Troas [[G5174]] in [[G891]] five [[G4002]] days; [[G2250]] where [[G3757]] we abode [[G1304]] seven [[G2033]] days. [[G2250]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] upon [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] first [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4521]] week, [[G4521]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] when came together [[G4863]] to break [[G2806]] bread, [[G740]] Paul [[G3972]] preached [[G1256]] unto them, [[G846]] ready [[G3195]] to depart [[G1826]] the [[G3588]] on [[G1887]] morrow; [[G1887]] and [[G5037]] continued [[G3905]] his [[G3056]] speech [[G3056]] until [[G3360]] midnight. [[G3317]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] many [[G2425]] lights [[G2985]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] upper chamber, [[G5253]] where [[G3757]] they were [[G2258]] gathered together. [[G4863]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] there sat [[G2521]] in [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] window [[G2376]] a certain [[G5100]] young man [[G3494]] named [[G3686]] Eutychus, [[G2161]] being fallen [[G2702]] into a deep [[G901]] sleep: [[G5258]] and as [[G1909]] Paul was [[G3972]] long [[G4119]] preaching, [[G1256]] he sunk down [[G2702]] with [[G575]] sleep, [[G5258]] and fell down [[G4098]]  up [[G2736]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] third loft, [[G5152]] and [[G2532]] was taken [[G142]] dead. [[G3498]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] went down, [[G2597]] and fell [[G1968]] on him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] embracing [[G4843]] said, [[G2036]] Trouble yourselves; [[G2350]] not [[G3361]] for [[G1063]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 11
When [[G1161]] he therefore was come up again, [[G305]] and [[G2532]] had broken [[G2806]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] eaten, [[G1089]] and [[G5037]] talked [[G3656]] a even [[G1909]] long while, [[G2425]] till [[G891]] break of day, [[G827]] so [[G3779]] he departed. [[G1831]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] they brought [[G71]] the [[G3588]] young man [[G3816]] alive, [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] were [[G3870]] not [[G3756]] a little [[G3357]] comforted. [[G3870]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] went before [[G4281]] to [[G1909]] ship, [[G4143]] and sailed [[G321]] unto [[G1519]] Assos, [[G789]] there [[G1564]] intending [[G3195]] to take [[G353]] in [[G3588]] Paul: [[G3972]] for [[G1063]] so [[G3779]] had [[G2258]] he appointed, [[G1299]] minding [[G3195]] himself [[G846]] to go afoot. [[G3978]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] he met [[G4820]] with us [[G2254]] at [[G1519]] Assos, [[G789]] we took in, [[G353]] him [[G846]] and came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Mitylene. [[G3412]]

### 15
And we sailed [[G636]] thence, [[G2547]] and came [[G2658]] the [[G3588]] next [[G1966]] over against [[G481]] Chios; [[G5508]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] next [[G2087]] we arrived [[G3846]] at [[G1519]] Samos, [[G4544]] and [[G2532]] tarried [[G3306]] at [[G1722]] Trogyllium; [[G5175]] the [[G3588]] and [[G2192]] next [[G2192]] we came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Miletus. [[G3399]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] Paul [[G3972]] had determined [[G2919]] to sail by [[G3896]] Ephesus, [[G2181]] because [[G3704]] he [[G846]] would [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] spend the time [[G5551]] in [[G1722]] Asia: [[G773]] for [[G1063]] he hasted, [[G4692]] if [[G1487]] it were [[G2258]] possible [[G1415]] for him, [[G846]] to be [[G1096]] at [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G4005]] Pentecost. [[G4005]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] from [[G575]] Miletus [[G3399]] he sent [[G3992]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus, [[G2181]] and called [[G3333]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] church. [[G1577]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] they were come [[G3854]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye [[G5210]] know, [[G1987]] from [[G575]] the first [[G4413]] day [[G2250]] that [[G575]]  I [[G3739]] came [[G1910]] into [[G1519]] Asia, [[G773]] after what manner [[G4459]] I have been [[G1096]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] at all [[G3956]] seasons, [[G5550]]

### 19
Serving [[G1398]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] humility of mind, [[G5012]] and [[G2532]] with many [[G4183]] tears, [[G1144]] and [[G2532]] temptations, [[G3986]] which befell [[G4819]] me [[G3427]] by [[G1722]] the lying in [[G3588]] wait of [[G1917]] the [[G3588]] Jews: [[G2453]]

### 20
how [[G5613]] I kept back [[G5288]] nothing [[G3762]] that was profitable [[G4851]] but [[G3361]] have shewed [[G312]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] have taught [[G1321]] you [[G5209]] publickly, [[G1219]] and [[G2532]] from house to house, [[G3624]]

### 21
Testifying [[G1263]] both [[G5037]] to the Jews, [[G2453]] and also [[G2532]] to the Greeks, [[G1672]] repentance [[G3341]] toward [[G1519]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] faith [[G4102]] toward [[G1519]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] go [[G4198]] bound [[G1210]] in the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] not [[G3361]] knowing [[G1492]] the things [[G3588]] that [[G1722]] shall befall [[G4876]] me [[G3427]] there: [[G846]]

### 23
Save [[G4133]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] witnesseth [[G1263]] in [[G2596]] every city, [[G4172]] saying [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] bonds [[G1199]] and [[G2532]] afflictions [[G2347]] abide [[G3306]] me. [[G3165]]

### 24
But [[G235]] none [[G3762]] of these things [[G3056]] move me, [[G4160]] neither [[G3761]] count I [[G2192]] my [[G3450]] life [[G5590]] dear [[G5093]] unto myself, [[G1683]] so [[G5613]] that I might [[G5048]] finish [[G5048]] my [[G3450]] course [[G1408]] with [[G3326]] joy, [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ministry, [[G1248]] which [[G3739]] I have received [[G2983]] of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] to testify [[G1263]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5485]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] ye [[G5210]] all, [[G3956]] among [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] I have gone [[G1330]] preaching [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] shall see [[G3700]] my [[G3450]] face no [[G4383]] more. [[G3765]]

### 26
Wherefore [[G1352]] I take to [[G3143]] you [[G5213]] record [[G3143]] this [[G4594]] day, [[G2250]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] pure [[G2513]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of all [[G3956]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] I have [[G5288]] shunned [[G5288]] to [[G3361]] declare [[G312]] unto you [[G5213]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] counsel [[G1012]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 28
Take heed [[G4337]] therefore [[G3767]] unto yourselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] flock, [[G4168]] over [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost hath [[G4151]] made [[G5087]] you [[G5209]] overseers, [[G1985]] to feed [[G4165]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] he hath purchased [[G4046]] with [[G1223]] his own [[G2398]] blood. [[G129]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] this, [[G5124]] that [[G3754]] after [[G3326]] my [[G3450]] departing shall [[G867]] grievous [[G926]] wolves [[G3074]] enter [[G1525]] in [[G1519]] among [[G1519]] you, [[G5209]] not [[G3361]] sparing [[G5339]] the [[G3588]] flock. [[G4168]]

### 30
Also [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] own selves [[G846]] shall men [[G435]] arise, [[G450]] speaking [[G2980]] perverse things, [[G1294]] to draw away [[G645]] disciples [[G3101]] after [[G3694]] them. [[G846]]

### 31
Therefore [[G1352]] watch, [[G1127]] and remember, [[G3421]] that [[G3754]] by the space of three years [[G5148]] I ceased [[G3973]] not [[G3756]] to warn [[G3560]] every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] with [[G3326]] tears. [[G1144]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] brethren, [[G80]] I commend [[G3908]] you [[G5209]] to [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3056]] word [[G3056]] of [[G5485]] his [[G846]] grace, [[G5485]] which [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to build you up, [[G2026]] and [[G2532]] to give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] an inheritance [[G2817]] among [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] them [[G3588]] which are sanctified. [[G37]]

### 33
I have coveted [[G1937]] no man's [[G3762]] silver, [[G694]] or [[G2228]] gold, [[G5553]] or [[G2228]] apparel. [[G2441]]

### 34
Yea, [[G1161]] yourselves [[G846]] ye [[G1097]] know, [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] hands have [[G5495]] ministered [[G5256]] unto my [[G3450]] necessities, [[G5532]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] to that [[G5607]] were [[G5607]] with [[G3326]] me. [[G1700]]

### 35
I have shewed [[G5263]] you [[G5213]] all things, [[G3956]] how that [[G3754]] so [[G3779]] labouring [[G2872]] ye ought [[G1163]] to support [[G482]] the [[G3588]] weak, [[G770]] and [[G5037]] to remember [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] how [[G3754]] he [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] It is [[G2076]] more [[G3123]] blessed [[G3107]] to give [[G1325]] than [[G2228]] to receive. [[G2983]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] thus [[G5023]] when he had [[G2036]] spoken, [[G2036]] he kneeled down, [[G5087]] and prayed [[G4336]] with [[G4862]] them [[G846]] all. [[G3956]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] they [[G2425]] all [[G3956]] wept [[G2805]] sore, [[G2425]] and [[G2532]] fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] Paul's [[G3972]] neck, [[G5137]] and kissed [[G2705]] him, [[G846]]

### 38
Sorrowing [[G3600]] most of all [[G3122]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] which [[G3739]] he spake, [[G2046]] that [[G3754]] they should [[G3195]] see [[G2334]] his [[G846]] face [[G4383]] no more. [[G3765]] And [[G1161]] they accompanied [[G4311]] him [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]]
