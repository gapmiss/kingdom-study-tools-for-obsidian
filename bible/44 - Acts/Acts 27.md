### 1
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] it was determined that [[G2919]] we [[G2248]] should sail [[G636]] into [[G1519]] Italy, [[G2482]] they delivered [[G3860]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] other [[G2087]] prisoners [[G1202]] unto named [[G3686]] Julius, [[G2457]] a centurion [[G1543]] of Augustus' [[G4575]] band. [[G4686]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] entering into [[G1910]] a ship [[G4143]] of Adramyttium, [[G98]] we launched, [[G321]] meaning [[G3195]] to sail [[G4126]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G5117]] of [[G773]] Asia; [[G773]] Aristarchus, [[G708]] a Macedonian [[G3110]] of Thessalonica, [[G2331]] being [[G5607]] with [[G4862]] us. [[G2254]]

### 3
And [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] next [[G2087]] we touched [[G2609]] at [[G1519]] Sidon. [[G4605]] And [[G5037]] Julius [[G2457]] courteously [[G5364]] entreated [[G5530]] Paul, [[G3972]] and gave liberty [[G2010]] to go [[G4198]] unto [[G4314]] his friends [[G5384]] to refresh himself. [[G1958]]

### 4
And when from thence, [[G2547]] we had launched [[G321]] we sailed under [[G5284]] Cyprus, [[G2954]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] were [[G1511]] contrary. [[G1727]]

### 5
And [[G5037]] when we had sailed over [[G1277]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G3989]] of [[G2596]] Cilicia [[G2791]] and [[G2532]] Pamphylia, [[G3828]] we came [[G2718]] to [[G1519]] Myra, [[G3460]] of [[G3073]] Lycia. [[G3073]]

### 6
And there [[G2546]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] found [[G2147]] a ship [[G4143]] of Alexandria [[G222]] sailing [[G4126]] into [[G1519]] Italy; [[G2482]] and he put [[G1688]] us [[G2248]] therein. [[G1519]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] when [[G1722]] we had sailed slowly [[G1020]] many [[G2425]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] scarce [[G3433]] were come [[G1096]] over against [[G2596]] Cnidus, [[G2834]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] not [[G3361]] suffering [[G4330]] us, [[G2248]] we sailed under [[G5284]] Crete, [[G2914]] over against [[G2596]] Salmone; [[G4534]]

### 8
And, [[G5037]] hardly [[G3433]] passing [[G3881]] it, [[G846]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G1519]] a which [[G5100]] place [[G5117]] is called [[G2564]] The fair [[G2568]] havens; [[G2568]] nigh [[G1451]] whereunto [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] the city [[G4172]] Lasea. [[G2996]]

### 9
Now [[G1161]] when much [[G2425]] time [[G5550]] was spent, [[G1230]] and [[G2532]] when [[G4144]] sailing [[G4144]] was [[G5607]] now [[G2235]] dangerous, [[G2000]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] fast [[G3521]] was [[G3928]] now [[G2532]] already [[G2235]] past, [[G3928]] Paul [[G3972]] admonished [[G3867]]

### 10
And said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Sirs, [[G435]] I perceive [[G2334]] that [[G3754]] this [[G4144]] voyage [[G4144]] will [[G3195]] be [[G2071]] with [[G3326]] hurt [[G5196]] and [[G2532]] much [[G4183]] damage, [[G2209]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5414]] lading [[G5414]] and [[G2532]] ship, [[G4143]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] of our [[G2257]] lives. [[G5590]]

### 11
Nevertheless [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] believed [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2942]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] owner of the ship, [[G3490]] more [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] those things [[G3588]] which were spoken [[G3004]] by [[G5259]] Paul. [[G3972]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] because the [[G3588]] haven [[G3040]] was [[G5225]] not commodious [[G428]] to [[G4314]] winter in, [[G3915]] the [[G3588]] more part [[G4119]] advised [[G5087]] to depart [[G321]] thence also, [[G2547]] if by any means [[G1513]] they might [[G1410]] attain [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Phenice, [[G5405]] to winter; [[G3914]] an haven [[G3040]] of [[G2914]] Crete, [[G2914]] and lieth [[G991]] toward [[G2596]] the south west [[G3047]] and [[G2532]] north west. [[G5566]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] when the south wind [[G3558]] blew softly, [[G5285]] supposing that [[G1380]] they had obtained [[G2902]] purpose, [[G4286]] loosing [[G142]] they sailed [[G3881]] close [[G788]]  by [[G3588]] Crete. [[G2914]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] long [[G4183]] after [[G3326]] there arose [[G906]] against [[G2596]] it [[G846]] a tempestuous [[G5189]] wind, [[G417]] called [[G2564]] Euroclydon. [[G2148]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G4143]] ship [[G4143]] was caught, [[G4884]] and [[G2532]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] bear up into [[G503]] the [[G3588]] wind, [[G417]] we let [[G1929]] drive. [[G5342]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] running under [[G5295]] a certain [[G5100]] island [[G3519]] which is called [[G2564]] Clauda, [[G2802]] we had much [[G2480]] work [[G3433]] to come by [[G4031]] the [[G3588]] boat: [[G4627]]

### 17
Which [[G3739]] when they had taken up, [[G142]] they used [[G5530]] helps, [[G996]] undergirding [[G5269]] the [[G3588]] ship; [[G4143]] and, [[G5037]] fearing [[G5399]] lest [[G3361]] they should fall [[G1601]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] quicksands, [[G4950]] strake [[G5465]] sail, [[G4632]] and so [[G3779]] were driven. [[G5342]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] we [[G2257]] being exceedingly [[G4971]] tossed with a tempest, [[G5492]] the [[G3588]] next [[G1836]] lightened the ship; [[G1546]]  they [[G4160]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] we cast out [[G4496]] with our own hands [[G849]] the [[G3588]] tackling [[G4631]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4143]] ship. [[G4143]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] when neither [[G3383]] sun [[G2246]] nor [[G3383]] stars [[G798]] in [[G1909]] many [[G4119]] days [[G2250]] appeared, [[G2014]] and [[G5037]] no [[G3756]] small [[G3641]] tempest [[G5494]] lay on [[G1945]] all [[G3956]] hope [[G1680]] that we [[G2248]] should be saved [[G4982]] then [[G3063]] was taken [[G4014]] away. [[G4014]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] after [[G5225]] long [[G4183]] abstinence [[G776]] Paul [[G3972]] stood forth [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of them, [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] Sirs, [[G435]] ye should [[G1163]] have [[G3303]] hearkened [[G3980]] unto me, [[G3427]] not [[G3361]] and have [[G321]] loosed [[G321]] from [[G575]] Crete, [[G2914]] and [[G5037]] to have gained [[G2770]] this [[G3778]] harm [[G5196]] and [[G2532]] loss. [[G2209]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I exhort [[G3867]] you [[G5209]] to be of good cheer: [[G2114]] for [[G1063]] of [[G5590]] there shall be [[G2071]] no [[G3762]] loss [[G580]] life [[G5590]] among [[G1537]] you, [[G5216]] but [[G4133]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4143]] ship. [[G4143]]

### 23
For [[G1063]] there stood [[G3936]] by [[G3427]] me [[G3427]] this [[G3778]] night [[G3571]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] whose [[G3739]] I am, [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] whom [[G3739]] I serve, [[G3000]]

### 24
Saying, [[G3004]] Fear [[G5399]] not, [[G3361]] Paul; [[G3972]] thou [[G4571]] must be [[G1163]] brought before [[G3936]] Caesar: [[G2541]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] God [[G2316]] hath given [[G5483]] thee [[G4671]] all [[G3956]] them [[G3588]] that sail [[G4126]] with [[G3326]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 25
Wherefore, [[G1352]] sirs, [[G435]] be of good cheer: [[G2114]] for [[G1063]] I believe [[G4100]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] it [[G3779]] shall be [[G2071]] even [[G2596]] as [[G5158]] it was told [[G2980]] me. [[G3427]]

### 26
Howbeit [[G1161]] we [[G2248]] must [[G1163]] be cast [[G1601]] upon [[G1519]] a certain [[G5100]] island. [[G3520]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] the fourteenth [[G5065]] night [[G3571]] was come, [[G1096]] as we [[G2257]] were driven up and down [[G1308]] in [[G1722]] Adria, [[G99]] about [[G2596]] midnight [[G3571]] the [[G3588]] shipmen [[G3492]] deemed that [[G5282]] they [[G846]] drew near to [[G4317]] some [[G5100]] country; [[G5561]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] sounded, [[G1001]] and found [[G2147]] twenty [[G1501]] fathoms: [[G3712]] and [[G1161]] when they had gone [[G1339]] a little further, [[G1024]] they sounded [[G1001]] again, [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] fifteen [[G1178]] fathoms. [[G3712]]

### 29
Then [[G5037]] fearing [[G5399]] lest [[G3381]] we should have fallen [[G1601]] upon [[G1519]] rocks, [[G5138]] they cast [[G4496]] four [[G5064]] anchors [[G45]] out of [[G1537]] the stern, [[G4403]] and wished [[G2172]] the day. [[G2250]] for [[G1096]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] as [[G3492]] shipmen [[G3492]] were about [[G2212]] to flee [[G5343]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] when [[G2532]] they had let down [[G5465]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4627]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] under colour [[G4392]] as though [[G5613]] they would [[G3195]] have cast [[G1614]] anchors [[G45]] out of [[G1537]] the foreship, [[G4408]]

### 31
Paul [[G3972]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1543]] centurion [[G1543]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4757]] soldiers, [[G4757]] Except [[G1437]] these [[G3778]] abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] ye [[G5210]] cannot [[G3756]]  be [[G1410]] saved. [[G4982]]

### 32
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] cut off [[G609]] the [[G3588]] ropes [[G4979]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4627]] boat, [[G4627]] and [[G2532]] let [[G1439]] her [[G846]] fall off. [[G1601]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] while [[G891]] the day [[G2250]] was [[G3195]] coming on, [[G1096]] Paul [[G3972]] besought [[G3870]] all [[G537]] to take [[G3335]] meat, [[G5160]] saying, [[G3004]] This day [[G4594]] is the fourteenth [[G5065]] day [[G2250]] that [[G3739]] ye have tarried [[G4328]] and continued [[G1300]] fasting, [[G777]] having taken [[G4355]] nothing. [[G3367]]

### 34
Wherefore [[G1352]] I pray [[G3870]] you [[G5209]] to take [[G4355]] meat: [[G5160]] for [[G1063]] this is [[G5124]]  there shall [[G5225]] for [[G4314]] your [[G5212]] health: [[G4991]] for [[G1063]] not of of [[G3762]] an hair [[G2359]] fall [[G4098]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] any [[G3762]] you. [[G5216]]

### 35
And when [[G1161]] he had [[G2036]] thus [[G5023]] spoken, [[G2036]] he took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] gave thanks [[G2168]]  to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] in presence [[G1799]] of them all: [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] when he had broken [[G2806]] he began [[G756]] to eat. [[G2068]]

### 36
Then [[G1161]] were [[G1096]] they all [[G3956]] of good cheer, [[G2115]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] also took [[G4355]] meat. [[G5160]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] we were [[G1510]] in all [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] two hundred [[G1250]] threescore and [[G1440]] sixteen [[G1803]] souls. [[G5590]]

### 38
And when [[G1161]] they had eaten enough, [[G2880]] they lightened [[G2893]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] and cast out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] wheat [[G4621]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] it was [[G1096]] day, [[G2250]] they knew [[G1921]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] land: [[G1093]] but [[G1161]] they discovered [[G2657]] a certain [[G5100]] creek [[G2859]] with [[G2192]] a shore, [[G123]] into [[G1519]] the which [[G3739]] they were minded, [[G1011]] if [[G1487]] it were possible, [[G1410]] to thrust [[G1856]] in [[G4143]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] when they had taken up [[G4014]] the [[G3588]] anchors, [[G45]] they committed [[G1439]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G260]] loosed [[G447]] the [[G3588]] rudder [[G4079]] bands, [[G2202]] and [[G2532]] hoised up [[G1869]] the [[G3588]] mainsail to [[G736]] the [[G3588]] wind, [[G4154]] and made [[G2722]] toward [[G1519]] shore. [[G123]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] falling [[G4045]] into [[G1519]] a place [[G5117]] where two seas met, [[G1337]] they ran aground; [[G2027]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G3491]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] forepart [[G4408]] stuck fast, [[G2043]] and remained [[G3306]] unmoveable, [[G761]] but [[G1161]] the hinder [[G3588]] part [[G4403]] was broken [[G3089]] with [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] violence [[G970]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2949]] waves. [[G2949]]

### 42
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] soldiers' [[G4757]] counsel [[G1012]] was [[G1096]] to [[G2443]] kill [[G615]] the [[G3588]] prisoners, [[G1202]] lest [[G3361]] any [[G5100]] of them should swim out, [[G1579]] and escape. [[G1309]]

### 43
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] centurion, [[G1543]] willing [[G1014]] to save [[G1295]] Paul, [[G3972]] kept from [[G2967]] them [[G846]] purpose; [[G1013]] and [[G5037]] commanded that [[G2753]] they [[G3588]] which could [[G1410]] swim [[G2860]] should cast [[G641]] first [[G4413]] and get [[G1826]] to [[G1909]] land: [[G1093]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rest, [[G3062]] some [[G3739]] on [[G1909]] boards, [[G4548]] and [[G1161]] some [[G3739]] on [[G1909]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]] And [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that they escaped safe [[G1295]] all [[G3956]] to [[G1909]] land. [[G1093]]
