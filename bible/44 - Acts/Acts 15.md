### 1
And [[G2532]] certain men [[G5100]] which came down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Judaea [[G2449]] taught [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] Except [[G1437]] ye be circumcised [[G4059]] after the [[G3588]] manner [[G1485]] of Moses, [[G3475]] cannot [[G3756]] ye be [[G1410]] saved. [[G4982]]

### 2
When therefore [[G3767]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] had [[G1096]] no [[G3756]] small [[G3641]] dissension [[G4714]] and [[G2532]] disputation [[G4803]] with [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] they determined that [[G5021]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas, [[G921]] and [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] other [[G243]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] should go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] about [[G4012]] this [[G5127]] question. [[G2213]]

### 3
And [[G3767]] being brought on their way [[G4311]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] they passed [[G3588]] through [[G1330]] Phenice [[G5403]] and [[G2532]] Samaria, [[G4540]] declaring [[G1555]] the [[G3588]] conversion [[G1995]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] Gentiles: [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] they caused [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] joy [[G5479]] unto all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] when they were come [[G3854]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] they were received [[G588]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G5037]] they declared [[G312]] all things that [[G3745]] God [[G2316]] had done [[G4160]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] there rose up [[G1817]] certain [[G5100]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] sect [[G139]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] which believed, [[G4100]] saying, [[G3004]] That [[G3754]] it was needful to [[G1163]] circumcise [[G4059]] them, [[G846]] and [[G5037]] to command [[G3853]] to keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of Moses. [[G3475]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] came together [[G4863]] for to consider [[G1492]] of [[G4012]] this [[G5127]] matter. [[G3056]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] when there had been [[G1096]] much [[G4183]] disputing, [[G4803]] Peter [[G4074]] rose up, [[G450]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] ye [[G5210]] know [[G1987]] how that [[G3754]] a good while [[G2250]] ago [[G744]] God [[G2316]] made choice [[G1586]] among [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] that the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] by [[G1223]] my [[G3450]] mouth [[G4750]] should hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel, [[G2098]] and [[G2532]] believe. [[G4100]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] God, [[G2316]]  which knoweth the [[G3588]] hearts, [[G2589]] bare [[G3140]] them [[G846]] witness, [[G3140]] giving [[G1325]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] unto us; [[G2254]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] no [[G3762]] put [[G1252]] difference [[G1252]] between [[G3342]] us [[G2257]] and [[G2532]] them, [[G846]] purifying [[G2511]] their [[G846]] hearts by [[G2588]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 10
Now [[G3568]] therefore [[G3767]] why [[G5101]] tempt ye [[G3985]] God, [[G2316]] to put [[G2007]] a yoke [[G2218]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] neck [[G5137]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples, [[G3101]] which [[G3739]] neither [[G3777]] our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] nor [[G3777]] we [[G2249]] were able [[G2480]] to bear? [[G941]]

### 11
But [[G235]] we believe [[G4100]] that [[G3739]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] we shall be saved, [[G4982]] even [[G5158]] as [[G2596]] they. [[G2548]]

### 12
Then [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G4128]] kept silence, [[G4601]] and [[G2532]] gave audience [[G191]] to Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Paul, [[G3972]] declaring [[G1834]] what [[G3745]] miracles [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] God [[G2316]] had wrought [[G4160]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] by [[G1223]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] they had held peace, [[G4601]] their [[G846]] James [[G2385]] answered, [[G611]] saying, [[G3004]] Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] hearken [[G191]] unto me: [[G3450]]

### 14
Simeon [[G4826]] hath declared [[G1834]] how [[G2531]] God [[G2316]] at the first [[G4412]] did visit [[G1980]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] to take [[G2983]] out of them [[G1537]] a people [[G2992]] for [[G1909]] his [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] to this [[G5129]] agree [[G4856]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets; [[G4396]] as [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]]

### 16
After [[G3326]] this [[G5023]] I will return, [[G390]] and [[G2532]] will build again [[G456]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle [[G4633]] of David, [[G1138]] which [[G3588]] is fallen down; [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] I will build again [[G456]] the [[G3588]] ruins [[G2679]] thereof, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] I will set up: [[G461]] it [[G846]]

### 17
That [[G3704]] the [[G3588]] residue [[G2645]]  of [[G3588]] men [[G444]] might seek [[G1567]] the [[G3588]] after [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] upon [[G1909]] whom [[G3739]] my [[G3450]] name is [[G3686]] called, [[G1941]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord, [[G2962]] who doeth [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 18
Known [[G1110]]  unto [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] are [[G2076]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] works [[G2041]] from [[G575]] the beginning of the world. [[G165]]

### 19
Wherefore [[G1352]] my [[G1473]] sentence is, [[G2919]] that we trouble [[G3926]] not [[G3361]] them, which [[G3588]] from among [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] are turned [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] God: [[G2316]]

### 20
But [[G235]] that we write [[G1989]] unto them, [[G846]] that they abstain [[G567]] from [[G575]] pollutions [[G234]] of [[G1497]] idols, [[G1497]] and [[G2532]] fornication, [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] things strangled, [[G4156]] and [[G2532]] blood. [[G129]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] Moses [[G3475]] of [[G1537]] old [[G744]] time [[G1074]] hath [[G2192]] in every [[G2596]] city [[G4172]] them [[G3588]] that preach [[G2784]] him, [[G846]] being read [[G314]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] every [[G3956]]  sabbath [[G2596]] day. [[G4521]]

### 22
Then [[G5119]] pleased it [[G1380]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] church, [[G1577]] to send [[G3992]] chosen [[G1586]] men [[G435]] of [[G1537]] their own company [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Antioch [[G490]] with [[G4862]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas; [[G921]] Judas [[G2455]] surnamed [[G1941]] Barsabas, [[G923]] and [[G2532]] Silas, [[G4609]] chief [[G2233]] men [[G435]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] brethren: [[G80]]

### 23
And they wrote [[G1125]] by [[G1223]] them [[G846]] after this manner; [[G3592]] The [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] brethren [[G80]] greeting [[G5463]] unto the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] which [[G3588]] are of [[G1537]] the Gentiles [[G1484]] in [[G2596]] Antioch [[G490]] and [[G2532]] Syria [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] Cilicia: [[G2791]]

### 24
Forasmuch as [[G1894]] we have heard, [[G191]] that [[G3754]] certain [[G5100]] which went out [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] us [[G2257]] have troubled [[G5015]] you [[G5209]] with words, [[G3056]] subverting [[G384]] your [[G5216]] souls, [[G5590]] saying, [[G3004]] be circumcised, [[G4059]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] law: [[G3551]] to whom [[G3739]] we gave commandment: [[G1291]] no [[G3756]]

### 25
It seemed good [[G1380]] unto us, [[G2254]] being assembled [[G1096]] with one accord, [[G3661]] to send [[G3992]] chosen [[G1586]] men [[G435]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] with [[G4862]] our [[G2257]] beloved [[G27]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Paul, [[G3972]]

### 26
Men [[G444]] that have hazarded [[G3860]] their [[G846]] lives [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 27
We have sent [[G649]] therefore [[G3767]] Judas [[G2455]] and [[G2532]] Silas, [[G4609]] who [[G846]] also [[G2532]] shall [[G518]] tell [[G518]] the [[G3588]] same things [[G846]] by [[G1223]] mouth. [[G3056]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] it seemed good [[G1380]] the [[G3588]] to [[G40]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] to us, [[G2254]] to lay upon [[G2007]] you [[G5213]] no [[G3367]] greater [[G4119]] burden [[G922]] than [[G4133]] these [[G5130]] necessary things; [[G1876]]

### 29
That ye abstain [[G567]] from meats offered to idols, [[G1494]] and [[G2532]] from blood, [[G129]] and [[G2532]] from things strangled, [[G4156]] and [[G2532]] from fornication: [[G4202]] from [[G1537]] which [[G3739]] if ye keep [[G1301]] yourselves, [[G1438]] ye shall do [[G4238]] well. [[G2095]] Fare ye well. [[G4517]]

### 30
So when [[G3767]] they [[G3588]] were dismissed, [[G630]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Antioch: [[G490]] and [[G2532]] when they had gathered together, [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G4128]] they delivered [[G1929]] the [[G3588]] epistle: [[G1992]]

### 31
when [[G1161]] they had read, [[G314]] they rejoiced [[G5463]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] consolation. [[G3874]]

### 32
And [[G5037]] Judas [[G2455]] and [[G2532]] Silas, [[G4609]] being [[G5607]] prophets [[G4396]] also [[G2532]] themselves, [[G846]] exhorted [[G3870]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] with [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] words, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] confirmed [[G1991]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] after they had tarried [[G4160]] a space, [[G5550]] they were let go [[G630]] in [[G3326]] peace [[G1515]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 34
Notwithstanding [[G1161]] it pleased [[G1380]] Silas [[G4609]] to abide still. [[G1961]] there [[G847]]

### 35
Paul [[G3972]] also [[G1161]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] continued [[G1304]] in [[G1722]] Antioch, [[G490]] teaching [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] preaching [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] many [[G4183]] others [[G2087]] also. [[G2532]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] days [[G2250]] after [[G3326]] Paul [[G3972]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] Barnabas, [[G921]] Let us go again [[G1994]]  and [[G1211]] visit [[G1980]] our [[G2257]] brethren [[G80]] in [[G2596]] every [[G3956]] city [[G4172]] where [[G1722]]  we have [[G3739]] preached [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G4459]] they do. [[G2192]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] Barnabas [[G921]] determined [[G1011]] to take with them [[G4838]] John, [[G2491]] whose surname was [[G2564]] Mark. [[G3138]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] thought [[G515]] not [[G3361]] good [[G515]] to take him [[G4838]]  with them, [[G5126]] who [[G3588]] departed [[G868]] from [[G575]] them [[G846]] from [[G575]] Pamphylia, [[G3828]] and [[G2532]] went [[G4905]] not [[G3361]] with them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] work. [[G2041]]

### 39
And [[G3767]] the contention so sharp between them, [[G3948]] was [[G1096]] that [[G5620]] they departed asunder [[G673]] one [[G846]] from [[G575]] the other: [[G240]] and so [[G5037]] Barnabas [[G921]] took [[G3880]] Mark, [[G3138]] and sailed [[G1602]] unto [[G1519]] Cyprus; [[G2954]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] chose [[G1951]] Silas, [[G4609]] and departed, [[G1831]] being recommended [[G3860]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G5485]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] he went through [[G1330]] Syria [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] Cilicia, [[G2791]] confirming [[G1991]] the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]]
