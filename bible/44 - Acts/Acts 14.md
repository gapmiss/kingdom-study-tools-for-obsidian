### 1
And [[G1161]] it came to pass [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Iconium, [[G2430]] that they [[G846]] went [[G1525]] together [[G2596]] both [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue of [[G4864]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] spake, [[G2980]] that [[G5620]] a great [[G4183]] multitude [[G4128]] both [[G5037]] of the Jews [[G2453]] and also [[G2532]] of the Greeks [[G1672]] believed. [[G4100]]

### 2
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] unbelieving [[G544]] Jews [[G2453]] stirred up [[G1892]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] made evil affected [[G2559]] their [[G3588]] minds [[G5590]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 3
Long [[G2425]] time [[G5550]] therefore [[G3767]] abode they [[G1304]] speaking boldly [[G3955]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] which [[G3588]] gave testimony [[G3140]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3056]] word [[G3056]] of his [[G846]] grace, [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] granted [[G1325]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] to be done [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] their [[G846]] hands. [[G5495]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city [[G4172]] was divided: [[G4977]] and [[G2532]] part [[G3303]] held [[G2258]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G1161]] part [[G3588]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] there was made [[G1096]] an assault [[G3730]] both [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] and also [[G2532]] of the Jews [[G2453]] with [[G4862]] their [[G846]] rulers, [[G758]] to use despitefully, [[G5195]] and [[G2532]] to stone [[G3036]] them, [[G846]]

### 6
They were ware of [[G4894]] and fled [[G2703]] unto [[G1519]] Lystra [[G3082]] and [[G2532]] Derbe, [[G1191]] cities [[G4172]] of [[G3071]] Lycaonia, [[G3071]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unto region that lieth round [[G4066]] about: [[G4066]]

### 7
And there [[G2546]] they preached [[G2258]] the gospel. [[G2097]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] there sat [[G2521]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G435]] at [[G1722]] Lystra, [[G3082]] impotent [[G102]]  in his [[G3588]] feet, [[G4228]] being [[G5225]] a cripple [[G5560]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mother's [[G3384]] womb, [[G2836]] who [[G3739]] never [[G3763]] had walked: [[G4043]]

### 9
The same [[G3778]] heard [[G191]] Paul [[G3972]] speak: [[G2980]] who [[G3739]] stedfastly beholding [[G816]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] perceiving [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he had [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] to be healed, [[G4982]]

### 10
Said [[G2036]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] Stand [[G450]] upright [[G3717]] on [[G1909]] thy [[G4675]] feet. [[G4228]] And [[G2532]] he leaped [[G242]] and [[G2532]] walked. [[G4043]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] saw [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] Paul [[G3972]] had done, [[G4160]] they lifted up [[G1869]] their [[G846]] voices, [[G5456]] saying [[G3004]] in the speech of Lycaonia, [[G3072]] The [[G3588]] gods [[G2316]] are come down [[G2597]] to [[G4314]] us [[G2248]] in the likeness [[G3666]] of men. [[G444]]

### 12
And [[G5037]] they called [[G2564]] Barnabas, [[G921]] Jupiter; [[G2203]] and [[G1161]] Paul, [[G3972]] Mercurius, [[G2060]] because [[G1894]] he [[G846]] was [[G2258]] the [[G3588]] chief [[G2233]] speaker. [[G3056]]

### 13
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] priest [[G2409]] of [[G2203]] Jupiter, [[G2203]] which was [[G5607]] before [[G4253]] their [[G846]] city, [[G4172]] brought [[G5342]] oxen [[G5022]] and [[G2532]] garlands [[G4725]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] gates, [[G4440]] and would have [[G2309]] done sacrifice [[G2380]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G3793]]

### 14
when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] apostles, [[G652]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Paul, [[G3972]] heard [[G191]] they rent [[G1284]] their [[G846]] clothes, [[G2440]] and ran in [[G1530]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] crying out, [[G2896]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Sirs, [[G435]] why [[G5101]] do ye [[G4160]] these things? [[G5023]] We [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] are [[G2070]] men [[G444]] of like passions [[G3663]] with you, [[G5213]] and preach [[G2097]] unto you [[G5209]] that ye should turn [[G1994]] from [[G575]] these [[G5130]] vanities [[G3152]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] made [[G4160]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] things [[G3588]] that are therein: [[G1722]]

### 16
Who [[G3739]] in [[G1722]] times [[G1074]] past [[G3944]] suffered [[G1439]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] to walk in [[G4198]] their own [[G846]] ways. [[G3598]]

### 17
Nevertheless [[G2544]] he left [[G863]] not [[G3756]] himself [[G1438]] without witness, [[G267]] in that he did good, [[G15]] and gave [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] rain [[G5205]] from heaven, [[G3771]] and [[G2532]] fruitful [[G2593]] seasons, [[G2540]] filling [[G1705]] our [[G2257]] hearts with [[G2588]] food [[G5160]] and [[G2532]] gladness. [[G2167]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] with these [[G5023]] sayings [[G3004]] scarce [[G3433]] restrained they [[G2664]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] that they had done [[G2380]] not [[G3361]] sacrifice [[G2380]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] there came thither [[G1904]] Jews [[G2453]] from [[G575]] Antioch [[G490]] and [[G2532]] Iconium, [[G2430]] who [[G2532]] persuaded [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] and, [[G2532]] having stoned [[G3034]] Paul, [[G3972]] drew [[G4951]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] supposing [[G3543]] he [[G846]] had been dead. [[G2348]]

### 20
Howbeit, [[G1161]] as the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] stood round about [[G2944]] him, [[G846]] he rose up, [[G450]] and came [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city: [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] he departed [[G1831]] with [[G4862]] Barnabas [[G921]] to [[G1519]] Derbe. [[G1191]]

### 21
And [[G5037]] when they had preached the gospel [[G2097]] to that [[G1565]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] had taught [[G3100]] many, [[G2425]] they returned again [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Lystra, [[G3082]] and [[G2532]] Iconium, [[G2430]] and [[G2532]] Antioch, [[G490]]

### 22
Confirming [[G1991]] the [[G3588]] souls [[G5590]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples, [[G3101]] exhorting them [[G3870]] to continue [[G1696]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4102]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] we [[G2248]] must [[G1163]] through [[G1223]] much [[G4183]] tribulation [[G2347]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] when they had ordained [[G5500]] them [[G846]] elders [[G4245]] in every [[G2596]] church, [[G1577]] and had prayed [[G4336]] with [[G3326]] fasting, [[G3521]] they commended [[G3908]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] on [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] they believed. [[G4100]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] after they had passed throughout [[G1330]] Pisidia, [[G4099]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Pamphylia. [[G3828]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] when they had preached [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] Perga, [[G4011]] they went down [[G2597]] into [[G1519]] Attalia: [[G825]]

### 26
And thence [[G2547]] sailed [[G636]] to [[G1519]] Antioch, [[G490]] from whence [[G3606]] they had been [[G2258]] recommended [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] to [[G5485]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] they fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] when they were come, [[G3854]] and [[G2532]] had gathered together, [[G4863]] the [[G1577]] church [[G1577]]  they [[G3588]] rehearsed [[G312]] all that [[G3745]] God [[G2316]] had done [[G4160]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] how [[G3754]] he had opened [[G455]] the door [[G2374]] of faith [[G4102]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1484]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] there [[G1563]] they abode [[G1304]] long [[G3756]] time [[G5550]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]]
