### 1
Now [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] that was [[G5607]] at [[G1722]] Antioch [[G490]] certain [[G5100]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] teachers; [[G1320]] as [[G5037]] Barnabas, [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Simeon [[G4826]] that was called [[G2564]] Niger, [[G3526]] and [[G2532]] Lucius [[G3066]] of [[G2956]] Cyrene, [[G2956]] and [[G5037]] Manaen, [[G3127]] which had been brought up with [[G4939]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] tetrarch, [[G5076]] and [[G2532]] Saul. [[G4569]]

### 2
As [[G1161]] they [[G846]] ministered [[G3008]] to [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] fasted, [[G3522]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] said, [[G2036]] Separate [[G873]] me [[G3427]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Saul [[G4569]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] whereunto [[G3739]] I have called [[G4341]] them. [[G846]]

### 3
And when [[G5119]] they had fasted [[G3522]] and [[G2532]] prayed, [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] on them, [[G846]] they sent away. [[G630]]

### 4
So [[G3303]] they, [[G3778]] being sent forth [[G1599]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] departed [[G2718]] unto [[G1519]] Seleucia; [[G4581]] and [[G5037]] from thence [[G1564]] they sailed [[G636]] to [[G1519]] Cyprus. [[G2954]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when they were [[G1096]] at [[G1722]] Salamis, [[G4529]] they preached [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues of [[G4864]] the [[G3588]] Jews: [[G2453]] and [[G1161]] they had [[G2192]] also [[G2532]] John to [[G2491]] minister. [[G5257]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] when they had gone through [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] isle [[G3520]] unto [[G891]] Paphos, [[G3974]] they found [[G2147]] a certain [[G5100]] sorcerer, [[G3097]] a false prophet, [[G5578]] a Jew, [[G2453]] whose [[G3739]] name [[G3686]] Bar-jesus: [[G919]]

### 7
Which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] with [[G4862]] the deputy of the country, [[G3588]] Sergius [[G4588]] Paulus, [[G3972]] a prudent [[G4908]] man; [[G435]] who [[G3778]] called for [[G4341]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Saul, [[G4569]] and desired [[G1934]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] Elymas [[G1681]] the [[G3588]] sorcerer [[G3097]] (for [[G1063]] so [[G3779]] is by [[G3177]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] interpretation) [[G3177]] withstood [[G436]] them, [[G846]] seeking [[G2212]] to turn away [[G1294]] the [[G3588]] deputy [[G446]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 9
Then [[G1161]] Saul, [[G4569]] (who [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] Paul,) [[G3972]] filled with [[G4130]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] set his eyes [[G816]] on [[G1519]] him, [[G846]]

### 10
And said, [[G2036]] O [[G5599]] full [[G4134]] of all [[G3956]] subtilty [[G1388]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] mischief, [[G4468]] child [[G5207]] of the devil, [[G1228]] enemy [[G2190]] of all [[G3956]] righteousness, [[G1343]] not [[G3756]] wilt thou [[G3973]] cease [[G3973]] to pervert [[G1294]] the [[G3588]] right [[G2117]] ways [[G3598]] of the Lord? [[G2962]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] behold, [[G2400]] the hand [[G5495]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] upon [[G1909]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt be [[G2071]] blind, [[G5185]] not [[G3361]] seeing [[G991]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] for [[G891]] a season. [[G2540]] And [[G1161]] immediately [[G3916]] there fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] a mist [[G887]] and [[G2532]] a darkness; [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] he went about [[G4013]] seeking [[G2212]] some to lead him by the hand. [[G5497]]

### 12
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] deputy, [[G446]] when he saw [[G1492]] what was done, [[G1096]] believed, [[G4100]] being astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] doctrine [[G1322]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 13
Now when [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] and his company [[G4012]] loosed [[G321]] from [[G575]] Paphos, [[G3974]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Perga [[G4011]]  in [[G3588]] Pamphylia: [[G3828]] and [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] departing [[G672]] from [[G575]] them [[G846]] returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 14
But when [[G1161]] they [[G846]] departed [[G1330]] from [[G575]] Perga, [[G4011]] they came [[G3854]] to [[G1519]] Antioch [[G490]]  in [[G3588]] Pisidia, [[G4099]] and [[G2532]] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] the [[G3588]] on [[G4521]] sabbath [[G4521]] day, [[G2250]] and sat down. [[G2523]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] reading [[G320]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] the rulers the [[G3588]] of synagogue [[G752]] sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] if [[G1487]] ye have [[G2076]]  any [[G1722]] word [[G3056]] of exhortation [[G3874]] for [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] say on. [[G3004]]

### 16
Then [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] stood up, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] beckoning with [[G2678]] hand [[G5495]] said, [[G2036]] Men [[G435]] of Israel, [[G2475]] and [[G2532]] ye that fear [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] give audience. [[G191]]

### 17
The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of this [[G5127]] people of [[G2992]] Israel [[G2474]] chose [[G1586]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] exalted [[G5312]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] when [[G1722]] they dwelt as strangers [[G3940]] in [[G1722]] the land [[G1093]] of Egypt, [[G125]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] an high [[G5308]] arm [[G1023]] brought he [[G1806]] them [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] it. [[G846]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] about [[G5613]] the time [[G5550]] of forty years [[G5063]] suffered he manners [[G5159]] their [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] when he had destroyed [[G2507]] seven [[G2033]] nations [[G1484]] in [[G1722]] the land [[G1093]] of Chanaan, [[G5477]] he divided by lot. [[G2624]] their [[G846]] land [[G1093]] to them [[G846]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] that [[G5023]] he gave [[G1325]] judges [[G2923]] about the space of [[G5613]] four hundred [[G5071]] and [[G2532]] fifty [[G4004]] years, [[G2094]] until [[G2193]] Samuel [[G4545]] the [[G3588]] prophet. [[G4396]]

### 21
And afterward [[G2547]] they desired [[G154]] a king: [[G935]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G1325]] unto them [[G846]] Saul [[G4549]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Cis, [[G2797]] a man [[G435]] of [[G1537]] the tribe [[G5443]] of Benjamin, [[G958]] by the space of forty [[G5062]] years. [[G2094]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] when he had removed [[G3179]] him, [[G846]] he raised up [[G1453]] unto them [[G846]] David [[G1138]] to be [[G1519]] their king; [[G935]] to whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] he gave testimony, [[G3140]] and said, [[G2036]] I have found [[G2147]] David [[G1138]] the [[G3588]] of Jesse, [[G2421]] a man [[G435]] after [[G2596]] mine own [[G3450]] heart, [[G2588]] which [[G3739]] shall fulfil [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] my [[G3450]] will. [[G2307]]

### 23
Of [[G575]] this man's [[G5127]] seed [[G4690]] hath [[G1453]] God [[G2316]] according to [[G2596]] promise [[G1860]] raised [[G1453]] unto Israel [[G2474]] a [[G3588]] Saviour, [[G4990]] Jesus: [[G2424]]

### 24
When had first [[G4296]] John [[G2491]] preached [[G4296]] before [[G4253]] his [[G846]] coming the [[G1529]] baptism [[G908]] of repentance [[G3341]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] as [[G5613]] John [[G2491]] fulfilled [[G4137]]  his [[G3588]] course, [[G1408]] he said, [[G3004]] Whom [[G5101]] think ye that [[G5282]] I [[G3165]] am? [[G1511]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] But, [[G235]] behold, [[G2400]] there cometh one [[G2064]] after [[G3326]] me, [[G1691]] whose [[G3739]] shoes [[G5266]]  of [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] to loose. [[G3089]]

### 26
Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] children [[G5207]] of the stock [[G1085]] of Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3588]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] feareth [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] to you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] is [[G649]] word [[G3056]] of this [[G3778]] salvation [[G4991]] sent. [[G649]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] they that dwell [[G2730]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] rulers, [[G758]] because they knew not, [[G50]]  him nor [[G5126]] yet [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] voices [[G5456]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets [[G4396]] which [[G3588]] are read [[G314]] every [[G2596]]  sabbath [[G3956]] day, [[G4521]] they have fulfilled [[G4137]] in condemning [[G2919]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] though they found [[G2147]] no [[G3367]] cause [[G156]] of death [[G2288]] yet desired they [[G154]] Pilate [[G4091]] that he [[G846]] should be slain. [[G337]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] they had fulfilled [[G5055]] all [[G537]] that was written [[G1125]] of [[G4012]] him, [[G846]] they took down [[G2507]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] tree, [[G3586]] and laid [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] a sepulchre. [[G3419]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] raised [[G1453]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the dead: [[G3498]]

### 31
And he was [[G3739]] seen [[G3700]] many [[G4119]] days [[G2250]] of them which came up with [[G4872]] him [[G846]] from [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] who [[G3748]] are [[G1526]] his [[G846]] witnesses [[G3144]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] how that [[G3754]] we [[G2249]] unto you [[G5209]] declare glad [[G2097]] tidings, [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] which was made [[G1096]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] fathers, [[G3962]]

### 33
God [[G2316]] hath fulfilled [[G1603]] the same [[G3778]] unto us [[G2254]] their [[G846]] children, [[G5043]] in that he hath raised up again; [[G450]] Jesus [[G2424]] as [[G5613]] also [[G2532]] it is [[G1125]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] psalm, [[G5568]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] my [[G3450]] Son, [[G5207]] this day [[G4594]] I [[G1473]] have [[G1080]] begotten [[G1080]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] as concerning that [[G3754]] he raised up [[G450]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] no more [[G3371]] to [[G3195]] return [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] corruption, [[G1312]] he said [[G2046]] on this wise, [[G3779]] I will give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] sure [[G4103]] mercies [[G3741]] of David. [[G1138]]

### 35
Wherefore [[G1352]] he saith [[G3004]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] another [[G2087]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G1325]] suffer [[G1325]] thine [[G4675]] Holy One [[G3741]] to see [[G1492]] corruption. [[G1312]]

### 36
For [[G1063]] David, [[G1138]] after he had served [[G5256]] his own [[G2398]] generation [[G1074]] the [[G3588]] by [[G3588]] will [[G1012]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] fell on sleep, [[G2837]] and [[G2532]] was laid [[G4369]] unto [[G4314]] his [[G846]] fathers, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] corruption: [[G1312]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] he, whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] raised again, [[G1453]] saw [[G1492]] no [[G3756]] corruption. [[G1312]]

### 38
Be it [[G2077]] known [[G1110]] unto you [[G5213]] therefore, [[G3767]] men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] through [[G1223]] this man [[G5127]] is preached [[G2605]] unto you [[G5213]] the forgiveness [[G859]] of sins: [[G266]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] him [[G5129]] all [[G3956]] that believe [[G4100]] are justified [[G1344]] from [[G575]] all things, [[G3956]] from which [[G3739]] ye could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] be justified [[G1344]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of Moses. [[G3475]]

### 40
Beware [[G991]] therefore, [[G3767]] lest [[G3361]] that come [[G1904]] upon [[G1909]] you, [[G5209]] which is spoken of [[G2046]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prophets; [[G4396]]

### 41
Behold, [[G1492]]  ye [[G3588]] despisers, [[G2707]] and [[G2532]] wonder, [[G2296]] and [[G2532]] perish: [[G853]] for [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] work [[G2038]] a work [[G2041]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] days, [[G2250]] a [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] in no wise [[G3756]] ye shall [[G4100]] believe, [[G4100]] though [[G1437]] a man [[G5100]] declare it [[G1555]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 42
And [[G1161]] when were [[G1826]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] gone [[G1826]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] besought [[G3870]] that these [[G5023]] words [[G4487]] might be preached [[G2980]] to them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] next [[G3342]] sabbath. [[G4521]]

### 43
Now [[G1161]] when was up, [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] congregation [[G4864]] broken [[G3089]] many [[G4183]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] religious [[G4576]] proselytes [[G4339]] followed [[G190]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas: [[G921]] who, [[G3748]] speaking [[G4354]] to [[G846]] them, [[G846]] persuaded [[G3982]] them [[G846]] to continue in [[G1961]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 44
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] next [[G2064]] sabbath day [[G4521]] almost [[G4975]] came [[G4863]] the whole [[G3956]] city [[G4172]] together [[G4863]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 45
But [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] multitudes, [[G3793]] they were filled [[G4130]] with envy, [[G2205]] and [[G2532]] spake against [[G483]] those things which were spoken [[G3004]] by [[G5259]] Paul, [[G3972]] contradicting [[G483]] and [[G2532]] blaspheming. [[G987]]

### 46
Then [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] waxed bold, [[G3955]] and said, [[G2036]] It was [[G2258]] necessary [[G316]] that the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] first [[G4412]] should have been [[G2980]] spoken [[G2980]] to you: [[G5213]] but [[G1161]] seeing [[G1894]] ye put from you, [[G683]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] judge [[G2919]] yourselves [[G1438]] unworthy [[G3756]]  of [[G514]] everlasting [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] lo, [[G2400]] we turn [[G4762]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 47
For [[G1063]] so [[G3779]] hath [[G1781]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] commanded [[G1781]] us, [[G2254]] I have set [[G5087]] thee [[G4571]] to be [[G1519]] a light [[G5457]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] of the [[G1519]] that thou [[G4571]] shouldest be [[G1511]] for [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] unto [[G2193]] the ends [[G2078]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 48
And [[G1161]] when this, [[G191]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] heard [[G191]] they were glad, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord: [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] as many as [[G3745]] were [[G2258]] ordained [[G5021]] to [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] believed. [[G4100]]

### 49
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] was published [[G1308]] throughout [[G1223]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] region. [[G5561]]

### 50
the [[G3588]] But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] stirred up [[G3951]] devout [[G4576]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] honourable [[G2158]] women, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief men [[G4413]] of [[G4172]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] raised [[G1892]] persecution [[G1375]] against [[G1909]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas, [[G921]] and [[G2532]] expelled [[G1544]] them [[G846]] out of [[G575]] their [[G846]] coasts. [[G3725]]

### 51
