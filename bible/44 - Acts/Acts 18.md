After [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] Paul [[G3972]] departed [[G5563]] from [[G1537]] Athens, [[G116]] and came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Corinth; [[G2882]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] a certain [[G5100]] Jew [[G2453]] named [[G3686]] Aquila, [[G207]] born [[G1085]] in Pontus, [[G4193]] lately [[G4373]] come [[G2064]] from [[G575]] Italy, [[G2482]] with [[G2532]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] Priscilla; [[G4252]] (because that [[G1223]] Claudius [[G2804]] had commanded [[G1299]] all [[G3956]] Jews [[G2453]] to depart [[G5563]] from [[G1537]] Rome:) [[G4516]] and came [[G4334]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] because of same [[G1511]] he was [[G2258]] the [[G3588]] craft, [[G3673]] he abode [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] wrought: [[G2038]] for [[G1063]] by their [[G3588]]  occupation they were [[G5078]] tentmakers. [[G4635]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] he reasoned [[G1256]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] every [[G3956]] sabbath, [[G4521]] and [[G5037]] persuaded [[G3982]] the Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] the Greeks. [[G1672]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] Silas [[G4609]] and [[G2532]] Timotheus [[G5095]] were come [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] Paul [[G3972]] was pressed [[G4912]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] and testified [[G1263]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] when they opposed [[G498]] themselves, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] blasphemed, [[G987]] he shook [[G1621]] raiment, [[G2440]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Your [[G5216]] blood [[G129]] upon [[G1909]] your own [[G5216]] heads; [[G2776]] I [[G1473]] clean: [[G2513]] from [[G575]] henceforth [[G3568]] I will go [[G4198]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] he departed [[G3327]] thence, [[G1564]] and entered [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] a certain [[G5100]] house, [[G3614]] named [[G3686]] Justus, [[G2459]] that [[G3739]] worshipped [[G4576]] God, [[G2316]] whose [[G3588]] house [[G3614]]  joined hard to [[G4927]] the [[G3588]] synagogue. [[G4864]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] Crispus, [[G2921]] the [[G3588]] chief ruler of the synagogue, [[G752]] believed [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] on [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] with [[G4862]] all [[G3650]] his [[G846]] house; [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2881]] Corinthians [[G2881]] hearing [[G191]] believed, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] were baptized. [[G907]]

### 9
Then [[G1161]] spake [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] to [[G3972]] Paul [[G3972]] in [[G1722]] the night [[G3571]] by [[G1223]] a vision, [[G3705]] not [[G3361]] Be [[G5399]] afraid, [[G5399]] but [[G235]] speak, [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] hold thy peace: [[G4623]] not [[G3361]]

### 10
For [[G1360]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] thee, [[G4675]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] shall set [[G2007]] on thee [[G4671]] to hurt [[G2559]] thee: [[G4571]] for [[G1360]] I [[G3427]] have [[G2076]] much [[G4183]] people [[G2992]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] city. [[G4172]]

### 11
And [[G5037]] he continued [[G2523]] a year [[G1763]] and [[G2532]] six [[G1803]] months, [[G3376]] teaching [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] among [[G1722]] them. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] when Gallio [[G1058]] was the deputy [[G445]] of [[G882]] Achaia, [[G882]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] made insurrection [[G2721]] with one accord [[G3661]]  against [[G3588]] Paul, [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat, [[G968]]

### 13
Saying, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] persuadeth [[G374]] men [[G444]] to worship [[G4576]] God [[G3754]]  to [[G2316]] contrary [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] law. [[G3551]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] when [[G3972]] Paul [[G3972]] was now about [[G3195]] to open [[G455]] mouth, [[G4750]] Gallio [[G1058]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] If [[G1487]] were [[G2258]] it matter [[G5100]] a [[G5100]] of wrong [[G92]] or [[G2228]] wicked [[G4190]] lewdness, [[G4467]] O [[G5599]] Jews, [[G2453]] reason [[G3056]] would that [[G2596]] I should bear with [[G430]] you: [[G5216]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] it be [[G2076]] a question [[G2213]] of [[G4012]] words [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] names, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5209]] law, [[G3551]] look ye [[G3700]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] will [[G1014]] be [[G1511]] no [[G3756]] judge [[G2923]] of such [[G5130]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he drave [[G556]] them [[G846]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat. [[G968]]

### 17
Then [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Greeks [[G1672]] took [[G1949]] Sosthenes, [[G4988]] the [[G3588]] chief ruler of the synagogue, [[G752]] and beat [[G5180]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat. [[G968]] And [[G2532]] Gallio [[G1058]] cared for [[G3199]] none [[G3762]] of those things. [[G5130]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] tarried [[G4357]] yet [[G2089]] a good [[G2425]] while, [[G2250]] and then took his leave [[G657]] of [[G80]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] and sailed thence [[G1602]] into [[G1519]] Syria, [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] Priscilla [[G4252]] and [[G2532]] Aquila; [[G207]] having shorn [[G2751]] head [[G2776]] in [[G1722]] Cenchrea: [[G2747]] for [[G1063]] he had [[G2192]] a vow. [[G2171]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] he came [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus, [[G2181]] and [[G2548]] left them [[G2641]] there: [[G847]] but [[G1161]] himself [[G846]] he [[G1525]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and reasoned [[G1256]] the [[G3588]] with [[G2453]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 20
When [[G1161]] they [[G846]] desired [[G2065]] to [[G1909]] tarry [[G3306]] longer [[G4119]] time [[G5550]] with [[G3844]] them, [[G846]] he consented [[G1962]] not; [[G3756]]

### 21
But [[G235]] bade [[G657]] them [[G846]] farewell, [[G657]] saying, [[G2036]] I [[G3165]] must [[G1163]] by all means [[G3843]] keep [[G4160]] this [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] that [[G2064]] cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem: [[G2414]] but [[G1161]] I will return [[G344]] again [[G3825]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] if [[G2309]] God [[G2316]] will. [[G2309]] And [[G2532]] he sailed [[G321]] from [[G575]] Ephesus. [[G2181]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] when he had landed [[G2718]] at [[G1519]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and gone up, [[G305]] and [[G2532]] saluted [[G782]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] he went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Antioch. [[G490]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] after he had spent [[G4160]] some [[G5100]] time [[G5550]] he departed, [[G1831]] and went over [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] country [[G5561]] of Galatia [[G1054]] and [[G2532]] Phrygia [[G5435]] in order, [[G2517]] strengthening [[G1991]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] Jew [[G2453]] named [[G3686]] Apollos, [[G625]] born [[G1085]] at Alexandria, [[G221]] an eloquent [[G3052]] man, [[G435]] mighty [[G1415]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] scriptures, [[G1124]] came [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus. [[G2181]]

### 25
This man [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] instructed [[G2727]] in the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord; [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] being fervent [[G2204]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] he spake [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] taught [[G1321]] diligently [[G199]] the things [[G3588]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] knowing [[G1987]] only [[G3440]] the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] of John. [[G2491]]

### 26
And [[G5037]] he [[G3778]] began [[G756]] to speak boldly [[G3955]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue: [[G4864]] whom [[G846]] when had [[G191]] Aquila [[G207]] and [[G2532]] Priscilla [[G4252]] heard, [[G191]] they took unto [[G4355]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] expounded [[G1620]] unto him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] more perfectly. [[G199]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] when he [[G846]] was disposed [[G1014]] to pass [[G1330]] into [[G1519]] Achaia, [[G882]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] wrote, [[G1125]] exhorting [[G4389]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] to receive [[G588]] him: [[G846]] who, [[G3739]] when he was come, [[G3854]] helped them [[G4820]] much [[G4183]] which [[G3588]] had believed [[G4100]] through [[G1223]] grace: [[G5485]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] he mightily [[G2159]] convinced [[G1246]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] publickly, [[G1219]] shewing that [[G1925]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] scriptures [[G1124]] Jesus [[G2424]] was [[G1511]] Christ. [[G5547]]
