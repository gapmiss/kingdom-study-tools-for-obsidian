### 1
Now [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] went up [[G305]] together [[G1909]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] of [[G4335]] prayer, [[G4335]] the [[G3588]] ninth [[G1766]]

And [[G2532]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G435]] lame [[G5560]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mother's [[G3384]] womb [[G2836]] was carried, [[G941]] whom [[G3739]] they laid [[G5087]] daily [[G2596]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] gate [[G2374]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2411]] temple [[G2411]] which [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] Beautiful, [[G5611]] to ask [[G154]] alms [[G1654]] of [[G3844]] them [[G3588]] that entered [[G1531]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple; [[G2411]]

### 3
Who [[G3739]] seeing [[G1492]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] about to [[G3195]] go [[G1524]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] asked [[G2065]] an [[G2983]] alms. [[G1654]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] Peter, [[G4074]] fastening his eyes [[G816]] upon [[G1519]] him [[G846]] with [[G4862]] John, [[G2491]] said, [[G2036]] Look [[G991]] on [[G1519]] us. [[G2248]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] gave heed unto [[G1907]] them, [[G846]] expecting [[G4328]] to receive [[G2983]] something [[G5100]] of [[G3844]] them. [[G846]]

### 6
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G2036]] Silver [[G694]] and [[G2532]] gold [[G5553]] have [[G5225]] I [[G3427]] none; [[G3756]] but [[G1161]] such as [[G3739]] I have [[G2192]] give I [[G1325]] thee: [[G4671]] In [[G1722]] the of [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] Nazareth [[G3480]] rise up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] walk. [[G4043]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] he took [[G4084]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] by [[G5495]] right [[G1188]] hand, [[G5495]] and lifted up: [[G1453]] and [[G1161]] immediately [[G3916]] his [[G846]] feet [[G939]] and [[G2532]]  ankle [[G3588]] bones received [[G4974]] strength. [[G4732]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] leaping up [[G1814]] he [[G2476]] stood, [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] walked, [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] entered [[G1525]] with [[G4862]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] walking, [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] leaping, [[G242]] and [[G2532]] praising [[G134]] God. [[G2316]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] saw [[G1492]] him [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] praising [[G134]] God: [[G2316]]

### 10
And [[G5037]] they knew [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] it [[G846]] was [[G2258]] he [[G3778]] which [[G3588]] sat [[G2521]] for [[G4314]] alms [[G1654]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Beautiful [[G5611]] gate [[G4439]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2411]] temple: [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] they were filled [[G4130]] with wonder [[G2285]] and [[G2532]] amazement [[G1611]] at [[G1909]] that which [[G3588]] had happened [[G4819]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] as [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] lame [[G5560]]  man [[G3588]] which was healed [[G2390]] held [[G2902]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] ran together [[G4936]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] porch [[G4745]] that [[G3588]] is [[G2564]] called [[G2564]] Solomon's, [[G4672]] greatly wondering. [[G1569]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] Peter [[G4074]] saw [[G1492]] he answered [[G611]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] Ye men [[G435]] of Israel, [[G2475]] why [[G5101]] marvel ye [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] this? [[G5129]] or [[G2228]] why [[G5101]] look ye so earnestly [[G816]] on us, [[G2254]] as though [[G5613]] own [[G2398]] by our [[G1411]] power [[G1411]] or [[G2228]] holiness [[G2150]] we had made [[G4160]] this [[G3588]] man [[G846]] to walk? [[G4043]]

### 13
The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] of Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] of Jacob, [[G2384]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]] hath glorified [[G1392]] his [[G846]] Son [[G3816]] Jesus; [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] delivered up, [[G3860]] and [[G2532]] denied [[G720]] him [[G846]] in [[G2596]] the presence [[G4383]] of Pilate, [[G4091]] when was [[G2919]] he [[G1565]] determined [[G2919]] to let go. [[G630]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] denied [[G720]] the [[G3588]] Holy One [[G40]] and [[G2532]] the Just, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] desired [[G154]] a [[G435]] murderer [[G5406]] to be granted [[G5483]] unto you; [[G5213]]

### 15
the [[G3588]] And [[G1161]] killed [[G615]] Prince [[G747]] of [[G2222]] life, [[G2222]] whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead; [[G3498]] whereof [[G3739]] we [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] witnesses. [[G3144]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] through [[G1909]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G846]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] hath made strong, [[G4732]] this man [[G5126]] whom [[G3739]] ye see [[G2334]] and [[G2532]] know: [[G1492]] yea, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] which [[G3588]] is by [[G1223]] him [[G846]] hath given [[G1325]] him [[G846]] this [[G3778]] perfect [[G3647]] soundness [[G3647]] in the presence [[G561]] of you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] brethren, [[G80]] I wot [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] through [[G2596]] ignorance [[G52]] ye did [[G4238]] as [[G5618]] also [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] rulers. [[G758]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] those things, [[G3588]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] before had shewed [[G4293]] by [[G1223]] the mouth [[G4750]] of all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] prophets, [[G4396]] that should [[G3958]] Christ [[G5547]] suffer, [[G3958]] he hath [[G4137]] so [[G3779]] fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 19
Repent ye [[G3340]] therefore, [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] be converted, [[G1994]] that [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] sins [[G266]] may be blotted out, [[G1813]] when [[G3704]] the times [[G2540]] of refreshing [[G403]] shall come [[G2064]] from [[G575]] the presence [[G4383]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord; [[G2962]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] he shall send [[G649]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] which before was preached [[G4296]] unto you: [[G5213]]

### 21
Whom [[G3739]] the heaven [[G3772]] must [[G1163]] receive [[G1209]] until [[G891]] the times [[G5550]] of restitution [[G605]] of all things, [[G3956]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath spoken [[G2980]] by [[G1223]] the mouth [[G4750]] of all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] holy [[G40]] prophets [[G4396]] since [[G575]] the world began. [[G165]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] Moses [[G3475]] truly [[G3303]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] fathers, [[G3962]] A prophet [[G4396]] the Lord [[G2962]] shall up [[G2316]] your [[G5216]] God [[G2316]] raise [[G450]] unto you [[G5213]] of [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] brethren, [[G80]] like unto [[G5613]] me; [[G1691]] him [[G846]] shall ye hear [[G191]] in [[G2596]] all things [[G3956]] whatsoever [[G3745]] he shall say [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] it shall come to pass, [[G2071]] every [[G3956]] soul, [[G5590]] which [[G3748]] not [[G3361]] will [[G191]] hear [[G191]] that [[G1565]] prophet, [[G4396]] shall be destroyed [[G1842]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] among [[G2992]] people. [[G2992]]

### 24
Yea, [[G1161]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] from [[G575]] Samuel [[G4545]] and [[G2532]] those that follow after, [[G2517]] as many as [[G3745]] have spoken, [[G2980]] likewise [[G2532]] have [[G4293]] foretold [[G4293]] of [[G2250]] these [[G3778]] days. [[G2250]]

### 25
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] the children [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] of [[G1242]] the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] made [[G1303]] with [[G4314]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]] saying [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] Abraham, [[G11]] And [[G2532]] in [[G4690]] thy [[G4675]] seed [[G4690]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] kindreds [[G3965]] the [[G3588]] of earth [[G1093]] shall be blessed. [[G1757]]

### 26
Unto you [[G5213]] first [[G4412]] God, [[G2316]] having raised up [[G450]] his [[G846]] Son [[G3816]] Jesus, [[G2424]] sent [[G649]] him [[G846]] to bless [[G2127]] you, [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] turning away [[G654]] every one of you [[G1538]] from [[G575]] his [[G5216]] iniquities. [[G4189]]
