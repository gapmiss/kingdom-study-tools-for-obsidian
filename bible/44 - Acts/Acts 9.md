### 1
And [[G1161]] Saul, [[G4569]] yet [[G2089]] breathing out [[G1709]] threatenings [[G547]] and [[G2532]] slaughter [[G5408]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] went unto [[G4334]] the high [[G3588]] priest, [[G749]]

### 2
And desired [[G154]] of [[G3844]] him [[G846]] letters [[G1992]] to [[G1519]] Damascus [[G1154]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] that [[G3704]] if [[G1437]] he found [[G2147]] any [[G5100]] this [[G3588]] of [[G3598]] way, [[G3598]] whether they were [[G5037]] men [[G435]] or [[G2532]] women, [[G1135]] he might bring [[G71]] them bound [[G1210]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] as [[G1722]] he [[G3588]] journeyed, [[G4198]] he [[G846]] came [[G1096]] near [[G1448]] Damascus: [[G1154]] and [[G2532]] suddenly [[G1810]] there shined round about [[G4015]] him [[G846]] a light [[G5457]] from [[G575]] heaven: [[G3772]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] he fell [[G4098]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Saul, [[G4549]] Saul, [[G4549]] why [[G5101]] persecutest thou [[G1377]] me? [[G3165]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] he said, [[G2036]] Who [[G5101]] art thou, [[G1488]] Lord? [[G2962]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said, [[G2036]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] thou [[G4771]] persecutest: [[G1377]] hard [[G4642]] for thee [[G4671]] to kick [[G2979]] against [[G4314]] the pricks. [[G2759]]

### 6
And [[G5037]] he trembling [[G5141]] and [[G2532]] astonished [[G2284]] said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] what [[G5101]] wilt thou [[G2309]] me [[G3165]] have to [[G4160]] do? [[G4160]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Arise, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] go [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] it shall be told [[G2980]] thee [[G4671]] what [[G5101]] thou [[G4571]] must [[G1163]] do. [[G4160]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] which [[G3588]] journeyed [[G4922]] with [[G846]] him [[G846]] stood [[G2476]] speechless, [[G1769]] hearing [[G191]] a [[G3303]] voice, [[G5456]] but [[G1161]] seeing [[G2334]] no man. [[G3367]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] Saul [[G4569]] arose [[G1453]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] and when [[G1161]] his [[G846]] eyes were [[G3788]] opened, [[G455]] he saw [[G991]] no man: [[G3762]] but [[G1161]] they led by the hand, [[G5496]] him [[G846]] and brought [[G1521]] into [[G1519]] Damascus. [[G1154]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he was [[G2258]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] without [[G3361]] sight, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] neither [[G3756]] did eat [[G5315]] nor [[G3761]] drink. [[G4095]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] a certain [[G5100]] disciple [[G3101]] at [[G1722]] Damascus, [[G1154]] named [[G3686]] Ananias; [[G367]] and [[G2532]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] in [[G1722]] a vision, [[G3705]] Ananias. [[G367]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Arise, [[G450]] and go [[G4198]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] street [[G4505]] which [[G3588]] is called [[G2564]] Straight, [[G2117]] and [[G2532]] inquire for [[G2212]] in [[G1722]] the house [[G3614]] of Judas [[G2455]] called [[G3686]] Saul, [[G4569]] of Tarsus: [[G5018]] for, [[G1063]] behold, [[G2400]] he prayeth, [[G4336]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] hath seen [[G1492]] in [[G1722]] a vision [[G3705]] a man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Ananias [[G367]] coming in, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] putting [[G2007]] hand [[G5495]] on him, [[G846]] that [[G3704]] he might receive his sight. [[G308]]

### 13
Then [[G1161]] Ananias [[G367]] answered, [[G611]] Lord, [[G2962]] I have heard [[G191]] by [[G575]] many [[G4183]] of [[G4012]] this [[G5127]] man, [[G435]] how much [[G3745]] evil [[G2556]] he hath done [[G4160]] to thy [[G4675]] saints [[G40]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem: [[G2419]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] here [[G5602]] he hath [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] from [[G3844]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] to bind [[G1210]] all [[G3956]] that call on [[G1941]] thy [[G4675]] name. [[G3686]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Go thy way: [[G4198]] for [[G3754]] he [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] a chosen [[G1589]] vessel [[G4632]] unto me, [[G3427]] to bear [[G941]] my [[G3450]] name [[G3686]] before [[G1799]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kings, [[G935]] and [[G5037]] the children [[G5207]] of Israel: [[G2474]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] will shew [[G5263]] him [[G846]] how great things [[G3745]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] suffer [[G3958]] for [[G5228]] my [[G3450]] name's sake. [[G3686]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] Ananias [[G367]] went his way, [[G565]] and [[G2532]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house; [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] putting his [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] Brother [[G80]] Saul, [[G4549]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] that [[G3588]] appeared [[G3700]] unto thee [[G4671]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] as [[G3739]] thou camest, [[G2064]] hath sent [[G649]] me, [[G3165]] that [[G3704]] thou mightest receive thy sight, [[G308]] and [[G2532]] be filled [[G4130]] with the Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] there fell [[G634]] from [[G575]] his [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] as it had been [[G5616]] scales: [[G3013]] and [[G5037]] he received sight [[G308]] forthwith, [[G3916]] and [[G2532]] arose, [[G450]] and was baptized. [[G907]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] when he had received [[G2983]] meat, [[G5160]] he was strengthened. [[G1765]] Then [[G1161]] was [[G1096]] Saul [[G4569]] certain [[G5100]] days [[G2250]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] which [[G3588]] were at [[G1722]] Damascus. [[G1154]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] straightway [[G2112]] he preached [[G2784]] Christ [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] that [[G3754]] he [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] were amazed, [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] said; [[G3004]] Is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] he that [[G3588]] destroyed [[G4199]] them which [[G3588]] called on [[G1941]] this [[G5124]] name [[G3686]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] hither [[G5602]] for [[G1519]] that intent, [[G5124]] that [[G2443]] he might bring [[G71]] them [[G846]] bound [[G1210]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] chief [[G749]] priests? [[G749]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] Saul [[G4569]] the more [[G3123]] increased in [[G1743]] strength, [[G1743]] and [[G2532]] confounded [[G4797]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] which [[G3588]] dwelt [[G2730]] at [[G1722]] Damascus, [[G1154]] proving [[G4822]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] very [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] after that [[G5613]] many [[G2425]] days [[G2250]] were fulfilled, [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] took counsel [[G4823]] to kill [[G337]] him: [[G846]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] their [[G846]]  laying [[G3588]] await was [[G1917]] known [[G1097]] of [[G4569]] Saul. [[G4569]] And [[G5037]] they watched [[G3906]] the [[G3588]] gates [[G4439]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] to [[G3704]] kill [[G337]] him. [[G846]]

### 25
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] took [[G2983]] him [[G846]] by night, [[G3571]] and let [[G2524]] down [[G5465]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] wall [[G5038]] in [[G1722]] a basket. [[G4711]]

### 26
And [[G1161]]  when [[G3588]] Saul [[G4569]] was come [[G3854]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] he assayed [[G3987]] to join himself [[G2853]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3101]] disciples: [[G3101]] but [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] they were [[G5399]] afraid [[G5399]] of him, [[G846]] and believed [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2076]] a disciple. [[G3101]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] Barnabas [[G921]] took [[G1949]] him, [[G846]] and brought [[G71]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles, [[G652]] and [[G2532]] declared [[G1334]] unto them [[G846]] how [[G4459]] he had seen [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] he had spoken to [[G2980]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] he had preached boldly [[G3955]] at [[G1722]] Damascus [[G1154]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G2424]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] he was [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] them [[G846]] coming in [[G1531]] and [[G2532]] going out [[G1607]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] he spake boldly [[G3955]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G5037]] disputed [[G4802]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Grecians: [[G1675]] but [[G1161]] they went [[G3588]] about [[G2021]] to slay [[G337]] him. [[G846]]

### 30
when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] knew, [[G1921]] they brought down [[G2609]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and [[G2532]] sent forth [[G1821]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Tarsus. [[G5019]]

### 31
Then [[G3767]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] rest [[G1515]] throughout [[G2596]] all [[G3650]] Judaea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Galilee [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] Samaria, [[G4540]] and were edified; [[G3618]] and [[G2532]] walking [[G4198]] in the [[G3588]] fear [[G5401]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] in the [[G3588]] comfort of [[G3874]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] were multiplied. [[G4129]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as Peter [[G4074]] passed [[G1330]] throughout [[G1223]] all [[G3956]] he came down [[G2718]] also [[G2532]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] which [[G3588]] dwelt [[G2730]] at Lydda. [[G3069]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] there [[G1563]] he found [[G2147]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G444]] named [[G3686]] Aeneas, [[G132]] which [[G3739]] had kept his [[G2621]] bed [[G2895]] eight [[G3638]] years, [[G2094]] and was [[G2258]] sick of the palsy. [[G3886]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Aeneas, [[G132]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] maketh whole: [[G2390]] thee [[G4571]] arise, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] make bed. [[G4766]]  thy [[G4572]] And [[G2532]] he arose [[G450]] immediately. [[G2112]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] dwelt [[G2730]] at Lydda [[G3069]] and [[G2532]] Saron [[G4565]] saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] and turned [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 36
Now [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] at [[G1722]] Joppa [[G2445]] a certain [[G5100]] disciple [[G3102]] named [[G3686]] Tabitha, [[G5000]] which [[G3739]] by interpretation [[G1329]] is called [[G3004]] Dorcas: [[G1393]] this woman [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] full [[G4134]] of good [[G18]] works [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] almsdeeds [[G1654]] which [[G3739]] she did. [[G4160]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] it came to pass [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] that she [[G846]] was sick, [[G770]] and died: [[G599]] when [[G1161]] whom [[G846]] they had washed, [[G3068]] they laid [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] an upper chamber. [[G5253]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] forasmuch as [[G5607]] Lydda [[G3069]] was nigh [[G1451]] to [[G2445]] Joppa, [[G2445]] the [[G3588]] and had [[G191]] disciples [[G3101]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Peter [[G4074]] was [[G2076]] there, [[G1722]]  they [[G846]] sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] two [[G1417]] men, [[G435]] desiring that [[G3870]] not [[G3361]] he would [[G3635]] delay [[G3635]] to come [[G1330]] to [[G2193]] them. [[G846]]

### 39
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] arose [[G450]] and went with [[G4905]] them. [[G846]] When [[G3739]] he was come, [[G3854]] they brought him [[G321]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] upper chamber: [[G5253]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] widows [[G5503]] stood by [[G3936]] him [[G846]] weeping, [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] shewing [[G1925]] the coats [[G5509]] and [[G2532]] garments [[G2440]] which [[G3745]] Dorcas [[G1393]] made, [[G4160]] while she was [[G5607]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] put them [[G1544]] all [[G3956]] forth, [[G1854]] and kneeled down, [[G5087]] and prayed; [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] turning [[G1994]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] said, [[G2036]] Tabitha, [[G5000]] arise. [[G450]] And [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] opened [[G455]] her [[G846]] eyes: [[G3788]] and when [[G2532]] she saw [[G1492]] Peter, [[G4074]] she sat up. [[G339]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] he gave [[G1325]] her [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]] and lifted up, [[G450]] her [[G846]] and [[G1161]] when he had called [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] widows, [[G5503]] presented [[G3936]] her [[G846]] alive. [[G2198]]

### 42
And [[G1161]] it was [[G1096]] known [[G1110]] throughout [[G2596]] all [[G3650]] Joppa; [[G2445]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 43
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that he [[G846]] tarried [[G3306]] many [[G2425]] days [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] Joppa [[G2445]] with [[G3844]] one [[G5100]] Simon [[G4613]] a tanner. [[G1038]]
