### 1
Then [[G1161]] Agrippa [[G67]] said [[G5346]] unto [[G4314]] Paul, [[G3972]] Thou [[G4671]] art permitted [[G2010]] to speak [[G3004]] for [[G5228]] thyself. [[G4572]] Then [[G5119]] Paul stretched [[G3972]] forth [[G1614]] the [[G3588]] hand, [[G5495]] and answered for himself: [[G626]]

### 2
I think [[G2233]] myself [[G1683]] happy, [[G3107]] king [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] because I shall [[G3195]] answer for myself [[G626]] this day [[G4594]] before [[G1909]] thee [[G4675]] touching [[G4012]] all the things [[G3956]] whereof [[G3739]] I am accused [[G1458]] of [[G5259]] the Jews: [[G2453]]

### 3
Especially [[G3122]] thee [[G4571]] to be [[G5607]] expert [[G1109]] in all [[G3956]] customs [[G1485]] and [[G2532]] questions [[G2213]] which are among [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Jews: [[G2453]] wherefore [[G1352]] I [[G1189]] beseech [[G1189]] thee [[G4675]] to hear [[G191]] me [[G3450]] patiently. [[G3116]]

### 4
My [[G3450]] manner of life [[G981]] from [[G1537]] my youth, [[G3503]] which [[G3588]] was [[G1096]] at [[G575]] the first [[G746]] among [[G1722]] mine own [[G3450]] nation [[G1484]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] know [[G2467]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews; [[G2453]]

### 5
Which knew [[G4267]] me [[G3165]] from the beginning, [[G509]] if [[G1437]] they would [[G2309]] testify, [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] most straitest [[G196]] sect [[G139]] of our [[G2251]] religion [[G2356]] I lived [[G2198]] a Pharisee. [[G5330]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I stand [[G2476]] and am judged [[G2919]] for [[G1909]] the hope [[G1680]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1860]] promise [[G1860]] made [[G1096]] of [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] unto [[G4314]] our [[G3962]] fathers: [[G3962]]

### 7
Unto [[G1519]] which [[G3739]] our [[G2257]]  twelve [[G3588]] tribes, [[G1429]] instantly [[G1722]] serving [[G3000]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night, [[G3571]] hope [[G1679]] to come. [[G2658]] For [[G4012]] which [[G3739]] hope's sake, [[G1680]] king [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] I am accused [[G1458]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 8
Why [[G5101]] should it be thought [[G2919]] a thing incredible [[G571]] with [[G3844]] you, [[G5213]] that [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] should raise [[G1453]] the dead? [[G3498]]

### 9
I [[G1473]] verily [[G3303]] thought [[G1380]] with myself, [[G1683]] that I ought [[G1163]] to do [[G4238]] many things [[G4183]] contrary [[G1727]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3480]] Nazareth. [[G3480]]

### 10
Which thing [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] I [[G4160]] did [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem: [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] the [[G3588]] of [[G40]] saints [[G40]] I [[G1473]] did up [[G2623]] shut [[G2623]] in prison, [[G5438]] having received [[G2983]] authority [[G1849]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] chief priests; [[G749]] and [[G5037]] when they [[G846]] were put to death, [[G337]] I gave against [[G2702]] my voice [[G5586]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] I punished [[G5097]] them [[G846]] oft [[G4178]] in [[G2596]] every [[G3956]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and compelled [[G315]] to blaspheme; [[G987]] and [[G5037]] exceedingly [[G4057]] being [[G1693]] mad [[G1693]] against them, [[G846]] I persecuted [[G1377]] even [[G2193]] unto [[G1519]] strange [[G1854]] cities. [[G4172]]

### 12
Whereupon [[G1722]] as [[G2532]] I went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Damascus [[G1154]] with [[G3326]] authority [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] commission [[G2011]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]]

### 13
At O [[G2250]] midday, [[G3319]] king, [[G935]] I saw [[G1492]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] a light [[G5457]] from heaven, [[G3771]] above [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] brightness [[G2987]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2246]] sun, [[G2246]] shining round about [[G4034]] me [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] which journeyed [[G4198]] with [[G4862]] me. [[G1698]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] when we [[G2257]] were all [[G3956]] fallen [[G2667]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] speaking [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] saying [[G3004]] in the [[G3588]] Hebrew [[G1446]] tongue, [[G1258]] Saul, [[G4549]] Saul, [[G4549]] why [[G5101]] persecutest [[G1377]] thou me? [[G3165]] hard [[G4642]] for thee [[G4671]] to kick [[G2979]] against [[G4314]] the pricks. [[G2759]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] said, [[G2036]] Who [[G5101]] art thou, [[G1488]] Lord? [[G2962]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] thou [[G4771]] persecutest. [[G1377]]

### 16
But [[G235]] rise, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] stand [[G2476]] upon [[G1909]] thy [[G4675]] feet: [[G4228]] for [[G1063]] I have appeared [[G3700]] unto thee [[G4671]] for [[G1519]] this purpose, [[G5124]] to make [[G4400]] thee [[G4571]] a minister [[G5257]] and [[G2532]] a witness [[G3144]] both [[G5037]] of these things which [[G3739]] thou hast seen, [[G1492]] and [[G5037]] of those things in the which [[G3739]] I will appear [[G3700]] unto thee; [[G4671]]

### 17
Delivering [[G1807]] thee [[G4571]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] unto [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] now [[G3568]] I send [[G649]] thee, [[G4571]]

### 18
To open [[G455]] their [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] to turn [[G1994]] from [[G575]] darkness [[G4655]] to [[G1519]] light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1849]] of [[G4567]] Satan [[G4567]] unto [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G3588]] they [[G846]] may receive [[G2983]] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] inheritance [[G2819]] among [[G1722]] them which [[G3588]] are sanctified [[G37]] by faith [[G4102]] that [[G3588]] is in [[G1519]] me. [[G1691]]

### 19
Whereupon, [[G3606]] O king [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] I was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] disobedient [[G545]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3770]] heavenly [[G3770]] vision: [[G3701]]

### 20
But [[G235]] shewed [[G518]] first [[G4412]] them [[G3588]] unto [[G1722]] of [[G1722]] Damascus, [[G1154]] and [[G2532]] at Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G5037]] throughout [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] coasts [[G5561]] of [[G2449]] Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1484]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] that they should repent [[G3340]] and [[G2532]] turn [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] and do [[G4238]] works [[G2041]] meet [[G514]]  for [[G3588]] repentance. [[G3341]]

### 21
For [[G1752]] these causes [[G5130]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] caught [[G4815]] me [[G3165]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and went about [[G3987]] to kill [[G1315]]

### 22
therefore [[G3767]] Having [[G5177]] obtained [[G5177]] help [[G1947]] of [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] I continue [[G2476]] unto [[G891]] this [[G3778]] day, [[G2250]] witnessing [[G3140]] both [[G5037]] to small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great, [[G3173]] saying [[G3004]] none [[G3762]] other things [[G1622]] those which [[G3739]] than [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] did say [[G2980]] should [[G3195]] come: [[G1096]]

### 23
That [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] should [[G3195]] suffer, [[G3805]] that [[G1487]] he should be the first [[G4413]] that should rise [[G386]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] and should shew [[G2605]] light [[G5457]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2992]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1484]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] as he [[G846]] thus [[G5023]] spake for himself, [[G626]] Festus [[G5347]] said [[G5346]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] Paul, [[G3972]] thou art beside thyself; [[G3105]] much [[G4183]] learning [[G1121]] doth make [[G4062]] thee [[G4571]] mad. [[G3130]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G5346]] not [[G3756]] I am [[G3105]] mad, [[G3105]] most noble [[G2903]] Festus; [[G5347]] but [[G235]] speak forth [[G669]] the words [[G4487]] of truth [[G225]] and [[G2532]] soberness. [[G4997]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] knoweth [[G1987]] of [[G4012]] these things, [[G5130]] before [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] I speak [[G2980]] freely: [[G3955]] for [[G1063]] I am persuaded [[G3982]] none [[G3756]] that [[G3762]] of these things [[G5130]] are hidden from [[G2990]] him; [[G846]] for [[G1063]] this thing [[G5124]] was [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] done [[G4238]] in [[G1722]] a corner. [[G1137]]

### 27
King [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] believest thou [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] prophets? [[G4396]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] thou believest. [[G4100]]

### 28
Then [[G1161]] Agrippa [[G67]] said [[G5346]] unto [[G4314]] Paul, [[G3972]] Almost [[G1722]]  thou [[G3641]] persuadest [[G3982]] me [[G3165]] to be [[G1096]] a Christian. [[G5546]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] said, [[G2036]] I would that [[G2172]] to [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] thou, [[G4571]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that hear [[G191]] me [[G3450]] this day, [[G4594]] were [[G1096]] both [[G2532]] almost, [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] altogether [[G1722]] such [[G5108]] as [[G3697]] I [[G2504]] am, [[G1510]] except [[G3924]] these [[G5130]] bonds. [[G1199]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] when he [[G846]] thus [[G5023]] had [[G2036]] spoken, [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] rose up, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] governor, [[G2232]] and [[G5037]] Bernice, [[G959]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that sat [[G4775]] with [[G846]] them: [[G846]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] when they were gone aside, [[G402]] they talked [[G2980]] between [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] doeth [[G4238]] nothing [[G3762]] worthy [[G514]] of death [[G2288]] or [[G2228]] of bonds. [[G1199]]

### 32
Then [[G1161]] said [[G5346]] Agrippa [[G67]] unto [[G5347]] Festus, [[G5347]] This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] might [[G1410]] have been set at liberty, [[G630]] if [[G1487]] not [[G3361]] he had [[G1941]] appealed [[G1941]] unto Caesar. [[G2541]]
