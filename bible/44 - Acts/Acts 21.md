### 1
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that after [[G5613]] we [[G2248]] were gotten [[G645]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and had launched, [[G321]] we came [[G2064]] with a straight course [[G2113]] unto [[G1519]] Coos, [[G2972]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] following [[G1836]] unto [[G1519]] Rhodes, [[G4499]] and from thence [[G2547]] unto [[G1519]] Patara: [[G3959]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] finding [[G2147]] a ship [[G4143]] sailing over [[G1276]] unto [[G1519]] Phenicia, [[G5403]] we went aboard, [[G1910]] and set forth. [[G321]]

### 3
Now [[G1161]] when we had discovered [[G398]] Cyprus, [[G2954]] we [[G2532]] left [[G2641]] it [[G846]] on the left hand, [[G2176]] and sailed [[G4126]] into [[G1519]] Syria, [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] landed [[G2609]] at [[G1519]] Tyre: [[G5184]] for [[G1063]] there [[G1566]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] was [[G2258]] to unlade [[G670]]  her [[G3588]] burden. [[G1117]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] finding [[G429]] disciples, we [[G3101]] tarried [[G1961]] there [[G847]] seven [[G2033]] days: [[G2250]] who [[G3748]] said [[G3004]] to [[G3972]] Paul [[G3972]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] not [[G3361]] that he should [[G305]] go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] we [[G2248]] had [[G1096]] accomplished [[G1822]]  those [[G3588]] days, [[G2250]] we departed [[G1831]] and went our way; [[G4198]] and they all [[G3956]] brought on our way, [[G4311]] us [[G2248]] with [[G4862]] wives [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children, [[G5043]] till [[G2193]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city: [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] we kneeled down [[G5087]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] shore, [[G123]] and prayed. [[G4336]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] when we had taken our leave [[G782]] one of another, [[G240]] we took [[G1910]] ship; [[G4143]] and [[G1161]] they [[G1565]] returned again. [[G5290]] home [[G2398]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] when we [[G2249]] had finished [[G1274]] course [[G4144]] from [[G575]] Tyre, [[G5184]] we came [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Ptolemais, [[G4424]] and [[G2532]] saluted [[G782]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] and abode [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] them [[G846]] one [[G1520]] day. [[G2250]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] next [[G1887]] we that [[G3588]] were of company [[G4012]] Paul's [[G3972]] departed, [[G1831]] and came [[G2064]] unto [[G1519]] Caesarea: [[G2542]] and [[G2532]] we entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Philip [[G5376]] the [[G3588]] evangelist, [[G2099]] which [[G3588]] was [[G5607]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] seven; [[G2033]] and abode [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] the same man [[G5129]] had [[G2258]] four [[G5064]] daughters, [[G2364]] virgins, [[G3933]] which did prophesy. [[G4395]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] as we [[G2257]] tarried [[G1961]] many [[G4119]] days, [[G2250]] there came down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Judaea [[G2449]] a certain [[G5100]] prophet, [[G4396]] named [[G3686]] Agabus. [[G13]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] when he was come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] us, [[G2248]] he [[G2532]] took [[G142]] Paul's [[G3972]] girdle, [[G2223]] and [[G5037]] bound [[G1210]] his own [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] feet, [[G4228]] and said, [[G2036]] Thus [[G3592]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] So [[G3779]] shall [[G1210]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] bind [[G1210]] the [[G3588]] man [[G435]] that [[G3739]] owneth [[G2076]] this [[G3778]] girdle, [[G2223]] and [[G2532]] shall deliver [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] the hands [[G5495]] of the Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] we heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] both [[G5037]] we, [[G2249]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] of that place, [[G1786]] besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to [[G1519]] go up [[G305]] to Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 13
Then [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] answered, [[G611]] What [[G5101]] mean ye [[G4160]] to weep [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] to break [[G4919]] mine [[G3450]] heart? [[G2588]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] am [[G2192]] ready [[G2093]] not [[G3756]] to be bound [[G1210]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] to die [[G599]] at [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 14
And when [[G1161]] he [[G846]] not [[G3361]] would be [[G3982]] persuaded, [[G3982]] we ceased, [[G2270]] saying, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] be done. [[G1096]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] those [[G3778]] days we took up our [[G2250]] carriages, [[G643]] and went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 16
There [[G1161]] went [[G4905]] with [[G4862]] us [[G2254]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples [[G3101]] of [[G575]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and brought with them [[G71]] one [[G5100]] Mnason [[G3416]] of Cyprus, [[G2953]] an old [[G744]] disciple, [[G3101]] with [[G3844]] whom [[G3739]] we should lodge. [[G3579]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] when we [[G2257]] were come [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] received [[G1209]] us [[G2248]] gladly. [[G780]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] following [[G1966]] Paul [[G3972]] went in [[G1524]] with [[G4862]] us [[G2254]] unto [[G4314]] James; [[G2385]] and [[G5037]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] were present. [[G3854]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] when he had saluted [[G782]] them, [[G846]] he declared [[G1834]] particularly [[G1538]] what things [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] had wrought [[G4160]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] by [[G1223]] his [[G846]] ministry. [[G1248]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] when [[G191]] heard [[G191]] they glorified [[G1392]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G5037]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou seest, [[G2334]] brother, [[G80]] how many [[G4214]] thousands [[G3461]] of Jews [[G2453]] there are [[G1526]] which [[G3588]] believe; [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] they are [[G5225]] all [[G3956]] zealous [[G2207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law: [[G3551]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] they are informed [[G2727]] of [[G4012]] thee, [[G4675]] that [[G3754]] thou teachest [[G1321]] all [[G3956]] the Jews [[G2453]] which [[G3588]] are among [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles to [[G1484]] forsake [[G646]] Moses, [[G3475]] saying that [[G3004]] they [[G846]] not [[G3361]] ought to [[G4059]] circumcise [[G4059]] children, [[G5043]] neither [[G3366]] to walk after [[G4043]] the [[G3588]] customs. [[G1485]]

### 22
What [[G5101]] is it [[G2076]] therefore? [[G3767]] the multitude [[G4128]] must [[G1163]] needs [[G3843]] come together: [[G4905]] for [[G1063]] they will hear [[G191]] that [[G3754]] thou art come. [[G2064]]

### 23
Do [[G4160]] therefore [[G3767]] this [[G5124]] that [[G3739]] we say [[G3004]] to thee: [[G4671]] We [[G2254]] have [[G1526]] four [[G5064]] men [[G435]] which have [[G2192]] a vow [[G2171]] on [[G1909]] them; [[G1438]]

### 24
Them [[G5128]] take, [[G3880]] and purify thyself [[G48]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] be at charges [[G1159]] with [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they may shave [[G3587]] heads: [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] may know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] those things, [[G3739]] whereof they were informed [[G2727]] concerning [[G4012]] thee, [[G4675]] are [[G2076]] nothing; [[G3762]] but [[G235]] thou thyself [[G846]] also [[G2532]] walkest orderly, [[G4748]] and keepest [[G5442]] the [[G3588]] law. [[G3551]]

### 25
As [[G1161]] touching [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] which believe, [[G4100]] we [[G2249]] have written [[G1989]] concluded that [[G2919]] they [[G846]] observe [[G5083]] no [[G3367]] such thing, [[G5108]] save only that [[G1487]] they keep [[G5442]] themselves [[G846]] from [[G5037]] offered to idols, [[G1494]] and [[G2532]]  from [[G3588]] blood, [[G129]] and [[G2532]] from strangled, [[G4156]] and [[G2532]] from fornication. [[G4202]]

### 26
Then [[G5119]] Paul [[G3972]] took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] men, [[G435]] the [[G3588]] and [[G2192]] next [[G2192]] day [[G2250]] purifying himself [[G48]] with [[G4862]] them [[G846]] entered [[G1524]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] to signify [[G1229]] the [[G3588]] accomplishment [[G1604]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2250]] days [[G2250]] of [[G49]] purification, [[G49]] until [[G2193]] that [[G3739]] should be [[G4374]] an offering [[G4376]] offered [[G4374]] for [[G5228]] every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of them. [[G846]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] days [[G2250]] were almost [[G3195]] ended, [[G4931]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] which [[G575]] were of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Asia, [[G773]] when they saw [[G2300]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] stirred up [[G4797]] all [[G3956]] people, [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G1911]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] him, [[G846]]

### 28
Crying out, [[G2896]] Men [[G435]] of Israel, [[G2475]] help: [[G997]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] that teacheth [[G1321]] all [[G3956]] every where [[G3837]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] this [[G5127]] place: [[G5117]] and [[G5037]] further [[G2089]] brought [[G1521]] Greeks [[G1672]] also [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] hath polluted [[G2840]] this [[G5126]] holy [[G40]] place. [[G5117]]

### 29
(For [[G1063]] they had [[G2258]] seen before [[G4308]] with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] Trophimus [[G5161]] an Ephesian, [[G2180]] whom [[G3739]] they supposed [[G3543]] that [[G3754]] Paul [[G2411]]  had [[G3972]] brought [[G1521]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple.) [[G2411]]

### 30
And [[G5037]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] was [[G1096]] moved, [[G2795]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] ran together: [[G4890]] and [[G2532]] they took [[G1949]] Paul, [[G3972]] and drew [[G1670]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] temple: [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] forthwith [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] doors were [[G2374]] shut. [[G2808]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] as they went about [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] tidings [[G5334]] came unto [[G305]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4686]] band, [[G4686]] that [[G3754]] all [[G3650]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] was in an uproar. [[G4797]]

### 32
Who [[G3739]] immediately [[G1824]] took [[G3880]] soldiers [[G4757]] and [[G2532]] centurions, [[G1543]] and ran down [[G2701]] unto [[G1909]] them: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] when [[G1492]] saw [[G1492]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] soldiers, [[G4757]] they left [[G3973]] beating [[G5180]] of [[G3972]] Paul. [[G3972]]

### 33
Then [[G5119]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] came near, [[G1448]] and took [[G1949]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] commanded [[G2753]] to be bound [[G1210]] with two [[G1417]] chains; [[G254]] and [[G2532]] demanded [[G4441]] who [[G5101]] he was, [[G1498]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] he had [[G2076]] done. [[G4160]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] some [[G243]] cried [[G994]] one thing, [[G5100]] some another, [[G243]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] multitude: [[G3793]] and [[G1161]] when he could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] certainty [[G804]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] tumult, [[G2351]] he commanded [[G2753]] him [[G846]] to be carried [[G71]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] castle. [[G3925]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] he came [[G1096]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] stairs, [[G304]] so it was, [[G4819]] that he was [[G846]] borne [[G941]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] violence [[G970]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3793]] people. [[G3793]]

### 36
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] followed after, [[G190]] crying, [[G2896]] Away with [[G142]] him. [[G846]]

### 37
And [[G5037]] as [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] was [[G3195]] to be led [[G1521]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] castle, [[G3925]] he said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto chief [[G5506]] captain, [[G5506]] May [[G1832]] I [[G3427]] speak [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] thee? [[G4571]] Who [[G3588]] said, [[G5346]] Canst thou speak [[G1097]] Greek? [[G1676]]

### 38
Art [[G1488]] not [[G3756]] thou [[G4771]] that [[G3588]] Egyptian, [[G124]] which [[G3588]] before [[G4253]] these [[G5130]] days [[G2250]] madest an uproar, [[G387]] and [[G2532]] leddest out [[G1806]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] four thousand [[G5070]] men [[G435]]  that were [[G3588]] murderers? [[G4607]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] said, [[G2036]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] a man [[G444]] a Jew [[G2453]] of Tarsus, [[G5018]] in [[G3588]] Cilicia, [[G2791]] a [[G3588]] citizen [[G4177]] no [[G3756]] of [[G767]] mean [[G767]] city: [[G4172]] and, [[G1161]] I beseech [[G1189]] thee, [[G4675]] suffer [[G2010]] me [[G3427]] to speak [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] when he had given [[G2010]] him [[G846]] licence, [[G2010]] Paul [[G3972]] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] stairs, [[G304]] and beckoned [[G2678]] with the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2992]] people. [[G2992]] And [[G1161]] when there was made [[G1096]] a great [[G4183]] silence, [[G4602]] he spake unto [[G4377]] in the [[G3588]] Hebrew [[G1446]] tongue, [[G1258]] saying, [[G3004]]
