### 1
The [[G3588]] former [[G4413]] treatise [[G3056]] have I made, [[G4160]] O [[G5599]] Theophilus, [[G2321]] of [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] began [[G756]] both [[G5037]] to do [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] teach, [[G1321]]

### 2
Until [[G891]] the day [[G2250]] in which [[G3739]] he was taken up, [[G353]] after that he had given [[G1781]] through [[G1223]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] commandments [[G1781]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G652]] apostles [[G652]] whom [[G3739]] he had chosen: [[G1586]]

### 3
To whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] he shewed [[G3936]] himself [[G1438]] alive [[G2198]] after [[G3326]] his [[G846]] passion [[G3958]] by [[G1722]] many [[G4183]] infallible proofs, [[G5039]] being seen [[G3700]] of [[G1223]] them [[G846]] forty [[G5062]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] speaking [[G3004]] the things [[G3588]] of to [[G4012]] pertaining [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]]

### 4
And, [[G2532]] being assembled together [[G4871]] with commanded [[G3853]] them [[G846]] that they should [[G2414]] not [[G3361]] depart [[G5563]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] but [[G235]] wait for [[G4037]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] which, [[G3739]] ye have heard [[G191]] of me. [[G3450]]

### 5
For [[G3754]] John [[G2491]] truly [[G3303]] baptized [[G907]] with water; [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] shall be baptized [[G907]] with [[G1722]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] not [[G3756]] many [[G4183]] days [[G2250]] hence. [[G3326]]

### 6
they [[G3588]] When were come [[G4905]] therefore [[G3767]] together, [[G4905]] they asked [[G1905]] of him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] wilt [[G1487]] at [[G1722]] thou restore [[G600]] this [[G5129]] time [[G5550]] again [[G600]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] to [[G2474]] Israel? [[G2474]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] is [[G2076]] It to [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] for you [[G5216]] know [[G1097]] the times [[G5550]] or [[G2228]] the seasons, [[G2540]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] hath put [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G2398]] power. [[G1849]]

### 8
But [[G235]] ye shall receive [[G2983]] power, [[G1411]] after that is [[G1904]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] come [[G1904]] upon [[G1909]] you: [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] ye shall be [[G2071]] witnesses [[G3144]] unto me [[G3427]] both [[G5037]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] in Samaria, [[G4540]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G2193]] the uttermost [[G2078]] part of [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when he had spoken [[G2036]] these things, [[G5023]] while [[G991]] they [[G846]] beheld, [[G991]] he was taken up; [[G1869]] and [[G2532]] a cloud [[G3507]] received [[G5274]] him [[G846]] out of [[G575]] their [[G846]] sight. [[G3788]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] while [[G5613]] they looked stedfastly [[G816]] toward [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] as up, [[G4198]] he [[G846]] went [[G4198]] behold, [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] men [[G435]] stood by [[G3936]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] white [[G3022]] apparel; [[G2066]]

### 11
Which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Ye men [[G435]] of Galilee, [[G1057]] why [[G5101]] stand ye [[G2476]] gazing up [[G1689]] into [[G1519]] heaven? [[G3772]] this same [[G3778]] Jesus, [[G2424]] which is taken up [[G353]] from [[G575]] you [[G5216]] into [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] so [[G3779]] shall [[G2064]] come [[G2064]] in like manner [[G5158]] as [[G3739]] ye have seen [[G2300]] him [[G846]] go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 12
Then [[G5119]] returned they [[G5290]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] from [[G575]] the mount [[G3735]] called [[G2564]] Olivet, [[G1638]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] from [[G1451]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] a sabbath day's [[G4521]] journey. [[G3598]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] they were [[G2258]] come in, [[G1525]] they went up [[G305]] into [[G1519]]  an upper [[G3588]] room, [[G5253]] where [[G3757]] abode [[G2650]] both [[G5037]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] Andrew, [[G406]] Philip, [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] Thomas, [[G2381]] Bartholomew, [[G918]] and [[G2532]] Matthew, [[G3156]] James [[G2385]] of Alphaeus, [[G256]] and [[G2532]] Simon [[G4613]] Zelotes, [[G2208]] and [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] of James. [[G2385]]

### 14
These [[G3778]] all [[G3956]] continued [[G2258]]  with one [[G4342]] accord [[G3661]]  in [[G3588]] prayer [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] supplication, [[G1162]] with [[G4862]] the women, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] with [[G4862]] his [[G846]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days [[G2250]] Peter [[G4074]] stood up [[G450]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G5037]] said, [[G2036]] (the number [[G3793]] of names [[G3686]] together [[G1909]] were [[G2258]] about [[G5613]] an hundred [[G1540]] and twenty,) [[G1501]]

### 16
Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] this [[G3778]] scripture must [[G1124]] needs [[G1163]] have been fulfilled, [[G4137]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] by [[G1223]] the mouth [[G4750]] of David [[G1138]] spake before [[G4277]] concerning [[G4012]] Judas, [[G2455]] which was [[G1096]] guide [[G3595]] to them that took [[G4815]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] he [[G2674]] was [[G2258]] numbered [[G2674]] with [[G4862]] us, [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] had obtained [[G2975]] part [[G2819]] of this [[G3778]] ministry. [[G1248]]

### 18
Now [[G3767]] this man [[G3778]] purchased [[G2932]] a field [[G5564]] with [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] reward [[G3408]] of [[G93]] iniquity; [[G93]] and [[G2532]] falling [[G1096]] headlong, [[G4248]] he burst asunder [[G2997]] in the midst, [[G3319]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] bowels gushed [[G4698]] out. [[G1632]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] it was [[G1096]] known [[G1110]] unto all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] dwellers [[G2730]] at Jerusalem; [[G2419]] insomuch as [[G5620]] that [[G1565]] field is [[G5564]] called [[G2564]] in their [[G846]] proper [[G2398]] tongue, [[G1258]] Aceldama, [[G184]] that [[G5124]] is to say, [[G2076]] The field [[G5564]] of blood. [[G129]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the book [[G976]] of Psalms, [[G5568]] his [[G846]] Let [[G1096]] habitation [[G1886]] be [[G1096]] desolate, [[G2048]] and [[G2532]] let [[G2077]] no [[G3361]] man dwell [[G2730]] therein: [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] bishoprick [[G1984]] let [[G2983]] another [[G2087]] take. [[G2983]]

### 21
Wherefore [[G3767]] of these men [[G435]] which [[G3588]] have companied [[G4905]] with us [[G2254]] all [[G3956]] the time [[G5550]] that [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] went in [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] out [[G1831]] among [[G1909]] us, [[G2248]]

### 22
Beginning [[G756]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] of John, [[G2491]] unto [[G2193]] that same [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] that [[G3739]] he was taken up [[G353]] from [[G575]] us, [[G2257]] must be ordained to [[G1096]] one [[G1520]] be [[G1096]] a witness [[G3144]] with [[G4862]] us [[G2254]] of his [[G846]] resurrection. [[G386]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] they appointed [[G2476]] two, [[G1417]] Joseph [[G2501]] called [[G2564]] Barsabas, [[G923]] who [[G3739]] was surnamed [[G1941]] Justus, [[G2459]] and [[G2532]] Matthias. [[G3159]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] they prayed, [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Thou, [[G4771]] Lord, [[G2962]] which knowest the hearts [[G2589]] of all [[G3956]] shew [[G322]] whether [[G3739]] of [[G1537]] these [[G5130]] two [[G1417]] thou hast chosen, [[G1586]]

### 25
That he may take [[G2983]] part [[G2819]] of this [[G3778]] ministry [[G1248]] and [[G2532]] apostleship, [[G651]] from [[G1537]] which [[G3739]] Judas [[G2455]] by transgression [[G3845]] fell, that he might [[G4198]] go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] his own [[G2398]] place. [[G5117]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] they gave forth [[G1325]] their [[G846]] lots; [[G2819]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lot [[G2819]] fell [[G4098]] upon [[G1909]] Matthias; [[G3159]] and [[G2532]] he was numbered [[G4785]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] eleven [[G1733]] apostles. [[G652]]
