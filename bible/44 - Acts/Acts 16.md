### 1
Then [[G1161]] came he [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Derbe [[G1191]] and [[G2532]] Lystra: [[G3082]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a certain [[G5100]] disciple [[G3101]] was [[G2258]] there, [[G1563]] named [[G3686]] Timotheus, [[G5095]] the son [[G5207]] of a certain [[G5100]] woman, [[G1135]] which was a Jewess, [[G2453]] and believed; [[G4103]] but [[G1161]] his father [[G3962]] a Greek: [[G1672]]

### 2
Which [[G3739]] was well reported of [[G3140]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] that were at [[G1722]] Lystra [[G3082]] and [[G2532]] Iconium. [[G2430]]

### 3
Him [[G5126]] would [[G2309]] Paul [[G3972]] have to go forth [[G1831]] with [[G4862]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2983]] and circumcised [[G4059]] him [[G846]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] which were [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] quarters: [[G5117]] for [[G1063]] they knew [[G1492]] all [[G537]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] was [[G5225]] a Greek. [[G1672]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] as [[G5613]] they went through [[G1279]] the [[G3588]] cities, [[G4172]] they delivered [[G3860]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] decrees for to [[G1378]] keep, [[G5442]] that were ordained [[G2919]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] which [[G3588]] were [[G1722]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 5
And were [[G3303]] so [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] established [[G4732]] in [[G2596]] the in [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] increased [[G4052]] number [[G706]] daily. [[G2250]]

### 6
Now [[G1161]] when they had gone throughout [[G1330]] Phrygia [[G5435]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] region [[G5561]] of Galatia, [[G1054]] and were forbidden [[G2967]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] to preach [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] Asia, [[G773]]

### 7
After [[G2596]] they were come [[G2064]] to [[G3465]] Mysia, [[G3465]] they assayed [[G3985]] to go [[G4198]] into [[G2596]] Bithynia: [[G978]] but [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] suffered [[G1439]] them [[G846]] not. [[G3756]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] they passing [[G3928]] by [[G3588]] Mysia [[G3465]] came down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Troas. [[G5174]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] a vision [[G3705]] appeared [[G3700]]  to [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] in [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] night; [[G3571]] There [[G2476]] stood [[G2476]] a man [[G435]] of Macedonia, [[G3110]] and [[G2532]] prayed [[G3870]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Come over [[G1224]] into [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] and help [[G997]] us. [[G2254]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] after [[G5613]] he had seen [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] vision, [[G3705]] immediately [[G2112]] we endeavoured [[G2212]] to go [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] assuredly gathering [[G4822]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] had called [[G4341]] us [[G2248]] for to preach the gospel [[G2097]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 11
Therefore [[G3767]] loosing [[G321]] from [[G575]] Troas, [[G5174]] we came with a straight course [[G2113]] to [[G1519]] Samothracia, [[G4543]] and [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] next [[G1966]] to [[G1519]] Neapolis; [[G3496]]

### 12
And [[G5037]] from thence [[G1564]] to [[G1519]] Philippi, [[G5375]] which [[G3748]] is [[G2076]] the chief [[G4413]] city [[G4172]] of that part [[G3588]] of [[G3109]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] a colony: [[G2862]] and [[G1161]] we were [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] that [[G3778]] city [[G4172]] abiding [[G1304]] certain [[G5100]] days. [[G2250]]

### 13
And [[G5037]] on [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] sabbath [[G4521]] we went [[G1831]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] by [[G3844]] a river side, [[G4215]] where [[G3757]] prayer [[G4335]] was wont [[G3543]] to be made; [[G1511]] and [[G2532]] we sat down, [[G2523]] and spake [[G2980]] unto the [[G3588]] women [[G1135]] which [[G3588]] resorted [[G4905]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] a certain [[G5100]] woman [[G1135]] named [[G3686]] Lydia, [[G3070]] a seller of purple, [[G4211]] of the city [[G4172]] of Thyatira, [[G2363]] which [[G3739]] worshipped [[G4576]] God, [[G2316]] heard [[G191]] whose [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] opened, [[G1272]] that she attended unto [[G4337]] the things which [[G3588]] were spoken [[G2980]] of [[G5259]] Paul. [[G3972]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] she was baptized, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] household, [[G3624]] she besought [[G3870]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1487]] ye have judged [[G2919]] me [[G3165]] to be [[G1511]] faithful [[G4103]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] come [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] house, [[G3624]] and abide [[G3306]] And [[G2532]] she constrained [[G3849]] us. [[G2248]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as we [[G2257]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] prayer, [[G4335]] a certain [[G5100]] damsel [[G3814]] possessed [[G2192]] with a spirit [[G4151]] of divination [[G4436]] met [[G528]] us, [[G2254]] which [[G3748]] brought [[G3930]] her [[G846]] masters [[G2962]] much [[G4183]] gain [[G2039]] by soothsaying: [[G3132]]

### 17
The same [[G3778]] followed [[G2628]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] us, [[G2254]] and cried, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] These [[G3778]] men [[G444]] are [[G1526]] the servants [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] of most [[G5310]] high [[G5310]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3748]] shew unto [[G2605]] us [[G2254]] the way [[G3598]] of salvation. [[G4991]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] did she [[G4160]] many [[G4183]] days. [[G2250]] But [[G1161]] Paul, [[G3972]] being grieved, [[G1278]] turned [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] I command [[G3853]] thee [[G4671]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] to come out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] her. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] he came out [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] when her [[G846]] masters [[G2962]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] of their [[G846]] gains [[G2039]] was gone, [[G1831]] they caught [[G1949]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas, [[G4609]] and drew [[G1670]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] marketplace [[G58]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] rulers, [[G758]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] brought [[G4317]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4755]] magistrates, [[G4755]] saying, [[G2036]] These [[G3778]] men, [[G444]] being [[G5225]] Jews, [[G2453]] do exceedingly trouble [[G1613]] our [[G2257]] city, [[G4172]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] teach [[G2605]] customs, [[G1485]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] are [[G1832]] lawful [[G1832]] for us [[G2254]] to receive, [[G3858]] neither [[G3761]] to observe, [[G4160]] being [[G5607]] Romans. [[G4514]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] rose up together [[G4911]] against [[G2596]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] magistrates [[G4755]] rent off [[G4048]] their [[G846]] clothes, [[G2440]] and commanded [[G2753]] to beat [[G4463]]

### 23
And [[G5037]] when they had laid [[G2007]] many [[G4183]] stripes [[G4127]] upon them, [[G846]] they cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] charging [[G3853]] the [[G3588]] jailor [[G1200]] to keep [[G5083]] them [[G846]] safely: [[G806]]

### 24
Who, [[G3739]] having received [[G2983]] such [[G5108]] a charge, [[G3852]] thrust [[G906]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] inner [[G2082]] prison, [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] made [[G805]] feet [[G4228]] fast [[G805]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] stocks. [[G3586]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] at [[G2596]] midnight [[G3317]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas [[G4609]] prayed, [[G4336]] and sang praises [[G5214]] unto [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] prisoners [[G1198]] heard [[G1874]] them. [[G846]]

### 26
And [[G1161]] suddenly [[G869]] there was [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] earthquake, [[G4578]] so that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] foundations [[G2310]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1201]] prison [[G1201]] were shaken: [[G4531]] and [[G5037]] immediately [[G3916]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] doors [[G2374]] were opened, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] every one's [[G3956]] bands [[G1199]] were loosed. [[G447]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] keeper the [[G1200]] awaking out [[G1853]] of prison [[G1200]] of his sleep, [[G1853]] and [[G2532]] seeing [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] prison [[G5438]] doors [[G2374]] open, [[G455]] he drew out [[G4685]] his sword, [[G3162]] and would [[G3195]] have killed [[G337]] himself, [[G1438]] supposing that [[G3543]] the [[G3588]] prisoners had been [[G1198]] fled. [[G1628]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] cried [[G5455]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] saying, [[G3004]] Do [[G4238]] thyself [[G4572]] no [[G3367]] harm: [[G2556]] for [[G1063]] we are [[G2070]] all [[G537]] here. [[G1759]]

### 29
Then [[G1161]] he called [[G154]] for a light, [[G5457]] and sprang in, [[G1530]] and [[G2532]] came [[G1096]] trembling, [[G1790]] and fell down before [[G4363]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas, [[G4609]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] brought [[G4254]] them [[G846]] out, [[G1854]] and said, [[G5346]] Sirs, [[G2962]] what [[G5101]] must [[G1163]] I [[G3165]] do [[G4160]] to be [[G2443]] saved? [[G4982]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Believe [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] thou [[G4771]] shalt be saved, [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] house. [[G3624]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] they spake [[G2980]] unto him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] were in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] he took [[G3880]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3571]] night, [[G3571]] and washed [[G3068]] stripes; [[G4127]] and [[G2532]] was baptized, [[G907]] he [[G846]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] his, [[G846]] straightway. [[G3916]]

### 34
And [[G5037]] when he had brought [[G321]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] he set before them, [[G3908]] meat [[G5132]] and [[G2532]] rejoiced, [[G21]] believing [[G4100]]  in [[G3588]] God with all his [[G2316]] house. [[G3832]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] when it was [[G1096]] day, [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] magistrates [[G4755]] sent [[G649]] the [[G3588]] serjeants, [[G4465]] saying, [[G3004]] Let [[G630]] those [[G1565]] men [[G444]] go. [[G630]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] the keeper the [[G3588]] of prison [[G1200]] told [[G518]] this [[G5128]] saying [[G3056]] to [[G4314]] Paul, [[G3972]] The [[G3588]] magistrates [[G4755]] have sent [[G649]] to [[G2443]] let you go: [[G630]] now [[G3568]] therefore [[G3767]] depart, [[G1831]] and go [[G4198]] in [[G1722]] peace. [[G1515]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] said [[G5346]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] They have beaten [[G1194]] us [[G2248]] openly [[G1219]] uncondemned, [[G178]] being [[G5225]] Romans, [[G4514]] and have cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison; [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] do they out [[G2977]] thrust [[G1544]] us [[G2248]] privily? [[G2977]] nay [[G3756]] verily; [[G1063]] but [[G235]] let them come [[G2064]] themselves [[G846]] and out. [[G2248]] fetch [[G1806]] us [[G2248]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] serjeants [[G4465]] told [[G312]] these [[G5023]] words [[G4487]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G4755]] magistrates: [[G4755]] and [[G2532]] they feared, [[G5399]] when they heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] they were [[G1526]] Romans. [[G4514]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] and besought [[G3870]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] brought out, [[G1806]] and desired [[G2065]] to depart [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] out of [[G4172]] city. [[G4172]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] they went [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] prison, [[G5438]] and entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] Lydia: [[G3070]] and [[G2532]] when they had seen [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] they comforted [[G3870]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] departed. [[G1831]]
