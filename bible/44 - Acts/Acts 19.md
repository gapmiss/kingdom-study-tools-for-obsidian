### 1
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that, [[G1722]]  while [[G3588]] Apollos [[G625]] was [[G1511]] at [[G1722]] Corinth, [[G2882]] Paul [[G3972]] having passed through [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] upper [[G510]] coasts [[G3313]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus: [[G2181]] and [[G2532]] finding [[G2147]] certain [[G5100]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 2
He said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Have [[G1487]] ye received [[G2983]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] since ye believed? [[G4100]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] We have [[G191]] not so much as [[G3761]] heard [[G191]] whether [[G1487]] there be [[G2076]] any Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 3
And [[G5037]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Unto [[G1519]] what [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] were ye baptized? [[G907]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Unto [[G1519]] John's [[G2491]] baptism. [[G908]]

### 4
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] Paul, [[G3972]] John [[G2491]] verily [[G3303]] baptized [[G907]] with the baptism [[G908]] of repentance, [[G3341]] saying [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2992]] people, [[G2992]] that [[G2443]] they should believe [[G4100]] on him [[G1519]] which [[G3588]] should come [[G2064]] after [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] on [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 5
When [[G1161]] they heard [[G191]] they were baptized [[G907]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 6
And [[G2532]]  when [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] had laid [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] upon them, [[G846]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] came [[G2064]] on [[G1909]] them; [[G846]] and [[G5037]] they spake [[G2980]] with tongues, [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] prophesied. [[G4395]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] were [[G2258]] about [[G5616]] twelve. [[G1177]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] he went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and spake boldly [[G3955]] for the space of [[G1909]] three [[G5140]] months, [[G3376]] disputing [[G1256]] and [[G2532]] persuading [[G3982]] the things [[G3588]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] divers [[G5100]] were hardened, [[G4645]] and [[G2532]] believed not, [[G544]] but spake evil [[G2551]]  of that [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G4128]] he departed [[G868]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and separated [[G873]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] disputing [[G1256]] daily [[G2596]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] school [[G4981]] of one [[G5100]] Tyrannus. [[G5181]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] continued [[G1096]] by the space of [[G1909]] two [[G1417]] years; [[G2094]] so that [[G5620]] all [[G3956]] they [[G3588]] which dwelt [[G2730]] in [[G773]] Asia [[G773]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] both [[G5037]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks. [[G1672]]

### 11
And [[G5037]] God [[G2316]] wrought [[G4160]] special [[G5177]] miracles [[G1411]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] of Paul: [[G3972]]

### 12
So that [[G5620]] from [[G575]] his [[G846]] body were [[G5559]] brought [[G2018]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sick [[G770]] handkerchiefs [[G4676]] or [[G2228]] aprons, [[G4612]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] diseases [[G3554]] departed [[G525]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] spirits [[G4151]] went out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
Then [[G1161]] certain [[G5100]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] vagabond [[G4022]] Jews, [[G2453]] exorcists, [[G1845]] took upon them [[G2021]] to call [[G3687]] over [[G1909]] them [[G3588]] which had [[G2192]] evil [[G4190]] spirits [[G4151]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] saying, [[G3004]] We adjure [[G3726]] you [[G5209]] by [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] Paul [[G3972]] preacheth. [[G2784]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] seven [[G2033]] sons [[G5207]] of Sceva, [[G4630]] a Jew, [[G2453]] chief of the priests, [[G749]] which did [[G4160]] so. [[G5124]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] spirit [[G4151]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] I know, [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] Paul [[G3972]] I know; [[G1987]] but [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] are [[G2075]] ye? [[G5210]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] spirit [[G4151]] was [[G2258]] leaped [[G2177]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] overcame [[G2634]] them, [[G846]] and prevailed [[G2480]] against [[G2596]] them, [[G846]] so that [[G5620]] they fled [[G1628]] out of [[G1537]] that [[G1565]] house [[G3624]] naked [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] wounded. [[G5135]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] was [[G1096]] known [[G1110]] to all [[G3956]] the Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] also [[G5037]] dwelling [[G2730]]  at [[G3588]] Ephesus; [[G2181]] and [[G2532]] fear [[G5401]] fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] them [[G846]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] was magnified. [[G3170]]

### 18
And [[G5037]] many [[G4183]] that [[G3588]] believed [[G4100]] came, [[G2064]] and confessed, [[G1843]] and [[G2532]] shewed [[G312]] their [[G846]] deeds. [[G4234]]

### 19
Many [[G2425]] them [[G3588]] of also which [[G4238]] used [[G4238]] curious arts [[G4021]] brought their [[G4851]] books [[G976]] together, [[G4851]] and burned them [[G2618]] before [[G1799]] all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] they counted [[G4860]] the [[G3588]] price [[G5092]] of them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] fifty [[G4002]] thousand [[G3461]] of silver. [[G694]]

### 20
So [[G3779]] mightily [[G2596]] grew [[G837]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2962]] God [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] prevailed. [[G2480]]

### 21
After [[G5613]] these things [[G5023]] were ended, [[G4137]] Paul [[G3972]] purposed [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] spirit, [[G4151]] when he had passed through [[G1330]] Macedonia [[G3109]] and [[G2532]] Achaia, [[G882]] to go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] saying, [[G2036]] After [[G3326]] I [[G3165]] have been [[G1096]] there, [[G1563]] I [[G3165]] must [[G1163]] also [[G2532]] see [[G1492]] Rome. [[G4516]]

### 22
So [[G1161]] he sent [[G649]] into [[G1519]] Macedonia [[G3109]] two [[G1417]] them [[G3588]] of that [[G1247]] ministered [[G1247]] unto him, [[G846]] Timotheus [[G5095]] and [[G2532]] Erastus; [[G2037]] himself [[G846]] but he [[G1907]] stayed [[G1907]] in [[G1519]] Asia for a [[G773]] season. [[G5550]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] the same [[G1565]] time there [[G2540]] arose [[G1096]] no [[G3756]] small [[G3641]] stir [[G5017]] about [[G4012]]  that [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] a certain [[G5100]] named [[G3686]] Demetrius, [[G1216]] a silversmith, [[G695]] which made [[G4160]] silver [[G693]] shrines [[G3485]] for Diana, [[G735]] brought [[G3930]] no [[G3756]] small [[G3641]] gain [[G2039]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G5079]] craftsmen; [[G5079]]

### 25
Whom [[G3739]] he called together [[G4867]] with [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] workmen [[G2040]] of [[G4012]] like occupation, [[G5108]] and said, [[G2036]] Sirs, [[G435]] ye know [[G1987]] that [[G3754]] by [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] craft [[G2039]] we have [[G2076]] our [[G2257]] wealth. [[G2142]]

### 26
Moreover [[G2532]] ye see [[G2334]] and [[G2532]] hear, [[G191]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] alone [[G3440]] at Ephesus, [[G2181]] but [[G235]] almost [[G4975]] throughout all [[G3956]] Asia, [[G773]] this [[G3778]] Paul hath [[G3972]] persuaded [[G3982]] and turned away [[G3179]] much [[G2425]] people, [[G3793]] saying [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] they be [[G1526]] no [[G3756]] gods, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] are made [[G1096]] with [[G1223]] hands: [[G5495]]

### 27
So that [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] this [[G5124]] our [[G2254]] craft [[G3313]] is in danger [[G2793]] to be set [[G2064]] at [[G557]] nought; [[G557]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] that the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3173]] great [[G3173]] goddess [[G2299]] Diana [[G735]] should be [[G3049]] despised, [[G3049]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] magnificence [[G3168]] should be [[G3195]] destroyed, [[G2507]] whom [[G3739]] all [[G3650]] Asia [[G773]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] world [[G3625]] worshippeth. [[G4576]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] when they heard [[G191]] they were [[G1096]] full [[G4134]] of wrath, [[G2372]] and [[G2532]] cried out, [[G2896]] saying, [[G3004]] Great [[G3173]] Diana [[G735]] of the Ephesians. [[G2180]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] city was [[G4172]] filled [[G4130]] with confusion: [[G4799]] and [[G5037]] having caught [[G4884]] Gaius [[G1050]] and [[G2532]] Aristarchus, [[G708]] men of Macedonia, [[G3110]] Paul's companions in [[G3972]] travel, [[G4898]] they rushed [[G3729]] with one accord [[G3661]] into [[G1519]] theatre. [[G2302]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] when Paul [[G3972]] would [[G1014]] have entered in [[G1525]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G1218]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] suffered [[G1439]] him [[G846]] not. [[G3756]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] certain [[G5100]] of [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief of Asia, [[G775]] which were [[G5607]] his [[G846]] friends, [[G5384]] sent [[G3992]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] desiring [[G3870]] not [[G3361]] that he would [[G1325]] adventure [[G1325]] himself [[G1438]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] theatre. [[G2302]]

### 32
Some [[G243]] therefore [[G3767]] cried one thing, [[G2896]]  and [[G3303]] some [[G243]] another: [[G5100]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] assembly [[G1577]] was [[G2258]] confused; [[G4797]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] more part [[G4119]] knew [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] wherefore [[G5101]]  they were come [[G1752]] together. [[G4905]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] they drew [[G4264]] Alexander [[G223]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] putting forward. [[G4261]] him [[G846]] And [[G1161]] Alexander [[G223]] beckoned [[G2678]] the [[G3588]] with [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] and would have [[G2309]] made his defence [[G626]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1218]] people. [[G1218]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] when they knew [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2076]] a Jew, [[G2453]] all [[G3956]] with about the space [[G1096]] one [[G1520]] voice [[G5456]] of [[G1909]] two [[G1417]] hours [[G5610]] cried out, [[G2896]] Great [[G3173]] Diana [[G735]] of the Ephesians. [[G2180]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G1122]] townclerk [[G1122]] had appeased [[G2687]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] he said, [[G5346]] men [[G435]] of Ephesus, [[G2180]] what [[G5101]] man [[G444]] is there [[G2076]] that [[G3739]] knoweth [[G1097]] not how that [[G3756]] the city [[G4172]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2180]] Ephesians [[G2180]] is [[G5607]] a worshipper [[G3511]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3173]] great [[G3173]] goddess [[G2299]] Diana, [[G735]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of which fell down from [[G1356]] Jupiter? [[G1356]]

### 36
Seeing [[G5607]] then that [[G3767]] these things [[G5130]] cannot be spoken against, [[G368]] ye [[G5209]] ought [[G1163]] to be [[G5225]] quiet, [[G2687]] and [[G2532]] to do [[G4238]] nothing [[G3367]] rashly. [[G4312]]

### 37
For [[G1063]] ye have brought hither [[G71]] these [[G5128]] men, [[G435]] which are neither [[G3777]] robbers of churches, [[G2417]] nor yet [[G3777]] blasphemers [[G987]] of your [[G5216]] goddess. [[G2299]]

### 38
Wherefore [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] Demetrius, [[G1216]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] craftsmen [[G5079]] which are with [[G4862]] him, [[G846]] have [[G2192]] a matter [[G3056]] against [[G4314]] any man, [[G5100]] the law [[G60]] is open, [[G71]] and [[G2532]] there are [[G1526]] deputies: [[G446]] let them implead [[G1458]] one another. [[G240]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye inquire [[G1934]] any thing [[G5100]] concerning [[G4012]] other matters, [[G2087]] it shall be determined [[G1956]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] lawful [[G1772]] assembly. [[G1577]]

### 40
For [[G1063]] we are in danger [[G2793]] to be called in question [[G1458]] for [[G4012]] this [[G4594]] day's [[G4594]] uproar, [[G4714]] there being [[G5225]] no [[G3367]] cause [[G158]] whereby [[G3739]] we may [[G1410]] give [[G591]] an account [[G3056]] of [[G4012]] this [[G3778]] concourse. [[G4963]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] thus [[G5023]] when he had [[G2036]] spoken, [[G2036]] he dismissed [[G630]] the [[G3588]] assembly. [[G1577]]
