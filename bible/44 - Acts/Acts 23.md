### 1
And [[G1161]] Paul, [[G3972]] earnestly beholding [[G816]] the before [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]] said, [[G2036]] Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] I [[G1473]] have lived [[G4176]] in all [[G3956]] good [[G18]] conscience [[G4893]] God [[G2316]] until [[G891]] this [[G3778]] day. [[G2250]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] Ananias [[G367]] commanded [[G2004]] them that [[G3588]] stood by [[G3936]] him [[G846]] to smite [[G5180]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] on [[G4750]] mouth. [[G4750]]

### 3
Then [[G5119]] said [[G2036]] Paul [[G3972]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] God [[G2316]] shall [[G3195]] smite [[G5180]] thee, [[G4571]] whited [[G2867]] wall: [[G5109]] for [[G2532]] sittest [[G2521]] thou [[G4771]] to judge [[G2919]] me [[G3165]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] commandest [[G2753]] me [[G3165]] to be smitten [[G5180]] contrary to the law? [[G3891]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] they that [[G3588]] stood by [[G3936]] said, [[G2036]] Revilest thou [[G3058]] God's high [[G2316]] priest? [[G749]]

### 5
Then [[G5037]] said [[G5346]] Paul, [[G3972]] I wist [[G1492]] not, [[G3756]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2076]] the high priest: [[G749]] for [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G2046]] speak [[G2046]] evil [[G2560]] of the ruler [[G758]] of thy [[G4675]] people. [[G2992]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] when [[G3972]] Paul [[G3972]] perceived [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] part [[G3313]] were [[G2076]] Sadducees, [[G4523]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] he cried out [[G2896]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]] Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] a Pharisee, [[G5330]] the son [[G5207]] of a Pharisee: [[G5330]] of [[G4012]] the hope [[G1680]] and [[G2532]] resurrection [[G386]] of the dead [[G3498]] I [[G1473]] am called in question. [[G2919]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] when had [[G5124]] he [[G846]] so [[G5124]] said, [[G2980]] there arose [[G1096]] a dissension [[G4714]] between the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Sadducees: [[G4523]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] multitude was [[G4128]] divided. [[G4977]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] the Sadducees [[G4523]] say that [[G3004]] there is [[G1511]] no [[G3361]] resurrection, [[G386]] neither [[G3366]] angel, [[G32]] nor [[G3383]] spirit: [[G4151]] but [[G1161]] the Pharisees [[G5330]] confess [[G3670]] both. [[G297]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] there arose [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] cry: [[G2906]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees' [[G5330]] part [[G3313]] arose, [[G450]] and strove, [[G1264]] saying, [[G3004]] We find [[G2147]] no [[G3762]] evil [[G2556]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] man: [[G444]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] a spirit [[G4151]] or [[G2228]] an angel [[G32]] hath spoken [[G2980]] to him, [[G846]] not [[G3361]] let us fight against [[G2313]] God. [[G2313]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] when there arose [[G1096]] a great [[G4183]] dissension, [[G4714]] the [[G3588]] chief captain, [[G5506]] fearing [[G2125]] lest [[G3361]] Paul [[G3972]] should have been pulled in pieces [[G1288]] of [[G5259]] them, [[G846]] commanded [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4753]] to go down, [[G2597]] and to take by force [[G726]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] among [[G3319]] them, [[G846]] and [[G5037]] to bring [[G71]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] castle. [[G3925]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] following [[G1966]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] stood [[G2186]] by him, [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] Be of good cheer, [[G2293]] Paul: [[G3972]] for [[G1063]] as [[G5613]] thou hast testified [[G1263]] of [[G4012]] me [[G1700]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] so [[G3779]] must [[G1163]] thou [[G4571]] bear witness [[G3140]] also [[G2532]] at [[G1519]] Rome. [[G4516]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] when it was [[G1096]] day, [[G2250]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] banded [[G4160]] together, [[G4963]] and bound under a curse, [[G332]] themselves [[G1438]] saying that [[G3004]] neither [[G3383]] they would [[G5315]] eat [[G5315]] nor [[G3383]] drink [[G4095]] till [[G2193]] they had killed [[G615]] Paul. [[G3972]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] they were [[G2258]] more [[G4119]] than forty [[G5062]] which [[G3588]] had made [[G4160]] this [[G3778]] conspiracy. [[G4945]]

### 14
And they [[G3748]] came [[G4334]] to the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] and said, [[G2036]] We have bound [[G332]] ourselves [[G1438]] under a great curse, [[G331]] that we will eat [[G1089]] nothing [[G3367]] until [[G2193]] we have slain [[G615]] Paul. [[G3972]]

### 15
Now [[G3568]] therefore [[G3767]] ye [[G5210]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] council [[G4892]] signify [[G1718]] to the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] that [[G3704]] he bring down [[G2609]] him [[G846]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] to morrow, [[G839]] as though [[G5613]] ye would [[G3195]] inquire [[G1231]] something more perfectly [[G199]] concerning [[G4012]] him: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] we, [[G2249]] or ever [[G4253]] he [[G846]] come near, [[G1448]] are [[G2070]] ready [[G2092]] to kill [[G337]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
And when [[G1161]] Paul's [[G3972]] sister's [[G79]] son [[G5207]] heard [[G191]]  of their lying in [[G3588]] wait, [[G1749]] he went [[G3854]] and [[G2532]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] castle, [[G3925]] and told [[G518]] Paul. [[G3972]]

### 17
Then [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] called unto [[G4341]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1543]] centurions [[G1543]] and said, [[G5346]] Bring [[G520]] this [[G5126]]  young [[G3588]] man [[G3494]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief captain: [[G5506]] for [[G1063]] he hath [[G2192]] a certain thing [[G5100]] to tell [[G518]] him. [[G846]]

### 18
So [[G3767]] he [[G3588]] took [[G3880]] him, [[G846]] and brought [[G71]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief captain, [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G5346]] Paul [[G3972]] the [[G3588]] prisoner [[G1198]] called unto [[G4341]] me [[G3165]] and prayed me [[G2065]] to bring [[G71]] this [[G5126]] young [[G3494]] man [[G3494]] unto [[G4314]] thee, [[G4571]] who hath [[G2192]] something [[G5100]] to say [[G2980]] unto thee. [[G4671]]

### 19
Then [[G1161]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] took [[G1949]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] by [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] went [[G402]] aside [[G2596]] privately, [[G2398]] and asked [[G4441]] What [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] that [[G3739]] thou hast [[G2192]] to tell [[G518]] me? [[G3427]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] he said, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] have agreed [[G4934]] to desire [[G2065]] thee [[G4571]] that [[G3704]] thou wouldest bring down [[G2609]] Paul [[G3972]] to morrow [[G839]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]] as though [[G5613]] they would more [[G3195]] inquire [[G4441]] somewhat [[G5100]] of [[G4012]] him [[G846]] perfectly. [[G199]]

### 21
But [[G3767]] not [[G3361]] do [[G3982]] thou [[G4771]] yield [[G3982]] unto them: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] there lie in wait [[G1748]] for him [[G846]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] more [[G4119]] than forty [[G5062]] men, [[G435]] which [[G3748]] have bound with an oath, [[G332]] themselves [[G1438]] that [[G3739]] neither [[G3383]] they will [[G5315]] eat [[G5315]] nor [[G3383]] drink [[G4095]] till [[G2193]] they have killed [[G337]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] are they [[G1526]] ready, [[G2092]] looking for [[G4327]] a promise [[G1860]] from [[G575]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 22
So [[G3767]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] let depart, [[G630]] the young [[G3588]] man [[G3494]] and charged [[G3853]] tell [[G1583]] no man [[G3367]] that [[G3754]] thou hast shewed [[G1718]] these things [[G5023]] to [[G4314]] me. [[G3165]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he called unto [[G4341]] two [[G1417]] centurions, [[G1543]] saying, [[G2036]] Make ready [[G2090]] two hundred [[G1250]] soldiers [[G4757]] to [[G3704]] go [[G4198]] to [[G2193]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and [[G2532]] horsemen [[G2460]] threescore and ten, [[G1440]] and [[G2532]] spearmen [[G1187]] two hundred, [[G1250]] at [[G575]] the third [[G5154]] hour [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3571]] night; [[G3571]]

### 24
And [[G5037]] provide [[G3936]] beasts, [[G2934]] that [[G2443]] they may set on, [[G1913]] Paul [[G3972]] and bring safe [[G1295]] unto [[G4314]] Felix [[G5344]] the [[G3588]] governor. [[G2232]]

### 25
And he wrote [[G1125]] a letter [[G1992]] after [[G4023]] this [[G5126]] manner: [[G5179]]

### 26
Claudius [[G2804]] Lysias [[G3079]] the [[G3588]] unto most [[G2903]] excellent [[G2903]] governor [[G2232]] Felix [[G5344]] greeting. [[G5463]]

### 27
This [[G5126]] man was [[G435]] taken [[G4815]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] should [[G3195]] have been killed [[G337]] of [[G5259]] them: [[G846]] then came I [[G2186]] with [[G4862]]  an [[G3588]] army, [[G4753]] and rescued [[G1807]] him, [[G846]] having understood [[G3129]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2076]] a Roman. [[G4514]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] when I would [[G1014]] have known [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] cause [[G156]] wherefore [[G3739]] they accused [[G1458]] him, [[G846]] I brought forth [[G2609]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] their [[G846]] council: [[G4892]]

### 29
Whom [[G3739]] I perceived [[G2147]] to be accused [[G1458]] of [[G4012]] questions [[G2213]] of their [[G846]] law, [[G3551]] but [[G1161]] to have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3367]] laid to his charge [[G1462]] worthy [[G514]] of death [[G2288]] or [[G2228]] of bonds. [[G1199]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] when it was told [[G3377]] me [[G3427]] how [[G3195]] that [[G2071]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] laid wait [[G1917]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G435]] I sent [[G3992]] straightway [[G1824]] to [[G4314]] thee, [[G4571]] and gave commandment [[G3853]] his [[G3588]] to [[G2725]] accusers [[G2725]] also [[G2532]] to say [[G3004]] before [[G1909]] thee [[G4675]] what [[G3588]] against [[G4314]] him. [[G846]] Farewell. [[G4517]]

### 31
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] soldiers, [[G4757]] as [[G2596]] it was commanded [[G1299]] them, [[G846]] took [[G353]] Paul, [[G3972]] and brought [[G71]] by [[G1223]] night [[G3571]] to [[G1519]] Antipatris. [[G494]]

### 32
On [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] morrow [[G1887]] they left [[G1439]] the [[G3588]] horsemen [[G2460]] to go [[G4198]] with [[G4862]] him, [[G846]] and returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] castle: [[G3925]]

### 33
Who, [[G3748]] when they came [[G1525]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and [[G2532]] delivered [[G325]] the [[G3588]] epistle [[G1992]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2232]] governor, [[G2232]] presented [[G3936]] Paul [[G3972]] also [[G2532]] before him. [[G846]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] governor had [[G2232]] read [[G314]] he asked [[G1905]] of [[G1537]] what [[G4169]] province [[G1885]] he was. [[G2076]] And [[G2532]] when he understood [[G4441]] that [[G3754]] of [[G575]] Cilicia; [[G2791]]

### 35
I will hear [[G1251]] thee, [[G4675]] said he, [[G5346]] when [[G3752]] thine [[G4675]] accusers are [[G2725]] also [[G2532]] come. [[G3854]] And [[G5037]] he commanded [[G2753]] him [[G846]] to be kept [[G5442]] in [[G1722]] Herod's judgment [[G2264]] hall. [[G4232]]
