### 1
Men, [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] fathers, [[G3962]] hear ye [[G191]] my [[G3450]] defence [[G627]] now [[G3568]] unto [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 2
(And [[G1161]] when they heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] he spake [[G4377]] in the [[G3588]] Hebrew [[G1446]] tongue [[G1258]] to them, [[G846]] they kept [[G3930]] the more [[G3123]] silence: [[G2271]] and [[G2532]] he saith,) [[G5346]]

### 3
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] verily [[G3303]] a man [[G435]] a Jew, [[G2453]] born [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] Tarsus, [[G5019]]  in [[G3588]] Cilicia, [[G2791]] yet [[G1161]] brought up [[G397]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] city [[G4172]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of Gamaliel, [[G1059]] taught [[G3811]] according to [[G2596]] the perfect manner [[G195]] of the law [[G3551]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3971]] fathers, [[G3971]] and was [[G5225]] zealous [[G2207]]  toward [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] as [[G2531]] ye [[G5210]] all [[G3956]] are [[G2075]] this day. [[G4594]]

### 4
I [[G3739]] And [[G3778]] persecuted [[G1377]] this [[G3778]] way [[G3598]] unto [[G891]] the death, [[G2288]] binding [[G1195]] and [[G2532]] delivering [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] prisons [[G5438]] both [[G5037]] men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] women. [[G1135]]

### 5
As [[G5613]] also [[G2532]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] doth bear witness, [[G3140]] me [[G3427]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] estate of the elders: [[G4244]] from [[G3844]] whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] I received [[G1209]] letters [[G1992]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] and went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Damascus, [[G1154]] to bring [[G71]] them [[G3588]] which were [[G5607]] there [[G1566]] bound [[G1210]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] for [[G2443]] to be punished. [[G5097]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, that, [[G1096]] as I [[G3427]] made my journey, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] was come nigh [[G1448]]  unto [[G3588]] Damascus [[G1154]] about [[G4012]] noon, [[G3314]] suddenly [[G1810]] there shone [[G4015]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] a [[G3588]] great [[G2425]] light [[G5457]] round about [[G4012]] me. [[G1691]]

### 7
And [[G5037]] I fell [[G4098]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground, [[G1475]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] saying [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Saul, [[G4549]] Saul, [[G4549]] why [[G5101]] persecutest thou [[G1377]] me? [[G3165]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] answered, [[G611]] Who [[G5101]] art thou, [[G1488]] Lord? [[G2962]] And [[G5037]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3480]] Nazareth, [[G3480]] whom [[G3739]] thou [[G4771]] persecutest. [[G1377]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] that were [[G5607]] with [[G4862]] me [[G1698]] saw [[G2300]] indeed [[G3303]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] were [[G1096]] afraid; [[G1719]] but [[G1161]] they heard [[G191]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] him [[G3588]] of that [[G2980]] spake [[G2980]] to me. [[G3427]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] I said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] shall I do, [[G4160]] Lord? [[G2962]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] Arise, [[G450]] and go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] Damascus; [[G1154]] and there [[G2546]] it shall be told [[G2980]] thee [[G4671]] of [[G4012]] all things [[G3956]] which [[G3739]] are appointed [[G5021]] for thee [[G4671]] to do. [[G4160]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] not [[G3756]] I could [[G1689]] see [[G1689]] for [[G575]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of that [[G1565]] light, [[G5457]] being led by the hand [[G5496]] of [[G5259]] them [[G3588]] that were with [[G4895]] me, [[G3427]] I came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] Damascus. [[G1154]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] Ananias, [[G367]] a devout [[G2152]] man [[G435]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] having a good report [[G3140]] of [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] which dwelt [[G2730]]

### 13
Came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] stood, [[G2186]] and said [[G2036]] unto me, [[G3427]] Brother [[G80]] Saul, [[G4549]] receive thy sight. [[G308]] And I [[G2504]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] looked up [[G308]] upon [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of our [[G2257]] fathers hath [[G3962]] chosen [[G4400]] thee, [[G4571]] that thou shouldest know [[G1097]] his [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] and [[G2532]] see [[G1492]] that [[G3588]] Just One, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] shouldest hear [[G191]] the voice [[G5456]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mouth. [[G4750]]

### 15
For [[G3754]] thou shalt be [[G2071]] his [[G846]] witness [[G3144]] unto [[G4314]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] of what [[G3739]] thou hast seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] heard. [[G191]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] why [[G5101]] tarriest thou? [[G3195]] arise, [[G450]] and be baptized, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] wash away [[G628]] thy [[G4675]] sins, [[G266]] calling on [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, that, [[G1096]] when I [[G3427]] was come again [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] even [[G2532]] while I [[G3450]] prayed [[G4336]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] I [[G3165]] was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] a trance; [[G1611]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] him [[G846]] saying [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Make haste, [[G4692]] and [[G2532]] get thee [[G1831]] quickly [[G1722]]  out [[G5034]] of [[G1537]] Jerusalem: [[G2419]] for [[G1360]] not [[G3756]] they will [[G3858]] receive [[G3858]] thy [[G4675]] testimony [[G3141]] concerning [[G4012]] me. [[G1700]]

### 19
And I [[G2504]] said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] they [[G846]] know [[G1987]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] imprisoned [[G2252]] and [[G2532]] beat [[G1194]] in every [[G2596]] synagogue [[G4864]] them that [[G3588]] believed [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] thee: [[G4571]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of thy [[G4675]] martyr [[G3144]] Stephen [[G4736]] was shed, [[G1632]] I [[G846]] also [[G2532]] was [[G2252]] standing by, [[G2186]] and [[G2532]] consenting unto [[G4909]] his [[G846]] death, [[G336]] and [[G2532]] kept [[G5442]] the [[G3588]] raiment [[G2440]] them [[G3588]] of that [[G337]] slew [[G337]] him. [[G846]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] Depart: [[G4198]] for [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] will send [[G1821]] thee [[G4571]] far hence [[G3112]] unto [[G1519]] the Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] they gave [[G191]] him [[G846]] audience [[G191]] unto [[G891]] this [[G5127]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] lifted up [[G1869]] their [[G846]] voices, [[G5456]] and said, [[G3004]] Away with [[G142]] such [[G5108]] a [[G3588]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] for [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] it is [[G2520]] fit [[G2520]] that he [[G846]] should live. [[G2198]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] as they [[G846]] cried out, [[G2905]] and [[G2532]] cast off [[G4495]] clothes, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] threw [[G906]] dust [[G2868]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] air, [[G109]]

### 24
The chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] commanded [[G2753]] him [[G846]] to be brought [[G71]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] castle, [[G3925]] and bade that [[G2036]] he [[G846]] should be examined [[G426]] by scourging; [[G3148]] that [[G2443]] he might know [[G1921]] wherefore [[G1223]]  they [[G3739]] cried [[G2019]] so [[G3779]] against him. [[G846]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] as [[G5613]] they bound [[G4385]] him [[G846]]  with [[G3588]] thongs, [[G2438]] Paul [[G3972]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the centurion [[G1543]] that [[G3588]] stood by, [[G2476]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] for you [[G5213]] to scourge [[G3147]] a man [[G444]] that is a Roman, [[G4514]] and [[G2532]] uncondemned? [[G178]]

### 26
When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] heard [[G191]] he went [[G4334]] and told [[G518]] the [[G3588]] chief captain, [[G5506]] saying, [[G3004]] Take heed [[G3708]] what [[G5101]] thou [[G3195]] doest: [[G4160]] for [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is [[G2076]] a Roman. [[G4514]]

### 27
Then [[G1161]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] came, [[G4334]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Tell [[G3004]] me, [[G3427]] art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] a Roman? [[G4514]] He [[G3588]] said, [[G5346]] Yea. [[G3483]]

### 28
And [[G5037]] the [[G3588]]  chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] answered, [[G611]] With a great [[G4183]] sum [[G2774]] obtained [[G2932]] I [[G1473]] this [[G3778]] freedom. [[G4174]] And [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] said, [[G5346]] But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] was [[G2532]] born. [[G1080]]

### 29
Then [[G3767]] straightway [[G2112]] they departed [[G868]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] which [[G3588]] should [[G3195]] have examined [[G426]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] also [[G1161]] was afraid, [[G5399]] after he knew [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G2076]] a Roman, [[G4514]] and [[G2532]] because [[G3754]] he had [[G2258]] bound [[G1210]] him. [[G846]]

### 30
On the [[G3588]] morrow, [[G1887]] because he would [[G1014]] have known [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] certainty [[G804]] wherefore [[G5101]] he was accused [[G2723]] of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] he loosed [[G3089]] him [[G846]] from [[G575]] bands, [[G1199]] and [[G2532]] commanded [[G2753]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] their [[G846]] council [[G4892]] to appear, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] brought down, [[G2609]] Paul [[G3972]] and set him [[G2476]] before [[G1519]] them. [[G846]]
