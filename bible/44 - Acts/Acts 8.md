### 1
And [[G1161]] Saul [[G4569]] was [[G2258]] consenting unto [[G4909]] his [[G846]] death. [[G336]] And [[G1161]] at [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2250]] there was [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] persecution [[G1375]] against [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] which [[G3588]] was [[G1722]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem; [[G2414]] and [[G5037]] all [[G3956]] they were scattered [[G1289]] abroad [[G1289]] throughout [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] regions [[G5561]] of [[G2449]] Judaea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Samaria, [[G4540]] except [[G4133]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] devout [[G2126]] men [[G435]] carried [[G4792]] Stephen [[G4736]] and [[G2532]] made [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] lamentation [[G2870]] over [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
As [[G1161]] for Saul, [[G4569]] he made havock [[G3075]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] church, [[G1577]] entering into [[G1531]] every [[G2596]] house, [[G3624]] and [[G5037]] haling [[G4951]] men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] women [[G1135]] committed [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] prison. [[G5438]]

### 4
Therefore [[G3767]] they [[G3588]] that were scattered abroad [[G1289]] went every where [[G1330]] preaching [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] word. [[G3056]]

### 5
Then [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] went down [[G2718]] to [[G1519]] the city [[G4172]] of [[G4540]] Samaria, [[G4540]] and preached [[G2784]] Christ unto [[G5547]] them. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] with [[G1722]] one accord [[G3661]] gave heed [[G4337]] unto those things [[G3588]] which [[G3004]] Philip [[G5376]] spake, [[G3004]] hearing [[G191]] and [[G2532]] seeing [[G991]] the [[G3588]] miracles [[G4592]] which [[G3739]] he did. [[G4160]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] crying [[G994]] with loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] came out [[G1831]] of many [[G4183]] that were possessed [[G2192]] and [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] taken with palsies, [[G3886]] and [[G2532]] lame, [[G5560]] that were were [[G2323]] healed. [[G2323]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] there was [[G1096]] great [[G3173]] joy [[G5479]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] city. [[G4172]]

### 9
But there was [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] man, [[G435]] called [[G3686]] Simon, [[G4613]] which beforetime [[G4391]] in [[G1722]] the same [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] used sorcery, [[G3096]] and [[G2532]] bewitched [[G1839]] the [[G3588]] people [[G1484]] of [[G4540]] Samaria, [[G4540]] giving out that [[G3004]] himself [[G1438]] was [[G1511]] some [[G5100]] great one: [[G3173]]

### 10
To whom [[G3739]] they all [[G3956]] gave heed, [[G4337]] from [[G575]] the least [[G3398]] to [[G2193]] the greatest, [[G3173]] saying, [[G3004]] This man [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] power [[G1411]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] to him [[G846]] they had regard, [[G4337]] because that [[G1223]] of long [[G2425]] time [[G5550]] he had bewitched [[G1839]] them [[G846]]  with [[G3588]] sorceries. [[G3095]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] they believed [[G4100]] Philip [[G5376]] preaching [[G2097]] the things [[G3588]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] they were baptized, [[G907]] both [[G5037]] men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] women. [[G1135]]

### 13
Then [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] himself [[G846]] believed [[G4100]] also: [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] when he was [[G2258]] baptized, [[G907]] he continued [[G4342]]  with [[G3588]] Philip, [[G5376]] and [[G5037]] wondered, [[G1839]] beholding [[G2334]] the miracles [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] which were done. [[G1096]]

### 14
Now when [[G1161]] the apostles [[G652]] which [[G3588]] were at [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Samaria [[G4540]] had received [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] they sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John: [[G2491]]

### 15
Who, [[G3748]] when they were come down, [[G2597]] prayed [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] them, [[G846]] that [[G3704]] they might receive [[G2983]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost: [[G4151]]

### 16
(For [[G1063]] as yet [[G3768]] he was [[G2258]] fallen [[G1968]] upon [[G1909]] none [[G3762]] of them: [[G846]] only [[G3440]] they were [[G5225]] baptized [[G907]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus.) [[G2424]]

### 17
Then [[G5119]] laid they [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they received [[G2983]] the Holy [[G4151]]  Ghost. [[G40]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] when [[G4613]] Simon [[G4613]] saw [[G2300]] that [[G3754]] through [[G1223]] laying [[G1936]] on [[G1936]] the [[G3588]] of [[G652]] apostles' [[G652]] hands [[G5495]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost was [[G4151]] given, [[G1325]] he offered [[G4374]] them [[G846]] money, [[G5536]]

### 19
Saying, [[G3004]] Give me [[G1325]] also [[G2504]] this [[G3778]] power, [[G1849]] that [[G2443]] on whomsoever [[G3739]] I lay [[G2007]] hands, [[G5495]] he may receive [[G2983]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Thy [[G4675]] money [[G694]] perish [[G684]] with [[G4862]] thee, [[G4671]] because [[G3754]] thou hast thought [[G3543]] that [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] may be purchased [[G2932]] with money. [[G5536]]

### 21
Thou [[G4671]] hast [[G2076]] neither [[G3756]] part [[G3310]] nor [[G3761]] lot [[G2819]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] matter: [[G3056]] for [[G1063]] thy [[G4675]] heart [[G2588]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] right [[G2117]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]]

### 22
Repent [[G3340]] therefore [[G3767]] of [[G575]] this [[G3778]] thy [[G4675]] wickedness, [[G2549]] and [[G2532]] pray [[G1189]] God, [[G2316]] if [[G1487]] perhaps [[G686]] the [[G3588]] thought [[G1963]] of thine [[G4675]] heart [[G2588]] may be forgiven [[G863]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 23
For [[G1063]] I perceive [[G3708]] that thou [[G4571]] art [[G5607]] in [[G1519]] the gall [[G5521]] of bitterness, [[G4088]] and [[G2532]] the bond [[G4886]] of iniquity. [[G93]]

### 24
Then [[G1161]] answered [[G611]] Simon, [[G4613]] and said, [[G2036]] Pray [[G1189]] ye [[G5210]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] for [[G5228]] me, [[G1700]] that [[G3704]] none of these things [[G3367]] which [[G3739]] ye have spoken [[G2046]] come [[G1904]] upon [[G1909]] me. [[G1691]]

### 25
they, [[G3588]] And when they had [[G3767]] testified [[G1263]] and [[G2532]] preached [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G5037]] preached the gospel [[G2097]] in many [[G4183]] villages [[G2968]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4541]] Samaritans. [[G4541]]

### 26
And [[G1161]] the angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] spake [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] Philip, [[G5376]] saying, [[G3004]] Arise, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] toward [[G2596]] the south [[G3314]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] that [[G3588]] goeth down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] unto [[G1519]] Gaza, [[G1048]] which [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] desert. [[G2048]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] he arose [[G450]] and went: [[G4198]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a man [[G435]] of Ethiopia, [[G128]] an eunuch [[G2135]] of great authority [[G1413]] under Candace [[G2582]] queen [[G938]] of the Ethiopians, [[G128]] who [[G3739]] had [[G2258]] the charge of [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] her [[G846]] treasure, [[G1047]] and had come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] for to worship, [[G4352]]

### 28
Was [[G2258]] returning, [[G5290]] and [[G2532]] sitting [[G2521]] in [[G1909]] his [[G846]] chariot [[G716]] read [[G314]] Esaias [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet. [[G4396]]

### 29
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G5376]] Philip, [[G5376]] Go near, [[G4334]] and [[G2532]] join thyself [[G2853]] to this [[G5129]] chariot. [[G716]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] ran thither to [[G4370]] and heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] read [[G314]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Esaias, [[G2268]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]]  thou [[G687]] Understandest [[G1097]] what [[G3739]] thou readest? [[G314]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] How [[G4459]] can I, [[G1410]] except [[G1437]] some man [[G5100]] should guide [[G3594]] me? [[G3165]] And [[G5037]] he desired [[G3870]] Philip [[G5376]] that he would come up [[G305]] and sit [[G2523]] with [[G4862]] him. [[G846]]

### 32
The [[G3588]] place [[G4042]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1124]] scripture [[G1124]] which [[G3739]] he read [[G314]] was [[G2258]] this, [[G3778]] He was led [[G71]] as [[G5613]] a sheep [[G4263]] to [[G1909]] the slaughter; [[G4967]] and [[G2532]] like [[G5613]] a lamb [[G286]] dumb [[G880]] before [[G1726]] his [[G846]] shearer, [[G2751]] so [[G3779]] opened he [[G455]] not [[G3756]] his [[G846]] mouth: [[G4750]]

### 33
In [[G1722]] his [[G846]] humiliation [[G5014]] his [[G846]] judgment was taken [[G2920]] away: [[G142]] and [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] shall declare [[G1334]] his [[G846]] generation? [[G1074]] for [[G3754]] his [[G846]] life is [[G2222]] taken [[G142]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] eunuch [[G2135]] answered [[G611]] Philip, [[G5376]] and said, [[G2036]] I pray [[G1189]] thee, [[G4675]] of [[G4012]] whom [[G5101]] speaketh [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] this? [[G5124]] of [[G4012]] himself, [[G1438]] or [[G2228]] of [[G4012]] some [[G5100]] other man? [[G2087]]

### 35
Then [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] at [[G575]] the same [[G3778]] scripture, [[G1124]] and preached [[G2097]] unto him [[G846]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] as [[G5613]] they went [[G4198]] on [[G2596]] way, [[G3598]] they came [[G2064]] unto [[G1909]] a certain [[G5100]] water: [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] eunuch [[G2135]] said, [[G5346]] See, [[G2400]] water; [[G5204]] what [[G5101]] doth hinder [[G2967]] me [[G3165]] to be baptized? [[G907]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] said, [[G2036]] If [[G1487]] thou believest [[G4100]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]]  thine [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] thou mayest. [[G1832]] And [[G1161]] he answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] I believe [[G4100]] that [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] is [[G1511]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] he commanded [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] chariot [[G716]] to stand still: [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] they went down [[G2597]] both [[G297]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] both [[G5037]] Philip [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] eunuch; [[G2135]] and [[G2532]] he baptized [[G907]] him. [[G846]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] they were come up [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] the Spirit [[G4151]] of the Lord [[G2962]] caught away [[G726]] Philip, [[G5376]] that [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] eunuch [[G2135]] saw [[G1492]] him [[G846]] no more: [[G3765]] and [[G1063]] he went [[G4198]] on his [[G846]] way [[G3598]] rejoicing. [[G5463]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] was found [[G2147]] at [[G1519]] Azotus: [[G108]] and [[G2532]] passing through [[G1330]] he preached [[G2097]] in all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] cities, [[G4172]] till [[G2193]] he [[G846]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea. [[G2542]]
