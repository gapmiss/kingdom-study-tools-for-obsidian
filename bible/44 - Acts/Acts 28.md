### 1
And [[G2532]] when they were escaped, [[G1295]] then [[G5119]] they knew [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] island [[G3520]] was called [[G2564]] Melita. [[G3194]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] barbarous people [[G915]] shewed [[G3930]] us [[G2254]] no [[G3756]] little [[G5177]] kindness: [[G5363]] for [[G1063]] they kindled [[G381]] a fire, [[G4443]] and received [[G4355]] us [[G2248]] every one, [[G3956]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2186]] present [[G2186]] rain, [[G5205]] and [[G2532]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5592]] cold. [[G5592]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] when [[G3972]] Paul [[G3972]] had gathered [[G4962]] a bundle [[G4128]] of sticks, [[G5434]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] fire, [[G4443]] there came [[G1831]] a viper [[G2191]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] heat, [[G2329]] and fastened on [[G2510]] his [[G846]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] barbarians [[G915]] saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] hang [[G2910]] on [[G1537]] his [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]] they said [[G3004]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] No doubt [[G3843]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is [[G2076]] a murderer, [[G5406]] whom, [[G3739]] though he hath escaped [[G1295]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]]  yet [[G3588]] vengeance [[G1349]] suffereth [[G1439]] not [[G3756]] to live. [[G2198]]

### 5
And [[G3767]] he shook [[G3588]] off [[G660]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire, [[G4442]] and felt [[G3958]] no [[G3762]] harm. [[G2556]]

### 6
Howbeit [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] looked [[G4328]] when he [[G846]] should [[G3195]] have swollen, [[G4092]] or [[G2228]] fallen down [[G2667]] dead [[G3498]] suddenly: [[G869]] but [[G1161]] after [[G1909]] they [[G846]] had looked [[G4328]] a great while, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2334]] no [[G3367]] harm [[G824]] come [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] they changed their minds, [[G3328]] and said that [[G3004]] he [[G846]] was [[G1511]] a god. [[G2316]]

### 7
In [[G1722]] same [[G1565]] quarters [[G5117]] were [[G5225]] possessions [[G5564]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] chief man [[G4413]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3520]] island, [[G3520]] whose name [[G3686]] was Publius; [[G4196]] who [[G3739]] received [[G324]] us, [[G2248]] and lodged us [[G3579]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] courteously. [[G5390]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] of [[G4196]] Publius [[G4196]] lay [[G2621]] sick [[G4912]] of a fever [[G4446]] and [[G2532]] of a bloody flux: [[G1420]] to [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] Paul [[G3972]] entered in, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] prayed, [[G4336]] and laid [[G2007]] his [[G5495]] hands [[G5495]] on him, [[G846]] and healed [[G2390]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
So [[G3767]] when this [[G5127]] was done, [[G1096]] others [[G3062]] also, [[G2532]] which [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] diseases [[G769]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] island, [[G3520]] came, [[G4334]] and [[G2532]] were healed: [[G2323]]

### 10
Who [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] honoured [[G5091]] us [[G2248]] with many [[G4183]] honours; [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] when we departed, [[G321]] they laded [[G2007]] with such things [[G3588]]  as were [[G4314]] necessary. [[G5532]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] months [[G3376]] we departed [[G321]] in [[G1722]] a ship [[G4143]] of Alexandria, [[G222]] which had wintered [[G3914]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] isle, [[G3520]] whose sign [[G3902]] was Castor and Pollux. [[G1359]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] landing [[G2609]] at [[G1519]] Syracuse, [[G4946]] we tarried [[G1961]] three [[G5140]] days. [[G2250]]

### 13
And from thence [[G3606]] we fetched a compass, [[G4022]] and came [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Rhegium: [[G4484]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] one [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] the south wind [[G3558]] blew, [[G1920]] and we came [[G2064]] the next day [[G1206]] to [[G1519]] Puteoli: [[G4223]]

### 14
Where [[G3757]] we found [[G2147]] brethren, [[G80]] and were desired [[G3870]] to tarry [[G1961]] with [[G1909]] them [[G846]] seven [[G2033]] days: [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] we went [[G2064]] toward [[G1519]] Rome. [[G4516]]

### 15
And from thence, [[G2547]] the [[G3588]] when [[G80]] brethren [[G80]] heard [[G191]] of [[G4012]] us, [[G2257]] they came [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G529]] us [[G2254]] as far as [[G891]] Appii [[G675]] forum, [[G5410]] and [[G2532]] The three [[G5140]] taverns: [[G4999]] whom [[G3739]] when [[G3972]] Paul [[G3972]] saw, [[G1492]] he thanked [[G2168]] God, [[G2316]] and took [[G2983]] courage. [[G2294]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] we came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Rome, [[G4516]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] delivered [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] prisoners [[G1198]] the [[G3588]] to captain of the [[G4759]] guard: [[G4759]] but [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] was suffered [[G2010]] to dwell [[G3306]] by [[G2596]] himself [[G1438]] with [[G4862]] a soldier [[G4757]] that kept [[G5442]] him. [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] Paul [[G3972]] called together: [[G4779]] the chief [[G4413]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G1161]] when were come [[G4905]] they [[G846]] together, [[G4905]] he said [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] though I [[G1473]] have committed [[G4160]] nothing [[G3762]] against [[G1727]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] or [[G2228]] customs of our [[G1485]] fathers, [[G3971]] yet was I delivered [[G3860]] prisoner [[G1198]] from [[G1537]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] hands of [[G5495]] the [[G3588]] Romans. [[G4514]]

### 18
Who, [[G3748]] when they had examined [[G350]] me, [[G3165]] would have [[G1014]] let go, [[G630]] because [[G1223]] there was [[G5225]] no [[G3367]] cause [[G156]] of death [[G2288]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] spake against [[G483]] I was constrained [[G315]] to appeal [[G1941]] unto [[G2541]] Caesar; [[G2541]] not [[G3756]] that [[G5613]] I had [[G2192]] ought [[G5100]] to accuse of. [[G2723]] my [[G3450]] nation [[G1484]]

### 20
For [[G1223]] this [[G3778]] cause [[G156]] therefore [[G3767]] have I called [[G3870]] for you, [[G5209]] to see [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] to speak with [[G4354]] because that [[G1752]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] of [[G2474]] Israel [[G2474]] I am bound with [[G4029]] this [[G3778]] chain. [[G254]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] We [[G2249]] neither [[G3777]] received [[G1209]] letters [[G1121]] out [[G575]] of [[G2449]] Judaea [[G2449]] concerning [[G4012]] thee, [[G4675]] neither [[G3777]] any [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G80]] brethren [[G80]] that came [[G3854]] shewed [[G518]] or [[G2228]] spake [[G2980]] any [[G5100]] harm [[G4190]] of [[G4012]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] we desire [[G515]] to hear [[G191]] of [[G3844]] thee [[G4675]] what [[G3739]] thou thinkest: [[G5426]] for [[G1063]] as [[G3303]] concerning [[G4012]] this [[G3778]] sect, [[G139]] we [[G2254]] know [[G1110]] that [[G3754]] every where [[G3837]] it is [[G2076]] spoken against. [[G483]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] when they had appointed [[G5021]] him [[G846]] a day, [[G2250]] there came [[G2240]] many [[G4119]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] lodging; [[G3578]] to whom [[G3739]] he expounded [[G1620]] and [[G5037]] testified [[G1263]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]]  of God, [[G3588]] persuading [[G3982]] them [[G846]] concerning [[G4012]] Jesus, [[G2424]] both [[G5037]] out [[G575]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] of Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] from [[G575]] morning [[G4404]] till [[G2193]] evening. [[G2073]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] some [[G3588]] believed [[G3982]] the things [[G3588]] which were spoken, [[G3004]] and [[G1161]] some [[G3588]] believed not. [[G569]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] they agreed not [[G800]] when [[G5607]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] they departed, [[G630]] after that [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] had spoken [[G2036]] one [[G1520]] word, [[G4487]] Well [[G2573]] spake [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] by [[G1223]] Esaias [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] unto [[G4314]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]]

### 26
Saying, [[G3004]] Go [[G4198]] unto [[G4314]] this [[G5126]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] say, [[G2036]] Hearing [[G189]] ye shall hear, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G4920]] understand; [[G4920]] and [[G2532]] seeing [[G991]] ye shall see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] perceive: [[G1492]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] of this [[G5127]] people [[G2992]] is waxed gross, [[G3975]] and [[G2532]] their [[G3588]] ears [[G3775]] dull of [[G917]] are [[G191]] hearing, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] eyes have they [[G3788]] closed; [[G2576]] lest [[G3379]] they should see [[G1492]]  with [[G3588]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] hear [[G191]] with [[G3775]] ears, [[G3775]] and [[G2532]] understand [[G4920]] with [[G2588]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] should be converted, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] I should heal [[G2390]] them. [[G846]]

### 28
Be it [[G2077]] known [[G1110]] therefore [[G3767]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] salvation [[G4992]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] is sent [[G649]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1484]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] will hear it. [[G191]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] when he [[G846]] had said [[G2036]] these words, [[G5023]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] departed, [[G565]] and had [[G2192]] great [[G4183]] reasoning [[G4803]] among [[G1722]] themselves. [[G1438]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] dwelt [[G3306]] two years [[G1333]] whole [[G3650]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G2398]] hired house, [[G3410]] and [[G2532]] received [[G588]] all [[G3956]] that came in [[G1531]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]]

### 31
Preaching [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] teaching [[G1321]] those things [[G3588]] which concern [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] confidence, [[G3954]] no man forbidding him. [[G209]]
