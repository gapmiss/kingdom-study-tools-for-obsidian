### 1
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] five [[G4002]] days [[G2250]] Ananias [[G367]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] descended [[G2597]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] a certain [[G5100]] orator [[G4489]] Tertullus, [[G5061]] who [[G3748]] informed [[G1718]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] against [[G2596]] Paul. [[G3972]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] when he [[G846]] was called forth, [[G2564]] Tertullus [[G5061]] began [[G756]] to accuse [[G2723]] saying, [[G3004]] Seeing that by [[G1223]] thee [[G4675]] we enjoy [[G5177]] great [[G4183]] quietness, [[G1515]] and that [[G2532]] very worthy deeds [[G2735]] are done [[G1096]] unto this [[G5129]] nation [[G1484]] by [[G1223]] thy [[G4674]] providence, [[G4307]]

### 3
We accept [[G588]] always, [[G3839]] and [[G2532]] in all places, [[G3837]] most noble [[G2903]] Felix, [[G5344]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] thankfulness. [[G2169]]

### 4
Notwithstanding, [[G1161]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] I be [[G1465]] further [[G4119]] tedious [[G1465]] unto [[G1909]] thee, [[G4571]] I pray [[G3870]] thee [[G4571]] that thou wouldest hear [[G191]] us [[G2257]] of thy [[G4674]] clemency [[G1932]] a few words. [[G4935]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] we have found [[G2147]] this [[G5126]] man [[G435]] pestilent [[G3061]] and [[G2532]] a mover [[G2795]] of sedition [[G4714]] among all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] throughout [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G3625]] and [[G5037]] a ringleader [[G4414]] the [[G3588]] of of [[G3480]] sect [[G139]] the [[G3588]] Nazarenes: [[G3480]]

### 6
Who [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] hath gone about [[G3985]] to profane [[G953]] the [[G3588]] temple: [[G2411]] whom [[G3739]] we took, [[G2902]] and [[G2532]] would have [[G2309]] judged [[G2919]] according to [[G2596]] our [[G2251]] law. [[G3551]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] Lysias [[G3079]] came [[G3928]] and with [[G3326]] great [[G4183]] violence [[G970]] took away [[G520]] out of [[G1537]] our [[G2257]] hands, [[G5495]]

### 8
Commanding [[G2753]] his [[G846]] accusers to [[G2725]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G1909]] thee: [[G4571]] by examining [[G350]] of [[G3844]] whom [[G3739]] thyself [[G846]] mayest [[G1410]] take knowledge [[G1921]] of [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] these things, [[G5130]] whereof [[G3739]] we [[G2249]] accuse [[G2723]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] also [[G2532]] assented, [[G4934]] saying that [[G5335]] these things [[G5023]] were [[G2192]] so. [[G3779]]

### 10
Then after that [[G1161]] Paul, [[G3972]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] had beckoned [[G3506]] unto him [[G846]] to speak, [[G3004]] answered, [[G611]] Forasmuch [[G4012]] as I know that [[G1987]] thou [[G4571]] hast been [[G5607]] of [[G1537]] many [[G4183]] years [[G2094]] a judge [[G2923]] unto this [[G5129]] nation, [[G1484]] the more cheerfully [[G2115]] I do for [[G626]] answer [[G626]] myself: [[G1683]]

### 11
Because that [[G1410]] thou [[G4675]] mayest [[G1410]] understand, [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] there are [[G1526]]  yet [[G4119]] but [[G2228]] twelve [[G1177]] days [[G2250]] since [[G575]] I went up [[G305]] to [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] for to worship. [[G4352]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] neither [[G3777]] they [[G2147]] found [[G2147]] me [[G3165]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] disputing [[G1256]] with [[G4314]] any man, [[G5100]] neither [[G2228]] raising up [[G1999]] the people, [[G3793]] neither [[G3777]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] nor [[G3777]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] city: [[G4172]]

### 13
Neither [[G3777]] can they [[G1410]] prove the things [[G3936]] whereof [[G4012]] they now [[G3568]] accuse [[G2723]] me. [[G3450]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] I confess [[G3670]] unto thee, [[G4671]] that [[G3754]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] which [[G3739]] they call [[G3004]] heresy, [[G139]] so [[G3779]] worship I [[G3000]] the God [[G2316]] of my fathers, [[G3971]] believing [[G4100]] all things [[G3956]] which [[G3588]] are written [[G1125]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4396]] prophets: [[G4396]]

### 15
And have [[G2192]] hope [[G1680]] toward [[G1519]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] they [[G846]]  themselves [[G3778]] also [[G2532]] allow, [[G4327]] that there shall [[G3195]] be [[G2071]] a resurrection [[G386]] of the dead, [[G3498]] both [[G5037]] of the just [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] unjust. [[G94]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] herein [[G1722]]  do I [[G5129]] exercise [[G778]] myself, [[G846]] to have [[G2192]] always [[G1275]] a conscience [[G4893]] void of offence [[G677]] toward [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] men. [[G444]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] after [[G1223]] many [[G4119]] years [[G2094]] I came [[G3854]] to bring [[G4160]] alms [[G1654]] to [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] offerings. [[G4376]]

### 18
Whereupon [[G1722]] certain [[G5100]] Jews [[G2453]] from [[G575]] Asia [[G773]] found [[G2147]] me [[G3165]] purified [[G48]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] neither [[G3756]] with [[G3326]] multitude, [[G3793]] nor [[G3761]] with [[G3326]] tumult. [[G2351]]

### 19
Who [[G3739]] ought [[G1163]] to have been here [[G3918]] before [[G1909]] thee, [[G4675]] and [[G2532]] object, [[G2723]] if [[G1487]] they had [[G2192]] ought [[G5100]] against [[G4314]] me. [[G3165]]

### 20
Or else [[G2228]] these [[G3778]] let [[G2036]] same [[G846]] say, [[G2036]] if [[G1487]] they have found [[G2147]] any [[G5100]] evil doing [[G92]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] while I [[G3450]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]]

### 21
Except [[G2228]] it be for [[G4012]] this [[G3778]] one [[G1520]] voice, [[G5456]] that [[G3739]] I cried [[G2896]] standing [[G2476]] among [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] Touching [[G4012]] the resurrection [[G386]] of the dead [[G3498]] I [[G1473]] am called in question [[G2919]] by [[G5259]] you [[G5216]] this day. [[G4594]]

### 22
And when [[G1161]] Felix [[G5344]] heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] more perfect [[G199]] having [[G1492]] knowledge [[G1492]] of [[G4012]] way, [[G3598]] he deferred [[G306]] them, [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] When [[G3752]] Lysias [[G3079]] the chief [[G3588]] captain [[G5506]] shall come down, [[G2597]] I will know the uttermost [[G1231]] of your [[G5209]] matter. [[G2596]]

### 23
And [[G5037]] he commanded [[G1299]] a [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] to keep [[G5083]] Paul, [[G3972]] and [[G5037]] to let have [[G2192]] liberty, [[G425]] and [[G2532]] that he should forbid [[G2967]] none [[G3367]] of his [[G846]] acquaintance [[G2398]] to minister [[G5256]] or [[G2228]] come unto [[G4334]] him. [[G846]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] certain [[G5100]] days, [[G2250]] when [[G3854]] Felix [[G5344]] came [[G3854]] with [[G4862]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] Drusilla, [[G1409]] which was [[G5607]] a Jewess, [[G2453]] he sent for [[G3343]] Paul, [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 25
And as [[G1161]] he [[G846]] reasoned [[G1256]] of [[G4012]] righteousness, [[G1343]] temperance, [[G1466]] and [[G2532]] judgment [[G2917]] to [[G3195]] come, [[G2071]] Felix [[G5344]] trembled, [[G1719]]  and [[G1096]] answered, [[G611]] Go thy way [[G4198]] for this [[G3568]] time; [[G3568]] when [[G1161]] I have [[G3335]] a convenient season, [[G2540]] I will call for [[G3333]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 26
He hoped [[G1679]] also [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] money [[G5536]] should have been given [[G1325]] him [[G846]] of [[G5259]] Paul, [[G3972]] that [[G3704]] he might loose [[G3089]] him: [[G846]] wherefore [[G1352]] he sent for [[G3343]] him [[G846]] the oftener, [[G4437]] and [[G3656]] communed [[G3656]] with him. [[G846]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] after [[G4137]] two years [[G1333]] Porcius [[G4201]] Festus [[G5347]] came [[G2983]]  into [[G1240]] Felix' room: [[G5344]] and [[G5037]] Felix, [[G5344]] willing [[G2309]] to shew [[G2698]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] a pleasure, [[G5485]] left [[G2641]] Paul [[G1210]] bound.
