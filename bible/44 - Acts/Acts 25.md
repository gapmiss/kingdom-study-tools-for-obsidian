### 1
Now [[G3767]] when Festus [[G5347]] was come [[G1910]] into [[G1885]] the [[G3588]] province, [[G1885]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] he ascended [[G305]] from [[G575]] Caesarea [[G2542]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 2
Then [[G1161]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief [[G4413]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] informed [[G1718]] him [[G846]] against [[G2596]] Paul, [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] besought [[G3870]] him, [[G846]]

### 3
And desired [[G154]] favour [[G5485]] against [[G2596]] him, [[G846]] that [[G3704]] he would send for [[G3343]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] laying [[G4160]] wait [[G1747]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] way to [[G3598]] kill [[G337]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
But [[G3767]] Festus [[G5347]] answered, that [[G611]] Paul [[G3972]] should be kept [[G5083]] at [[G1722]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and [[G1161]] that he himself [[G1438]] would [[G3195]] depart [[G1607]] shortly [[G5034]]

### 5
if [[G1487]] them [[G3588]] Let [[G4782]] therefore, [[G3767]] said he, [[G5346]] which among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] are able, [[G1415]] go down with [[G4782]] and accuse [[G2723]] this [[G5129]] man, [[G435]] there be [[G2076]] any [[G5100]] wickedness [[G824]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] when he had tarried [[G1304]] among [[G1722]] them [[G846]] more [[G4119]] than [[G2228]] ten [[G1176]] days, [[G2250]] he went down [[G2597]] unto [[G1519]] Caesarea; [[G2542]] the [[G3588]] and next [[G1887]] day [[G1887]] sitting [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] the judgment [[G3588]] seat [[G968]] commanded [[G2753]] Paul [[G3972]] to be brought. [[G71]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] when was [[G3854]] he [[G846]] come, [[G3854]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] which came down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] stood round about, [[G4026]] and laid [[G5342]] many [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] grievous [[G926]] complaints [[G157]] against [[G2596]] Paul, [[G3972]] which [[G3739]] they could [[G2480]] not [[G3756]] prove. [[G584]]

### 8
While he answered [[G626]] for himself, [[G846]] Neither [[G3777]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] law of [[G3551]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] neither [[G3777]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] nor yet [[G3777]] against [[G1519]] Caesar, [[G2541]] have I offended [[G264]] any thing at all. [[G5100]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] Festus, [[G5347]] willing [[G2309]] to do [[G2698]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] a pleasure, [[G5485]] answered [[G611]] Paul, [[G3972]] and said, [[G2036]] Wilt thou [[G2309]] go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and there [[G1563]] be judged [[G2919]] of [[G4012]] these things [[G5130]] before [[G1909]] me? [[G1700]]

### 10
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] Paul, [[G3972]] stand [[G2476]] I [[G1510]] at [[G1909]] Caesar's [[G2541]]  judgment [[G3588]] seat, [[G968]] where [[G3757]] I [[G3165]] ought [[G1163]] to be judged: [[G2919]] to the Jews [[G2453]] no [[G3762]] have I done [[G91]] wrong, [[G91]] as [[G5613]] thou [[G4771]] very well [[G2566]] knowest. [[G1921]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] I be an offender, [[G91]] or [[G2532]] have committed [[G4238]] any thing [[G5100]] worthy [[G514]] of death, [[G2288]] I refuse [[G3868]] not [[G3756]] to die: [[G599]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] there be [[G2076]] none [[G3762]] of these things whereof [[G3739]] these [[G3778]] accuse [[G2723]] me, [[G3450]] no man [[G3762]] may [[G1410]] deliver [[G5483]] me [[G3165]] unto them. [[G846]] I appeal unto [[G1941]] Caesar. [[G2541]]

### 12
Then [[G5119]] Festus, [[G5347]] when he had conferred [[G4814]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4824]] answered, [[G611]] Hast thou appealed [[G1941]] unto Caesar? [[G2541]] unto [[G1909]] Caesar [[G2541]] shalt thou go. [[G4198]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] after [[G1230]] certain [[G5100]] days [[G2250]] king [[G935]] Agrippa [[G67]] and [[G2532]] Bernice [[G959]] came [[G2658]] unto [[G1519]] Caesarea [[G2542]] to salute [[G782]] Festus. [[G5347]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] they had been [[G1304]] there [[G1563]] many [[G4119]] days, [[G2250]] Festus [[G5347]] declared [[G394]] Paul's [[G3972]] cause [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G935]] king, [[G935]] saying, [[G3004]] There is [[G2076]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G435]] left [[G2641]] in bonds [[G1198]] by [[G5259]] Felix: [[G5344]]

### 15
About [[G4012]] whom, [[G3739]] when I [[G3450]] was [[G1096]] at [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews [[G2453]] informed [[G1718]] desiring [[G154]] judgment [[G1349]] against [[G2596]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
To [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] I answered, [[G611]] It is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] the manner [[G1485]] of the Romans [[G4514]] to deliver [[G5483]] any [[G5100]] man [[G444]] to [[G1519]] die, [[G684]] before [[G4250]] that [[G2228]] he which [[G3588]] is accused [[G2723]] have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] accusers [[G2725]] face face, [[G4383]]  to [[G2596]] and [[G5037]] have [[G2983]] licence [[G5117]] to answer for himself [[G627]] concerning [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] crime laid against him. [[G1462]]

### 17
Therefore, [[G3767]] when they [[G846]] were come [[G4905]] hither, [[G1759]] without [[G3367]] any delay [[G311]] the [[G3588]] on [[G1836]] morrow [[G1836]] I sat [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat, [[G968]] and commanded [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] man to be brought [[G435]] forth. [[G71]]

### 18
Against [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] when [[G2725]] accusers [[G2725]] stood up, [[G2476]] they brought [[G2018]] none [[G3762]] accusation [[G156]] of such things [[G3739]] as I [[G1473]] supposed: [[G5282]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] had [[G2192]] certain [[G5100]] questions [[G2213]] against [[G4314]] him [[G846]] of [[G4012]] their own [[G2398]] superstition, [[G1175]] and [[G2532]] of [[G4012]] one [[G5100]] Jesus, [[G2424]] which was dead, [[G2348]] whom [[G3739]] Paul [[G3972]] affirmed [[G5335]] to be alive. [[G2198]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] because [[G639]] I [[G1473]] doubted [[G639]] of [[G1519]] such manner [[G5127]] of questions, [[G2214]] I asked [[G3004]] whether [[G1487]] he would [[G1014]] go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and there [[G2546]] be judged [[G2919]] of [[G4012]] these matters. [[G5130]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] when Paul [[G3972]] had appealed [[G1941]] to be reserved [[G5083]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] hearing [[G1233]] of Augustus, [[G4575]] I commanded [[G2753]] him [[G846]] to be kept [[G5083]] till [[G2193]] I might send [[G3992]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] Caesar. [[G2541]]

### 22
Then [[G1161]] Agrippa [[G67]] said [[G5346]] unto [[G4314]] Festus, [[G5347]] I would [[G1014]] also [[G2532]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] myself. [[G846]] To morrow, [[G839]] said [[G5346]] he, [[G3588]] thou shalt hear [[G191]] him. [[G846]]

### 23
And [[G3767]] on the [[G3588]] morrow, [[G1887]]  when [[G3588]] Agrippa [[G67]] was come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] Bernice, [[G959]] with [[G3326]] great [[G4183]] pomp, [[G5325]] and [[G2532]] was entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] place of hearing, [[G201]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] chief captains, [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] principal [[G1851]] men [[G435]] of [[G5607]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] at [[G2753]] Festus' [[G5347]] commandment [[G2753]] Paul [[G3972]] was brought forth. [[G71]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] Festus [[G5347]] said, [[G5346]] King [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] and [[G2532]] all men [[G3956]] which [[G3588]] are here present [[G4840]] with us, [[G2254]] ye see [[G2334]] this [[G5126]] man, [[G435]] about [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] multitude of [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] have dealt [[G1793]] with me, [[G3427]] both [[G5037]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] here, [[G1759]] crying that [[G1916]] he [[G846]] ought [[G1163]] not [[G3361]] to live [[G2198]] any longer. [[G3371]] the [[G3588]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] when I [[G1473]] found [[G2638]] that he [[G846]] had committed [[G4238]] nothing [[G3367]] worthy [[G514]] of death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] that he [[G5127]] himself [[G846]] hath appealed to [[G1941]] Augustus, [[G4575]] I have determined [[G2919]] to send [[G3992]] him. [[G846]]

### 26
Of [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] certain [[G804]] thing [[G5100]] to write [[G1125]]  unto my [[G3588]] lord. [[G2962]] Wherefore [[G1352]] I have brought forth [[G4254]] him [[G846]] before [[G1909]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] specially [[G3122]] before [[G1909]] thee, [[G4675]] O king [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] that, [[G3704]]  after [[G3588]] examination [[G351]] had, [[G1096]] I might have [[G2192]] somewhat [[G5100]] to write. [[G1125]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] it seemeth [[G1380]] to me [[G3427]] unreasonable [[G249]] to send [[G3992]] a prisoner, [[G1198]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] withal to signify [[G4591]] the [[G3588]] crimes [[G156]] against [[G2596]] him. [[G846]]
