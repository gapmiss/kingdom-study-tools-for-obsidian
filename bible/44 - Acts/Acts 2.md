### 1
And [[G2532]] when was fully [[G4845]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G4005]] Pentecost [[G4005]] come, [[G4845]] they [[G846]] were [[G2258]] all [[G537]] with one accord [[G3661]] in [[G1722]]  one place. [[G1909]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] suddenly [[G869]] there came [[G1096]] a sound [[G2279]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] as [[G5618]] of a rushing [[G5342]] mighty [[G972]] wind, [[G4157]] and [[G2532]] it filled [[G4137]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] where [[G3757]] they were [[G2258]] sitting. [[G2521]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] there appeared [[G3700]] unto them [[G846]] cloven [[G1266]] tongues [[G1100]] like as [[G5616]] of fire, [[G4442]] and [[G5037]] it sat [[G2523]] upon [[G1909]] each [[G1538]] of them. [[G846]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] they were [[G4130]] all [[G537]] filled [[G4130]] with the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to speak with [[G2980]] other [[G2087]] tongues, [[G1100]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] utterance. [[G669]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] there were [[G2258]] dwelling [[G2730]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] Jews, [[G2453]] devout [[G2126]] men, [[G435]] out of [[G575]] every [[G3956]] nation [[G1484]] under [[G5259]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 6
Now [[G1161]] when abroad, [[G1096]] this [[G3778]] was [[G1096]] noised [[G5456]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G4128]] came together, [[G4905]] and [[G2532]] were confounded, [[G4797]] because that [[G3754]] every man [[G1538]] heard [[G191]] them [[G846]] speak [[G2980]] in his own [[G2398]] language. [[G1258]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] they were [[G1839]] all [[G3956]] amazed [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] marvelled, [[G2296]] saying [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] Behold, [[G2400]] are [[G1526]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] which speak [[G2980]] Galilaeans? [[G1057]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] hear [[G191]] we [[G2249]] every man [[G1538]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] own [[G2398]] tongue, [[G1258]] wherein [[G3739]] we were born? [[G1080]]

### 9
Parthians, [[G3934]] and [[G2532]] Medes, [[G3370]] and [[G2532]] Elamites, [[G1639]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dwellers [[G2730]]  in [[G3588]] Mesopotamia, [[G3318]] and [[G5037]] in Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Cappadocia, [[G2587]] in Pontus, [[G4195]] and [[G2532]] Asia, [[G773]]

### 10
Phrygia, [[G5435]] and [[G2532]] Pamphylia, [[G3828]] in Egypt, [[G125]] and [[G2532]] in the [[G3588]] parts [[G3313]] of [[G3033]] Libya [[G3033]] about [[G2596]] Cyrene, [[G2957]] and [[G2532]] strangers [[G1927]] of Rome, [[G4514]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] proselytes, [[G4339]]

### 11
Cretes [[G2912]] and [[G2532]] Arabians, [[G690]] we do hear [[G191]] them [[G846]] speak [[G2980]] in our [[G2251]] tongues [[G1100]] the [[G3588]] wonderful works [[G3167]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] they were [[G1839]] all [[G3956]] amazed, [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] were in doubt, [[G1280]] saying [[G3004]] one [[G243]] to [[G4314]] another, [[G243]] What [[G5101]] meaneth [[G2309]] this? [[G5124]]

### 13
Others [[G2087]] mocking [[G5512]] said, [[G3004]] These men [[G3325]] are [[G1526]] full [[G3325]] of new wine. [[G1098]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] Peter, [[G4074]] standing up [[G2476]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] eleven, [[G1733]] lifted up [[G1869]] his [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] said [[G669]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye men [[G435]] of Judaea, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] all [[G537]] that dwell [[G2730]] at Jerusalem, [[G2419]] be [[G2077]] this [[G5124]] known [[G1110]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] hearken to [[G1801]] my [[G3450]] words: [[G4487]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] these [[G3778]] not [[G3756]] are [[G3184]] drunken, [[G3184]] as [[G5613]] ye [[G5210]] suppose, [[G5274]] seeing [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] the [[G5610]] third [[G5154]] hour [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2250]] day. [[G2250]]

### 16
But [[G235]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] that [[G3588]] which was spoken [[G2046]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Joel; [[G2493]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] it shall come to pass [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] days, [[G2250]] saith [[G3004]] God, [[G2316]] I will pour out [[G1632]] of [[G575]] my [[G3450]] Spirit [[G4151]] upon [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] flesh: [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] sons [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] daughters shall [[G2364]] prophesy, [[G4395]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]]  young [[G3588]] men shall [[G3495]] see [[G3700]] visions, [[G3706]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] old men [[G4245]] shall dream [[G1797]] dreams: [[G1798]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] servants [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] handmaidens I will pour [[G1399]] out [[G1632]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] of [[G575]] my [[G3450]] Spirit; [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they shall prophesy: [[G4395]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] I will shew [[G1325]] wonders [[G5059]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] above, [[G507]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] beneath; [[G2736]] blood, [[G129]] and [[G2532]] fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] vapour [[G822]] of smoke: [[G2586]]

### 20
The [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] shall be turned [[G3344]] into [[G1519]] darkness, [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] into [[G1519]] blood, [[G129]] before that [[G4250]] great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] notable [[G2016]] day [[G2250]] of the Lord [[G2962]] come: [[G2064]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] it shall come to pass, [[G2071]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall call on [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the Lord [[G2962]] shall be saved. [[G4982]]

### 22
Ye men [[G435]] of Israel, [[G2475]] hear [[G191]] these [[G5128]] words; [[G3056]] Jesus [[G2424]]  of Nazareth, [[G3588]] a man [[G435]] approved by [[G584]] of [[G575]] God [[G2316]] among [[G1519]] you [[G5209]] miracles [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] signs, [[G4592]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] did [[G4160]] by [[G1223]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of you, [[G5216]] as [[G2531]] ye yourselves [[G846]] also [[G2532]] know: [[G1492]]

### 23
Him, [[G5126]] being delivered [[G1560]] the [[G3588]] by [[G1012]] determinate [[G3724]] counsel [[G1012]] and [[G2532]] foreknowledge [[G4268]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] ye have taken, [[G2983]] and by [[G1223]] wicked [[G459]] hands [[G5495]] have crucified [[G4362]] and slain: [[G337]]

### 24
Whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath raised up, [[G450]] having loosed [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] pains [[G5604]] of [[G2288]] death: [[G2288]] because [[G2530]] it was [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] possible [[G1415]] that should be [[G2902]] he [[G846]] holden [[G2902]] of [[G5259]] it. [[G846]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] David [[G1138]] speaketh [[G3004]] concerning [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] I foresaw [[G4308]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] always [[G3956]] before [[G1799]] my face, [[G3450]] for [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] right hand, [[G1188]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] I should be [[G4531]] moved: [[G4531]]

### 26
Therefore [[G1223]] did [[G2165]] my [[G3450]] heart [[G2588]] rejoice, [[G2165]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] tongue [[G1100]] was glad; [[G21]] moreover [[G2089]] also [[G1161]] my [[G3450]] flesh shall [[G4561]] rest [[G2681]] in [[G1909]] hope: [[G1680]]

### 27
Because [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] thou wilt [[G1459]] leave [[G1459]] my [[G3450]] soul [[G5590]] in [[G1519]] hell, [[G86]] neither [[G3761]] wilt thou suffer [[G1325]] thine [[G4675]] Holy One [[G3741]] to see [[G1492]] corruption. [[G1312]]

### 28
Thou hast made known [[G1107]] to me [[G3427]] the ways [[G3598]] of life; [[G2222]] thou shalt make full [[G4137]] me [[G3165]] of joy [[G2167]] with [[G3326]] thy [[G4675]] countenance. [[G4383]]

### 29
Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] let [[G1832]] freely [[G3954]] me speak [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] patriarch [[G3966]] David, [[G1138]] that [[G3754]] both [[G2532]] he is [[G5053]] dead [[G5053]] and [[G2532]] buried, [[G2290]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] sepulchre [[G3418]] is [[G2076]] with [[G1722]] us [[G2254]] unto [[G891]] this [[G3778]] day. [[G2250]]

### 30
Therefore [[G3767]] being [[G5225]] a prophet, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] had sworn that [[G3660]] with an oath [[G3727]] to him, [[G846]] of [[G1537]] the fruit [[G2590]] of his [[G846]] loins, [[G3751]] according to [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] he would raise up [[G450]] Christ [[G5547]] to sit [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] throne; [[G2362]]

### 31
He seeing this before [[G4275]] spake [[G2980]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G3754]] his [[G846]] was [[G2641]] soul [[G5590]] not [[G3756]] left [[G2641]] in [[G1519]] hell, [[G86]] neither [[G3761]] his [[G846]] flesh did [[G4561]] see [[G1492]] corruption. [[G1312]]

### 32
This [[G5126]] Jesus [[G2424]] hath up, [[G450]] God [[G2316]] raised [[G450]] whereof [[G3739]] we [[G2249]] all [[G3956]] are [[G2070]] witnesses. [[G3144]]

### 33
Therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] by right [[G1188]] of [[G2316]] being [[G5312]] hand [[G1188]] God [[G2316]] exalted, [[G5312]] and [[G5037]] having received [[G2983]] of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] he hath shed forth [[G1632]] this, [[G5124]] which [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] now [[G3568]] see [[G991]] and [[G2532]] hear. [[G191]]

### 34
For [[G1063]] David [[G1138]] not [[G3756]] is [[G305]] ascended [[G305]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] heavens: [[G3772]] but [[G1161]] he saith [[G3004]] himself, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G3588]] my [[G3450]] Lord, [[G2962]] Sit thou [[G2521]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] right hand, [[G1188]]

### 35
Until [[G2193]] I [[G302]] make [[G5087]] thy [[G4675]] foes [[G2190]] thy [[G4675]] footstool. [[G5286]]

### 36
Therefore [[G3767]] let [[G1097]] all [[G3956]] the house [[G3624]] of Israel [[G2474]] know [[G1097]] assuredly, [[G806]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] hath made [[G4160]] same [[G846]] that [[G5126]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] have crucified, [[G4717]] both [[G2532]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 37
Now when [[G1161]] they heard [[G191]] they were pricked [[G2660]]  in their [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G5037]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3062]] rest [[G3062]] of the apostles, [[G652]] Men [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] what [[G5101]] shall we do? [[G4160]]

### 38
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G5346]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Repent, [[G3340]] and [[G2532]] be baptized [[G907]] every one [[G1538]] of you [[G5216]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] for [[G1519]] the remission [[G859]] of sins, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] ye shall receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] gift of [[G1431]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 39
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] is [[G2076]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] to your [[G5216]] children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] are afar off, [[G3112]] as many as [[G3745]]  the [[G302]] Lord [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] God [[G2316]] shall call. [[G4341]]

### 40
And [[G5037]] with [[G3056]] many [[G4119]] other [[G2087]] words [[G3056]] did he testify [[G1263]] and [[G2532]] exhort, [[G3870]] saying, [[G3004]] Save yourselves [[G4982]] from [[G575]] this [[G3778]] untoward [[G4646]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 41
Then [[G3767]] gladly [[G780]] that [[G588]] they were [[G907]] received [[G588]] his [[G846]] word [[G3056]] baptized: [[G907]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] day there were [[G2250]] added [[G4369]] about [[G5616]] three thousand [[G5153]] souls. [[G5590]]

### 42
And [[G1161]]  they [[G2258]] continued stedfastly [[G4342]] the [[G3588]] in [[G652]] apostles' [[G652]] doctrine [[G1322]] and [[G2532]] fellowship, [[G2842]] and [[G2532]] in [[G2800]] breaking [[G2800]] of [[G740]] bread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] in [[G4335]] prayers. [[G4335]]

### 43
And [[G1161]] fear [[G5401]] came upon [[G1096]] every [[G3956]] soul: [[G5590]] and [[G5037]] many [[G4183]] wonders [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] were done [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 44
And [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] that believed [[G4100]] were [[G2258]] together, [[G1909]] and [[G2532]] had [[G2192]] all things [[G537]] common; [[G2839]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] sold [[G4097]] their [[G3588]] possessions [[G2933]] and [[G2532]] goods, [[G5223]] and [[G2532]] parted [[G1266]] them [[G846]] to all [[G3956]] as [[G2530]] every [[G302]] man [[G5100]] had [[G2192]] need. [[G5532]]

### 46
And [[G5037]] they, continuing [[G4342]] daily [[G2596]]  with one [[G2250]] accord [[G3661]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G5037]] breaking [[G2806]] bread [[G740]] from house [[G3624]] to house, [[G2596]] did eat their [[G3335]] meat [[G5160]] with [[G1722]] gladness [[G20]] and [[G2532]] singleness [[G858]] of heart, [[G2588]]

### 47
Praising [[G134]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] having [[G2192]] favour [[G5485]] with [[G4314]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] added [[G4369]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1577]] church [[G1577]] daily [[G2250]] such [[G3588]] as [[G2596]] should be saved. [[G4982]]
