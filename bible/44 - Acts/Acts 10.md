### 1
There [[G1161]] was [[G2258]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G435]] in [[G1722]] Caesarea [[G2542]] called [[G3686]] Cornelius, [[G2883]] a centurion [[G1543]] of [[G1537]] the band [[G4686]] called [[G2564]] the [[G3588]] Italian [[G2483]]

### 2
devout [[G2152]] and [[G2532]] one that feared [[G5399]] God [[G2316]] with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] which [[G5037]] gave [[G4160]] much [[G4183]] alms [[G1654]] to [[G2992]] the to [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] prayed [[G1189]] God [[G2316]] alway. [[G1275]]

### 3
He saw [[G1492]] in [[G1722]] a vision [[G3705]] evidently [[G5320]] about [[G5616]] the ninth [[G1766]] hour [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2250]] day [[G2250]] an angel [[G32]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] coming in [[G1525]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saying [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Cornelius. [[G2883]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] when [[G816]] looked [[G816]] on him, [[G846]] he was [[G1096]] afraid, [[G1719]] and said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] is it, [[G2076]] Lord? [[G2962]] And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thy [[G4675]] prayers [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] thine [[G4675]] alms are come [[G1654]] up [[G305]] for [[G1519]] a memorial [[G3422]] before [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] send [[G3992]] men [[G435]] to [[G1519]] Joppa, [[G2445]] and [[G2532]] call for [[G3343]] Simon, [[G4613]] whose [[G3739]] surname is [[G1941]] Peter: [[G4074]]

### 6
He [[G3778]] lodgeth [[G3579]] with [[G3844]] one [[G5100]] Simon [[G4613]] a tanner, [[G1038]] whose [[G3739]] house [[G3614]] is [[G2076]] by [[G3844]] the sea side: [[G2281]] he [[G3778]] shall tell [[G2980]] thee [[G4671]] what [[G5101]] thou [[G4571]] oughtest [[G1163]] to do. [[G4160]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] which [[G3588]] spake [[G2980]] unto [[G2883]] Cornelius [[G2883]] was departed, [[G565]] he called [[G5455]] two [[G1417]] of his [[G846]]  household [[G3588]] servants, [[G3610]] and [[G2532]] a devout [[G2152]] soldier [[G4757]] them [[G3588]] of that continually; [[G4342]] waited [[G4342]] on him [[G846]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] when he had declared [[G1834]] all things [[G537]] unto them, [[G846]] he sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Joppa. [[G2445]]

### 9
On [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] morrow, [[G1887]] as went on their [[G3596]] they [[G1565]] journey, [[G3596]] and [[G2532]] drew nigh [[G1448]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G4172]] city, [[G4172]] Peter [[G4074]] went up [[G305]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetop [[G1430]] to pray [[G4336]] about [[G4012]] the sixth [[G1623]] hour: [[G5610]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] he became [[G1096]] very hungry, [[G4361]] and [[G2532]] would [[G2309]] have eaten: [[G1089]] but [[G1161]] while they [[G1565]] made ready, [[G3903]] he [[G846]] fell [[G1968]] into [[G1909]] a trance, [[G1611]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] saw [[G2334]] heaven [[G3772]] opened, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] a certain [[G5100]] vessel [[G4632]] descending [[G2597]] unto [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] as [[G5613]] it had been a great [[G3173]] sheet [[G3607]] knit [[G1210]] at the four [[G5064]] corners, [[G746]] and [[G2532]] let down [[G2524]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]]

### 12
Wherein [[G1722]] were [[G5225]] all manner of [[G3956]] fourfooted beasts [[G5074]] of [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]]  wild [[G3588]] beasts, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]]  creeping things, [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] fowls [[G4071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] air. [[G3772]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] there came [[G1096]] a voice [[G5456]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Rise, [[G450]] Peter; [[G4074]] kill, [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] eat. [[G5315]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G2036]] Not so, [[G3365]] Lord; [[G2962]] for [[G3754]] never [[G3763]] I have [[G5315]] eaten [[G5315]] any thing [[G3956]] that is common [[G2839]] or [[G2228]] unclean. [[G169]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] the voice [[G5456]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] again [[G3825]] the [[G1537]] second time, [[G1208]] What [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath cleansed, [[G2511]] call common. [[G2840]] not [[G3361]] thou [[G4771]]

### 16
This [[G5124]] was done [[G1096]] thrice: [[G5151]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] vessel [[G4632]] was received up [[G353]] again [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] while [[G5613]] Peter [[G4074]] doubted [[G1280]] in [[G1722]] himself [[G1438]] what [[G5101]] this [[G3588]] vision [[G3705]] which [[G3739]] he had seen [[G1492]] should mean, [[G1498]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] which [[G3588]] were sent [[G649]] from [[G575]] Cornelius [[G2883]] had made inquiry [[G1331]] for Simon's [[G4613]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] stood [[G2186]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] gate, [[G4440]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] called, [[G5455]] and asked [[G4441]] whether [[G1487]] Simon, [[G4613]] which [[G3588]] was surnamed [[G1941]] Peter, [[G4074]] were lodged [[G3579]] there. [[G1759]]

### 19
While [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] thought [[G1760]] on [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] vision, [[G3705]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] said unto [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] Behold, [[G2400]] three [[G5140]] men [[G435]] seek [[G2212]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 20
Arise [[G450]] therefore, [[G235]] and get thee down, [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] doubting [[G1252]] nothing: [[G3367]] for [[G1360]] I [[G1473]] have sent [[G649]] them. [[G846]]

### 21
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] went down [[G2597]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] which [[G3588]] were sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] from [[G575]] Cornelius; [[G2883]] and said, [[G2036]] Behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] he whom [[G3739]] ye seek: [[G2212]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] cause [[G156]] wherefore [[G1223]] ye [[G3739]] are come? [[G3918]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Cornelius [[G2883]] the centurion, [[G1543]] a just [[G1342]] man, [[G435]] and [[G2532]] one that feareth [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G5037]] of good report [[G3140]] among [[G5259]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] nation [[G1484]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews, [[G2453]] was warned from God [[G5537]] by [[G5259]] an holy [[G40]] angel [[G32]] to send for [[G3343]] thee [[G4571]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] to hear [[G191]] words [[G4487]] of [[G3844]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 23
Then [[G3767]] called he in, [[G1528]] them [[G846]] and lodged [[G3579]] And [[G1161]] on the [[G3588]] morrow [[G1887]] Peter [[G4074]] went away [[G1831]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] brethren [[G80]] from [[G575]] Joppa [[G2445]] accompanied [[G4905]] him. [[G846]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] morrow after [[G1887]] they entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] Caesarea. [[G2542]] And [[G1161]] Cornelius [[G2883]] waited for [[G4328]] them, [[G846]] and had [[G2258]] called together [[G4779]] his [[G846]] kinsmen [[G4773]] and [[G2532]] near [[G316]] friends. [[G5384]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] as [[G5613]] Peter [[G4074]] was [[G1096]] coming in, [[G1525]] Cornelius [[G2883]] met [[G4876]] him, [[G846]] and fell down [[G4098]] at [[G1909]]  his [[G3588]] feet, [[G4228]] and worshipped [[G4352]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] took up, [[G1453]] him [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Stand up; [[G450]] I [[G2504]] myself [[G846]] also [[G2504]] am [[G1510]] a man. [[G444]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] as he talked with [[G4926]] him, [[G846]] he went in, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] many [[G4183]] that were come together. [[G4905]]

### 28
And [[G5037]] he said [[G5346]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Ye [[G5210]] know [[G1987]] how that [[G5613]] it is [[G2076]] an unlawful thing [[G111]] for a man [[G435]] that is a Jew [[G2453]] to keep company, [[G2853]] or [[G2228]] come unto [[G4334]] one of another nation; [[G246]] but [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] hath shewed that [[G1166]] me [[G1698]] not [[G3367]] I should call [[G3004]] any [[G3367]] man [[G444]] common [[G2839]] or [[G2228]] unclean. [[G169]]

### 29
Therefore [[G1352]] came I [[G2064]] without gainsaying, [[G369]] as soon as I was sent for: [[G3343]] I ask [[G4441]] therefore [[G3767]] for what [[G5101]] intent [[G3056]] ye have sent for [[G3343]] me? [[G3165]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] Cornelius [[G2883]] said, [[G5346]] Four [[G5067]] days [[G2250]] ago [[G575]] I was [[G2252]] fasting [[G3522]] until [[G3360]] this [[G3778]] hour; [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] at [[G1766]] ninth [[G1766]] hour [[G5610]] I prayed [[G4336]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] house, [[G3624]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a man [[G435]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] me [[G3450]] in [[G1722]] bright [[G2986]] clothing, [[G2066]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] said, [[G5346]] Cornelius, [[G2883]] thy [[G4675]] prayer [[G4335]] is heard, [[G1522]] and [[G2532]] thine [[G4675]] alms are had in [[G1654]] remembrance [[G3415]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]]

### 32
Send [[G3992]] therefore [[G3767]] to [[G1519]] Joppa, [[G2445]] and [[G2532]] call hither [[G3333]] Simon, [[G4613]] whose [[G3739]] surname is [[G1941]] Peter; [[G4074]] he [[G3778]] is lodged [[G3579]] in [[G1722]] the house [[G3614]] of Simon [[G4613]] a tanner [[G1038]] by [[G3844]] the sea side: [[G2281]] who, [[G3739]] when he cometh, [[G3854]] shall speak [[G2980]] unto thee. [[G4671]]

### 33
Immediately [[G1824]] therefore [[G3767]] I sent [[G3992]] to [[G4314]] thee; [[G4571]] and [[G5037]] thou [[G4771]] well [[G2573]] hast [[G4160]] done [[G4160]] that thou art come. [[G3854]] Now [[G3568]] therefore [[G3767]] are we [[G2249]] all [[G3956]] here present [[G3918]] before [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] to hear [[G191]] all things [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] are commanded [[G4367]] thee [[G4671]] of [[G5259]] God. [[G2316]]

### 34
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] opened [[G455]] mouth, [[G4750]] and said, [[G2036]] Of [[G1909]] a truth [[G225]] I perceive [[G2638]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] respecter of persons: [[G4381]]

### 35
But [[G235]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] nation [[G1484]] he [[G3588]] that feareth [[G5399]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] worketh [[G2038]] righteousness, [[G1343]] is [[G2076]] accepted [[G1184]] with him. [[G846]]

### 36
The [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] which [[G3739]] sent [[G649]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G5207]] children [[G5207]] of Israel, [[G2474]] preaching [[G2097]] peace [[G1515]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]] (he [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] Lord [[G2962]] of all:) [[G3956]]

### 37
That word, [[G4487]] ye [[G5210]] know, [[G1492]] which was published [[G1096]] throughout [[G2596]] all [[G3650]] Judaea, [[G2449]] and began [[G756]] from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] which [[G3739]] John [[G2491]] preached; [[G2784]]

### 38
How [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] anointed [[G5548]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G575]] Nazareth [[G3478]] with the Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] with power: [[G1411]] who [[G3739]] went about [[G1330]] doing good, [[G2109]] and [[G2532]] healing [[G2390]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] were oppressed [[G2616]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] devil; [[G1228]] for [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] was [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] witnesses [[G3144]] of all things [[G3956]] which [[G3739]] he did [[G4160]] both [[G5037]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] land of [[G5561]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem; [[G2419]] whom [[G3739]] they slew [[G337]] and hanged [[G2910]] on [[G1909]] a tree: [[G3586]]

### 40
Him [[G5126]] God [[G2316]] raised up [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] shewed [[G1325]] him [[G846]] openly; [[G1717]]

### 41
Not [[G3756]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] but [[G235]] unto witnesses [[G3144]] chosen before [[G4401]] of [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]] to us, [[G2254]] who [[G3748]] did eat [[G4906]] and [[G2532]] drink with [[G4844]] him [[G846]] after [[G3326]] he [[G846]] rose [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] he commanded [[G3853]] us [[G2254]] to preach [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2992]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] to testify [[G1263]] that [[G3754]] it [[G846]] is [[G2076]] he which [[G3588]] was ordained [[G3724]] of [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] the Judge [[G2923]] of quick [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] dead. [[G3498]]

### 43
To him [[G5129]] all [[G3956]] give [[G3140]]  the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] witness, [[G3140]] that through [[G1223]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] whosoever [[G3956]] believeth [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] him [[G846]] shall receive [[G2983]] remission [[G859]] of sins. [[G266]]

### 44
While [[G3588]] Peter [[G4074]] yet [[G2089]] spake [[G2980]] these [[G5023]] words, [[G4487]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] them [[G3588]] which heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word. [[G3056]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] the circumcision [[G4061]] which believed [[G4103]] were astonished, [[G1839]] as many as [[G3745]] came [[G4905]] with [[G3588]] Peter, [[G4074]] because that [[G3754]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] also [[G2532]] was poured out [[G1632]] the [[G3588]] gift of [[G1431]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost. [[G4151]]

### 46
For [[G1063]] they heard [[G191]] them [[G846]] speak [[G2980]] with tongues, [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] magnify [[G3170]] God. [[G2316]] Then [[G5119]] answered [[G611]] Peter, [[G4074]]

### 47
Can [[G1410]] any man [[G5100]] forbid [[G2967]] water, [[G5204]] that [[G3588]] these [[G5128]] not [[G3361]] should be [[G907]] baptized, [[G907]] which [[G3748]] have received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] as well as [[G2531]] we? [[G2249]]

### 48
And [[G5037]] he commanded [[G4367]] them [[G846]] to be baptized [[G907]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]] Then [[G5119]] prayed they [[G2065]] him [[G846]] to tarry [[G1961]] certain [[G5100]] days. [[G2250]]
