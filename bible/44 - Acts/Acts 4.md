### 1
And [[G1161]] as [[G2980]] they [[G846]] spake [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] the [[G3588]] priests, [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] captain [[G4755]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2411]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Sadducees, [[G4523]] came upon [[G2186]] them, [[G846]]

### 2
Being grieved [[G1278]] that [[G1223]] they [[G846]] taught [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] preached [[G2605]] through [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] they laid [[G1911]] hands [[G5495]] on them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] put [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] hold [[G5084]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] next day: [[G839]] for [[G1063]] it was [[G2258]] now [[G2235]] eventide. [[G2073]]

### 4
Howbeit [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] of them which heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] believed; [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] the [[G3588]] of [[G435]] men [[G435]] was [[G1096]] about [[G5616]] five [[G4002]] thousand. [[G5505]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] it came to pass [[G1096]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] morrow, [[G839]] that their [[G846]] rulers, [[G758]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] Annas [[G452]] the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] were gathered together [[G4863]] Caiaphas, [[G2533]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] Alexander, [[G223]] and [[G2532]] as many as [[G3745]] were [[G2258]] at [[G1519]] of [[G1537]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] the kindred [[G1085]] of the high priest, [[G748]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] when they had set [[G2476]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] midst, [[G3319]] they asked, [[G4441]] By [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] power, [[G1411]] or [[G2228]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] name, [[G3686]] have [[G4160]] ye [[G5210]] done [[G4160]] this? [[G5124]]

### 8
Then [[G5119]] Peter, [[G4074]] filled [[G4130]] with the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Ye rulers [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] of Israel, [[G2474]]

### 9
If [[G1487]] we [[G2249]] this day [[G4594]] be examined [[G350]] of [[G1909]] the good deed done [[G2108]] to [[G444]] the impotent [[G772]] man, [[G444]] by [[G1722]] what means [[G5101]] he [[G3778]] is made whole; [[G4982]]

### 10
Be it [[G2077]] known [[G1110]] unto you [[G5213]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] of Israel, [[G2474]] that [[G3754]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]]  of Nazareth, [[G3588]] whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] crucified, [[G4717]] whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] by [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] him doth here [[G3936]] man [[G3778]] stand [[G3936]] before [[G1799]] you [[G5216]] whole. [[G5199]]

### 11
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] which [[G3588]] was set at nought [[G1848]] of [[G5259]] you [[G5216]] builders, [[G3618]] which [[G3588]] is become [[G1096]] the [[G1519]] head [[G2776]] of the corner. [[G1137]]

### 12
Neither [[G3777]]  there [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] salvation [[G4991]] in [[G1722]] any [[G3762]] other: [[G243]] for [[G1063]] there is [[G2076]] none other [[G2087]] name [[G3686]] under [[G5259]] heaven [[G3772]] given [[G1325]] among [[G1722]] men, [[G444]] whereby [[G3739]] we [[G2248]] must [[G1163]] be saved. [[G4982]]

### 13
Now [[G1161]] when they saw [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] boldness [[G3954]] of [[G4074]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] perceived [[G2638]] that [[G3754]] they were [[G1526]] unlearned [[G62]] and [[G2532]] ignorant [[G2399]] men, [[G444]] they marvelled; [[G2296]] and [[G5037]] they took knowledge [[G1921]] of them, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] they had been [[G2258]] with [[G4862]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] beholding [[G991]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] which [[G3588]] was healed [[G2323]] standing [[G2476]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] they could [[G2192]] say against it. [[G471]] nothing [[G3762]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] when they had commanded [[G2753]] them [[G846]] to go aside [[G565]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]] they conferred [[G4820]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]]

### 16
Saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] shall we do [[G4160]] to [[G444]] these [[G5125]] men? [[G444]] for [[G1063]] that [[G3754]] indeed [[G3303]] a notable [[G1110]] miracle [[G4592]] hath been done [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] them [[G846]] manifest [[G5318]] to all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] them [[G2730]] dwell [[G2730]] in Jerusalem; [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] we cannot [[G1410]] deny [[G720]]

### 17
But [[G235]] that [[G2443]] it spread [[G1268]] no [[G3361]] further [[G1909]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] straitly [[G547]] let us [[G546]] threaten [[G546]] them, [[G846]] that they speak [[G2980]] henceforth [[G3371]] to no [[G3367]] man [[G444]] in [[G1909]] this [[G5129]] name. [[G3686]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] they called [[G2564]] them, [[G846]] and commanded [[G3853]] them [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to speak [[G5350]] at all [[G2527]] nor [[G3366]] teach [[G1321]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G2424]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Whether [[G1487]] it be [[G2076]] right [[G1342]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] to hearken [[G191]] unto you [[G5216]] more [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] unto [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] judge ye. [[G2919]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] we [[G2249]] cannot [[G1410]] but [[G3361]] speak [[G2980]] the things which [[G3739]] we have seen [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] heard. [[G191]]

### 21
So [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] when had further [[G4324]] threatened [[G4324]] them, [[G846]] they let them go, [[G630]] finding [[G2147]] nothing [[G3367]] how [[G4459]] they might punish [[G2849]] them, [[G846]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people: [[G2992]] for [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] glorified [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1909]] that [[G3588]] which was done. [[G1096]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] was [[G2258]] above [[G4119]] forty [[G5062]] years old, [[G2094]] on [[G1909]] whom [[G3739]] this [[G5124]] miracle [[G4592]] of was [[G2392]] healing [[G2392]] shewed. [[G1096]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] being let go, [[G630]] they went [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] their own company, [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] reported [[G518]] all that [[G3745]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] had said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them. [[G846]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] when that, [[G191]] heard [[G191]] they lifted up [[G142]] their voice [[G5456]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] with one accord, [[G3661]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G1203]] thou [[G4771]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] hast made [[G4160]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] in is: [[G1722]] them [[G846]]

### 25
Who [[G3588]] by [[G1223]] the mouth [[G4750]] of thy [[G4675]] servant [[G3816]] David [[G1138]] hast said, [[G2036]] Why [[G2444]] did [[G5433]] the heathen [[G1484]] rage, [[G5433]] and [[G2532]] the people [[G2992]] imagine [[G3191]] vain things? [[G2756]]

### 26
The [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] stood up, [[G3936]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] were gathered [[G4863]] together [[G1909]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] against [[G2596]] his [[G846]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] of [[G1909]] a truth [[G225]] against [[G1909]] thy [[G4675]] holy [[G40]] child [[G3816]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] thou hast anointed, [[G5548]] both [[G5037]] Herod, [[G2264]] and [[G2532]] Pontius [[G4194]] Pilate, [[G4091]] with [[G4862]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] the people [[G2992]] of Israel, [[G2474]] were gathered together, [[G4863]]

### 28
For to do [[G4160]] whatsoever [[G3745]] thy [[G4675]] hand [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] counsel determined [[G1012]] before [[G4309]] to be done. [[G1096]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] Lord, [[G2962]] behold [[G1896]] their [[G846]] threatenings: [[G547]] and [[G2532]] grant [[G1325]] unto [[G1401]] thy [[G4675]] servants, [[G1401]] that with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] boldness [[G3954]] they may speak [[G2980]] thy [[G4675]] word, [[G3056]]

### 30
By [[G1722]] stretching forth [[G1614]] thine [[G4675]] hand [[G5495]] to that [[G1519]] heal; [[G2392]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] may be done [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G3816]] thy [[G4675]] holy [[G40]] child [[G3816]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] when had [[G1189]] they [[G846]] prayed, [[G1189]] the [[G3588]] place was [[G5117]] shaken [[G4531]] where [[G1722]]  they [[G3739]] were [[G2258]] assembled together; [[G4863]] and [[G2532]] they were [[G4130]] all [[G537]] filled [[G4130]] with the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they spake [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] with [[G3326]] boldness. [[G3954]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G4128]] that [[G3588]] of them [[G4100]] believed [[G4100]] were [[G2258]] of [[G5590]] one [[G1520]] heart [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] of one [[G2532]] soul: [[G5590]] neither [[G3761]] said [[G3004]] any [[G1520]] that [[G3588]] ought of the things which he [[G5100]] possessed [[G5224]] was [[G1511]] his [[G846]] own; [[G2398]] but [[G235]] they [[G846]] had [[G2258]] all things [[G537]] common. [[G2839]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] with [[G1411]] power [[G1411]] gave [[G591]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] witness [[G3142]] the [[G3588]] of [[G386]] resurrection [[G386]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus: [[G2424]] and [[G5037]] great [[G3173]] grace [[G5485]] was [[G2258]] upon [[G1909]] them [[G846]] all. [[G3956]]

### 34
Neither [[G3761]] was there that [[G5225]] any [[G5100]] among [[G1722]] them [[G846]] lacked: [[G1729]] for [[G1063]] as many as [[G3745]] were [[G5225]] possessors [[G2935]] of lands [[G5564]] or [[G2228]] houses [[G3614]] sold them, [[G4453]] and brought [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] prices of things that were [[G5092]] the [[G3588]] sold, [[G4097]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] laid down [[G5087]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] apostles' [[G652]] feet: [[G4228]] and [[G1161]] distribution was made [[G1239]] unto every man [[G1538]] according as [[G2530]] he [[G5100]] had [[G2192]] need. [[G5532]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] Joses, [[G2500]] who [[G3588]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] was surnamed [[G1941]] Barnabas, [[G921]] (which [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] being interpreted, [[G3177]] The son [[G5207]] of consolation,) [[G3874]] a Levite, [[G3019]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1085]] country [[G1085]] of Cyprus, [[G2953]]

### 37
Having [[G5225]] land, [[G68]] sold [[G4453]] brought [[G5342]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] money, [[G5536]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] apostles' [[G652]] feet. [[G4228]]
