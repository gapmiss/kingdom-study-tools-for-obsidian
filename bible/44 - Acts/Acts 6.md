### 1
And [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days, [[G2250]] when the number was [[G4129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples [[G3101]] multiplied, [[G4129]] there arose [[G1096]] a murmuring [[G1112]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1675]] Grecians [[G1675]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Hebrews, [[G1445]] because [[G3754]] their [[G846]] widows [[G5503]] were neglected [[G3865]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] daily [[G2522]] ministration. [[G1248]]

### 2
Then and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples [[G3101]] said, [[G2036]] It is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] reason [[G701]] we [[G2248]] that should [[G2641]] leave [[G2641]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and serve [[G1247]] tables. [[G5132]]

### 3
Wherefore, [[G3767]] brethren, [[G80]] look ye out [[G1980]] among [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] seven [[G2033]] men [[G435]] of honest report, [[G3140]] full [[G4134]] of the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] wisdom, [[G4678]] whom [[G3739]] we may appoint [[G2525]] over [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] business. [[G5532]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] will give ourselves continually [[G4342]] to [[G4335]] prayer, [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1248]] ministry [[G1248]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3056]] word. [[G3056]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] pleased [[G700]] the [[G1799]] whole [[G3956]] multitude: [[G4128]] and [[G2532]] they chose [[G1586]] Stephen, [[G4736]] a man [[G435]] full [[G4134]] of faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] Philip, [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] Prochorus, [[G4402]] and [[G2532]] Nicanor, [[G3527]] and [[G2532]] Timon, [[G5096]] and [[G2532]] Parmenas, [[G3937]] and [[G2532]] Nicolas [[G3532]] a proselyte [[G4339]] of Antioch: [[G491]]

### 6
Whom [[G3739]] they set [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] apostles: [[G652]] and [[G2532]] when they had prayed, [[G4336]] they laid [[G2007]] hands on [[G5495]] them. [[G846]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] increased; [[G837]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples [[G3101]] multiplied [[G4129]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] greatly; [[G4970]] and [[G5037]] great [[G4183]] a [[G3793]] company [[G3793]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2409]] priests [[G2409]] were obedient [[G5219]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4102]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] Stephen, [[G4736]] full [[G4134]] of faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] power, [[G1411]] did [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] wonders [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] miracles [[G4592]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 9
Then [[G1161]] there arose [[G450]] certain [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] which [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] of the Libertines, [[G3032]] and [[G2532]] Cyrenians, [[G2956]] and [[G2532]] Alexandrians, [[G221]] and [[G2532]] of [[G575]] them [[G3588]] of Cilicia [[G2791]] and [[G2532]] of Asia, [[G773]] disputing [[G4802]] with [[G3588]] Stephen. [[G4736]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] they were [[G2480]] able [[G2480]] to resist [[G436]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] by which [[G3739]] he spake. [[G2980]]

### 11
Then [[G5119]] they suborned [[G5260]] men, [[G435]] which said, [[G3004]] We have heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] speak [[G2980]] blasphemous [[G989]] words [[G4487]] against [[G1519]] Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
And [[G5037]] they stirred up [[G4787]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] came upon [[G2186]] and caught [[G4884]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G71]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]]

### 13
And [[G5037]] set up [[G2476]] false [[G5571]] witnesses, [[G3144]] which said, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] ceaseth [[G3973]] not [[G3756]] to speak [[G2980]] blasphemous [[G989]] words [[G4487]] against [[G2596]] this [[G5127]] holy [[G40]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] law: [[G3551]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] we have heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] say, [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] Jesus [[G2424]] of shall [[G3480]] Nazareth [[G3480]] destroy [[G2647]] this [[G5126]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] shall change [[G236]] the [[G3588]] customs [[G1485]] which [[G3739]] Moses [[G3475]] delivered [[G3860]] us. [[G2254]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] all [[G537]] that sat [[G2516]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]] looking stedfastly [[G816]] on [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] saw [[G1492]] his [[G846]] face as it had [[G4383]] been [[G5616]] the face [[G4383]] of an angel. [[G32]]
