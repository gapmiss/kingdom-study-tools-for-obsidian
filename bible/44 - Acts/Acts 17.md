### 1
Now [[G1161]] when they had passed through [[G1353]] Amphipolis [[G295]] and [[G2532]] Apollonia, [[G624]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Thessalonica, [[G2332]] where [[G3699]] was [[G2258]] a [[G3588]]  synagogue of [[G4864]] the [[G3588]] Jews: [[G2453]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] Paul, [[G3972]] as [[G2596]] his manner was, [[G1486]] went in [[G1525]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] sabbath days [[G4521]] reasoned [[G1256]] with them [[G846]] out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] scriptures, [[G1124]]

### 3
Opening [[G1272]] and [[G2532]] alleging, [[G3908]] that [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] must needs [[G1163]] have suffered, [[G3958]] and [[G2532]] risen again [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the dead; [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] preach [[G2605]] unto you, [[G5213]] is [[G2076]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] believed, [[G3982]] and [[G2532]] consorted [[G4345]] with [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas; [[G4609]] and [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4576]] devout [[G4576]] Greeks [[G1672]] a great [[G4183]] multitude, [[G4128]] and [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4413]] chief [[G4413]] women [[G1135]] not [[G3756]] a few. [[G3641]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] which believed not, [[G544]] moved with envy, [[G2206]] took unto them [[G4355]] certain [[G5100]] lewd [[G4190]] fellows [[G435]] the [[G3588]] of baser [[G60]] sort, [[G60]] and [[G2532]] gathered a company, [[G3792]] and set all on an [[G2350]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] uproar, [[G2350]] and [[G5037]] assaulted [[G2186]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] of Jason, [[G2394]] and sought [[G2212]] to bring out [[G71]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G1218]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] when they found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] not, [[G3361]] they drew [[G4951]] Jason [[G2394]] and [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] brethren [[G80]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] rulers of the city, [[G4173]] crying, [[G994]] These [[G3778]] that [[G3754]] have turned upside down [[G387]] the [[G3588]] world [[G3625]]  are [[G3588]] come [[G3918]] hither [[G1759]] also; [[G2532]]

### 7
Whom [[G3739]] Jason [[G2394]] hath received: [[G5264]] and [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] all [[G3956]] do [[G4238]] contrary [[G561]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1378]] decrees [[G1378]] of Caesar, [[G2541]] saying [[G3004]] that there is [[G1511]] another [[G2087]] king, [[G935]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] they troubled [[G5015]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rulers of the city, [[G4173]] when they heard [[G191]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when they had taken [[G2983]] security [[G2425]] of [[G3844]] Jason, [[G2394]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3062]] other, [[G3062]] they let [[G630]] them [[G846]] go. [[G630]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] immediately [[G2112]] sent away [[G1599]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Silas [[G4609]] by [[G1223]] night [[G3571]] unto [[G1519]] Berea: [[G960]] who [[G3748]] coming [[G3854]] went [[G549]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue of [[G4864]] the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 11
These [[G3778]] were [[G2258]] more noble [[G2104]] than those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Thessalonica, [[G2332]] in that [[G3748]] they received [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] readiness of mind, [[G4288]] and searched [[G350]] the [[G3588]] scriptures [[G1124]] daily, [[G2250]] whether [[G1487]] those things [[G5023]] were [[G2192]] so. [[G3779]]

### 12
Therefore [[G3767]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] believed; [[G4100]] also [[G2532]] of honourable [[G2158]] women [[G1135]] which [[G3588]] were Greeks, [[G1674]] and [[G2532]] of men, [[G435]] not [[G3756]] a few. [[G3641]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] of [[G575]] Thessalonica had [[G2332]] knowledge [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] was preached [[G2605]] of [[G5259]] Paul [[G3972]] at [[G1722]] Berea, [[G960]] they came [[G2064]] thither also, [[G2546]] and [[G2532]] stirred up [[G4531]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G3793]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] then [[G5119]] immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] sent away [[G1821]] the [[G3588]] Paul to [[G3972]] go [[G4198]] as it were [[G5613]] to [[G1909]] sea: [[G2281]] but [[G1161]] Silas [[G4609]] and [[G2532]] Timotheus [[G5095]] abode still. [[G5278]] there [[G1563]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] that conducted [[G2525]] Paul [[G3972]] brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] unto [[G2193]] Athens: [[G116]] and [[G2532]] receiving [[G2983]] a commandment [[G1785]] unto [[G4314]] Silas [[G4609]] and [[G2532]] Timotheus [[G5095]] for [[G2443]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]]  with all speed, [[G5613]] they departed. [[G1826]]

### 16
Now [[G1161]]  while [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] waited [[G1551]] for them [[G846]] at [[G1722]] Athens, [[G116]] his [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] was stirred [[G3947]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] when he saw [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] wholly given [[G5607]] to idolatry. [[G2712]]

### 17
Therefore [[G3767]] disputed he [[G1256]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue with [[G4864]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] with devout [[G4576]] persons, [[G4576]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] market [[G58]] daily [[G2250]] with [[G4314]] them that [[G3588]] met with him. [[G3909]]

### 18
Then [[G1161]] certain [[G5100]] philosophers [[G5386]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1946]] Epicureans, [[G1946]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4770]] Stoicks, [[G4770]] encountered [[G4820]] him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] said, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] will [[G2309]] this [[G3778]] babbler [[G4691]] say? [[G3004]] other some, [[G3588]] He seemeth [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] a setter forth [[G2604]] of strange [[G3581]] gods: [[G1140]] because [[G3754]] he preached [[G2097]] unto them [[G846]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] resurrection. [[G386]]

### 19
And [[G5037]] they took [[G1949]] him, [[G846]] and brought him [[G71]] unto [[G1909]] Areopagus, [[G697]] saying, [[G3004]] May [[G1410]] we know [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] this [[G3778]] new [[G2537]] doctrine, [[G1322]] whereof [[G5259]] thou [[G4675]] speakest, [[G2980]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] thou bringest [[G1533]] certain [[G5100]] strange things [[G3579]] to [[G1519]] our [[G2257]] ears: [[G189]] we would [[G1014]] know [[G1097]] therefore [[G3767]] what [[G5101]] these things [[G5023]] mean. [[G2309]]

### 21
(For [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] the Athenians [[G117]] and [[G2532]] strangers [[G3581]] which [[G3588]] were there [[G1927]] spent their time [[G2119]] in [[G1519]] nothing [[G3762]] else, [[G2087]] but either [[G2228]] to tell, [[G3004]] or [[G2532]] to hear [[G191]] some [[G5100]] new thing.) [[G2537]]

### 22
Then [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] stood [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]]  of [[G3588]] Mars' [[G697]] hill, [[G697]] and said, [[G5346]] men [[G435]] of Athens, [[G117]] I perceive [[G2334]] that in [[G2596]] all things [[G3956]] ye [[G5209]] are [[G5613]] too superstitious. [[G1174]]

### 23
For [[G1063]] as I passed by, [[G1330]] and [[G2532]] beheld [[G333]] your [[G5216]] devotions, [[G4574]] I found [[G2147]] an [[G2532]] altar [[G1041]] with [[G1722]] this [[G3739]] inscription, [[G1924]] TO THE UNKNOWN [[G57]] GOD. [[G2316]] Whom [[G3739]] therefore [[G3767]] ye ignorantly [[G50]] worship, [[G2151]] him [[G5126]] declare [[G2605]] I [[G1473]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 24
God [[G3588]]  that [[G2316]] made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] all things [[G3956]] therein, [[G1722]]  seeing that [[G846]] he [[G3778]] is [[G5225]] Lord [[G2962]] of heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth, [[G1093]] dwelleth [[G2730]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] temples [[G3485]] made with hands; [[G5499]]

### 25
Neither [[G3761]] is worshipped [[G2323]] with [[G5259]] men's [[G444]] hands, [[G5495]] as though he needed [[G4326]] any thing, [[G5100]] seeing he [[G846]] giveth [[G1325]] to all [[G3956]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] breath, [[G4157]]  and [[G2596]] all things; [[G3956]]

### 26
And [[G5037]] hath made [[G4160]] of [[G1537]] one [[G1520]] blood [[G129]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] of men [[G444]] for to dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] face [[G4383]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] and hath determined [[G3724]] the times [[G2540]] before appointed, [[G4384]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] bounds [[G3734]] of their [[G846]] habitation; [[G2733]]

### 27
That they should seek [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] haply [[G686]]  they might feel [[G1065]] after [[G5584]] him, him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] though [[G2544]] he be [[G5225]] not [[G3756]] far [[G3112]] from [[G575]] every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of us: [[G2257]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] we live, [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] move, [[G2795]] and [[G2532]] have our being; [[G2070]] as [[G5613]] certain [[G5100]] also [[G2532]] of [[G2596]] your own [[G5209]] poets [[G4163]] have said, [[G2046]] For [[G1063]] we are [[G2070]] also [[G2532]] his [[G5120]] offspring. [[G1085]]

### 29
Forasmuch then [[G3767]] as we are [[G5225]] the offspring [[G1085]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] we ought [[G3784]] not [[G3756]] to think that [[G3543]] the [[G3588]] Godhead [[G2304]] is [[G1511]] like unto [[G3664]] gold, [[G5557]] or [[G2228]] silver, [[G696]] or [[G2228]] stone, [[G3037]] graven [[G5480]] by art [[G5078]] and [[G2532]] man's [[G444]] device. [[G1761]]

### 30
And [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] times [[G5550]] this [[G3588]] of [[G52]] ignorance [[G52]] God [[G2316]] winked at; [[G5237]] but [[G3568]] now [[G3568]] commandeth [[G3853]] all [[G3956]] men every [[G444]] where [[G3837]] to repent: [[G3340]]

### 31
Because [[G1360]] he hath appointed [[G2476]] a day, [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] he will [[G3195]] judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world [[G3625]] in [[G1722]] righteousness [[G1343]] by [[G1722]] man [[G435]] whom [[G3739]] he hath ordained; [[G3724]] he hath given [[G3930]] assurance [[G4102]] unto all [[G3956]] in that he hath raised [[G450]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] when they heard [[G191]] of the resurrection [[G386]] of the dead, [[G3498]] some [[G3588]] mocked: [[G5512]] and [[G1161]] others [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] We will hear [[G191]] thee [[G4675]] again [[G3825]] of [[G4012]] this [[G5127]]

### 33
So [[G3779]] Paul [[G3972]] departed [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] among [[G3319]] them. [[G846]]

### 34
Howbeit [[G1161]] certain [[G5100]] men [[G435]] clave [[G2853]] unto him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] believed: [[G4100]] among [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] Dionysius [[G1354]] the [[G3588]] Areopagite, [[G698]] and [[G2532]] a woman [[G1135]] named [[G3686]] Damaris, [[G1152]] and [[G2532]] others [[G2087]] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]]
