### 1
But [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Ananias, [[G367]] with [[G4862]] Sapphira [[G4551]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] sold [[G4453]] a possession, [[G2933]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] kept back [[G3557]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] price, [[G5092]] his [[G846]] wife also [[G1135]] being privy [[G4894]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G5342]] a certain [[G5100]] part, [[G3313]] and laid [[G5087]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] apostles' [[G652]] feet. [[G4228]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G2036]] Ananias, [[G367]] why [[G1302]] hath [[G4137]] Satan [[G4567]] filled [[G4137]] thine [[G4675]] heart [[G2588]] to lie [[G5574]] the [[G3588]] to [[G40]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] to keep back [[G3557]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] price [[G5092]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5564]] land? [[G5564]]

### 4
Whiles it remained, [[G3306]] was it [[G3306]] not [[G3780]] thine own? [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] after it was sold, [[G4097]] was it not [[G5225]] in [[G1722]] thine own [[G4674]] power? [[G1849]] why [[G5101]] hast thou conceived [[G5087]] this [[G5124]] thing [[G4229]] in [[G1722]] thine [[G4675]] heart? [[G2588]] not [[G3756]] thou hast [[G5574]] lied [[G5574]] unto men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] unto [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] Ananias [[G367]] hearing [[G191]] these [[G5128]] words fell [[G3056]] down, [[G4098]] and gave up the ghost: [[G1634]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] fear [[G5401]] came [[G1096]] on [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] them [[G191]] heard [[G191]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] young men [[G3501]] arose, [[G450]] wound up, [[G4958]] him [[G846]] and and [[G2532]] carried out, [[G1627]] buried [[G2290]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] it was [[G1096]] about [[G5613]] the space [[G1292]] of three [[G5140]] hours after, [[G5610]] when [[G2532]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] not [[G3361]] knowing [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] was done, [[G1096]] came in. [[G1525]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] answered [[G611]] unto her, [[G846]] Tell [[G2036]] me [[G3427]] whether [[G1487]] ye sold [[G591]] the [[G3588]] land [[G5564]] for so much? [[G5118]] And [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Yea, [[G3483]] for so much. [[G5118]]

### 9
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] her, [[G846]] How is it [[G5101]] that [[G3754]] ye [[G5213]] have agreed together [[G4856]] to tempt [[G3985]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of the Lord? [[G2962]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] them [[G3588]] of which have [[G2290]] buried [[G2290]] thy [[G4675]] husband [[G435]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] door, [[G2374]] and [[G2532]] shall carry out. [[G1627]] thee [[G4571]]

### 10
Then [[G1161]] fell she down [[G4098]] straightway [[G3916]] at [[G3844]] his [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] yielded up the ghost: [[G1634]] and [[G1161]] the young [[G3588]] men [[G3495]] came in, [[G1525]] and found [[G2147]] her [[G846]] dead, [[G3498]] and, [[G2532]] carrying forth, [[G1627]] buried [[G2290]] by [[G4314]] her [[G846]] husband. [[G435]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] fear [[G5401]] came [[G1096]] upon [[G1909]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] as many as [[G3956]] heard [[G191]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] the [[G3588]] of [[G652]] apostles [[G652]] were [[G1096]] many [[G4183]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] wrought among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people; [[G2992]] (and [[G2532]] they were [[G2258]] all [[G537]] with one accord [[G3661]] in [[G1722]] Solomon's [[G4672]] porch. [[G4745]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3062]] rest [[G3062]] durst [[G5111]] no man [[G3762]] join himself [[G2853]] to them: [[G846]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] magnified [[G3170]] them. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] believers [[G4100]] the more [[G3123]] were [[G4369]] added [[G4369]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] multitudes [[G4128]] both [[G5037]] of men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] women.) [[G1135]]

### 15
Insomuch that [[G5620]] they brought forth [[G1627]] the [[G3588]] sick [[G772]] into [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] streets, [[G4113]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] on [[G1909]] beds [[G2825]] and [[G2532]] couches, [[G2895]] that [[G2443]] at the least [[G2579]] the [[G3588]] shadow [[G4639]] of Peter [[G4074]] passing by [[G2064]] might overshadow [[G1982]] some [[G5100]] of them. [[G846]]

### 16
There came [[G4905]] also [[G2532]] a and [[G4128]] multitude [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] cities [[G4172]] round about [[G4038]] unto [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] bringing [[G5342]] sick folks, [[G772]] and [[G2532]] them were [[G3791]] which [[G3748]] vexed [[G3791]] with [[G5259]] unclean [[G169]] spirits: [[G4151]] they were healed [[G2323]] every one. [[G537]]

### 17
Then [[G1161]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] rose up, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] they [[G3588]] (which [[G3588]] that were with [[G4862]] him, [[G846]] is [[G5607]] the sect [[G139]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4523]] Sadducees,) [[G4523]] and were filled [[G4130]] with indignation, [[G2205]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] laid [[G1911]] their [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] apostles, [[G652]] and [[G2532]] put [[G5087]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the common [[G1219]] prison. [[G5084]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] the angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] by [[G1223]] night [[G3571]] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] prison [[G5438]] doors, [[G2374]] and [[G5037]] brought forth, [[G1806]] them [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]]

### 20
Go, [[G4198]] stand [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] speak [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] of [[G2222]] this [[G3778]] life. [[G2222]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] when they heard [[G191]] they entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] in [[G5259]] early [[G3722]] the [[G3588]] morning, [[G3722]] and [[G2532]] taught. [[G1321]] But [[G1161]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] came, [[G3854]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that were with [[G4862]] him, [[G846]] and called [[G4779]] the [[G3588]] council [[G4892]] together, [[G4779]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] senate [[G1087]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] children [[G5207]] of Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] prison [[G1201]] to have [[G71]] them [[G846]] brought. [[G71]]

### 22
But and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G3854]] officers [[G5257]] came, [[G3854]] found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prison, [[G5438]] they returned, [[G390]] and [[G1161]] told, [[G518]]

### 23
Saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] prison [[G1201]] truly [[G3303]] found we [[G2147]] shut [[G2808]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] safety, [[G803]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] keepers [[G5441]] standing [[G2476]] without [[G1854]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] doors: [[G2374]] but [[G1161]] when we had opened, [[G455]] we found [[G2147]] no man [[G3762]] within. [[G2080]]

### 24
Now [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] the [[G5037]] high priest [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] captain [[G4755]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2411]] temple [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] the chief [[G3588]] priests [[G749]] heard [[G191]] these [[G5128]] things, [[G3056]] they doubted [[G1280]] of [[G4012]] them [[G846]] whereunto [[G5101]] this [[G5124]] would grow. [[G1096]]

### 25
came [[G3854]] Then [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] and [[G1161]] told [[G518]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] whom [[G3739]] ye put [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G5438]] are [[G1526]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] teaching [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 26
Then and [[G5119]] went [[G565]] the [[G3588]] captain [[G4755]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] officers, [[G5257]] brought [[G71]] them [[G846]] without [[G3326]] violence: [[G970]] for [[G1063]] they feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] lest [[G3361]] they should have been stoned. [[G3034]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] when they had brought [[G71]] them, [[G846]] they set [[G2476]] before [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] council: [[G4892]] and [[G2532]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] asked [[G1905]] them, [[G846]]

### 28
Saying, [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] Did we [[G3853]] straitly [[G3852]] command [[G3853]] you [[G5213]] not [[G3361]] that ye should [[G1321]] teach [[G1321]] in [[G1909]] this [[G5129]] name? [[G3686]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] ye have filled [[G4137]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] with [[G1322]] your [[G5216]] doctrine, [[G1322]] and [[G2532]] intend [[G1014]] to bring [[G1863]] this [[G5127]] man's [[G444]] blood [[G129]] upon [[G1909]] us. [[G2248]]

### 29
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] and and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] answered [[G611]] said, [[G2036]] We to [[G3980]] ought [[G1163]] obey [[G3980]] God [[G2316]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] men. [[G444]]

### 30
The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G3962]] our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] raised up [[G1453]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] slew [[G1315]] and hanged [[G2910]] on [[G1909]] a tree. [[G3586]]

### 31
Him [[G5126]] hath [[G5312]] God [[G2316]] exalted [[G5312]] with right [[G1188]] his [[G846]] hand [[G1188]] a Prince [[G747]] and [[G2532]] a Saviour, [[G4990]] for to give [[G1325]] repentance [[G3341]] to Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins. [[G266]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] his [[G846]] witnesses [[G3144]] of [[G4487]] these [[G5130]] things; [[G4487]] and [[G2532]] also [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath given [[G1325]] that [[G3588]] to them [[G3980]] obey [[G3980]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
When [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] they were cut [[G1282]] and [[G2532]] took counsel [[G1011]] to slay [[G337]] them. [[G846]]

### 34
Then [[G1161]] stood there up [[G450]] one [[G5100]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] council, [[G4892]] a Pharisee, [[G5330]] named [[G3686]] Gamaliel, [[G1059]] a doctor of the law, [[G3547]] had in reputation [[G5093]] among all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and commanded [[G2753]] to put [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] forth [[G1854]] a little [[G1024]] space; [[G1024]]

### 35
And [[G5037]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Ye men [[G435]] of Israel, [[G2475]] take heed [[G4337]] to yourselves [[G1438]] what [[G5101]] ye intend [[G3195]] to do [[G4238]] as touching [[G1909]] these [[G5125]] men. [[G444]]

### 36
For [[G1063]] before [[G4253]] these [[G5130]] days [[G2250]] rose up [[G450]] Theudas, [[G2333]] boasting [[G3004]] himself [[G1438]] to be [[G1511]] somebody; [[G5100]] to whom [[G3739]] a number [[G706]] of men, [[G435]] about [[G5616]] four hundred, [[G5071]] joined themselves: [[G4347]] who [[G3739]] was slain; [[G337]] and [[G2532]] all, [[G3956]] as many as [[G3745]] obeyed [[G3982]] him, [[G846]] were scattered, [[G1262]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] nought. [[G3762]]

### 37
After [[G3326]] this [[G5126]] man rose [[G450]] up [[G450]] Judas [[G2455]]  of [[G3588]] Galilee [[G1057]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of the taxing, [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] drew away [[G868]] much [[G2425]] people [[G2992]] after [[G3694]] him: [[G846]] he also [[G2548]] perished; [[G622]] and [[G2532]] all, [[G3956]] as many as [[G3745]] obeyed [[G3982]] him, [[G846]] were dispersed. [[G1287]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Refrain [[G868]] from [[G575]] these [[G5130]] men, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] let alone: [[G1439]] them [[G846]] for [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] this [[G3778]] counsel [[G1012]] or [[G2228]] this [[G5124]] work [[G2041]] be [[G5600]] of [[G1537]] men, [[G444]] it will come to nought: [[G2647]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] it be [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] ye cannot [[G1410]] overthrow [[G2647]] it; [[G846]] lest haply [[G3379]] ye be found [[G2147]] even [[G2532]] to fight against God. [[G2314]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] to him [[G846]] they agreed: [[G3982]] and [[G2532]] when they had called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] apostles, [[G652]] and beaten [[G1194]] they commanded [[G3853]] not [[G3361]] that they should [[G2980]] speak [[G2980]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] let [[G630]] them [[G846]] go. [[G630]]

### 41
And [[G3767]] they [[G3588]] departed [[G4198]] from [[G575]] the presence [[G4383]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4892]] council, [[G4892]] rejoicing [[G5463]] that [[G3754]] they were counted worthy [[G2661]] to suffer shame [[G818]] for [[G5228]] his [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

### 42
And [[G5037]] daily [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] in [[G2596]] every [[G3956]] house, [[G3624]] they ceased [[G3973]] not [[G3756]] to teach [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] preach [[G2097]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]
