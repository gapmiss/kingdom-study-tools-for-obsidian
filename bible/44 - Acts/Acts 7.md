### 1
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] the high priest, [[G3588]] Are [[G1487]]  things [[G2192]] these [[G5023]] so? [[G3779]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G5346]] Men, [[G435]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] fathers, [[G3962]] hearken; [[G191]] The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] appeared [[G3700]] unto [[G2257]] our [[G2257]] father [[G3962]] Abraham, [[G11]] when he was [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] Mesopotamia, [[G3318]] before [[G4250]] he [[G846]] dwelt [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Charran, [[G5488]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Get thee out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] country, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] thy [[G4675]] kindred, [[G4772]] and [[G2532]] come [[G1204]] into [[G1519]] the land [[G1093]] which [[G3739]] I shall shew [[G1166]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 4
Then [[G5119]] came he out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the land [[G1093]] of the Chaldaeans, [[G5466]] and dwelt [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Charran: [[G5488]] and from thence, [[G2547]] when [[G3326]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] was [[G599]] dead, [[G599]] he removed [[G3351]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] land, [[G1093]] wherein [[G1519]] ye [[G5210]] now [[G3568]] dwell. [[G2730]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] he gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] none [[G3756]] inheritance [[G2817]] in [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] no, not [[G3761]] to set his foot on: [[G968]] yet [[G2532]] he promised [[G1861]] that he would give it [[G1325]] to him [[G846]] for [[G1519]] a possession, [[G2697]] and [[G2532]] to [[G4690]] his [[G846]] seed [[G4690]] after [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] when [[G5607]] he [[G846]] had [[G5607]] no [[G3756]] child. [[G5043]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] spake [[G2980]] on this wise, [[G3779]] That [[G3754]] his [[G846]] seed [[G4690]] should [[G2071]] sojourn [[G3941]] in [[G1722]] a strange [[G245]] land; [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] that they should bring into bondage, [[G1402]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] entreat evil [[G2559]] four hundred [[G5071]] years. [[G2094]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] nation [[G1484]] to whom [[G3739]] they shall be in bondage [[G1398]] will [[G2919]] I [[G1473]] judge, [[G2919]] said [[G2036]] God: [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] that [[G5023]] shall they come forth, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] serve [[G3000]] me [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] place. [[G5117]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] he gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] the covenant [[G1242]] of circumcision: [[G4061]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] begat [[G1080]] Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] circumcised [[G4059]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] eighth [[G3590]] day; [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] Isaac [[G2464]] Jacob; [[G2384]] and [[G2532]] Jacob [[G2384]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] patriarchs. [[G3966]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] patriarchs, [[G3966]] moved with envy, [[G2206]] sold [[G591]] Joseph [[G2501]] into [[G1519]] Egypt: [[G125]] but [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] was [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] delivered [[G1807]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] afflictions, [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] favour [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] in the sight of [[G1726]] Pharaoh [[G5328]] king [[G935]] of Egypt; [[G125]] and [[G2532]] he made [[G2525]] him [[G846]] governor [[G2233]] over [[G1909]] Egypt [[G125]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3624]]

### 11
Now [[G1161]] there came [[G2064]] a dearth [[G3042]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] of Egypt [[G125]] and [[G2532]] Chanaan, [[G5477]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] affliction: [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] found [[G2147]] no [[G3756]] sustenance. [[G5527]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] when [[G191]] Jacob [[G2384]] heard [[G191]] that there was [[G5607]] corn [[G4621]] in [[G1722]] Egypt, [[G125]] he sent out [[G1821]] our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] first. [[G4412]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] Joseph [[G2501]] was made known [[G319]] to [[G80]] his [[G846]] brethren; [[G80]] and [[G2532]] Joseph's [[G2501]] kindred was [[G1085]] made [[G1096]] known [[G5318]] unto Pharaoh. [[G5328]]

### 14
sent [[G649]] Then [[G1161]] Joseph, [[G2501]] and [[G1161]] called [[G3333]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Jacob [[G2384]] to [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] kindred, [[G4772]] threescore [[G1440]] and fifteen [[G4002]] souls. [[G5590]]

### 15
So [[G1161]] Jacob [[G2384]] went down [[G2597]] into [[G1519]] Egypt, [[G125]] and [[G2532]] died, [[G5053]] he, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] were carried over [[G3346]] into [[G1519]] Sychem, [[G4966]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre [[G3418]] that [[G3739]] Abraham [[G11]] bought [[G5608]] for a sum [[G5092]] of money [[G694]] of [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Emmor [[G1697]] of [[G4966]] Sychem. [[G4966]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] when [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1860]] promise [[G1860]] drew nigh, [[G1448]] which [[G3739]] God had [[G2316]] sworn [[G3660]] to Abraham, [[G11]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] grew [[G837]] and [[G2532]] multiplied [[G4129]] in [[G1722]] Egypt, [[G125]]

### 18
Till [[G891]] another [[G2087]] king [[G935]] arose, [[G450]] which [[G3739]] knew [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] Joseph. [[G2501]]

### 19
The same [[G3778]] dealt subtilly with [[G2686]] our [[G2257]] kindred, [[G1085]] and evil entreated [[G2559]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]]  so that they [[G4160]] cast out [[G1570]] their [[G846]]  young [[G3588]] children, [[G1025]] to the end [[G1519]] they might [[G2225]] not [[G3361]] live. [[G2225]]

### 20
In [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] time [[G2540]] Moses [[G3475]] was born, [[G1080]] and and [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] exceeding [[G791]] fair, [[G791]] nourished up [[G397]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] father's [[G3962]] house [[G3624]] three [[G5140]] months: [[G3376]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] when was out, [[G1620]] he [[G846]] cast [[G1620]] Pharaoh's [[G5328]] daughter [[G2364]] took up, [[G337]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] nourished [[G397]] him [[G846]] for [[G1519]] her own [[G1438]] son. [[G5207]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] was learned [[G3811]] in all [[G3956]] the wisdom [[G4678]] of the Egyptians, [[G124]] and [[G1161]] was [[G2258]] mighty [[G1415]] in [[G1722]] words [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] deeds. [[G2041]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] he [[G846]] was full [[G4137]] forty years [[G5063]] old, [[G5550]] it came [[G305]] into [[G1909]] his [[G846]] heart to [[G2588]] visit [[G1980]] his [[G846]] brethren [[G80]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] seeing [[G1492]] one [[G5100]] suffer wrong, [[G91]] he defended [[G292]] and [[G2532]] avenged [[G4160]]  that was [[G1557]] him [[G3588]] oppressed, [[G2669]] and smote [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] Egyptian: [[G124]]

### 25
For [[G1161]] he supposed [[G3543]] his [[G846]] brethren would have [[G80]] understood [[G4920]] how that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] would deliver [[G1325]] them: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] understood [[G4920]] not. [[G3756]]

### 26
And [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] next [[G1966]] day [[G2250]] he shewed himself [[G3700]] unto them [[G846]] as they strove, [[G3164]] and [[G2532]] would have set again, [[G4900]] them [[G846]] at [[G1519]] one [[G1515]] saying, [[G2036]] Sirs, [[G435]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] brethren; [[G80]] why [[G2444]] do ye wrong [[G91]] one to another? [[G240]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that did his wrong [[G91]] neighbour [[G4139]] thrust away, [[G683]] him [[G846]] saying, [[G2036]] Who [[G5101]] made [[G2525]] thee [[G4571]] a ruler [[G758]] and [[G2532]] a judge [[G1348]] over [[G1909]] us? [[G2248]]

### 28
Wilt [[G2309]] thou [[G4771]] kill [[G337]] me, [[G3165]] as [[G5158]] thou diddest [[G337]] the [[G3588]] Egyptian [[G124]] yesterday? [[G5504]]

### 29
Then [[G1161]] fled [[G5343]] Moses [[G3475]] at [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] saying, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] was [[G1096]] a stranger [[G3941]] in [[G1722]] the land [[G1093]] of Madian, [[G3099]] where [[G3757]] he begat [[G1080]] two [[G1417]] sons. [[G5207]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] when were [[G4137]] forty [[G5062]] years [[G2094]] expired, [[G4137]] there appeared [[G3700]] to him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]]  of [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] Sina [[G4614]] an angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] in [[G1722]] a flame [[G5395]] of fire [[G4442]] in a bush. [[G942]]

### 31
When [[G1161]] Moses [[G3475]] saw [[G1492]] he wondered [[G2296]] the [[G3588]] at [[G3705]] sight: [[G3705]] and [[G1161]] as he drew [[G846]] near [[G4334]] to behold [[G2657]] the voice [[G5456]] of the Lord [[G2962]] came [[G1096]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]]

### 32
I [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G4675]] thy [[G4675]] fathers, [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jacob. [[G2384]] Then [[G1161]] Moses [[G3475]] trembled, [[G1790]] durst [[G5111]] and [[G2657]] not [[G3756]] behold. [[G2657]]

### 33
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] to him, [[G846]] Put off [[G3089]] thy from thy [[G4675]] shoes [[G5266]] feet: [[G4228]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G1722]]  thou [[G3739]] standest [[G2476]] is [[G2076]] holy [[G40]] ground. [[G1093]]

### 34
I have seen, [[G1492]] I have seen [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] affliction [[G2561]] of [[G2992]] my [[G3450]] people [[G2992]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] Egypt, [[G125]] and [[G2532]] I have heard [[G191]] their [[G846]] groaning, [[G4726]] and [[G2532]] am come down [[G2597]] to deliver [[G1807]] them. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] come, [[G1204]] I will send [[G649]] thee [[G4571]] into [[G1519]] Egypt. [[G125]]

### 35
This [[G5126]] Moses [[G3475]] whom [[G3739]] they refused, [[G720]] saying, [[G2036]] Who [[G5101]] made [[G2525]] thee [[G4571]] a ruler [[G758]] and [[G2532]] a judge? [[G1348]] the same [[G5126]] did [[G649]] God [[G2316]] send [[G649]] a ruler [[G758]] and [[G2532]] a deliverer [[G3086]] by [[G1722]] the hand [[G5495]] of the angel [[G32]] which [[G3588]] appeared [[G3700]] to him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] bush. [[G942]]

### 36
He [[G3778]] brought out, [[G1806]] them [[G846]] after that he had shewed [[G4160]] wonders [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] the land [[G1093]] of Egypt, [[G125]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Red [[G2063]] the [[G2281]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] forty [[G5062]] years. [[G2094]]

### 37
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] that [[G3778]] Moses, [[G3475]] which said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G5207]] children [[G5207]] of Israel, [[G2474]] A prophet [[G4396]] the Lord [[G2962]] shall up [[G2316]] your [[G5216]] God [[G2316]] raise [[G450]] unto you [[G5213]] of [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] brethren, [[G80]] like [[G5613]] unto [[G1691]] me; [[G1691]] him [[G846]] shall ye hear. [[G191]]

### 38
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] he, [[G3588]] that was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] which [[G3588]] spake [[G2980]] to him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] Sina, [[G4614]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] fathers: [[G3962]] who [[G3739]] received [[G1209]] the lively [[G2198]] oracles [[G3051]] to give [[G1325]] unto us: [[G2254]]

### 39
To whom [[G3739]] our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] obey, [[G5255]] but [[G235]] thrust from them, [[G683]] and [[G2532]] in [[G2588]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] turned back again [[G4762]] into [[G1519]] Egypt, [[G125]]

### 40
Saying [[G2036]] unto Aaron, [[G2]] Make [[G4160]] us [[G2254]] gods [[G2316]] to [[G3739]] go before [[G4313]] us: [[G2257]] for [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] Moses, [[G3475]] which [[G3739]] brought out [[G1806]] us [[G2248]] of [[G1537]] the land [[G1093]] of Egypt, [[G125]] we wot [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] is become [[G1096]] of him. [[G846]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] they made a calf [[G3447]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] offered [[G321]] sacrifice [[G2378]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1497]] idol, [[G1497]] and [[G2532]] rejoiced [[G2165]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of their own [[G846]] hands. [[G5495]]

### 42
Then [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] turned, [[G4762]] and [[G2532]] gave up [[G3860]] them [[G846]] to worship [[G3000]] the [[G3588]] host [[G4756]] of [[G3772]] heaven; [[G3772]] as [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the book [[G976]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets, [[G4396]] O ye house [[G3624]] of Israel, [[G2474]] have ye offered [[G4374]] to me [[G3427]] slain beasts [[G4968]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices [[G2378]] forty [[G5062]] years [[G2094]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness? [[G2048]]

### 43
Yea, [[G2532]] ye took up [[G353]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle of [[G4633]] Moloch, [[G3434]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] star [[G798]] of [[G2316]] your [[G5216]] god [[G2316]] Remphan, [[G4481]] figures [[G5179]] which [[G3739]] ye made [[G4160]] to worship [[G4352]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] I will carry away [[G3351]] you [[G5209]] beyond [[G1900]] Babylon. [[G897]]

### 44
Our [[G2257]] fathers [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle [[G4633]] of [[G3142]] witness [[G3142]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] as [[G2531]] he had appointed, [[G1299]] speaking [[G2980]] unto [[G3475]] Moses, [[G3475]] that he should make [[G4160]] it [[G846]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] fashion [[G5179]] that [[G3739]] he had seen. [[G3708]] had [[G2258]]

### 45
Which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] fathers that came [[G3962]] after [[G1237]] brought in [[G1521]] with [[G3326]] Jesus [[G2424]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] possession [[G2697]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] drave out [[G1856]] before [[G575]] the face [[G4383]] of [[G2257]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of David; [[G1138]]

### 46
Who [[G3739]] found [[G2147]] favour [[G5485]] before [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] desired [[G154]] to find [[G2147]] a tabernacle [[G4638]] for the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jacob. [[G2384]]

### 47
But [[G1161]] Solomon [[G4672]] built [[G3618]] him [[G846]] an house. [[G3624]]

### 48
Howbeit [[G235]] the [[G3588]] most High [[G5310]] dwelleth [[G2730]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] temples [[G3485]] made with hands; [[G5499]] as [[G2531]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]]

### 49
Heaven [[G3772]] my [[G3427]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G1161]] earth [[G1093]] my [[G3450]] footstool: [[G5286]] what [[G4169]] house [[G3624]] will ye build [[G3618]] me? [[G3427]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord: [[G2962]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] the place [[G5117]] of [[G2663]] my [[G3450]] rest? [[G2663]]

### 50
not [[G3780]] my [[G3450]] hand [[G5495]] Hath made [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] these things? [[G5023]]

### 51
Ye stiffnecked [[G4644]] and [[G2532]] uncircumcised [[G564]]  in [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] ears, [[G3775]] ye [[G5210]] always [[G104]] do [[G496]] resist [[G496]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost: [[G4151]] as [[G5613]] your [[G5216]] fathers [[G3962]] so [[G2532]] ye. [[G5210]]

### 52
Which [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets [[G4396]] not [[G3756]] have [[G1377]] your [[G5216]] fathers [[G3962]] persecuted? [[G1377]] and [[G2532]] they have slain [[G615]] them which [[G3588]] shewed before [[G4293]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] coming of Just [[G1660]] the [[G3588]] One; [[G1342]] of whom [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] have been [[G1096]] now [[G3568]] the betrayers [[G4273]] and [[G2532]] murderers: [[G5406]]

### 53
Who [[G3748]] have received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] by [[G1519]] the disposition [[G1296]] of angels, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] have [[G5442]] kept [[G5442]]

### 54
When [[G1161]] they heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] they were cut [[G1282]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2588]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] they gnashed [[G1031]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] with [[G3599]] teeth. [[G3599]]

### 55
But [[G1161]] he, being [[G5225]] full [[G4134]] of the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] looked stedfastly [[G816]] up into [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] and and [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] the glory [[G1391]] of God, [[G2316]] Jesus [[G2424]] standing [[G2476]] on [[G1537]] the right hand [[G1188]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]]

### 56
And [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Behold, [[G2400]] I see [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] opened, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] standing [[G2476]] on [[G1537]] the right hand [[G1188]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 57
Then [[G1161]] they cried out [[G2896]] with a [[G5456]] loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] and stopped [[G4912]] their [[G846]] ears, [[G3775]] and [[G2532]] ran [[G3729]] upon [[G1909]] him [[G846]] with one accord, [[G3661]]

### 58
And [[G2532]] cast [[G1544]] out [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city, [[G4172]] and stoned [[G3036]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] witnesses [[G3144]] laid down [[G659]] their [[G846]] clothes [[G2440]] at [[G3844]] a young man's [[G3494]] feet, [[G4228]] whose name was [[G2564]] Saul. [[G4569]]

### 59
And [[G2532]] they stoned [[G3036]] Stephen, [[G4736]] calling upon [[G1941]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] receive [[G1209]] my [[G3450]] spirit. [[G4151]]

### 60
he kneeled down, [[G5087]] And [[G1161]] and [[G1161]] cried [[G2896]] with a [[G5456]] loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] Lord, [[G2962]] lay charge. [[G2476]] not [[G3361]] this [[G3778]] sin to [[G266]] their [[G846]] And [[G2532]] when he had said [[G2036]] this, [[G5124]] he fell asleep. [[G2837]]
