### 1
Now [[G1161]] about [[G2596]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] stretched forth [[G1911]] hands [[G5495]] to vex [[G2559]] certain [[G5100]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] he killed [[G337]] James [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] of John [[G2491]] with the sword. [[G3162]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] because [[G3754]] he saw [[G1492]] it pleased [[G701]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] he proceeded further [[G4369]] to take [[G4815]] Peter [[G4074]] also. [[G2532]] (Then [[G1161]] were [[G2258]] the days [[G2250]] of unleavened bread.) [[G106]]

### 4
him, [[G3739]] And when [[G2532]] he had apprehended [[G4084]] he put [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] and delivered [[G3860]] to four [[G5064]] quaternions [[G5069]] of soldiers [[G4757]] to keep [[G5442]] him; [[G846]] intending [[G1014]] after [[G3326]] Easter [[G3957]] to bring forth [[G321]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2992]] people. [[G2992]]

### 5
Peter [[G4074]] therefore [[G3767]] was kept [[G5083]] in [[G1722]] prison: [[G5438]] but [[G1161]] prayer [[G4335]] was [[G2258]] made [[G1096]] without ceasing [[G1618]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] unto [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] him. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] Herod [[G2264]] would [[G3195]] have brought forth, [[G4254]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] night [[G3571]] Peter [[G4074]] was [[G2258]] sleeping [[G2837]] between [[G3342]] two [[G1417]] soldiers, [[G4757]] bound [[G1210]] with two [[G1417]] chains: [[G254]] and [[G5037]] the keepers [[G5441]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] kept [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] prison. [[G5438]]

### 7
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] the angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] came upon [[G2186]] and [[G2532]] a light [[G5457]] shined [[G2989]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prison: [[G3612]] and [[G1161]] he smote [[G3960]] Peter [[G4074]] the [[G3588]] on [[G4125]] side, [[G4125]] and raised up, [[G1453]] him [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Arise up [[G450]] quickly. [[G5034]] And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] chains [[G254]] fell off [[G1601]] from [[G1537]] hands. [[G5495]]

### 8
And [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Gird thyself, [[G4024]] and [[G2532]] bind on [[G5265]] thy [[G4675]] sandals. [[G4547]] And [[G1161]] so [[G3779]] he did. [[G4160]] And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Cast about thee, [[G4016]] thy [[G4675]] garment [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he went out, [[G1831]] and followed [[G190]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] wist [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G2076]] true [[G227]] which was done [[G1096]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] angel; [[G32]] but [[G1161]] thought [[G1380]] he saw [[G991]] a vision. [[G3705]]

### 10
When [[G1161]] they were past [[G1330]] the first [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the second [[G1208]] ward, [[G5438]] they came [[G2064]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] iron [[G4603]] gate that [[G4439]] leadeth [[G5342]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city; [[G4172]] which [[G3748]] opened [[G455]] to them [[G846]] of his own accord: [[G844]] and [[G2532]] they went out, [[G1831]] and passed on through [[G4281]] one [[G1520]] street; [[G4505]] and [[G2532]] forthwith [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] departed [[G868]] from [[G575]] him. [[G846]]

### 11
And when [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] was come [[G1096]] to [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] he said, [[G2036]] Now [[G3568]] I know [[G1492]] of a surety, [[G230]] that [[G3754]] the Lord [[G2962]] hath sent [[G1821]] his [[G846]] angel, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] hath delivered [[G1807]] me [[G3165]] out of [[G1537]] the hand [[G5495]] of Herod, [[G2264]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] expectation [[G4329]] the [[G3588]] of of [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 12
And [[G5037]] when he had considered [[G4894]] he came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] of Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of John, [[G2491]] whose surname was [[G1941]] Mark; [[G3138]] where [[G3757]] many [[G2425]] were [[G2258]] gathered together [[G4867]] praying. [[G4336]]

### 13
And as [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] knocked [[G2925]] at the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4440]] gate, [[G4440]] a damsel [[G3814]] came [[G4334]] to hearken, [[G5219]] named [[G3686]] Rhoda. [[G4498]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] when she knew [[G1921]] Peter's [[G4074]] voice, [[G5456]] she opened [[G455]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] gate [[G4440]] for [[G575]] gladness, [[G5479]] but [[G1161]] ran in, [[G1532]] and told [[G518]] how [[G2476]] Peter [[G4074]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] gate. [[G4440]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] her, [[G846]] Thou art mad. [[G3105]] But [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] constantly affirmed [[G1340]] that it was [[G2192]] even so. [[G3779]] Then [[G1161]] said [[G3004]] they, [[G3588]] It is [[G2076]] his [[G846]] angel. [[G32]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] continued [[G1961]] knocking: [[G2925]] and [[G1161]] when they had opened [[G455]] and saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] they were astonished. [[G1839]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] he, beckoning [[G2678]] unto them [[G846]] with the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] to hold their peace, [[G4601]] declared [[G1334]] unto them [[G846]] how [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] had brought [[G1806]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] prison. [[G5438]] And [[G1161]] he said, [[G2036]] Go shew [[G518]] these things [[G5023]] unto James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G80]] brethren. [[G80]] And [[G2532]] he departed, [[G1831]] and went [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] another [[G2087]] place. [[G5117]]

### 18
Now [[G1161]] as soon as it was [[G1096]] day, [[G2250]] there was [[G2258]] no [[G3756]] small [[G3641]] stir [[G5017]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] soldiers, [[G4757]] what [[G5101]] was become [[G1096]] of [[G4074]] Peter. [[G4074]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] when Herod [[G2264]] had sought [[G1934]] for [[G846]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] found him [[G2147]] not, [[G3361]] he examined [[G350]] the [[G3588]] keepers, [[G5441]] and commanded that [[G2753]] should be put to death. [[G520]] And [[G2532]] he went down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Judaea [[G2449]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and abode. [[G1304]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] was [[G2258]] highly displeased [[G2371]] with them of Tyre [[G5183]] and [[G2532]] Sidon: [[G4606]] but [[G1161]] they came [[G3918]] with one accord [[G3661]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] and, [[G2532]] having made their friend, [[G3982]] Blastus [[G986]] the [[G3588]] king's [[G935]] chamberlain [[G2846]] desired [[G154]] peace; [[G1515]] because [[G1223]] their [[G846]] country [[G5561]] was nourished [[G5142]] by [[G575]] the [[G3588]] king's [[G937]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] upon a set [[G5002]] day [[G2250]] Herod, [[G2264]] arrayed in [[G1746]] royal [[G937]] apparel, [[G2066]] sat [[G2523]] upon [[G1909]]  his [[G3588]] throne, [[G968]] and made an oration [[G1215]] unto [[G4314]] them. [[G846]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] people [[G1218]] gave a shout, [[G2019]] the voice [[G5456]] of a god, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] of a man. [[G444]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] immediately [[G3916]] the angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] smote [[G3960]] him, [[G846]] because [[G473]] he gave [[G1325]] not [[G3756]] God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] glory: [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] he was [[G1096]] eaten of worms, [[G4662]] and gave up the ghost. [[G1634]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] grew [[G837]] and [[G2532]] multiplied. [[G4129]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Saul [[G4569]] returned [[G5290]] from [[G1537]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] when they had fulfilled [[G4137]] ministry, [[G1248]] and [[G2532]] took with them [[G4838]] John, [[G2491]] whose surname was [[G1941]] Mark. [[G3138]]
