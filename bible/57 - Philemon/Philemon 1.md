[[Titus 3|←]] • [[Hebrews 1|→]]

### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] a prisoner [[G1198]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] Timothy [[G5095]] brother, [[G80]] unto Philemon [[G5371]] our [[G2257]] dearly beloved, [[G27]] and [[G2532]] fellowlabourer, [[G4904]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] to [[G27]] beloved [[G27]] Apphia, [[G682]] and [[G2532]] Archippus [[G751]] our [[G2257]] fellowsoldier, [[G4961]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1577]] church [[G1577]] in [[G2596]] thy [[G4675]] house: [[G3624]]

### 3
Grace [[G5485]] to you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] peace, [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 4
I thank [[G2168]] my [[G3450]] God, [[G2316]] making [[G4160]] mention [[G3417]] of thee [[G4675]] always [[G3842]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] prayers, [[G4335]]

### 5
Hearing [[G191]] of thy [[G4675]] love [[G26]] and [[G2532]] faith, [[G4102]] which [[G3739]] thou hast [[G2192]] toward [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] toward [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] saints; [[G40]]

### 6
That [[G3704]] the [[G3588]] communication [[G2842]] of thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] may become [[G1096]] effectual [[G1756]] by [[G1722]] the acknowledging [[G1922]] of every [[G3956]] good thing [[G18]] which [[G3588]] is [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] we have [[G2192]] great [[G4183]] joy [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] consolation [[G3874]] in [[G1909]] thy [[G4675]] love, [[G26]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] bowels of [[G4698]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] are refreshed [[G373]] by [[G1223]] thee, [[G4675]] brother. [[G80]]

### 8
Wherefore, [[G1352]] though I might be [[G2192]] much [[G4183]] bold [[G3954]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] to enjoin [[G2004]] thee [[G4671]] that which is convenient, [[G433]]

### 9
Yet for sake [[G1223]] love's [[G26]] rather [[G3123]] I [[G3870]] beseech [[G3870]] being [[G5607]] such an one [[G5108]] as [[G5613]] Paul [[G3972]] the aged, [[G4246]] and [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] also [[G2532]] a prisoner [[G1198]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 10
I beseech [[G3870]] thee [[G4571]] for [[G4012]] my [[G1700]] son [[G5043]] Onesimus, [[G3682]] whom [[G3739]] I have begotten [[G1080]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] bonds: [[G1199]]

### 11
Which was [[G3588]] in time past [[G4218]] to thee [[G4671]] unprofitable, [[G890]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] profitable [[G2173]] to thee [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] to me: [[G1698]]

### 12
Whom [[G3739]] I have sent again: [[G375]] thou [[G4771]] therefore [[G1161]] receive [[G4355]] him, [[G846]] that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] mine own [[G1699]] bowels: [[G4698]]

### 13
Whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] would [[G1014]] have retained [[G2722]] with [[G4314]] me, [[G1683]] that [[G2443]] in stead [[G5228]] thy [[G4675]] he might have ministered [[G1247]] unto [[G3427]] me [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] bonds [[G1199]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2098]] gospel: [[G2098]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] without [[G5565]] thy [[G4674]] mind [[G1106]] would I [[G2309]] do [[G4160]] nothing; [[G3762]] that [[G2443]] thy [[G4675]] benefit [[G18]] not [[G3361]] should [[G5600]] be [[G5600]] as it were [[G5613]] of [[G2596]] necessity, [[G318]] but [[G235]] willingly. [[G2596]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] perhaps [[G5029]] therefore [[G5124]] he [[G5563]] departed [[G5563]] for [[G1223]] a season, [[G5610]] that [[G2443]] thou shouldest receive [[G568]] him [[G846]] for ever; [[G166]]

### 16
Not now [[G3765]] as [[G5613]] a servant, [[G1401]] but [[G235]] above [[G5228]] a servant, [[G1401]] a brother [[G80]] beloved, [[G27]] specially [[G3122]] to me, [[G1698]] but [[G1161]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] unto thee, [[G4671]] both [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the Lord? [[G2962]]

### 17
If [[G1487]] thou count [[G2192]] me [[G1691]] therefore [[G3767]] a partner, [[G2844]] receive [[G4355]] him [[G846]] as [[G5613]] myself. [[G1691]]

### 18
If [[G1487]] he hath wronged [[G91]] thee, [[G4571]] or [[G2228]] oweth [[G3784]] ought, [[G5100]] put account; [[G1677]] that [[G5124]] on mine [[G1698]]

### 19
I [[G1473]] Paul [[G3972]] have written [[G1125]] with mine own [[G1699]] hand, [[G5495]] I [[G1473]] will repay [[G661]] albeit [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] I do [[G3004]] say [[G3004]] to thee [[G4671]] how [[G3754]] thou owest besides. [[G4359]] unto me [[G3427]] even [[G2532]] thine own self [[G4572]]

### 20
Yea, [[G3483]] brother, [[G80]] me [[G1473]] let have [[G3685]] joy [[G3685]] of thee [[G4675]] in [[G1722]] the Lord: [[G2962]] refresh [[G373]] my [[G3450]] bowels [[G4698]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 21
Having confidence [[G3982]] in [[G5218]] thy [[G4675]] obedience [[G5218]] I wrote [[G1125]] unto thee, [[G4671]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] also [[G2532]] thou wilt [[G4160]] do [[G4160]] more than [[G5228]] I say. [[G3004]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] withal [[G260]] prepare [[G2090]] me [[G3427]] also [[G2532]] a lodging: [[G3578]] for [[G1063]] I trust [[G1679]] that [[G3754]] through [[G1223]] your [[G5216]] prayers I shall be [[G4335]] given [[G5483]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 23
There salute [[G782]] thee [[G4571]] Epaphras, [[G1889]] my [[G3450]] fellowprisoner [[G4869]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus; [[G2424]]

### 24
Marcus, [[G3138]] Aristarchus, [[G708]] Demas, [[G1214]] Lucas, [[G3065]] my [[G3450]] fellowlabourers. [[G4904]]

### 25
The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] with [[G3326]] your [[G5216]] spirit. [[G4151]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 255
Written [[G1125]] from [[G575]] Rome [[G4516]] to [[G4314]] Philemon, [[G5371]] by [[G1223]] Onesimus [[G3682]] a servant. [[G3610]]
