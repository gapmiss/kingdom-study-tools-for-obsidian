### 1
brotherly love [[G5360]] Let continue. [[G3306]]

### 2
not [[G3361]] Be [[G1950]] forgetful [[G1950]] to entertain strangers: [[G5381]] for [[G1063]] thereby [[G1223]] some [[G5100]] have entertained [[G3579]] angels [[G32]] unawares. [[G2990]]

### 3
Remember [[G3403]]  them that are in [[G3588]] bonds, [[G1198]] as [[G5613]] bound with them; [[G4887]] them which suffer adversity, [[G2558]] as [[G5613]] being [[G5607]] yourselves [[G846]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the body. [[G4983]]

### 4
Marriage [[G1062]] honourable [[G5093]] in [[G1722]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] bed [[G2845]] undefiled: [[G283]] but [[G1161]] whoremongers [[G4205]] and [[G2532]] adulterers [[G3432]] God will [[G2316]] judge. [[G2919]]

### 5
conversation [[G5158]] without covetousness; [[G866]] content [[G714]] with such things as ye have: [[G3918]] for [[G1063]] he [[G846]] hath said, [[G2046]] never [[G3756]] I will [[G447]] leave [[G447]] thee, [[G4571]] nor [[G3761]] forsake [[G1459]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 6
So that [[G5620]] we [[G2248]] boldly [[G2292]] may [[G3004]] say, [[G3004]] The Lord [[G2962]] my [[G1698]] helper, [[G998]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] I will [[G5399]] fear [[G5399]] what [[G5101]] man [[G444]] shall do [[G4160]] unto me. [[G3427]]

### 7
Remember [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] them which have rule [[G2233]] over [[G2233]] you, [[G5216]] who [[G3748]] have spoken [[G2980]] unto you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] whose [[G3739]] faith [[G4102]] follow, [[G3401]] considering [[G333]] the [[G3588]] end [[G1545]] of [[G391]] conversation. [[G391]]

### 8
Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] yesterday, [[G5504]] and [[G2532]] to day, [[G4594]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 9
not [[G3361]] Be carried [[G4064]] about [[G4064]] with divers [[G4164]] and [[G2532]] strange [[G3581]] doctrines. [[G1322]] For [[G1063]] a good thing [[G2570]] that be [[G950]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] established [[G950]] with grace; [[G5485]] not [[G3756]] with meats, [[G1033]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] have [[G5623]] profited [[G5623]] them that have been occupied [[G4043]] therein. [[G1722]]

### 10
We have [[G2192]] an altar, [[G2379]] whereof [[G3739]] they have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] right [[G1849]] to eat [[G5315]] which serve [[G3000]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle. [[G4633]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] bodies [[G4983]] of [[G2226]] those [[G5130]] beasts, [[G2226]] whose [[G3739]] blood [[G129]] is brought [[G1533]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sanctuary [[G39]] by [[G1223]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] for [[G4012]] sin, [[G266]] are burned [[G2618]] without [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] camp. [[G3925]]

### 12
Wherefore [[G1352]] Jesus [[G2424]] also, [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] he might sanctify [[G37]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] with [[G1223]] his own [[G2398]] blood, [[G129]] suffered [[G3958]] without [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] gate. [[G4439]]

### 13
Let us go forth [[G1831]] therefore [[G5106]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] without [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] camp, [[G3925]] bearing [[G5342]] his [[G846]] reproach. [[G3680]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] here [[G5602]] have we [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] continuing [[G3306]] city, [[G4172]] but [[G235]] we seek [[G1934]] one to come. [[G3195]]

### 15
By [[G1223]] him [[G846]] therefore [[G3767]] let us offer [[G399]] the sacrifice [[G2378]] of praise [[G133]]  to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] continually, [[G1275]] that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] the fruit [[G2590]] of lips [[G5491]] giving thanks [[G3670]] to [[G3686]] his [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] to do good [[G2140]] and [[G2532]] to communicate [[G2842]] forget [[G1950]] not: [[G3361]] for [[G1063]] with such [[G5108]] sacrifices [[G2378]] God is well [[G2316]] pleased. [[G2100]]

### 17
Obey [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] them that have rule [[G2233]] over [[G2233]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] submit yourselves: [[G5226]] for [[G1063]] they [[G846]] watch [[G69]] for [[G5228]] your [[G5216]] souls, [[G5590]] as [[G5613]] they that must give [[G591]] account, [[G3056]] that [[G2443]] they may do [[G4160]] it [[G5124]] with [[G3326]] joy, [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] with grief: [[G4727]] for [[G1063]] that [[G5124]] unprofitable [[G255]] for you. [[G5213]]

### 18
Pray [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] us: [[G2257]] for [[G1063]] we trust [[G3982]] we have [[G2192]] a [[G4893]] good [[G2570]] conscience, [[G4893]] in [[G1722]] all things [[G3956]] willing [[G2309]] to live [[G390]] honestly. [[G2573]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] I beseech [[G3870]] the rather [[G4056]] to do [[G4160]] this, [[G5124]] that [[G2443]] I may be restored [[G600]] to you [[G5213]] the sooner. [[G5032]]

### 20
the [[G3588]] Now [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] of [[G1515]] that [[G3588]] peace, [[G1515]] brought again [[G321]] from [[G1537]] the dead [[G3498]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] that [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] shepherd [[G4166]] of the [[G3588]] sheep, [[G4263]] through [[G1722]] the blood [[G129]] of the [[G1242]] everlasting [[G166]] covenant, [[G1242]]

### 21
Make [[G2675]] you [[G5209]] perfect [[G2675]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work [[G2041]] to [[G1519]] do [[G4160]] his [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] working [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] that which [[G3588]] is wellpleasing [[G2101]] in [[G1799]] his [[G846]] sight, [[G1799]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ; [[G5547]] to whom [[G3739]] glory [[G1391]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]]  and [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] I beseech [[G3870]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] suffer [[G430]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G3874]] exhortation: [[G3874]] for [[G1063]] I have written a letter [[G1989]] unto you [[G5213]] in [[G1223]] few words. [[G1024]]

### 23
Know ye [[G1097]] that [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] Timothy [[G5095]] is set at liberty; [[G630]] with [[G3326]] whom, [[G3739]] if [[G1437]] he [[G5032]] come [[G2064]] shortly, [[G5032]] I will see [[G3700]] you. [[G5209]]

### 24
Salute [[G782]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] them that have rule [[G2233]] over [[G2233]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]] They [[G3588]] of [[G575]] Italy [[G2482]] salute [[G782]] you. [[G5209]]

### 25
Grace [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 255
Written [[G1125]] to [[G4314]] the Hebrews [[G1445]] from [[G575]] Italy, [[G2482]] by [[G1223]] Timothy. [[G5095]]
