### 1
Wherefore [[G5105]] seeing [[G2192]] we [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] are compassed about with [[G4029]] so great [[G5118]] a cloud [[G3509]] of witnesses, [[G3144]] let us lay aside [[G659]] every [[G3956]] weight, [[G3591]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sin [[G266]] which doth so easily beset [[G2139]] and let us run [[G5143]] with [[G1223]] patience [[G5281]] the [[G3588]] race [[G73]] that is set before [[G4295]] us, [[G2254]]

### 2
Looking [[G872]] unto [[G1519]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] author [[G747]] and [[G2532]] finisher [[G5051]]  of [[G3588]] faith; [[G4102]] who [[G3739]] for [[G473]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] that was set before [[G4295]] him [[G846]] endured [[G5278]] the cross, [[G4716]] despising [[G2706]] the shame, [[G152]] and [[G5037]] is set down [[G2523]] at [[G1722]] the right hand [[G1188]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2362]] throne [[G2362]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] consider [[G357]] him that endured [[G5278]] such [[G5108]] contradiction [[G485]] of [[G5259]] sinners [[G268]] against [[G1519]] himself, [[G846]] lest [[G3361]] ye be wearied [[G2577]] and faint [[G1590]] in [[G5590]] your [[G5216]] minds. [[G5590]]

### 4
not yet [[G3768]] Ye have [[G478]] resisted [[G478]] unto [[G3360]] blood, [[G129]] striving [[G464]] against [[G4314]] sin. [[G266]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] ye have forgotten [[G1585]] the [[G3588]] exhortation [[G3874]] which [[G3748]] speaketh [[G1256]] unto you [[G5213]] as [[G5613]] unto children, [[G5207]] My [[G3450]] son, [[G5207]] despise thou [[G3643]] not [[G3361]] the chastening [[G3809]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] nor [[G3366]] faint [[G1590]] when thou art rebuked [[G1651]] of [[G5259]] him: [[G846]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] whom [[G3739]] the Lord [[G2962]] loveth [[G25]] he chasteneth, [[G3811]] and [[G1161]] scourgeth [[G3146]] every [[G3956]] son [[G5207]] whom [[G3739]] he receiveth. [[G3858]]

### 7
If [[G1487]] ye endure [[G5278]] chastening, [[G3809]] God [[G2316]] dealeth [[G4374]] with you [[G5213]] as [[G5613]] with sons; [[G5207]] for [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] son [[G5207]] is he [[G2076]] whom [[G3739]] the father [[G3962]] chasteneth [[G3811]] not? [[G3756]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] ye be [[G2075]] without [[G5565]] chastisement, [[G3809]] whereof [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] are [[G1096]] partakers, [[G3353]] then [[G686]] are ye [[G2075]] bastards, [[G3541]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] sons. [[G5207]]

### 9
Furthermore [[G1534]] we have had [[G2192]] fathers [[G3962]] of [[G4561]] our [[G2257]] flesh [[G4561]] which corrected [[G3810]] and [[G2532]] we gave reverence: [[G1788]] not [[G3756]] shall we be in unto [[G5293]] much [[G4183]] rather [[G3123]] subjection [[G5293]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] of [[G4151]] spirits, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] live? [[G2198]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] they [[G3588]] verily [[G3303]] for [[G4314]] a few [[G3641]] days [[G2250]] chastened [[G3811]] after [[G2596]] their own [[G846]] pleasure; [[G1380]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] for [[G1909]] profit, [[G4851]] that [[G1519]] might be partakers [[G3335]] of [[G41]] his [[G846]] holiness. [[G41]]

### 11
Now [[G1161]] no [[G3756]] chastening [[G3809]] for [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] present [[G3918]] seemeth [[G1380]] to be [[G1511]] joyous, [[G5479]] but [[G235]] grievous: [[G3077]] nevertheless [[G1161]] afterward [[G5305]] it yieldeth [[G591]] the [[G2590]] peaceable [[G1516]] fruit [[G2590]] of righteousness [[G1343]] them [[G3588]] unto which are [[G1128]] exercised [[G1128]] thereby. [[G846]]

### 12
Wherefore [[G1352]] lift up [[G461]] the hands [[G5495]] which [[G3588]] hang down, [[G3935]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] feeble [[G3886]] knees; [[G1119]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] make [[G4160]] straight [[G3717]] paths [[G5163]] for [[G4228]] your [[G5216]] feet, [[G4228]] lest [[G3361]] that which is lame [[G5560]] be turned out of the way; [[G1624]] but [[G1161]] let it be [[G2390]] rather [[G3123]] healed. [[G2390]]

### 14
Follow [[G1377]] peace [[G1515]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] holiness, [[G38]] without [[G5565]] which [[G3739]] no man [[G3762]] shall see [[G3700]] the [[G3588]] Lord: [[G2962]]

### 15
Looking diligently [[G1983]] lest [[G3361]] any man [[G5100]] fail [[G5302]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] lest [[G3361]] any [[G5100]] root [[G4491]] of bitterness [[G4088]] springing [[G5453]] up [[G507]] trouble [[G1776]] and [[G2532]] thereby [[G5026]] many [[G4183]] be defiled; [[G3392]]

### 16
Lest there [[G3361]] any [[G5100]] fornicator, [[G4205]] or [[G2228]] profane person, [[G952]] as [[G5613]] Esau, [[G2269]] who [[G3739]] for [[G473]] one [[G1520]] morsel of meat [[G1035]] sold [[G591]] his [[G846]] birthright. [[G4415]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] ye know [[G2467]] how that [[G3754]] afterward, [[G3347]] when he would have [[G2309]] inherited [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] blessing, [[G2129]] he was rejected: [[G593]] for [[G1063]] he found [[G2147]] no [[G3756]] place [[G5117]] of repentance, [[G3341]] though [[G2539]] he sought carefully [[G1567]] it [[G846]] with [[G3326]] tears. [[G1144]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] ye are unto [[G4334]] come [[G4334]] the mount [[G3735]] that might be touched, [[G5584]] and [[G2532]] that burned [[G2545]] with fire, [[G4442]] nor [[G2532]] unto blackness, [[G1105]] and [[G2532]] darkness, [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] tempest, [[G2366]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the sound [[G2279]] of a trumpet, [[G4536]] and [[G2532]] the voice [[G5456]] of words; [[G4487]] which [[G3739]] they that [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] entreated [[G3868]] that [[G3361]] the word [[G3056]] not [[G3361]] should be any more: [[G4369]] spoken [[G4369]] to them [[G846]]

### 20
(For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] they could [[G5342]] endure [[G5342]] that which was commanded, [[G1291]] And if so much as [[G2579]] a beast [[G2342]] touch [[G2345]] the [[G3588]] mountain, [[G3735]] it shall be stoned, [[G3036]] or [[G2228]] thrust through [[G2700]] with a dart: [[G1002]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] terrible [[G5398]] was [[G2258]] the [[G3588]] sight, [[G5324]] Moses [[G3475]] said, [[G2036]] exceedingly fear [[G1630]] I [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] quake:) [[G1790]]

### 22
But [[G235]] ye are come [[G4334]] unto mount [[G3735]] Sion, [[G4622]] and [[G2532]] unto the city [[G4172]] of the [[G2316]] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] the [[G2419]] heavenly [[G2032]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] to an innumerable company [[G3461]] of angels, [[G32]]

### 23
To the general assembly [[G3831]] and [[G2532]] church [[G1577]] of the firstborn, [[G4416]] which are written [[G583]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] to God [[G2316]] the Judge [[G2923]] of all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] to the spirits [[G4151]] of just men [[G1342]] made perfect, [[G5048]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] to Jesus [[G2424]] the mediator [[G3316]] of the [[G1242]] new [[G3501]] covenant, [[G1242]] and [[G2532]] to the blood [[G129]] of sprinkling, [[G4473]] that speaketh [[G2980]] better things [[G2909]] than [[G3844]] Abel. [[G6]]

### 25
See ye [[G991]] that [[G3361]] refuse [[G3868]] not [[G3361]] him [[G3588]] that speaketh. [[G2980]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] they [[G1565]] escaped [[G5343]] not [[G3756]] who refused [[G3868]] him that spake [[G5537]] on [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] we [[G2249]] if we turn away from [[G654]] him [[G3588]] that [[G3588]] from [[G575]] heaven: [[G3772]]

### 26
Whose [[G3739]] voice [[G5456]] then [[G5119]] shook [[G4531]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] he hath promised, [[G1861]] saying, [[G3004]] Yet more [[G2089]] once [[G530]] I [[G1473]] shake [[G4579]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] this [[G3588]] Yet more, [[G2089]] once [[G530]] signifieth [[G1213]] the [[G3588]] removing [[G3331]] of those things that are shaken, [[G4531]] as [[G5613]] of things that are made, [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] those things which be [[G4531]] cannot [[G3361]] shaken [[G4531]] may remain. [[G3306]]

### 28
Wherefore [[G1352]] we receiving [[G3880]] a kingdom [[G932]] which cannot be moved, [[G761]] let us have [[G2192]] grace, [[G5485]] whereby [[G1223]] we may serve [[G3000]] God [[G2316]] acceptably [[G2102]] with [[G3326]] reverence [[G127]] and [[G2532]] godly fear: [[G2124]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] our [[G2257]] God [[G2316]] a [[G4442]] consuming [[G2654]] fire. [[G4442]]
