### 1
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] having [[G2192]] a shadow [[G4639]] of good things [[G18]] to come, [[G3195]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] very [[G846]] image [[G1504]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4229]] things, [[G4229]] can [[G1410]] never [[G3763]] with [[G2378]] those [[G846]] sacrifices [[G2378]] which [[G3739]] they offered [[G4374]] year by [[G2596]] year [[G1763]] continually [[G1336]]  thereunto [[G1519]] make [[G5048]] the [[G3588]] comers [[G4334]] perfect. [[G5048]]

### 2
For then [[G1893]] not [[G3756]] would they have [[G3973]] ceased [[G3973]] to be offered? [[G4374]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] that [[G3000]] worshippers [[G3000]] once [[G530]] purged [[G2508]] should have had [[G2192]] no [[G3367]] more [[G2089]] conscience [[G4893]] of sins. [[G266]]

### 3
But [[G235]] in [[G1722]] those [[G846]] a remembrance again [[G364]] of sins [[G266]] every [[G2596]] year. [[G1763]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] not possible [[G102]] the blood [[G129]] that should take [[G851]] of bulls [[G5022]] and [[G2532]] of goats [[G5131]] away [[G851]] sins. [[G266]]

### 5
Wherefore [[G1352]] when he cometh [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] he saith, [[G3004]] Sacrifice [[G2378]] and [[G2532]] offering [[G4376]] thou wouldest [[G2309]] not, [[G3756]] but [[G1161]] a body [[G4983]] hast thou prepared [[G2675]] me: [[G3427]]

### 6
In burnt offerings [[G3646]] and [[G2532]] for [[G4012]] sin [[G266]] no [[G3756]] thou hast had [[G2106]] pleasure. [[G2106]]

### 7
Then [[G5119]] said I, [[G2036]] Lo, [[G2400]] I come [[G2240]] (in [[G1722]] the volume [[G2777]] of the book [[G975]] it is written [[G1125]] of [[G4012]] me,) [[G1700]] to do [[G4160]] thy [[G4675]] will, [[G2307]]  O [[G3588]] God. [[G2316]]

### 8
Above [[G511]] when he said, [[G3004]] Sacrifice [[G2378]] and [[G2532]] offering [[G4376]] and [[G2532]] burnt offerings [[G3646]] and [[G2532]] for [[G4012]] sin [[G266]] thou wouldest [[G2309]] not, [[G3756]] neither [[G3761]] hadst pleasure [[G2106]] which [[G3748]] are offered [[G4374]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] law; [[G3551]]

### 9
Then [[G5119]] said he, [[G2046]] Lo, [[G2400]] I come [[G2240]] to do [[G4160]] thy [[G4675]] will, [[G2307]]  O [[G3588]] God. [[G2316]] He taketh away [[G337]] the [[G3588]] first, [[G4413]] that [[G2443]] he may establish [[G2476]] the [[G3588]] second. [[G1208]]

### 10
By [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] the [[G2307]] will [[G2307]] we are [[G2070]] sanctified [[G37]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] offering [[G4376]] of the [[G3588]] body of [[G4983]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] once [[G2178]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] priest [[G2409]] standeth [[G2476]] daily [[G2596]] ministering [[G3008]] and [[G2532]] offering [[G4374]] oftentimes [[G4178]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] sacrifices, [[G2378]] which [[G3748]] can [[G1410]] never [[G3763]] take away [[G4014]] sins: [[G266]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] this man, [[G846]] after he had offered [[G4374]] one [[G1520]] sacrifice [[G2378]] for [[G5228]] sins [[G266]] for [[G1519]] ever, [[G1336]] sat down [[G2523]] on [[G1722]] the right hand [[G1188]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]]

### 13
From henceforth [[G3063]] expecting [[G1551]] till [[G2193]] his [[G846]] enemies [[G2190]] be made [[G5087]] his [[G846]] footstool. [[G5286]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] by one [[G1520]] offering [[G4376]] he hath perfected [[G5048]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G1336]] them that are sanctified. [[G37]]

### 15
the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] also [[G2532]] is a witness [[G3140]] to us: [[G2254]] for [[G1063]] after [[G3326]] he [[G3588]] that had said [[G4280]] before, [[G4280]]

### 16
This [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] that [[G3739]] I will make [[G1303]] with [[G4314]] them [[G846]] after [[G3326]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord, [[G2962]] I will put [[G1325]] my [[G3450]] laws [[G3551]] into [[G1909]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] their [[G846]] minds will I [[G1271]] write [[G1924]] them; [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] their [[G846]] sins [[G266]] and [[G2532]] iniquities [[G458]] will I remember [[G3415]] no [[G3756]] more. [[G2089]]

### 18
Now [[G1161]] where [[G3699]] remission [[G859]] of these [[G5130]] no more [[G3765]] offering [[G4376]] for [[G4012]] sin. [[G266]]

### 19
Having [[G2192]] therefore, [[G3767]] brethren, [[G80]] boldness [[G3954]] to [[G1519]] enter into [[G1529]] the [[G3588]] holiest [[G39]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Jesus, [[G2424]]

### 20
By a [[G3598]] new [[G4372]] and [[G2532]] living [[G2198]] way, [[G3598]] which [[G3739]] he hath consecrated [[G1457]] for us, [[G2254]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] veil, [[G2665]] that [[G5124]] is to say, [[G2076]] his [[G846]] flesh; [[G4561]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] an [[G2409]] high [[G3173]] priest [[G2409]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]]

### 22
Let us draw near [[G4334]] with [[G3326]] true [[G228]] a [[G2588]] heart [[G2588]] in [[G1722]] full assurance [[G4136]] of faith, [[G4102]] having [[G4472]] our hearts [[G2588]] sprinkled [[G4472]] from [[G575]] an [[G4893]] evil [[G4190]] conscience, [[G4893]] and [[G2532]]  our [[G3588]] bodies [[G4983]] washed [[G3068]] with [[G5204]] pure [[G2513]] water. [[G5204]]

### 23
Let us hold fast [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] profession [[G3671]] of [[G1680]] faith [[G1680]] without wavering; [[G186]] (for [[G1063]] he [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] that promised;) [[G1861]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] let us consider [[G2657]] one another [[G240]] to [[G1519]] provoke [[G3948]] unto love [[G26]] and [[G2532]] good [[G2570]] to [[G2041]] works: [[G2041]]

### 25
Not [[G3361]] forsaking [[G1459]] the [[G3588]] assembling together, [[G1997]] of ourselves [[G1438]] as [[G2531]] the manner [[G1485]] of some [[G5100]] but [[G235]] exhorting [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] so much [[G5118]] the more, [[G3123]] as [[G3745]] ye see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] approaching. [[G1448]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] if [[G264]] we [[G2257]] sin [[G264]] wilfully [[G1596]] after [[G3326]] that we have received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1922]] the [[G3588]] of [[G225]] truth, [[G225]] there remaineth [[G620]] no more [[G3765]] sacrifice [[G2378]] for [[G4012]] sins, [[G266]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] fearful [[G5398]] looking for [[G1561]] of judgment [[G2920]] and [[G2532]] fiery [[G4442]] indignation, [[G2205]] which [[G2068]] shall [[G3195]] devour [[G2068]] the [[G3588]] adversaries. [[G5227]]

### 28
He that [[G5100]] despised [[G114]] Moses' [[G3475]] law [[G3551]] died [[G599]] without [[G5565]] mercy [[G3628]] under [[G1909]] two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] witnesses: [[G3144]]

### 29
Of how much [[G4214]] sorer [[G5501]] punishment, [[G5098]] suppose ye, [[G1380]] shall he be thought worthy, [[G515]] who hath trodden under foot [[G2662]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] hath counted [[G2233]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1242]] covenant, [[G1242]] wherewith [[G3739]] he was sanctified, [[G37]] an unholy thing, [[G2839]] and [[G2532]] hath done despite unto [[G1796]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G5485]] grace? [[G5485]]

### 30
For [[G1063]] we know [[G1492]] him [[G3588]] that hath said, [[G2036]] Vengeance [[G1557]] unto me, [[G1698]] I [[G1473]] will recompense, [[G467]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord. [[G2962]] And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] The Lord [[G2962]] shall judge [[G2919]] his [[G846]] people. [[G2992]]

### 31
a fearful thing [[G5398]] to fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] the hands [[G5495]] of the [[G2316]] living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] call to remembrance [[G363]] the [[G3588]] former [[G4386]] days, [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] which, [[G3739]] after ye were illuminated, [[G5461]] ye endured [[G5278]] great [[G4183]] a [[G119]] fight [[G119]] of afflictions; [[G3804]]

### 33
Partly, [[G5124]] whilst ye were made a gazingstock [[G2301]] both [[G5037]] by reproaches [[G3680]] and [[G2532]] afflictions; [[G2347]] and [[G1161]] partly, [[G5124]] whilst ye became [[G1096]] companions [[G2844]] of them that were [[G390]] so [[G3779]] used. [[G390]]

### 34
For [[G1063]] ye had compassion [[G4834]] of me [[G3450]]  in my [[G3588]] bonds, [[G1199]] and [[G2532]] took [[G4327]] joyfully [[G5479]] the [[G3588]] spoiling [[G724]] of your [[G5216]] goods, [[G5224]] knowing [[G1097]] in [[G1722]] yourselves [[G1438]] that ye have [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] better [[G2909]] a [[G5223]] and [[G2532]] an enduring [[G3306]] substance. [[G5223]]

### 35
not [[G3361]] Cast [[G577]] away [[G577]] therefore [[G3767]] your [[G5216]] confidence, [[G3954]] which [[G3748]] hath [[G2192]] great [[G3173]] recompence of reward. [[G3405]]

### 36
For [[G1063]] ye have [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] of patience, [[G5281]] that, [[G2443]] after ye have done [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] ye might receive [[G2865]] the [[G3588]] promise. [[G1860]]

### 37
For [[G1063]] yet [[G2089]] a little [[G3397]] while, [[G3745]] and he [[G3588]] that shall come [[G2064]] will come, [[G2240]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] will [[G5549]] tarry. [[G5549]]

### 38
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] just [[G1342]] shall live [[G2198]] by [[G1537]] faith: [[G4102]] but [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] draw back, [[G5288]] my [[G3450]] soul [[G5590]] no [[G3756]] shall have [[G2106]] pleasure [[G2106]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] not [[G3756]] of them who draw back [[G5289]] unto [[G1519]] perdition; [[G684]] but [[G235]] of them that believe [[G4102]] to [[G1519]] the saving [[G4047]] of the soul. [[G5590]]
