### 1
Wherefore, [[G3606]] holy [[G40]] brethren, [[G80]] partakers [[G3353]] of the heavenly [[G2032]] calling, [[G2821]] consider [[G2657]] the [[G3588]] Apostle [[G652]] and [[G2532]] High Priest [[G749]] of [[G3671]] our [[G2257]] profession, [[G3671]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus; [[G2424]]

### 2
Who was [[G5607]] faithful [[G4103]] him [[G3588]] to that [[G4160]] appointed [[G4160]] him, [[G846]] as [[G5613]] also [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3624]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] was counted worthy [[G515]] more [[G4119]] of [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] than [[G3844]] Moses, [[G3475]] inasmuch [[G2596]] as [[G3745]] he [[G3588]] who hath builded [[G2680]] the house [[G846]] hath [[G2192]] more [[G4119]] honour [[G5092]] the [[G3588]] than [[G3624]] house. [[G3624]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] every [[G3956]] house [[G3624]] is builded [[G2680]] by [[G5259]] some [[G5100]] but [[G1161]] he that built [[G2680]] all things [[G3956]] God. [[G2316]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] verily [[G3303]] faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] his [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] as [[G5613]] a servant, [[G2324]] for [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] of those things which were to be spoken after; [[G2980]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] Christ [[G5547]] as [[G5613]] a son [[G5207]] over [[G1909]] his own [[G846]] house; [[G3624]] whose [[G3739]] house [[G3624]] are we, [[G2070]] if [[G1437]] we [[G2249]] hold fast [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] confidence [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rejoicing [[G2745]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1680]] hope [[G1680]] firm [[G949]] unto [[G3360]] the end. [[G5056]]

### 7
Wherefore [[G1352]] (as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] saith, [[G3004]] To day [[G4594]] if [[G1437]] ye will hear [[G191]] his [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]]

### 8
Harden [[G4645]] not [[G3361]] your [[G5216]] hearts, [[G2588]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] provocation, [[G3894]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G3986]] temptation [[G3986]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness: [[G2048]]

### 9
When [[G3757]] your [[G5216]] fathers [[G3962]] tempted [[G3985]] me, [[G3165]] proved [[G1381]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] my [[G3450]] works [[G2041]] forty [[G5062]] years. [[G2094]]

### 10
Wherefore [[G1352]] I was grieved with [[G4360]] that [[G1565]] generation, [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] alway [[G104]] They do [[G4105]] err [[G4105]] in [[G2588]] heart; [[G2588]] and [[G1161]] they [[G846]] not [[G3756]] have [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] my [[G3450]] ways. [[G3598]]

### 11
So [[G5613]] I sware [[G3660]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] wrath, [[G3709]]  not [[G1487]] They shall [[G1525]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] rest.) [[G2663]]

### 12
Take heed, [[G991]] brethren, [[G80]] lest [[G3379]] there be [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] any [[G5100]] of you [[G5216]] an [[G2588]] evil [[G4190]] heart [[G2588]] of unbelief, [[G570]] in [[G1722]] departing [[G868]] from [[G575]] the living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]]

### 13
But [[G235]] exhort [[G3870]] one another [[G1438]] daily, [[G2250]] while [[G891]]  is [[G3739]] it [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] To day; [[G4594]] lest [[G2443]] any [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] be hardened [[G4645]] through the deceitfulness [[G539]] of [[G266]] sin. [[G266]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] we are made [[G1096]] partakers [[G3353]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] if [[G1437]] we hold [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] beginning [[G746]]  of our [[G3588]] confidence [[G5287]] stedfast [[G949]] unto [[G3360]] the end; [[G5056]]

### 15
While [[G1722]] it is said, [[G3004]] To day [[G4594]] if [[G1437]] ye will hear [[G191]] his [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]] harden [[G4645]] not [[G3361]] your [[G5216]] hearts, [[G2588]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] provocation. [[G3894]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] some, [[G5100]] when they had heard, [[G191]] did provoke: [[G3893]] howbeit [[G235]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] that came [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] Egypt [[G125]] by [[G1223]] Moses. [[G3475]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] with whom [[G5101]] was he grieved [[G4360]] forty [[G5062]] years? [[G2094]] not [[G3780]] with them that had sinned, [[G264]] whose [[G3739]] carcases [[G2966]] fell [[G4098]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness? [[G2048]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] to whom [[G5101]] sware he that [[G3660]] not [[G3361]] they should [[G1525]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] rest, [[G2663]] but [[G1487]] them that [[G3588]] to believed [[G544]] not? [[G544]]

### 19
So [[G2532]] we see [[G991]] that [[G3754]] they could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] enter in [[G1525]] because of [[G1223]] unbelief. [[G570]]
