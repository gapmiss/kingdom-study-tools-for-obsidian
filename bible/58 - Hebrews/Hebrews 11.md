### 1
Now [[G1161]] faith [[G4102]] is [[G2076]] the substance [[G5287]] of things hoped for, [[G1679]] the evidence [[G1650]] of things [[G4229]] not [[G3756]] seen. [[G991]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] by [[G1722]] it [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] obtained a good report. [[G3140]]

### 3
Through faith [[G4102]] we understand [[G3539]] that were [[G2675]] the [[G3588]] worlds [[G165]] framed [[G2675]] by the word [[G4487]] of God, [[G2316]] so that [[G1519]] things which are seen [[G991]] were made [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] of [[G1537]] things which do appear. [[G5316]]

### 4
By faith [[G4102]] Abel [[G6]] offered [[G4374]] unto [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] more excellent [[G4119]] a [[G2378]] sacrifice [[G2378]] than [[G3844]] Cain, [[G2535]] by [[G1223]] which [[G3739]] he obtained witness [[G3140]] that he was [[G1511]] righteous, [[G1342]] God [[G2316]] testifying [[G3140]] of [[G1909]] his [[G846]] gifts: [[G1435]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] it [[G846]] he being dead [[G599]] yet [[G2089]] speaketh. [[G2980]]

### 5
By faith [[G4102]] Enoch [[G1802]] was translated [[G3346]] that not [[G3361]] he should [[G1492]] see [[G1492]] death; [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] was [[G2147]] found, [[G2147]] because [[G1360]] God [[G2316]] had translated [[G3346]] him: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] before [[G4253]] his [[G846]] translation he had this [[G3331]] testimony, [[G3140]] that he pleased [[G2100]] God. [[G2316]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] without [[G5565]] faith [[G4102]] impossible [[G102]] to please [[G2100]] for [[G1063]] he [[G3588]] that cometh [[G4334]]  to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] must [[G1163]] believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] he is, [[G2076]] and [[G2532]] he is [[G1096]] a rewarder [[G3406]] of them that diligently seek [[G1567]] him. [[G846]]

### 7
By faith [[G4102]] Noah, [[G3575]] being warned of God [[G5537]] of [[G4012]] things [[G3588]] not as [[G3369]] seen [[G991]] yet, [[G3369]] moved with fear, [[G2125]] prepared [[G2680]] an ark [[G2787]] to [[G1519]] the saving [[G4991]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] house; [[G3624]] by [[G1223]] the which [[G3739]] he condemned [[G2632]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] became [[G1096]] heir [[G2818]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1343]] righteousness [[G1343]] which is by [[G2596]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 8
By faith [[G4102]] Abraham, [[G11]] when he was called [[G2564]] to go out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] which [[G3739]] he should after [[G3195]] receive [[G2983]] for [[G1519]] an inheritance, [[G2817]] obeyed; [[G5219]] and [[G2532]] he went out, [[G1831]] not [[G3361]] knowing [[G1987]] whither [[G4226]] he went. [[G2064]]

### 9
By faith [[G4102]] he sojourned [[G3939]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] of [[G1860]] promise, [[G1860]] as [[G5613]] a strange country, [[G245]] dwelling [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] tabernacles [[G4633]] with [[G3326]] Isaac [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] Jacob, [[G2384]] the [[G3588]] heirs with him [[G4789]] the [[G3588]] of [[G846]] same [[G846]] promise: [[G1860]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] he looked for [[G1551]] a city [[G4172]] which hath [[G2192]] foundations, [[G2310]] whose [[G3739]] builder [[G5079]] and [[G2532]] maker [[G1217]] God. [[G2316]]

### 11
Through faith [[G4102]] also [[G2532]] Sara [[G4564]] herself [[G846]] received [[G2983]] strength [[G1411]] to [[G1519]] conceive [[G2602]] seed, [[G4690]] and [[G2532]] was delivered of a child [[G5088]] when she was past [[G3844]] age, [[G2244]] because [[G1893]] she judged [[G2233]] him who [[G3588]] had [[G1861]] faithful [[G4103]] promised. [[G1861]]

### 12
Therefore [[G1352]] sprang there [[G1080]] even [[G2532]] of [[G575]] one, [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] him [[G5023]] as good as dead, [[G3499]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] stars [[G798]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] sky [[G3772]]  in [[G3588]] multitude, [[G4128]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5616]] the sand [[G285]] which is [[G3588]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] shore [[G5491]] innumerable. [[G382]]

### 13
These [[G3778]] all [[G3956]] died [[G599]] in [[G2596]] faith, [[G4102]] not [[G3361]] having received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] promises, [[G1860]] but [[G235]] having seen [[G1492]] them [[G846]] afar off, [[G4207]] and [[G2532]] were persuaded of [[G3982]] and [[G2532]] embraced [[G782]] and [[G2532]] confessed [[G3670]] that [[G3754]] they were [[G1526]] strangers [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] pilgrims [[G3927]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] they that say [[G3004]] such things [[G5108]] declare plainly [[G1718]] that [[G3754]] they seek [[G1934]] a country. [[G3968]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] truly, [[G3303]] if [[G1487]] they had been mindful [[G3421]] of that [[G1565]] from [[G575]] whence [[G3739]] they came out, [[G1831]] they might have had [[G2192]] opportunity [[G2540]] to have returned. [[G344]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] they desire [[G3713]] a better [[G2909]] that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] an heavenly: [[G2032]] wherefore [[G1352]] God is [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] ashamed [[G1870]] to be called [[G1941]] their [[G846]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] he hath prepared [[G2090]] for them [[G846]] a city. [[G4172]]

### 17
By faith [[G4102]] Abraham, [[G11]] when he was tried, [[G3985]] offered up [[G4374]] Isaac: [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] he that had received [[G324]] the [[G3588]] promises offered [[G1860]] up [[G4374]] his only begotten [[G3439]]

### 18
Of [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] it was said, [[G2980]] That [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] Isaac [[G2464]] shall be [[G2564]] thy [[G4671]] seed [[G4690]] called: [[G2564]]

### 19
Accounting [[G3049]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] able [[G1415]] to raise up, [[G1453]] even [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] the dead; [[G3498]] from whence [[G3606]] also [[G2532]] he received [[G2865]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a figure. [[G3850]]

### 20
By faith [[G4102]] Isaac [[G2464]] blessed [[G2127]] Jacob [[G2384]] and [[G2532]] Esau [[G2269]] concerning [[G4012]] things to come. [[G3195]]

### 21
By faith [[G4102]] Jacob, [[G2384]] when he was a dying, [[G599]] blessed [[G2127]] both [[G1538]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Joseph; [[G2501]] and [[G2532]] worshipped, [[G4352]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] top [[G206]] of [[G4464]] his [[G846]] staff. [[G4464]]

### 22
By faith [[G4102]] Joseph, [[G2501]] when he died, [[G5053]] made mention [[G3421]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] departing [[G1841]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] children [[G5207]] of Israel; [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] gave commandment [[G1781]] concerning [[G4012]] his [[G846]] bones. [[G3747]]

### 23
By faith [[G4102]] Moses, [[G3475]] when he was born, [[G1080]] was hid [[G2928]] three months [[G5150]] of [[G5259]] his [[G846]] parents, [[G3962]] because [[G1360]] they saw [[G1492]] a [[G3588]] proper [[G791]] child; [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] they were [[G5399]] afraid [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] of [[G935]] king's [[G935]] commandment. [[G1297]]

### 24
By faith [[G4102]] Moses, [[G3475]] when he was come [[G1096]] to years, [[G3173]] refused [[G720]] to be called [[G3004]] the son [[G5207]] of [[G2364]] Pharaoh's [[G5328]] daughter; [[G2364]]

### 25
Choosing [[G138]] rather [[G3123]] to suffer affliction with [[G4778]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] than [[G2228]] to enjoy [[G2192]] the pleasures [[G619]] of sin [[G266]] for a season; [[G4340]]

### 26
Esteeming [[G2233]] the [[G3588]] reproach [[G3680]] of [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] greater [[G3173]] riches [[G4149]] the [[G3588]] than [[G3588]] treasures [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] Egypt: [[G125]] for [[G1063]] he had respect [[G578]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] recompence of the reward. [[G3405]]

### 27
By faith [[G4102]] he forsook [[G2641]] Egypt, [[G125]] not [[G3361]] fearing [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G2372]] the [[G3588]] of [[G935]] king: [[G935]] for [[G1063]] he endured, [[G2594]] as [[G5613]] seeing [[G3708]] him who is invisible. [[G517]]

### 28
Through faith [[G4102]] he kept [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] passover, [[G3957]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sprinkling [[G4378]] of [[G129]] blood, [[G129]] lest [[G3361]] he [[G3588]] that destroyed [[G3645]] the [[G3588]] firstborn [[G4416]] should touch [[G2345]] them. [[G846]]

### 29
By faith [[G4102]] they passed through [[G1224]] the [[G3588]] Red [[G2063]] sea [[G2281]] as [[G5613]] by [[G1223]] dry [[G3584]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Egyptians [[G124]] assaying [[G3984]] to do [[G2983]] were drowned. [[G2666]]

### 30
By faith [[G4102]] the [[G3588]] walls [[G5038]] of Jericho [[G2410]] fell down, [[G4098]] after they were compassed [[G2944]] about [[G1909]] seven [[G2033]] days. [[G2250]]

### 31
By faith [[G4102]] the [[G3588]] harlot [[G4204]] Rahab [[G4460]] perished with [[G4881]] not [[G3756]] them that believed not, [[G544]] when she had received [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] spies [[G2685]] with [[G3326]] peace. [[G1515]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] more [[G2089]] shall I [[G3004]] say? [[G3004]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] would fail [[G1952]] me [[G3165]] to tell [[G1334]] of [[G4012]] Gedeon, [[G1066]] and [[G5037]] Barak, [[G913]] and [[G2532]] Samson, [[G4546]] and [[G2532]] Jephthae; [[G2422]] David [[G1138]] also, [[G5037]] and [[G2532]] Samuel, [[G4545]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets: [[G4396]]

### 33
Who [[G3739]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] subdued [[G2610]] kingdoms, [[G932]] wrought [[G2038]] righteousness, [[G1343]] obtained [[G2013]] promises, [[G1860]] stopped [[G5420]] the mouths [[G4750]] of lions, [[G3023]]

### 34
Quenched [[G4570]] the violence [[G1411]] of fire, [[G4442]] escaped [[G5343]] the edge [[G4750]] of the sword, [[G3162]] out of [[G575]] weakness [[G769]] were made strong, [[G1743]] waxed [[G1096]] valiant [[G2478]] in [[G1722]] fight, [[G4171]] turned to flight [[G2827]] the armies [[G3925]] of the aliens. [[G245]]

### 35
Women [[G1135]] received [[G2983]] their [[G846]] dead [[G3498]] raised to life again: [[G386]] and [[G1161]] others [[G243]] were tortured, [[G5178]] not [[G3756]] accepting [[G4327]] deliverance; [[G629]] that [[G2443]] they might obtain [[G5177]] better [[G2909]] a [[G386]] resurrection: [[G386]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] others [[G2087]] had [[G2983]] trial [[G3984]] of mockings [[G1701]] and [[G2532]] scourgings, [[G3148]] yea, [[G2089]] moreover [[G1161]] of bonds [[G1199]] and [[G2532]] imprisonment: [[G5438]]

### 37
They were stoned, [[G3034]] they were sawn asunder, [[G4249]] were tempted, [[G3985]] were slain [[G599]] with [[G1722]] the sword: [[G3162]] they wandered about [[G4022]] in [[G1722]] sheepskins [[G3374]]  and [[G1722]] goatskins; [[G122]] being destitute, [[G5302]] afflicted, [[G2346]] tormented; [[G2558]]

### 38
(Of whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] was [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] worthy:) [[G514]] they [[G4105]] wandered [[G4105]] in [[G1722]] deserts, [[G2047]] and [[G2532]] mountains, [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] dens [[G4693]] and [[G2532]] caves [[G3692]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] all, [[G3956]] having obtained a good report [[G3140]] through [[G1223]] faith, [[G4102]] received [[G2865]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] promise: [[G1860]]

### 40
God [[G2316]] having provided [[G4265]] some thing [[G5100]] better [[G2909]] for [[G4012]] us, [[G2257]] that [[G2443]] without [[G5565]] they should be made [[G5048]] us [[G2257]] not [[G3361]] perfect. [[G5048]]
