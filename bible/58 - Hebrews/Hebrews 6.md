### 1
Therefore [[G1352]] leaving [[G863]] the [[G3588]] principles [[G746]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3056]] doctrine [[G3056]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] let us go on [[G5342]] unto [[G1909]] perfection; [[G3361]] not [[G3361]] laying [[G2598]] again [[G3825]] the foundation [[G2310]] of repentance [[G3341]] from [[G575]] dead [[G3498]] works, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] of faith [[G4102]] toward [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]]

### 2
Of the doctrine [[G1322]] of baptisms, [[G909]] and [[G5037]] of laying on [[G1936]] of hands, [[G5495]] and [[G5037]] of resurrection [[G386]] of the dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] of [[G2917]] eternal [[G166]] judgment. [[G2917]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] will we do, [[G4160]] if [[G1437]] God [[G2316]] permit. [[G2010]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] impossible [[G102]] for those who were [[G5461]] once [[G530]] enlightened, [[G5461]] and [[G5037]] have tasted [[G1089]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2032]] heavenly [[G2032]] gift, [[G1431]] and [[G2532]] were made [[G1096]] partakers [[G3353]] of the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] have tasted [[G1089]] good [[G2570]] the [[G4487]] word [[G4487]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G5037]] the powers [[G1411]] of the world [[G165]] to come, [[G3195]]

### 6
If [[G2532]] they shall fall [[G3895]] away, [[G3895]] to renew them [[G340]] again [[G3825]] unto [[G1519]] repentance; [[G3341]] seeing they crucify afresh, [[G388]] to themselves [[G1438]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] put to an open shame. [[G3856]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] the earth which [[G1093]] drinketh in [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] rain [[G5205]] that cometh [[G2064]] oft [[G4178]] upon [[G1909]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] bringeth forth [[G5088]] herbs [[G1008]] meet [[G2111]] for them [[G1565]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] it is dressed, [[G1090]] receiveth [[G3335]] blessing [[G2129]] from [[G575]] God: [[G2316]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] that which beareth [[G1627]] thorns [[G173]] and [[G2532]] briers [[G5146]] rejected, [[G96]] and [[G2532]] nigh unto [[G1451]] cursing; [[G2671]] whose [[G3739]] end [[G5056]] to [[G1519]] be burned. [[G2740]]

### 9
But, [[G1161]] beloved, [[G27]] we are persuaded [[G3982]] better things [[G2909]] of [[G4012]] you, [[G5216]] and [[G2532]] things that accompany [[G2192]] salvation, [[G4991]] though [[G2532]] thus [[G3779]] we [[G2980]] speak. [[G2980]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] unrighteous [[G94]] to forget [[G1950]] your [[G5216]] work [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] labour [[G2873]] of [[G26]] love, [[G26]] which [[G3739]] ye have shewed [[G1731]] toward [[G1519]] his [[G846]] name, [[G3686]] in that ye have ministered to [[G1247]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] do minister. [[G1247]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] we desire that [[G1937]] every one [[G1538]] of you [[G5216]] do shew [[G1731]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] diligence [[G4710]] to [[G4314]] the full [[G3588]] assurance [[G4136]] of [[G1680]] hope [[G1680]] unto [[G891]] the end: [[G5056]]

### 12
That [[G2443]] ye be [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] slothful, [[G3576]] but [[G1161]] followers [[G3402]] of them who [[G2816]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] patience [[G3115]] inherit [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] promises. [[G1860]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] when made [[G1861]] God [[G2316]] promise [[G1861]] to Abraham, [[G11]] because [[G1893]] he could [[G2192]] swear [[G3660]] by [[G2596]] no [[G3762]] greater, [[G3173]] he sware [[G3660]] by [[G2596]] himself, [[G1438]]

### 14
Saying, [[G3004]] Surely [[G2229]] blessing [[G2127]] I will bless [[G2127]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] multiplying [[G4129]] I will multiply [[G4129]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] so, [[G3779]] after he had patiently endured, [[G3114]] he obtained [[G2013]] the [[G3588]] promise. [[G1860]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] men [[G444]] verily [[G3303]] swear [[G3660]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] greater: [[G3173]] and [[G2532]]  an [[G3588]] oath [[G3727]] for [[G1519]] confirmation [[G951]] to them [[G846]] an end [[G4009]] all [[G3956]] of [[G485]] strife. [[G485]]

### 17
Wherein [[G3739]] God, [[G2316]] willing [[G1014]] more abundantly [[G4054]] to shew [[G1925]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2818]] heirs [[G2818]] of [[G1860]] promise [[G1860]] the [[G3588]] immutability [[G276]] of [[G1012]] his [[G846]] counsel, [[G1012]] confirmed [[G3315]] by an oath: [[G3727]]

### 18
That [[G2443]] by [[G1223]] two [[G1417]] immutable [[G276]] things, [[G4229]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] impossible [[G102]] for God [[G2316]] to lie, [[G5574]] we might have [[G2192]] strong [[G2478]] a [[G3874]] consolation, [[G3874]] who have fled for refuge [[G2703]] to lay hold [[G2902]] upon the [[G1680]] hope [[G1680]] set before us: [[G4295]]

### 19
Which [[G3739]] we have [[G2192]] as [[G5613]] an anchor [[G45]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5590]] soul, [[G5590]] both [[G5037]] sure [[G804]] and [[G2532]] stedfast, [[G949]] and [[G2532]] which entereth [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] that within [[G2082]] the [[G3588]] veil; [[G2665]]

### 20
Whither [[G3699]] the forerunner [[G4274]] for [[G5228]] is [[G1525]] us [[G2257]] entered, [[G1525]] Jesus, [[G2424]] made [[G1096]] an high priest [[G749]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G3588]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchisedec. [[G3198]]
