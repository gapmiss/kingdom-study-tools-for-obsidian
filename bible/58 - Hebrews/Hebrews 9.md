### 1
Then [[G3767]] verily [[G3303]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] had [[G2192]] also [[G2532]] ordinances [[G1345]] of divine service, [[G2999]] and [[G5037]] a worldly [[G2886]] sanctuary. [[G39]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] a tabernacle [[G4633]] there was [[G2680]] made; [[G2680]] the [[G3588]] first, [[G4413]] wherein [[G3739]] the [[G5037]] candlestick, [[G3087]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] table, [[G5132]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] shewbread; [[G4286]] which [[G3748]] is called [[G3004]] the sanctuary. [[G39]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] veil, [[G2665]] the tabernacle [[G4633]] which [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] the Holiest [[G39]]  of all; [[G39]]

### 4
Which had [[G2192]] golden [[G5552]] the [[G2369]] censer, [[G2369]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ark [[G2787]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1242]] covenant [[G1242]] overlaid [[G4028]] round about [[G3840]] with gold, [[G5553]] wherein [[G3739]] the [[G4713]] golden [[G5552]] pot [[G4713]] that had [[G2192]] manna, [[G3131]] and [[G2532]] Aaron's [[G2]] rod [[G4464]] that budded, [[G985]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] tables [[G4109]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1242]] covenant; [[G1242]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] over [[G5231]] it [[G846]] the cherubims [[G5502]] of glory [[G1391]] shadowing [[G2683]] the mercyseat; [[G3588]] of [[G4012]] which [[G3739]] we cannot [[G2076]] now [[G3568]] speak [[G3004]] particularly. [[G2596]]

### 6
Now when [[G1161]] these things [[G5130]] thus [[G3779]] were [[G2680]] ordained, [[G2680]] the [[G3588]] priests [[G2409]] went [[G1524]] always [[G1275]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] tabernacle, [[G4633]] accomplishing [[G2005]] the [[G3588]] service [[G2999]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] alone [[G3441]] once [[G530]]  every [[G3588]] year, [[G1763]] not [[G3756]] without [[G5565]] blood, [[G129]] which [[G3739]] he offered [[G4374]] for [[G5228]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] errors [[G51]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people: [[G2992]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] this [[G5124]] signifying, that [[G1213]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] the [[G3588]] into of all [[G39]] holiest [[G39]] not yet [[G3380]] was made [[G5319]] manifest, [[G5319]] while as [[G2089]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] tabernacle [[G4633]] was [[G2192]] yet [[G2089]] standing: [[G4714]]

### 9
Which [[G3748]] a figure [[G3850]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] then [[G1764]] present, [[G1764]] in [[G2596]] which [[G3739]] were offered [[G4374]] both [[G5037]] gifts [[G1435]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices, [[G2378]] that [[G3361]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] make [[G5048]] the [[G3588]] him that did [[G3000]] service [[G3000]] perfect, [[G5048]] as pertaining to [[G2596]] the conscience; [[G4893]]

### 10
only [[G3440]] in [[G1909]] meats [[G1033]] and [[G2532]] drinks, [[G4188]] and [[G2532]] divers [[G1313]] washings, [[G909]] and [[G2532]] carnal [[G4561]] ordinances, [[G1345]] imposed [[G1945]] until [[G3360]] the time [[G2540]] of reformation. [[G1357]]

### 11
But [[G1161]] Christ [[G5547]] being come [[G3854]] an high priest [[G749]] of good things [[G18]] to come, [[G3195]] by [[G1223]] a [[G4633]] greater [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] more perfect [[G5046]] tabernacle, [[G4633]] not [[G3756]] made with hands, [[G5499]] that [[G5124]] is to say, [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] of [[G3778]] this [[G3778]] building; [[G2937]]

### 12
Neither [[G3761]] by [[G1223]] the blood [[G129]] of goats [[G5131]] and [[G2532]] calves, [[G3448]] but [[G1161]] by [[G1223]] his own [[G2398]] blood [[G129]] he entered in [[G1525]] once [[G2178]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] holy place, [[G39]] having obtained [[G2147]] eternal [[G166]] redemption [[G3085]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of bulls [[G5022]] and [[G2532]] of goats, [[G5131]] and [[G2532]] the ashes [[G4700]] of an heifer [[G1151]] sprinkling [[G4472]] the [[G3588]] unclean, [[G2840]] sanctifieth [[G37]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] purifying [[G2514]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4561]] flesh: [[G4561]]

### 14
How much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] the [[G3588]] shall [[G2511]] blood [[G129]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3739]] through [[G1223]] the [[G4151]] eternal [[G166]] Spirit [[G4151]] offered [[G4374]] himself [[G1438]] without spot [[G299]] to [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] purge [[G2511]] your [[G5216]] conscience [[G4893]] from [[G575]] dead [[G3498]] works [[G2041]] to [[G1519]] serve [[G3000]] the [[G3000]] living [[G2198]] God? [[G2316]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] this cause [[G5124]] he is [[G2076]] the mediator [[G3316]] of the [[G1242]] new [[G2537]] testament, [[G1242]] that [[G3704]] by means [[G1096]] of death, [[G2288]] for [[G1519]] the redemption [[G629]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3847]] transgressions [[G3847]] under [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] testament, [[G1242]] they might [[G2983]] which are called [[G2564]] receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of [[G2817]] eternal [[G166]] inheritance. [[G2817]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] where [[G3699]] a testament [[G1242]] there must also of necessity [[G318]] be [[G5342]] the death [[G2288]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1303]] testator. [[G1303]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] a testament [[G1242]] of force [[G949]] after [[G1909]] men are dead: [[G3498]] otherwise [[G1893]] no all [[G3379]] it is of strength [[G2480]] at [[G3379]] while [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] testator [[G1303]] liveth. [[G2198]]

### 18
Whereupon [[G3606]] neither [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] was dedicated [[G1457]] without [[G5565]] blood. [[G129]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] when [[G5259]] Moses [[G3475]] had spoken [[G2980]] every [[G3956]] precept [[G1785]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] according to [[G2596]] the law, [[G3551]] he took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of [[G3448]] calves [[G3448]] and [[G2532]] of goats, [[G5131]] with [[G3326]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] scarlet [[G2847]] wool, [[G2053]] and [[G2532]] hyssop, [[G5301]] and sprinkled [[G4472]] both [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]]

### 20
Saying, [[G3004]] This [[G5124]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1242]] testament [[G1242]] which [[G3739]] God hath [[G2316]] enjoined [[G1781]] unto [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 21
Moreover [[G3668]] he sprinkled [[G4472]]  with [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] both [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle, [[G4633]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] vessels [[G4632]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3009]] ministry. [[G3009]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] almost [[G4975]] all things [[G3956]] are [[G2511]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] purged [[G2511]] with [[G1722]] blood; [[G129]] and [[G2532]] without [[G5565]] shedding of blood [[G130]] is [[G1096]] no [[G3756]] remission. [[G859]]

### 23
therefore [[G3767]] necessary that [[G318]] the [[G3588]] patterns [[G5262]] things [[G3588]] of [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] should be purified [[G2511]] with these; [[G5125]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] heavenly things [[G2032]] themselves [[G846]] better [[G2909]] with [[G2378]] sacrifices [[G2378]] than [[G3844]] these. [[G3778]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] Christ [[G5547]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1525]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the holy places [[G39]] made with hands, [[G5499]] the figures [[G499]] the [[G3588]] of [[G228]] true; [[G228]] but [[G235]] into [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] itself, [[G846]] now [[G3568]] to appear [[G1718]] in the [[G3588]] presence [[G4383]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] us: [[G2257]]

### 25
Nor yet [[G3761]] that [[G2443]] he should offer [[G4374]] himself [[G1438]] often, [[G4178]] as [[G5618]] the high [[G3588]] priest [[G749]] entereth [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] holy place [[G39]] every [[G2596]] year [[G1763]] with [[G1722]] blood [[G129]] of others; [[G245]]

### 26
For then [[G1893]] must [[G1163]] he [[G846]] often [[G4178]] have suffered [[G3958]] since [[G575]] the foundation [[G2602]] of the world: [[G2889]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] once [[G530]] in [[G1909]] the end [[G4930]] the [[G3588]] of [[G165]] world [[G165]] hath he appeared [[G5319]] to [[G1519]] put away [[G115]] sin [[G266]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] sacrifice [[G2378]] of himself. [[G846]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] as [[G2596]]  it is [[G3745]] appointed [[G606]]  unto [[G3588]] men [[G444]] once [[G530]] to die, [[G599]] but [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] this [[G5124]] the judgment: [[G2920]]

### 28
So [[G3779]] Christ [[G5547]] once [[G530]] was [[G4374]] offered [[G4374]] to [[G1519]] bear [[G399]] the sins [[G266]] of many; [[G4183]] and unto them that look for [[G553]] him [[G846]] shall he appear [[G3700]] the [[G1537]] second time [[G1208]] without [[G5565]] sin [[G266]] unto [[G1519]] salvation.
