[[Hebrews 1|←]] • [[Hebrews 3|→]]

### 1
Therefore [[G1223]] we [[G2248]] ought [[G1163]] to give heed [[G4337]] the more earnest [[G4056]] the [[G3588]] to things which we have [[G191]] heard, [[G191]] lest at any time [[G3379]] we should let slip. [[G3901]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] spoken [[G2980]] by [[G1223]] angels [[G32]] was [[G1096]] stedfast, [[G949]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] transgression [[G3847]] and [[G2532]] disobedience [[G3876]] received [[G2983]] just [[G1738]] a recompence of [[G3405]] reward; [[G3405]]

### 3
How [[G4459]] we [[G2249]] shall [[G1628]] escape, [[G1628]] if we neglect [[G272]] so great [[G5082]] salvation; [[G4991]] which [[G3748]] the first [[G746]] at [[G2983]] began [[G2983]] to be spoken [[G2980]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and was confirmed [[G950]] unto [[G1519]] us [[G2248]] by [[G5259]] them that heard [[G191]]

### 4
God [[G2316]] also witness, [[G4901]] bearing [[G4901]] both [[G5037]] with signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders, [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] with divers [[G4164]] miracles, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] gifts [[G3311]] of the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] according to [[G2596]] his own [[G846]] will? [[G2308]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] unto the angels [[G32]] not [[G3756]] hath he put in [[G5293]] subjection [[G5293]] the [[G3588]] world to [[G3625]] come, [[G3195]] whereof [[G4012]] we speak. [[G2980]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] in a certain place [[G4225]] testified, [[G1263]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] man, [[G444]] that [[G3754]] thou art mindful [[G3403]] of him? [[G846]] or [[G2228]] the son [[G5207]] of man, [[G444]] that [[G3754]] thou visitest [[G1980]] him? [[G846]]

### 7
Thou madest lower [[G1642]] him [[G846]] a little [[G1024]] than [[G3844]] the angels; [[G32]] thou crownedst [[G4737]] him [[G846]] with glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honour, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] didst set [[G2525]] him [[G846]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of [[G5495]] thy [[G4675]] hands: [[G5495]]

### 8
all things [[G3956]] Thou hast put in [[G5293]] subjection [[G5293]] under [[G5270]] his [[G846]] feet. [[G4228]] For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] that [[G3588]] he put in under [[G5293]] all [[G3956]] subjection [[G5293]] him, [[G846]] he left [[G863]] nothing [[G3762]] not put under [[G506]] him. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] we see [[G3708]] not yet [[G3768]] all things [[G3956]] put under [[G5293]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] we see [[G991]] Jesus, who [[G2424]] was made lower [[G1642]] a little [[G1024]] than [[G3844]] the angels [[G32]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] suffering [[G3804]] of [[G2288]] death, [[G2288]] crowned [[G4737]] with glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honour; [[G5092]] that [[G3704]] by the grace [[G5485]] he should [[G1089]] of God [[G2316]] taste [[G1089]] death [[G2288]] for [[G5228]] every man. [[G3956]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] it became [[G4241]] him, [[G846]] for [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] all things, [[G3956]] in bringing [[G71]] many [[G4183]] sons [[G5207]] unto [[G1519]] glory, [[G1391]] the [[G3588]] to make [[G5048]] captain [[G747]] of [[G4991]] their [[G846]] salvation [[G4991]] perfect [[G5048]] through [[G1223]] sufferings. [[G3804]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] both [[G5037]] he that sanctifieth [[G37]] and [[G2532]] they who are sanctified [[G37]] all [[G3956]] of [[G1537]] one: [[G1520]] for [[G1223]] which [[G3739]] cause [[G156]] not [[G3756]] he is [[G1870]] ashamed [[G1870]] to call [[G2564]] them [[G846]] brethren, [[G80]]

### 12
Saying, [[G3004]] I will declare [[G518]] thy [[G4675]] name [[G3686]] unto [[G80]] my [[G3450]] brethren, [[G80]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of the church [[G1577]] will I sing praise unto [[G5214]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] I [[G1473]] will [[G2071]] put my trust [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] Behold [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] children [[G3813]] which [[G3739]] God hath [[G2316]] given [[G1325]] me. [[G3427]]

### 14
Forasmuch as [[G1893]] then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] children [[G3813]] are partakers [[G2841]] of flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]] also [[G2532]] he took [[G3348]] himself [[G846]] likewise [[G3898]] part [[G3348]] the [[G3588]] of [[G846]] same; [[G846]] that [[G2443]] through [[G1223]] death [[G2288]] he might destroy [[G2673]] him that had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] power [[G2904]] of [[G2288]] death, [[G2288]] that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] devil; [[G1228]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] deliver [[G525]] them [[G5128]] who [[G3745]] through fear [[G5401]] of death [[G2288]] were [[G2258]] all [[G3956]] their [[G3588]] lifetime [[G2198]] subject [[G1777]] to [[G1397]] bondage. [[G1397]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] verily [[G1222]] he took on [[G1949]] not [[G3756]] angels; [[G32]] but [[G235]] he took on [[G1949]] the seed of [[G4690]] Abraham. [[G11]]

### 17
Wherefore [[G3606]] in [[G2596]] all things [[G3956]] it behoved him [[G3784]] to be made like [[G3666]] unto [[G80]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G2443]] he might be [[G1096]] merciful [[G1655]] a high [[G749]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] priest [[G749]] in things to [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] to [[G1519]] make reconciliation for [[G2433]] the [[G3588]] sins [[G266]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people. [[G2992]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] that [[G3739]] he hath [[G3958]] himself [[G846]] suffered [[G3958]] being tempted, [[G3985]] he is able [[G1410]] to succour [[G997]] them that are tempted. [[G3985]]
