### 1
God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] at sundry times [[G4181]] and [[G2532]] in divers manners [[G4187]] spake [[G2980]] in time past [[G3819]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3962]] fathers [[G3962]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]]

### 2
in [[G1909]] Hath [[G2980]] these [[G3778]] last [[G2078]] days [[G2250]] spoken [[G2980]] unto us [[G2254]] by [[G1722]] Son, [[G5207]] whom [[G3739]] he hath appointed [[G5087]] heir [[G2818]] of all things, [[G3956]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] he made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] worlds; [[G165]]

### 3
Who [[G3739]] being [[G5607]] the brightness [[G541]] of [[G1391]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] the express image [[G5481]] of [[G5287]] his [[G846]] person, [[G5287]] and [[G5037]] upholding [[G5342]] all things [[G3956]] by the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] of [[G1411]] his [[G846]] power, [[G1411]] when he had [[G4160]] by [[G1223]] himself [[G1438]] purged [[G2512]] our [[G2257]] sins, [[G266]] sat down [[G2523]] on [[G1722]] the right hand [[G1188]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3172]] Majesty [[G3172]] on [[G1722]] high; [[G5308]]

### 4
Being made [[G1096]] so much [[G5118]] better [[G2909]] the [[G3588]] than [[G32]] angels, [[G32]] as [[G3745]] he hath by inheritance obtained [[G2816]] a more excellent [[G1313]] name [[G3686]] than [[G3844]] they. [[G846]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] unto which [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] of [[G32]] angels [[G32]] said he [[G2036]] at any time, [[G4218]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] my [[G3450]] Son, [[G5207]] this day [[G4594]] I [[G1473]] have [[G1080]] begotten [[G1080]] thee? [[G4571]] And [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] I [[G1473]] will be [[G2071]] to [[G1519]] him [[G846]] a Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] shall be [[G2071]] to [[G1519]] me [[G3427]] a Son? [[G5207]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] again, [[G3825]] when [[G3752]] he bringeth in [[G1521]] the [[G3588]] firstbegotten [[G4416]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G3625]] he saith, [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] let [[G4352]] all [[G3956]] the angels [[G32]] of God [[G2316]] worship [[G4352]] him. [[G846]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] of [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] he [[G3004]] saith, [[G3004]] Who [[G3588]] maketh [[G4160]] his [[G846]] angels [[G32]] spirits, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] ministers [[G3011]] a flame [[G5395]] of fire. [[G4442]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] Thy [[G4675]] throne, [[G2362]] O [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and ever: [[G165]] a [[G3588]] sceptre [[G4464]] of righteousness [[G2118]] the [[G3588]] sceptre [[G4464]] of [[G932]] thy [[G4675]] kingdom. [[G932]]

### 9
Thou hast loved [[G25]] righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] hated [[G3404]] iniquity; [[G458]] therefore [[G1223]] God, [[G2316]] thy [[G4675]] God, [[G2316]] hath anointed [[G5548]] thee [[G4571]] with the oil [[G1637]] of gladness [[G20]] above [[G3844]] thy [[G4675]] fellows. [[G3353]]

### 10
And, [[G2532]] Thou, [[G4771]] Lord, [[G2962]] in [[G2596]] the beginning [[G746]] hast laid the foundation [[G2311]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth; [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] are [[G1526]] the works [[G2041]] of [[G5495]] thine [[G4675]] hands: [[G5495]]

### 11
They [[G846]] shall perish; [[G622]] but [[G1161]] thou [[G4771]] remainest; [[G1265]] and [[G2532]] they all [[G3956]] shall wax old [[G3822]] as doth [[G5613]] a garment; [[G2440]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] as [[G5616]] a vesture [[G4018]] shalt thou fold up, [[G1667]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they shall be changed: [[G236]] but [[G1161]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] same, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] years [[G2094]] shall [[G1587]] not [[G3756]] fail. [[G1587]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] to [[G4314]] which [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] of [[G32]] angels [[G32]] said he [[G2046]] at any time, [[G4218]] Sit [[G2521]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] right hand, [[G1188]] until [[G2193]] I make [[G5087]] thine [[G4675]] enemies [[G2190]] thy [[G4675]] footstool? [[G5286]]

### 14
Are they [[G1526]] not [[G3780]] all [[G3956]] ministering [[G3010]] spirits, [[G4151]] sent forth [[G649]] to [[G1519]] minister [[G1248]] for [[G1223]] them who [[G3588]] shall be [[G3195]] heirs [[G2816]] of salvation? [[G4991]]
