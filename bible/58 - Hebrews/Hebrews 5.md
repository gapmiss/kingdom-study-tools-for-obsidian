### 1
For [[G1063]] every [[G3956]] high priest [[G749]] taken [[G2983]] from among [[G1537]] men [[G444]] is ordained in [[G2525]] for [[G5228]] men [[G444]] things [[G3588]] to [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] he may offer [[G4374]] both [[G5037]] gifts [[G1435]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices [[G2378]] for [[G5228]] sins: [[G266]]

### 2
Who can [[G1410]] have compassion on on [[G3356]] the [[G3588]] ignorant, [[G50]] and [[G2532]] them that are out of the way; [[G4105]] for that [[G1893]] himself [[G846]] he is compassed [[G4029]] also [[G2532]] with [[G4029]] infirmity. [[G769]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] by reason [[G1223]] hereof [[G5026]] he ought, [[G3784]] as [[G2531]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] for [[G4012]] himself, [[G1438]] to offer [[G4374]] for [[G5228]] sins. [[G266]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] man [[G5100]] taketh [[G2983]] this [[G3588]] honour [[G5092]] unto himself, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] he [[G3588]] that is called [[G2564]] of [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]] as [[G2509]] Aaron. [[G2]]

### 5
So [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] glorified [[G1392]] not [[G3756]] himself [[G1438]] to be made [[G1096]] an high priest; [[G749]] but [[G235]] he [[G3588]] that said [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] my [[G3450]] Son, [[G5207]] to day [[G4594]] I [[G1473]] have [[G1080]] begotten [[G1080]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 6
As [[G2531]] he saith [[G3004]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] another [[G2087]] Thou [[G4771]] a priest [[G2409]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G3588]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchisedec. [[G3198]]

### 7
Who [[G3739]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of [[G4561]] his [[G846]] flesh, [[G4561]] when he had offered up [[G4374]] prayers [[G1162]] and [[G2532]] supplications [[G2428]] with [[G3326]] strong [[G2478]] crying [[G2906]] and [[G2532]] tears [[G1144]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G3588]] that was able [[G1410]] to save [[G4982]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] was heard [[G1522]] in [[G575]] that [[G3588]] he feared; [[G2124]]

### 8
Though yet [[G2539]] he were [[G5607]] a Son, [[G5207]] learned he [[G3129]] obedience [[G5218]] by [[G575]] the things which [[G3739]] he suffered; [[G3958]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] being made perfect, [[G5048]] he became [[G1096]] the author [[G159]] of [[G4991]] eternal [[G166]] salvation [[G4991]] unto all [[G3956]] them that obey [[G5219]] him; [[G846]]

### 10
Called [[G4316]] of [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] an high priest [[G749]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchisedec. [[G3198]]

### 11
Of [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] we have [[G2254]] many [[G4183]] things [[G3588]] to say, [[G3004]] and [[G2532]] hard to be uttered, [[G1421]] seeing [[G1893]] ye are [[G1096]] dull [[G3576]] of [[G189]] hearing. [[G189]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] when [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] ye ought [[G3784]] to be [[G1511]] teachers, [[G1320]] ye have [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] that one [[G5101]] teach [[G1321]] you [[G5209]] again [[G3825]] which [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] first [[G746]] principles [[G4747]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3051]] oracles [[G3051]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] are become [[G1096]] such as have [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] of milk, [[G1051]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] strong [[G4731]] of [[G5160]] meat. [[G5160]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] every one [[G3956]] that useth [[G3348]] milk [[G1051]] unskilful [[G552]] in the word [[G3056]] of righteousness: [[G1343]] for [[G1063]] he is [[G2076]] a babe. [[G3516]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] strong [[G4731]] meat [[G5160]] belongeth [[G2076]] to them that are of full age, [[G5046]] those who [[G2192]] by reason of [[G1223]] use [[G1838]] have [[G2192]] their [[G3588]] senses [[G145]] exercised [[G1128]] to [[G4314]] discern [[G1253]] both [[G5037]] good [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] evil.
