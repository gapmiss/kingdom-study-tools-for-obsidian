### 1
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] Melchisedec, [[G3198]] king [[G935]] of Salem, [[G4532]] priest [[G2409]] the [[G3588]] of most [[G5310]] high [[G5310]] God, [[G2316]] who met [[G4876]] Abraham [[G11]] returning [[G5290]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] slaughter [[G2871]] the [[G3588]] of [[G935]] kings, [[G935]] and [[G2532]] blessed [[G2127]] him; [[G846]]

### 2
To whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] Abraham [[G11]] gave [[G3307]] a tenth part [[G1181]] of [[G575]] all; [[G3956]] first [[G4412]] being by interpretation [[G2059]] King [[G935]] of righteousness, [[G1343]] and [[G1161]] after that [[G1899]] also [[G2532]] King [[G935]] of Salem, [[G4532]] which [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] King [[G935]] of peace; [[G1515]]

### 3
Without father, [[G540]] without mother, [[G282]] without descent, [[G35]] having [[G2192]] neither [[G3383]] beginning [[G746]] of days, [[G2250]] nor [[G3383]] end [[G5056]] of life; [[G2222]] but [[G1161]] made like [[G871]] unto [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] abideth [[G3306]] a priest [[G2409]] continually. [[G1336]]

### 4
Now [[G1161]] consider [[G2334]] how great [[G4080]] this man [[G3778]] unto whom [[G3739]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] patriarch [[G3966]] Abraham [[G11]] gave [[G1325]] the tenth [[G1181]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] spoils. [[G205]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] verily [[G3303]] they [[G3588]] that are [[G3588]] of [[G1537]] who [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Levi, [[G3017]] receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] office of the priesthood, [[G2405]] have [[G2192]] a commandment [[G1785]] to take tithes of [[G586]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] of [[G846]] their [[G846]] brethren, [[G80]] though [[G2539]] they come out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] loins [[G3751]] of Abraham: [[G11]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] not [[G3361]] he whose descent is [[G1075]] counted [[G1075]] from [[G1537]] them [[G846]] received tithes [[G1183]] of Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] blessed [[G2127]] him [[G3588]] that had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] promises. [[G1860]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] without [[G5565]] all [[G3956]] contradiction [[G485]] the [[G3588]] less [[G1640]] is blessed [[G2127]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] better. [[G2909]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] here [[G5602]] men [[G444]] that die [[G599]] receive [[G2983]] tithes; [[G1181]] but [[G1161]] there [[G1563]] he of whom it is witnessed [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] he liveth. [[G2198]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] so [[G2031]] I may [[G2036]] say, [[G2036]] Levi [[G3017]] also, [[G2532]] who receiveth [[G2983]] tithes, [[G1181]] payed tithes [[G1183]] in [[G1223]] Abraham. [[G11]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] he was [[G2258]] yet [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] loins [[G3751]]  of his [[G3588]] father, [[G3962]] when [[G3753]] Melchisedec [[G3198]] met [[G4876]] him. [[G846]]

### 11
If [[G1487]]  therefore [[G3303]] perfection [[G5050]] were [[G2258]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Levitical [[G3020]] priesthood, [[G2420]] (for [[G1063]] under [[G1909]] it [[G846]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] received the law,) [[G3549]] what [[G5101]] further [[G2089]] need [[G5532]] another [[G2087]] that should [[G450]] priest [[G2409]] rise [[G450]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchisedec, [[G3198]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] be called [[G3004]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Aaron? [[G2]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] priesthood [[G2420]] being changed, [[G3346]] there is made [[G1096]] of [[G1537]] necessity [[G318]] a change [[G3331]] also [[G2532]] of the law. [[G3551]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] of [[G1909]] he [[G3348]] whom [[G3739]] these things [[G5023]] are spoken [[G3004]] pertaineth [[G3348]] to [[G5443]] another [[G2087]] tribe, [[G5443]] of [[G575]] which [[G3739]] no man [[G3762]] gave attendance [[G4337]] the [[G3588]] at [[G2379]] altar. [[G2379]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] evident [[G4271]] that [[G3754]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] sprang [[G393]] out of [[G1537]] Juda; [[G2448]] of [[G1519]] which [[G3739]] tribe [[G5443]] Moses [[G3475]] spake [[G2980]] nothing [[G3762]] concerning [[G4012]] priesthood. [[G2420]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] it is [[G2076]] yet [[G2089]] far more [[G4054]] evident: [[G2612]] for that [[G1487]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] similitude [[G3665]] of Melchisedec [[G3198]] there ariseth [[G450]] another [[G2087]] priest, [[G2409]]

### 16
Who [[G3739]] is made, [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] after [[G2596]] the law [[G3551]] of a [[G1785]] carnal [[G4559]] commandment, [[G1785]] but [[G235]] after [[G2596]] the power [[G1411]] of an [[G2222]] endless [[G179]] life. [[G2222]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] he testifieth, [[G3140]] Thou [[G4771]] a priest [[G2409]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G3588]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchisedec. [[G3198]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] there is [[G1096]] verily [[G3303]] a disannulling [[G115]] of the commandment [[G1785]] going before [[G4254]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] weakness [[G772]] and [[G2532]] unprofitableness [[G512]] thereof. [[G846]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] made perfect, [[G5048]] nothing [[G3762]] but [[G1161]] the bringing in [[G1898]] better [[G2909]] of a [[G1680]] hope [[G1680]] by [[G1223]] the which [[G3739]] we draw nigh [[G1448]] unto [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] inasmuch [[G2596]] as [[G3745]] not [[G3756]] without [[G5565]] an oath [[G3728]]

### 21
(For [[G1063]] those [[G3588]] priests [[G2409]] were [[G1526]] made [[G1096]] without [[G5565]] an oath; [[G3728]] but [[G1161]] this [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] an oath [[G3728]] by [[G1223]] him [[G3588]] that said [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] The Lord [[G2962]] sware [[G3660]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] will [[G3338]] repent, [[G3338]] Thou [[G4771]] a priest [[G2409]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchisedec:) [[G3198]]

### 22
By [[G2596]] so much [[G5118]] was [[G1096]] Jesus [[G2424]] made [[G1096]] a surety [[G1450]] better [[G2909]] of a [[G1242]] testament. [[G1242]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] truly [[G3303]] were [[G1526]] many [[G4119]] priests, [[G2409]] because [[G1223]] they were not suffered [[G2967]] to continue [[G3887]] by reason of death: [[G2288]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] this [[G3588]] because [[G1223]] he [[G846]] continueth [[G3306]] ever, [[G165]] hath [[G2192]] an [[G531]] unchangeable [[G531]] priesthood. [[G2420]]

### 25
Wherefore [[G3606]] he is able [[G1410]] also [[G2532]] to save [[G4982]] the [[G3588]] them [[G4982]] to [[G1519]] unto [[G2316]] that [[G3588]] uttermost [[G3838]] come [[G4334]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] him, [[G846]] ever [[G3842]] seeing he [[G2198]] liveth [[G2198]] to [[G1519]] make intercession [[G1793]] for [[G5228]] them. [[G846]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] such [[G5108]] an high priest [[G749]] became [[G4241]] us, [[G2254]] holy, [[G3741]] harmless, [[G172]] undefiled, [[G283]] separate [[G5563]] from [[G575]] sinners, [[G268]] and [[G2532]] made [[G1096]] higher [[G5308]] the [[G3588]] than [[G3772]] heavens; [[G3772]]

### 27
Who [[G3739]] needeth [[G318]] not [[G3756]] daily, [[G2250]] as [[G5618]] those high [[G3588]] priests, [[G749]] to offer up [[G399]] sacrifice, [[G2378]] first [[G4386]] for [[G5228]] his own [[G2398]] sins, [[G266]] and then [[G1899]] for the [[G3588]] people's: [[G2992]] for [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] he did [[G4160]] once, [[G2178]] when he offered up [[G399]] himself. [[G1438]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] maketh [[G2525]] men [[G444]] high priests [[G749]] which have [[G2192]] infirmity; [[G769]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3728]] oath, [[G3728]] which was [[G3588]] since [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] law, [[G3551]] the Son, [[G5207]] who is consecrated [[G5048]] for [[G1519]] evermore.
