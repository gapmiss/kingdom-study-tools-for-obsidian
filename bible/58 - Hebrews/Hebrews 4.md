### 1
Let us [[G5399]] therefore [[G3767]] fear, [[G5399]] lest, [[G3379]] a promise [[G1860]] being left [[G2641]] of entering [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] rest, [[G2663]] any [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] should seem [[G1380]] to come short of it. [[G5302]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] us was [[G2070]] unto the gospel [[G2097]] preached, [[G2097]] as well as [[G2509]] unto them: [[G2548]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] preached [[G189]] not [[G3756]] did [[G5623]] profit [[G5623]] them, [[G1565]] not [[G3361]] being mixed with [[G4786]] faith [[G4102]] in them that [[G3588]] heard [[G191]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] we do [[G1525]] which have believed [[G4100]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] rest, [[G2663]] as [[G2531]] he said, [[G2046]] As [[G5613]] I have sworn [[G3660]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] wrath, [[G3709]] if [[G1487]] they shall enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] rest: [[G2663]] although [[G2543]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] were finished [[G1096]] from [[G575]] the foundation [[G2602]] of the world. [[G2889]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] he spake [[G2046]] in a certain place [[G4225]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] on this wise, [[G3779]] And [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] did rest [[G2664]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] day [[G2250]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] works. [[G2041]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] again, [[G3825]] If [[G1487]] they shall enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] rest. [[G2663]]

### 6
Seeing [[G1893]] therefore [[G3767]] it remaineth [[G620]] that some [[G5100]] must enter [[G1525]] therein, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they to whom it was [[G2097]] first [[G4386]] preached [[G2097]] entered in [[G1525]] not [[G3756]] because of [[G1223]] unbelief: [[G543]]

### 7
Again, [[G3825]] he limiteth [[G3724]] a certain [[G5100]] day, [[G2250]] saying [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] David, [[G1138]] To day, [[G4594]] after [[G3326]] so long [[G5118]] a time; [[G5550]] as [[G2531]] it is said, [[G2046]] To day [[G4594]] if [[G1437]] ye will hear [[G191]] his [[G846]] voice, [[G5456]] harden [[G4645]] not [[G3361]] your [[G5216]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] Jesus [[G2424]] them [[G846]] had given [[G2664]] rest, [[G2664]] not [[G3756]] then [[G302]] would he have [[G2980]] afterward [[G3326]] spoken [[G2980]] of [[G4012]] another [[G243]] day. [[G2250]]

### 9
There remaineth [[G620]] therefore [[G686]] a rest [[G4520]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] he that [[G3588]] is entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] rest, [[G2663]] he [[G846]] also [[G2532]] hath ceased [[G2664]] from [[G575]] his own [[G2398]] works, [[G2041]] as [[G5618]] God [[G2316]] from [[G575]] his. [[G846]]

### 11
Let us labour [[G4704]] therefore [[G3767]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] that [[G1565]] rest, [[G2663]] lest [[G3361]] any man [[G5100]] fall [[G4098]] after [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] example [[G5262]] of [[G543]] unbelief. [[G543]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] quick, [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] powerful, [[G1756]] and [[G2532]] sharper [[G5114]] than [[G5228]] any [[G3956]] twoedged [[G1366]] sword, [[G3162]] piercing [[G1338]] even [[G2532]] to [[G891]] the dividing asunder [[G3311]] of soul [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G5037]] of the joints [[G719]] and [[G2532]] marrow, [[G3452]] and [[G2532]] a discerner [[G2924]] of the thoughts [[G1761]] and [[G2532]] intents [[G1771]] of the heart. [[G2588]]

### 13
Neither [[G2532]]  there [[G3756]] is [[G2076]] any creature [[G2937]] that is not manifest [[G852]] in [[G1799]] his [[G846]] sight: [[G1799]] but [[G1161]] all things [[G3956]] naked [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] opened [[G5136]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3788]] eyes [[G3788]] of him [[G846]] with [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] we have [[G2254]]  to do. [[G3588]]

### 14
Seeing then [[G3767]] that we have [[G2192]] a high [[G749]] great [[G3173]] priest, [[G749]] that is passed into [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] heavens, [[G3772]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] let us hold fast [[G2902]] profession. [[G3671]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] we have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] an high priest which [[G749]] cannot [[G1410]] be touched with the feeling of [[G4834]] our [[G2257]] infirmities; [[G769]] but [[G1161]] was [[G3985]] in [[G2596]] all points [[G3956]] tempted [[G3985]] like [[G3665]] as [[G2596]] without [[G5565]] sin. [[G266]]

### 16
Let us [[G4334]] therefore [[G3767]] come [[G4334]] boldly [[G3954]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2362]] throne [[G2362]] of [[G5485]] grace, [[G5485]] that [[G2443]] we may obtain [[G2983]] mercy, [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] grace [[G5485]] to [[G1519]] help [[G996]] in time of need. [[G2121]]
