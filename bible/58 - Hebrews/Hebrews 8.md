### 1
Now [[G1161]] of [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] things which we have spoken [[G3004]] the sum: [[G2774]] We have [[G2192]] such [[G5108]] an high priest, [[G749]] who [[G3739]] is set [[G2523]] on [[G1722]] the right hand [[G1188]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2362]] throne [[G2362]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3172]] Majesty [[G3172]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavens; [[G3772]]

### 2
A minister [[G3011]] the [[G3588]] of [[G39]] sanctuary, [[G39]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G228]] true [[G228]] tabernacle, [[G4633]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] pitched, [[G4078]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] man. [[G444]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] every [[G3956]] high priest [[G749]] is ordained [[G2525]] to [[G1519]] offer [[G4374]] gifts [[G1435]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices: [[G2378]] wherefore [[G3606]] of necessity [[G316]] that [[G3739]] this man [[G5126]] have [[G2192]] somewhat [[G5100]] also [[G2532]] to offer. [[G4374]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] he were [[G2258]] on [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] not [[G3761]] he should [[G2258]] be [[G2258]] a priest, [[G2409]] seeing that there are [[G5607]] priests [[G2409]] that [[G3588]] offer [[G4374]] gifts [[G1435]] according [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3551]] law: [[G3551]]

### 5
Who [[G3748]] serve [[G3000]] unto the example [[G5262]] and [[G2532]] shadow [[G4639]] of heavenly things, [[G2032]] as [[G2531]] Moses [[G3475]] was admonished of God [[G5537]] when he was about [[G3195]] to make [[G2005]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle: [[G4633]] for, [[G1063]] See, [[G3708]] saith he, [[G5346]] thou make [[G4160]] all things [[G3956]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] pattern [[G5179]] shewed [[G1166]] to thee [[G4671]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mount. [[G3735]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] hath he obtained a [[G5177]] more excellent [[G1313]] ministry, [[G3009]] by how much [[G3745]] also [[G2532]] he is [[G2076]] the mediator [[G3316]] of a better [[G2909]] covenant, [[G1242]] which [[G3748]] was established [[G3549]] upon [[G1909]] better [[G2909]] promises. [[G1860]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] that [[G1565]] first [[G4413]] had been [[G2258]] faultless, [[G273]] then should no [[G3756]] place [[G5117]] have been sought [[G2212]] for the second. [[G1208]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] finding fault [[G3201]] with them, [[G846]] he saith, [[G3004]] Behold, [[G2400]] the days [[G2250]] come, [[G2064]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord, [[G2962]] when [[G2532]] I will make [[G4931]] a [[G1242]] new [[G2537]] covenant [[G1242]] with [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Israel [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Judah: [[G2448]]

### 9
Not [[G3756]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] that [[G3739]] I made [[G4160]] with their [[G846]] fathers [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] when [[G1949]] I [[G3450]] took [[G1949]] them [[G846]] by the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] to lead out [[G1806]] them [[G846]] of [[G1537]] the land [[G1093]] of Egypt; [[G125]] because [[G3754]] they [[G846]] continued [[G1696]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] covenant, [[G1242]] and I [[G2504]] regarded not, [[G272]] them [[G846]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 10
For [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] that [[G3739]] I will make [[G1303]] with the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Israel [[G2474]] after [[G3326]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord; [[G2962]] put [[G1325]] I will [[G1924]] my [[G3450]] laws [[G3551]] into [[G1519]] their [[G846]] mind, [[G1271]] and [[G2532]] write [[G1924]] them [[G846]] in [[G1909]] their [[G846]] hearts: [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] I will be [[G2071]] to them [[G846]] a [[G1519]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] shall be [[G2071]] to me [[G3427]] a [[G1519]] people: [[G2992]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] they shall [[G1321]] teach [[G1321]] every man [[G1538]] his [[G846]] neighbour, [[G4139]] and [[G2532]] every man [[G1538]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] saying, [[G3004]] Know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Lord: [[G2962]] for [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] shall know [[G1492]] me, [[G3165]] from [[G575]] the least [[G3398]] to [[G2193]] the greatest. [[G3173]]

### 12
For [[G3754]] I will be [[G2071]] merciful [[G2436]] to [[G93]] their [[G846]] unrighteousness, [[G93]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] sins [[G266]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] iniquities [[G458]] will I remember [[G3415]] no [[G3756]] more. [[G2089]]

### 13
In [[G1722]] he [[G3588]] that [[G3004]] saith, [[G3004]] A new [[G2537]] he hath made [[G3822]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] old. [[G3822]] Now [[G1161]] that which [[G3588]] decayeth [[G3822]] and [[G2532]] waxeth old [[G1095]] ready [[G1451]] to vanish away. [[G854]]
