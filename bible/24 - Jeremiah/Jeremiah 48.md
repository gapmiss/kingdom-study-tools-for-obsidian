### 1
Against Moab [[H4124]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Woe [[H1945]] unto [[H413]] Nebo! [[H5015]] for [[H3588]] it is spoiled: [[H7703]] Kiriathaim [[H7156]] is confounded [[H3001]] taken: [[H3920]] Misgab [[H4869]] is confounded [[H3001]] and dismayed. [[H2865]]

### 2
no [[H369]] more [[H5750]] praise [[H8416]] of Moab: [[H4124]] in Heshbon [[H2809]] they have devised [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] it; come, [[H1980]] and let us cut it off [[H3772]] from a nation. [[H1471]] Also [[H1571]] thou shalt be cut down, [[H1826]] O Madmen; [[H4086]] the sword [[H2719]] shall pursue [[H1980]] thee. [[H310]]

### 3
A voice [[H6963]] of crying [[H6818]] from Horonaim, [[H2773]] spoiling [[H7701]] and great [[H1419]] destruction. [[H7667]]

### 4
Moab [[H4124]] is destroyed; [[H7665]] her little ones [[H6810]] have caused a cry [[H2201]] to be heard. [[H8085]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] in the going up [[H4608]] of Luhith [[H3872]] continual [[H1065]] weeping [[H1065]] shall go up; [[H5927]] for [[H3588]] in the going down [[H4174]] of Horonaim [[H2773]] the enemies [[H6862]] have heard [[H8085]] a cry [[H6818]] of destruction. [[H7667]]

### 6
Flee, [[H5127]] save [[H4422]] your lives, [[H5315]] and be [[H1961]] like the heath [[H6176]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] because [[H3282]] thou hast trusted [[H982]] in thy works [[H4639]] and in thy treasures, [[H214]] thou [[H859]] shalt also [[H1571]] be taken: [[H3920]] and Chemosh [[H3645]] shall go forth [[H3318]] into captivity [[H1473]] his priests [[H3548]] and his princes [[H8269]] together. [[H3162]]

### 8
And the spoiler [[H7703]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] every [[H3605]] city, [[H5892]] and no [[H3808]] city [[H5892]] shall escape: [[H4422]] the valley [[H6010]] also shall perish, [[H6]] and the plain [[H4334]] shall be destroyed, [[H8045]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken. [[H559]]

### 9
Give [[H5414]] wings [[H6731]] unto Moab, [[H4124]] that [[H3588]] it may flee [[H5323]] and get away: [[H3318]] for the cities [[H5892]] thereof shall be [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8047]] without any [[H369]] to dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H2004]]

### 10
Cursed [[H779]] he that doeth [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] of the Lord [[H3068]] deceitfully, [[H7423]] and cursed [[H779]] he that keepeth back [[H4513]] his sword [[H2719]] from blood. [[H1818]]

### 11
Moab [[H4124]] hath been at ease [[H7599]] from his youth, [[H5271]] and he [[H1931]] hath settled [[H8252]] on [[H413]] his lees, [[H8105]] and hath not [[H3808]] been emptied [[H7324]] from vessel [[H3627]] to [[H413]] vessel, [[H3627]] neither [[H3808]] hath he gone [[H1980]] into captivity: [[H1473]] therefore [[H5921]] his taste [[H2940]] remained [[H5975]] in him, and his scent [[H7381]] is not [[H3808]] changed. [[H4171]]

### 12
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will send [[H7971]] unto him wanderers, [[H6808]] that shall cause him to wander, [[H6808]] and shall empty [[H7324]] his vessels, [[H3627]] and break [[H5310]] their bottles. [[H5035]]

### 13
And Moab [[H4124]] shall be ashamed [[H954]] of Chemosh, [[H3645]] as [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] was ashamed [[H954]] of Beth-el [[H1008]] their confidence. [[H4009]]

### 14
How [[H349]] say [[H559]] ye, We [[H587]] mighty [[H1368]] and strong [[H2428]] men [[H582]] for the war? [[H4421]]

### 15
Moab [[H4124]] is spoiled, [[H7703]] and gone up [[H5927]] her cities, [[H5892]] and his chosen [[H4005]] young men [[H970]] are gone down [[H3381]] to the slaughter, [[H2874]] saith [[H5002]] the King, [[H4428]] whose name [[H8034]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 16
The calamity [[H343]] of Moab [[H4124]] near [[H7138]] to come, [[H935]] and his affliction [[H7451]] hasteth [[H4116]] fast. [[H3966]]

### 17
All [[H3605]] ye that are about [[H5439]] him, bemoan [[H5110]] him; and all [[H3605]] ye that know [[H3045]] his name, [[H8034]] say, [[H559]] How [[H349]] is the strong [[H5797]] staff [[H4294]] broken, [[H7665]] the beautiful [[H8597]] rod! [[H4731]]

### 18
Thou daughter [[H1323]] that dost inhabit [[H3427]] Dibon, [[H1769]] come down [[H3381]] from glory, [[H3519]] and sit [[H3427]] in thirst; [[H6772]] for [[H3588]] the spoiler [[H7703]] of Moab [[H4124]] shall come [[H5927]] upon thee, he shall destroy [[H7843]] thy strong holds. [[H4013]]

### 19
O inhabitant [[H3427]] of Aroer, [[H6177]] stand [[H5975]] by [[H413]] the way, [[H1870]] and espy; [[H6822]] ask [[H7592]] him that fleeth, [[H5127]] and her that escapeth, [[H4422]] say, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] is done? [[H1961]]

### 20
Moab [[H4124]] is confounded; [[H3001]] for [[H3588]] it is broken down: [[H2865]] howl [[H3213]] and cry; [[H2199]] tell [[H5046]] ye it in Arnon, [[H769]] that [[H3588]] Moab [[H4124]] is spoiled, [[H7703]]

### 21
And judgment [[H4941]] is come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] the plain [[H4334]] country; [[H776]] upon [[H413]] Holon, [[H2473]] and upon [[H413]] Jahazah, [[H3096]] and upon [[H5921]] Mephaath, [[H4158]]

### 22
And upon [[H5921]] Dibon, [[H1769]] and upon [[H5921]] Nebo, [[H5015]] and upon [[H5921]] Beth-diblathaim, [[H1015]]

### 23
And upon [[H5921]] Kiriathaim, [[H7156]] and upon [[H5921]] Beth-gamul, [[H1014]] and upon [[H5921]] Beth-meon, [[H1010]]

### 24
And upon [[H5921]] Kerioth, [[H7152]] and upon [[H5921]] Bozrah, [[H1224]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] far [[H7350]] or near. [[H7138]]

### 25
The horn [[H7161]] of Moab [[H4124]] is cut off, [[H1438]] and his arm [[H2220]] is broken, [[H7665]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 26
Make ye him drunken: [[H7937]] for [[H3588]] he magnified [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] the Lord: [[H3068]] Moab [[H4124]] also shall wallow [[H5606]] in his vomit, [[H6892]] and he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] shall be [[H1961]] in derision. [[H7814]]

### 27
For [[H518]] was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] Israel [[H3478]] a derision [[H7814]] unto thee? was he found [[H4672]] among thieves? [[H1590]] for [[H3588]] since [[H1767]] thou spakest [[H1697]] of him, thou skippedst for joy. [[H5110]]

### 28
O ye that dwell [[H3427]] in Moab, [[H4124]] leave [[H5800]] the cities, [[H5892]] and dwell [[H7931]] in the rock, [[H5553]] and be [[H1961]] like the dove [[H3123]] maketh her nest [[H7077]] in the sides [[H5676]] of the hole's [[H6354]] mouth. [[H6310]]

### 29
We have heard [[H8085]] the pride [[H1347]] of Moab, [[H4124]] (he is exceeding [[H3966]] proud) [[H1343]] his loftiness, [[H1363]] and his arrogancy, [[H1346]] and his pride, [[H1347]] and the haughtiness [[H7312]] of his heart. [[H3820]]

### 30
I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] his wrath, [[H5678]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] but not [[H3808]] so; [[H3651]] his lies [[H907]] shall not [[H3808]] so [[H3651]] effect [[H6213]]

### 31
Therefore [[H5921]] will I howl [[H3213]] for [[H5921]] Moab, [[H4124]] and I will cry out [[H2199]] for all [[H3605]] Moab; [[H4124]] shall mourn [[H1897]] for [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Kir-heres. [[H7025]]

### 32
O vine [[H1612]] of Sibmah, [[H7643]] I will weep [[H1058]] for thee with the weeping [[H1065]] of Jazer: [[H3270]] thy plants [[H5189]] are gone over [[H5674]] the sea, [[H3220]] they reach [[H5060]] to [[H5704]] the sea [[H3220]] of Jazer: [[H3270]] the spoiler [[H7703]] is fallen [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] thy summer fruits [[H7019]] and upon [[H5921]] thy vintage. [[H1210]]

### 33
And joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H1524]] is taken [[H622]] from the plentiful field, [[H3759]] and from the land [[H776]] of Moab; [[H4124]] and I have caused wine [[H3196]] to fail [[H7673]] from the winepresses: [[H3342]] none [[H3808]] shall tread [[H1869]] with shouting; [[H1959]] shouting [[H1959]] no [[H3808]] shouting. [[H1959]]

### 34
From the cry [[H2201]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] unto [[H5704]] Elealeh, [[H500]] unto [[H5704]] Jahaz, [[H3096]] have they uttered [[H5414]] their voice, [[H6963]] from Zoar [[H6820]] unto [[H5704]] Horonaim, [[H2773]] an heifer [[H5697]] of three years old: [[H7992]] for [[H3588]] the waters [[H4325]] also [[H1571]] of Nimrim [[H5249]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate. [[H4923]]

### 35
Moreover I will cause to cease [[H7673]] in Moab, [[H4124]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] him that offereth [[H5927]] in the high places, [[H1116]] and him that burneth incense [[H6999]] to his gods. [[H430]]

### 36
Therefore [[H5921]] mine heart [[H3820]] shall sound [[H1993]] for Moab [[H4124]] like pipes, [[H2485]] and mine heart [[H3820]] shall sound [[H1993]] like pipes [[H2485]] for [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Kir-heres: [[H7025]] because [[H5921]] the riches [[H3502]] he hath gotten [[H6213]] are perished. [[H6]]

### 37
For [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] head [[H7218]] bald, [[H7144]] and every [[H3605]] beard [[H2206]] clipped: [[H1639]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the hands [[H3027]] cuttings, [[H1417]] and upon [[H5921]] the loins [[H4975]] sackcloth. [[H8242]]

### 38
lamentation [[H4553]] generally [[H3605]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the housetops [[H1406]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and in the streets [[H7339]] thereof: for [[H3588]] I have broken [[H7665]] Moab [[H4124]] like a vessel [[H3627]] wherein no [[H369]] pleasure, [[H2656]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 39
They shall howl, [[H3213]] How [[H349]] is it broken down! [[H2865]] how [[H349]] hath Moab [[H4124]] turned [[H6437]] the back [[H6203]] with shame! [[H954]] so shall Moab [[H4124]] be [[H1961]] a derision [[H7814]] and a dismaying [[H4288]] to all [[H3605]] them about [[H5439]] him. [[H5439]]

### 40
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] he shall fly [[H1675]] as an eagle, [[H5404]] and shall spread [[H6566]] his wings [[H3671]] over [[H413]] Moab. [[H4124]]

### 41
Kerioth [[H7152]] is taken, [[H3920]] and the strong holds [[H4679]] are surprised, [[H8610]] and the mighty men's [[H1368]] hearts [[H3820]] in Moab [[H4124]] at that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall be [[H1961]] as the heart [[H3820]] of a woman [[H802]] in her pangs. [[H6887]]

### 42
And Moab [[H4124]] shall be destroyed [[H8045]] from a people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] he hath magnified [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 43
Fear, [[H6343]] and the pit, [[H6354]] and the snare, [[H6341]] upon [[H5921]] thee, O inhabitant [[H3427]] of Moab, [[H4124]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 44
He that fleeth [[H5211]] from [[H6440]] the fear [[H6343]] shall fall [[H5307]] into [[H413]] the pit; [[H6354]] and he that getteth up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the pit [[H6354]] shall be taken [[H3920]] in the snare: [[H6341]] for [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H413]] it, upon [[H413]] Moab, [[H4124]] the year [[H8141]] of their visitation, [[H6486]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 45
They that fled [[H5127]] stood [[H5975]] under the shadow [[H6738]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] because of the force: [[H3581]] but [[H3588]] a fire [[H784]] shall come forth [[H3318]] out of Heshbon, [[H2809]] and a flame [[H3852]] from the midst [[H996]] of Sihon, [[H5511]] and shall devour [[H398]] the corner [[H6285]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and the crown of the head [[H6936]] of the tumultuous [[H7588]] ones. [[H1121]]

### 46
Woe [[H188]] be unto thee, O Moab! [[H4124]] the people [[H5971]] of Chemosh [[H3645]] perisheth: [[H6]] for [[H3588]] thy sons [[H1121]] are taken [[H3947]] captives, [[H7628]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] captives. [[H7633]]

### 47
Yet will I bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Moab [[H4124]] in the latter [[H319]] days, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]] Thus far [[H2008]] the judgment [[H4941]] of Moab. [[H4124]]
