### 1
The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] concerning [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] which dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] which dwell [[H3427]] at Migdol, [[H4024]] and at Tahpanhes, [[H8471]] and at Noph, [[H5297]] and in the country [[H776]] of Pathros, [[H6624]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Ye [[H859]] have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I have brought [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah; [[H3063]] and, behold, [[H2005]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] they a desolation, [[H2723]] and no [[H369]] man dwelleth [[H3427]] therein, [[H3427]]

### 3
Because [[H6440]] of their wickedness [[H7451]] which [[H834]] they have committed [[H6213]] to provoke me to anger, [[H3707]] in that they went [[H1980]] to burn incense, [[H6999]] to serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] whom [[H834]] they knew [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] they, [[H1992]] ye, [[H859]] nor your fathers. [[H1]]

### 4
Howbeit I sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]]  you [[H853]] all [[H3605]] my servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] rising early [[H7925]] and sending [[H7971]] saying, [[H559]] Oh, [[H4994]] do [[H6213]] not [[H408]] this [[H2063]] abominable [[H8441]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I hate. [[H8130]]

### 5
But they hearkened [[H8085]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] their ear [[H241]] to turn [[H7725]] from their wickedness, [[H7451]] to burn [[H6999]] no [[H1115]] incense unto other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

### 6
Wherefore my fury [[H2534]] and mine anger [[H639]] was poured forth, [[H5413]] and was kindled [[H1197]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and they are [[H1961]] wasted [[H2723]] desolate, [[H8077]] as at this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 7
Therefore now [[H6258]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Wherefore [[H4100]] commit [[H6213]] ye [[H859]] great [[H1419]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H413]] your souls, [[H5315]] to cut off [[H3772]] from you man [[H376]] and woman, [[H802]] child [[H5768]] and suckling, [[H3243]] out [[H8432]] of Judah, [[H3063]] to leave [[H3498]] you none [[H1115]] to remain; [[H7611]]

### 8
In that ye provoke me unto wrath [[H3707]] with the works [[H4639]] of your hands, [[H3027]] burning incense [[H6999]] unto other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] whither [[H834]] ye [[H859]] be gone [[H935]] to dwell, [[H1481]] that [[H4616]] ye might cut yourselves off, [[H3772]] and that [[H4616]] ye might be [[H1961]] a curse [[H7045]] and a reproach [[H2781]] among all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth? [[H776]]

### 9
Have ye forgotten [[H7911]] the wickedness [[H7451]] of your fathers, [[H1]] and the wickedness [[H7451]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the wickedness [[H7451]] of their wives, [[H802]] and your own wickedness, [[H7451]] and the wickedness [[H7451]] of your wives, [[H802]] which [[H834]] they have committed [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem? [[H3389]]

### 10
They are not [[H3808]] humbled [[H1792]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] neither [[H3808]] have they feared, [[H3372]] nor [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in my law, [[H8451]] nor in my statutes, [[H2708]] that [[H834]] I set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you and before [[H6440]] your fathers. [[H1]]

### 11
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will set [[H7760]] my face [[H6440]] against you for evil, [[H7451]] and to cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 12
And I will take [[H3947]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that [[H834]] have set [[H7760]] their faces [[H6440]] to go into [[H935]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to sojourn [[H1481]] there, [[H8033]] and they shall all [[H3605]] be consumed, [[H8552]] fall [[H5307]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] they shall be consumed [[H8552]] by the sword [[H2719]] by the famine: [[H7458]] they shall die, [[H4191]] from the least [[H6996]] even unto [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]] by the sword [[H2719]] and by the famine: [[H7458]] and they shall be [[H1961]] an execration, [[H423]] an astonishment, [[H8047]] and a curse, [[H7045]] and a reproach. [[H2781]]

### 13
For I will punish [[H6485]] them that dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] as [[H834]] I have punished [[H6485]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] by the sword, [[H2719]] by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence: [[H1698]]

### 14
So that none [[H3808]] of the remnant [[H7611]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which are gone [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to sojourn [[H1481]] there, [[H8033]] shall [[H1961]] escape [[H6412]] or remain, [[H8300]] that they should return [[H7725]] into the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] to the which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] have [[H5375]] a desire [[H5315]] to return [[H7725]] to dwell [[H3427]] there: [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] none [[H3808]] shall return [[H7725]] but [[H3588]] such as shall escape. [[H6412]]

### 15
Then all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] which knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] their wives [[H802]] had burned incense [[H6999]] unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and all [[H3605]] the women [[H802]] that stood by, [[H5975]] a great [[H1419]] multitude, [[H6951]] even all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] in Pathros, [[H6624]] answered [[H6030]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 16
the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] us in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] we will not [[H369]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 17
But [[H3588]] we will certainly [[H6213]] do [[H6213]] whatsoever [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] goeth forth [[H3318]] out of our own mouth, [[H6310]] to burn incense [[H6999]] unto the queen [[H4446]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and to pour out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] unto her, as [[H834]] we have done, [[H6213]] we, [[H587]] and our fathers, [[H1]] our kings, [[H4428]] and our princes, [[H8269]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] for had we plenty [[H7646]] of victuals, [[H3899]] and were [[H1961]] well, [[H2896]] and saw [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 18
But since [[H227]] we left off [[H2308]] to burn incense [[H6999]] to the queen [[H4446]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and to pour out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] unto her, we have wanted [[H2637]] all [[H3605]] and have been consumed [[H8552]] by the sword [[H2719]] and by the famine. [[H7458]]

### 19
And when [[H3588]] we [[H587]] burned incense [[H6999]] to the queen [[H4446]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and poured out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] unto her, did we make [[H6213]] her cakes [[H3561]] to worship [[H6087]] her, and pour out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] unto her, without [[H1107]] our men? [[H582]]

### 20
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] to [[H5921]] the men, [[H1397]] and to [[H5921]] the women, [[H802]] and to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] which had given him answer, [[H6030]] saying, [[H559]]

### 21
The incense [[H7002]] that [[H834]] ye burned [[H6999]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] ye, [[H859]] and your fathers, [[H1]] your kings, [[H4428]] and your princes, [[H8269]] and the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] did not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] remember [[H2142]] them, and came [[H5927]] it into [[H5921]] his mind? [[H3820]]

### 22
So that the Lord [[H3068]] could [[H3201]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] bear, [[H5375]] because [[H6440]] of the evil [[H7455]] of your doings, [[H4611]] because [[H6440]] of the abominations [[H8441]] which [[H834]] ye have committed; [[H6213]] therefore is [[H1961]] your land [[H776]] a desolation, [[H2723]] and an astonishment, [[H8047]] and a curse, [[H7045]] without [[H369]] an inhabitant, [[H3427]] as at this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 23
Because [[H6440]] ye have burned incense, [[H6999]] and because [[H834]] ye have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] and have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] nor [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in his law, [[H8451]] nor in his statutes, [[H2708]] nor in his testimonies; [[H5715]] therefore [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] is happened unto [[H7122]] you, as at this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 24
Moreover Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the women, [[H802]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] that [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 25
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying; [[H559]] Ye [[H859]] and your wives [[H802]] have both spoken [[H1696]] with your mouths, [[H6310]] and fulfilled [[H4390]] with your hand, [[H3027]] saying, [[H559]] We will surely [[H6213]] perform [[H6213]] our vows [[H5088]] that [[H834]] we have vowed, [[H5087]] to burn incense [[H6999]] to the queen [[H4446]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and to pour out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] unto her: ye will surely [[H6965]] accomplish [[H6965]] your vows, [[H5088]] and surely [[H6213]] perform [[H6213]] your vows. [[H5088]]

### 26
Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] ye the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] that dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] Behold, [[H2005]] I have sworn [[H7650]] by my great [[H1419]] name, [[H8034]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that my name [[H8034]] shall no [[H518]] more [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] named [[H7121]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of any [[H3605]] man [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] liveth. [[H2416]]

### 27
Behold, [[H2005]] I will watch [[H8245]] over [[H5921]] them for evil, [[H7451]] and not [[H3808]] for good: [[H2896]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] that [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall be consumed [[H8552]] by the sword [[H2719]] and by the famine, [[H7458]] until [[H5704]] there be an end [[H3615]] of them. [[H3615]]

### 28
Yet a small [[H4962]] number [[H4557]] that escape [[H6412]] the sword [[H2719]] shall return out [[H7725]] of [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] into the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that are gone [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to sojourn [[H1481]] there, [[H8033]] shall know [[H3045]] whose [[H4310]] words [[H1697]] shall stand, [[H6965]] mine, [[H4480]] or theirs. [[H4480]]

### 29
And this [[H2063]] a sign [[H226]] unto you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will punish [[H6485]] you in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] that [[H4616]] ye may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] my words [[H1697]] shall surely [[H6965]] stand [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] you for evil: [[H7451]]

### 30
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will give [[H5414]] Pharaoh-hophra [[H6548]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] into the hand [[H3027]] of his enemies, [[H341]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of them that seek [[H1245]] his life; [[H5315]] as [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] his enemy, [[H341]] and that sought [[H1245]] his life. [[H5315]]
