### 1
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Go [[H1980]] and cry [[H7121]] in the ears [[H241]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] I remember [[H2142]] thee, the kindness [[H2617]] of thy youth, [[H5271]] the love [[H160]] of thine espousals, [[H3623]] when thou wentest [[H1980]] after [[H310]] me in the wilderness, [[H4057]] in a land [[H776]] not [[H3808]] sown. [[H2232]]

### 3
Israel [[H3478]] holiness [[H6944]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] the firstfruits [[H7225]] of his increase: [[H8393]] all [[H3605]] that devour [[H398]] him shall offend; [[H816]] evil [[H7451]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
Hear [[H8085]] ye the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] O house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 5
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] What [[H4100]] iniquity [[H5766]] have your fathers [[H1]] found [[H4672]] in me, that [[H3588]] they are gone far [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] me, and have walked [[H1980]] after [[H310]] vanity, [[H1892]] and are become vain? [[H1891]]

### 6
Neither [[H3808]] said [[H559]] they, Where [[H346]] the Lord [[H3068]] that brought us up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] that led [[H1980]] us through the wilderness, [[H4057]] through a land [[H776]] of deserts [[H6160]] and of pits, [[H7745]] through a land [[H776]] of drought, [[H6723]] and of the shadow of death, [[H6757]] through a land [[H776]] that no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] passed through, [[H5674]] and where [[H8033]] no [[H3808]] man [[H120]] dwelt? [[H3427]]

### 7
And I brought [[H935]] you into [[H413]] a plentiful [[H3759]] country, [[H776]] to eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] thereof and the goodness [[H2898]] thereof; but when ye entered, [[H935]] ye defiled [[H2930]] my land, [[H776]] and made [[H7760]] mine heritage [[H5159]] an abomination. [[H8441]]

### 8
The priests [[H3548]] said [[H559]] not, [[H3808]] Where [[H346]] the Lord? [[H3068]] and they that handle [[H8610]] the law [[H8451]] knew [[H3045]] me not: [[H3808]] the pastors [[H7462]] also transgressed [[H6586]] against me, and the prophets [[H5030]] prophesied [[H5012]] by Baal, [[H1168]] and walked [[H1980]] after [[H310]] do not [[H3808]] profit. [[H3276]]

### 9
Wherefore [[H3651]] I will yet [[H5750]] plead [[H7378]] with [[H854]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and with [[H854]] your children's [[H1121]] children [[H1121]] will I plead. [[H7378]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] pass over [[H5674]] the isles [[H339]] of Chittim, [[H3794]] and see; [[H7200]] and send [[H7971]] unto Kedar, [[H6938]] and consider [[H995]] diligently, [[H3966]] and see [[H7200]] if there be [[H1961]] such [[H2063]] a thing. [[H2063]]

### 11
Hath a nation [[H1471]] changed [[H4171]] gods, [[H430]] which [[H1992]] yet no [[H3808]] gods? [[H430]] but my people [[H5971]] have changed [[H4171]] their glory [[H3519]] for doth not [[H1097]] profit. [[H3276]]

### 12
Be astonished, [[H8074]] O ye heavens, [[H8064]] at [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] and be horribly afraid, [[H8175]] be ye very [[H3966]] desolate, [[H2717]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] my people [[H5971]] have committed [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] evils; [[H7451]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] me the fountain [[H4726]] of living [[H2416]] waters, [[H4325]] hewed them out [[H2672]] cisterns, [[H877]] broken [[H7665]] cisterns, [[H877]] that [[H834]] can hold [[H3557]] no [[H3808]] water. [[H4325]]

### 14
Israel [[H3478]] a servant? [[H5650]] he [[H1931]] a homeborn [[H1004]] why [[H4069]] is [[H1961]] he spoiled? [[H957]]

### 15
The young lions [[H3715]] roared [[H7580]] upon [[H5921]] him, yelled, [[H5414]] and they made [[H7896]] his land [[H776]] waste: [[H8047]] his cities [[H5892]] are burned [[H3341]] without [[H1097]] inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 16
Also [[H1571]] the children [[H1121]] of Noph [[H5297]] and Tahapanes [[H8471]] have broken [[H7462]] the crown of thy head. [[H6936]]

### 17
Hast thou not [[H3808]] procured [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] when [[H6256]] he led [[H1980]] thee by the way? [[H1870]]

### 18
And now [[H6258]] what [[H4100]] hast thou to do in the way [[H1870]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] to drink [[H8354]] the waters [[H4325]] of Sihor? [[H7883]] or what [[H4100]] hast thou to do in the way [[H1870]] of Assyria, [[H804]] to drink [[H8354]] the waters [[H4325]] of the river? [[H5104]]

### 19
Thine own wickedness [[H7451]] shall correct [[H3256]] thee, and thy backslidings [[H4878]] shall reprove [[H3198]] thee: know [[H3045]] therefore and see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] an evil [[H7451]] and bitter, [[H4751]] that thou hast forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and that my fear [[H6345]] not [[H3808]] in [[H413]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] of old time [[H5769]] I have broken [[H7665]] thy yoke, [[H5923]] burst [[H5423]] thy bands; [[H4147]] and thou saidst, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] transgress; [[H5674]] when [[H3588]] upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] hill [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree [[H6086]] thou [[H859]] wanderest, [[H6808]] playing the harlot. [[H2181]]

### 21
Yet I [[H595]] had planted [[H5193]] thee a noble vine, [[H8321]] wholly [[H3605]] a right [[H571]] seed: [[H2233]] how [[H349]] then art thou turned [[H2015]] into the degenerate plant [[H5494]] of a strange [[H5237]] vine [[H1612]] unto me? [[H1612]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] though [[H518]] thou wash [[H3526]] thee with nitre, [[H5427]] and take thee much [[H7235]] soap, [[H1287]] thine iniquity [[H5771]] is marked [[H3799]] before [[H6440]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3069]]

### 23
How [[H349]] canst thou say, [[H559]] I am not [[H3808]] polluted, [[H2930]] I have not [[H3808]] gone [[H1980]] after [[H310]] Baalim? [[H1168]] see [[H7200]] thy way [[H1870]] in the valley, [[H1516]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] thou hast done: [[H6213]] a swift [[H7031]] dromedary [[H1072]] traversing [[H8308]] her ways; [[H1870]]

### 24
A wild ass [[H6501]] used [[H3928]] to the wilderness, [[H4057]] snuffeth up [[H7602]] the wind [[H7307]] at her pleasure; [[H185]] in her occasion [[H8385]] who [[H4310]] can turn her away? [[H7725]] all [[H3605]] they that seek [[H1245]] her will not [[H3808]] weary [[H3286]] themselves; in her month [[H2320]] they shall find [[H4672]] her. [[H4672]]

### 25
Withhold [[H4513]] thy foot [[H7272]] from being unshod, [[H3182]] and thy throat [[H1627]] from thirst: [[H6773]] but thou saidst, [[H559]] There is no hope: [[H2976]] no; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] I have loved [[H157]] strangers, [[H2114]] and after [[H310]] them will I go. [[H1980]]

### 26
As the thief [[H1590]] is ashamed [[H1322]] when [[H3588]] he is found, [[H4672]] so [[H3651]] is the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] ashamed; [[H954]] they, [[H1992]] their kings, [[H4428]] their princes, [[H8269]] and their priests, [[H3548]] and their prophets, [[H5030]]

### 27
Saying [[H559]] to a stock, [[H6086]] Thou [[H859]] my father; [[H1]] and to a stone, [[H68]] Thou [[H859]] hast brought me forth: [[H3205]] for [[H3588]] they have turned [[H6437]] back [[H6203]] unto [[H413]] me, and not [[H3808]] face: [[H6440]] but in the time [[H6256]] of their trouble [[H7451]] they will say, [[H559]] Arise, [[H6965]] and save [[H3467]] us. [[H3467]]

### 28
But where [[H346]] thy gods [[H430]] that [[H834]] thou hast made [[H6213]] thee? let them arise, [[H6965]] if [[H518]] they can save [[H3467]] thee in the time [[H6256]] of thy trouble: [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] the number [[H4557]] of thy cities [[H5892]] are [[H1961]] thy gods, [[H430]] O Judah. [[H3063]]

### 29
Wherefore [[H4100]] will ye plead [[H7378]] with [[H413]] me? ye all [[H3605]] have transgressed [[H6586]] against me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 30
In vain [[H7723]] have I smitten [[H5221]] your children; [[H1121]] they received [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] correction: [[H4148]] your own sword [[H2719]] hath devoured [[H398]] your prophets, [[H5030]] like a destroying [[H7843]] lion. [[H738]]

### 31
O generation, [[H1755]] see [[H7200]] ye [[H859]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] Have I been [[H1961]] a wilderness [[H4057]] unto Israel? [[H3478]] a land [[H776]] of darkness? [[H3991]] wherefore [[H4069]] say [[H559]] my people, [[H5971]] We are lords; [[H7300]] we will come [[H935]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] unto [[H413]] thee? [[H413]]

### 32
Can a maid [[H1330]] forget [[H7911]] her ornaments, [[H5716]] a bride [[H3618]] her attire? [[H7196]] yet my people [[H5971]] have forgotten [[H7911]] me days [[H3117]] without [[H369]] number. [[H4557]]

### 33
Why [[H4100]] trimmest [[H3190]] thou thy way [[H1870]] to seek [[H1245]] love? [[H160]] therefore [[H3651]] hast thou also [[H1571]] taught [[H3925]] the wicked ones [[H7451]] thy ways. [[H1870]]

### 34
Also [[H1571]] in thy skirts [[H3671]] is found [[H4672]] the blood [[H1818]] of the souls [[H5315]] of the poor [[H34]] innocents: [[H5355]] I have not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] it by secret search, [[H4290]] but [[H3588]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] these. [[H3605]]

### 35
Yet thou sayest, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] I am innocent, [[H5352]] surely [[H389]] his anger [[H639]] shall turn [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] me. Behold, [[H2005]] I will plead with [[H8199]] thee, because [[H5921]] thou sayest, [[H559]] I have not [[H3808]] sinned. [[H2398]]

### 36
Why [[H4100]] gaddest thou about [[H235]] so much [[H3966]] to change [[H8138]] thy way? [[H1870]] thou also [[H1571]] shalt be ashamed [[H954]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] as [[H834]] thou wast ashamed [[H954]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 37
Yea, [[H1571]] thou shalt go forth [[H3318]] from [[H853]] him, [[H2088]] and thine hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] thine head: [[H7218]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath rejected [[H3988]] thy confidences, [[H4009]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] prosper [[H6743]] in them. [[H6743]]
