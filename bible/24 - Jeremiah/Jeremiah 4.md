### 1
If [[H518]] thou wilt return, [[H7725]] O Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] me: and if [[H518]] thou wilt put away [[H5493]] thine abominations [[H8251]] out of my sight, [[H6440]] then shalt thou not [[H3808]] remove. [[H5110]]

### 2
And thou shalt swear, [[H7650]] The Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] in truth, [[H571]] in judgment, [[H4941]] and in righteousness; [[H6666]] and the nations [[H1471]] shall bless themselves [[H1288]] in him, and in him shall they glory. [[H1984]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] to the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Break up [[H5214]] your fallow ground, [[H5215]] and sow [[H2232]] not [[H408]] among [[H413]] thorns. [[H6975]]

### 4
Circumcise yourselves [[H4135]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] and take away [[H5493]] the foreskins [[H6190]] of your heart, [[H3824]] ye men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] lest [[H6435]] my fury [[H2534]] come forth [[H3318]] like fire, [[H784]] and burn [[H1197]] that none [[H369]] can quench [[H3518]] because [[H6440]] of the evil [[H7455]] of your doings. [[H4611]]

### 5
Declare [[H5046]] ye in Judah, [[H3063]] and publish [[H8085]] in Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and say, [[H559]] Blow [[H8628]] ye the trumpet [[H7782]] in the land: [[H776]] cry, [[H7121]] gather together, [[H4390]] and say, [[H559]] Assemble yourselves, [[H622]] and let us go [[H935]] into [[H413]] the defenced [[H4013]] cities. [[H5892]]

### 6
Set up [[H5375]] the standard [[H5251]] toward Zion: [[H6726]] retire, [[H5756]] stay [[H5975]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] from the north, [[H6828]] and a great [[H1419]] destruction. [[H7667]]

### 7
The lion [[H738]] is come up [[H5927]] from his thicket, [[H5441]] and the destroyer [[H7843]] of the Gentiles [[H1471]] is on his way; [[H5265]] he is gone forth [[H3318]] from his place [[H4725]] to make [[H7760]] thy land [[H776]] desolate; [[H8047]] thy cities [[H5892]] shall be laid waste, [[H5327]] without [[H369]] an inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 8
For [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] gird [[H2296]] you with sackcloth, [[H8242]] lament [[H5594]] and howl: [[H3213]] for [[H3588]] the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is not [[H3808]] turned back [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] us. [[H4480]]

### 9
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the heart [[H3820]] of the king [[H4428]] shall perish, [[H6]] and the heart [[H3820]] of the princes; [[H8269]] and the priests [[H3548]] shall be astonished, [[H8074]] and the prophets [[H5030]] shall wonder. [[H8539]]

### 10
Then said [[H559]] I, Ah, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] God! [[H3069]] surely [[H403]] thou hast greatly [[H5377]] deceived [[H5377]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] Ye shall have [[H1961]] peace; [[H7965]] whereas the sword [[H2719]] reacheth [[H5060]] unto [[H5704]] the soul. [[H5315]]

### 11
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] shall it be said [[H559]] to this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] and to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] A dry [[H6703]] wind [[H7307]] of the high places [[H8205]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] toward [[H1870]] the daughter [[H1323]] of my people, [[H5971]] not [[H3808]] to fan, [[H2219]] nor [[H3808]] to cleanse, [[H1305]]

### 12
a full [[H4392]] wind [[H7307]] from those [[H428]] shall come [[H935]] unto me: now [[H6258]] also [[H1571]] will I [[H589]] give [[H1696]] sentence [[H4941]] against them. [[H4941]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] he shall come up [[H5927]] as clouds, [[H6051]] and his chariots [[H4818]] as a whirlwind: [[H5492]] his horses [[H5483]] are swifter [[H7043]] than eagles. [[H5404]] Woe [[H188]] unto us! for [[H3588]] we are spoiled. [[H7703]]

### 14
O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] wash [[H3526]] thine heart [[H3820]] from wickedness, [[H7451]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest be saved. [[H3467]] How long [[H5704]] shall thy vain [[H205]] thoughts [[H4284]] lodge [[H3885]] within [[H7130]] thee? [[H7130]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] a voice [[H6963]] declareth [[H5046]] from Dan, [[H1835]] and publisheth [[H8085]] affliction [[H205]] from mount [[H2022]] Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 16
Make ye mention [[H2142]] to the nations; [[H1471]] behold, [[H2009]] publish [[H8085]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] watchers [[H5341]] come [[H935]] from a far [[H4801]] country, [[H776]] and give out [[H5414]] their voice [[H6963]] against [[H5921]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 17
As keepers [[H8104]] of a field, [[H7704]] are [[H1961]] they against [[H5921]] her round about; [[H5439]] because [[H3588]] she hath been rebellious [[H4784]] against me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
Thy way [[H1870]] and thy doings [[H4611]] have procured [[H6213]] these [[H428]] unto thee; this [[H2063]] thy wickedness, [[H7451]] because [[H3588]] it is bitter, [[H4751]] because [[H3588]] it reacheth [[H5060]] unto [[H5704]] thine heart. [[H3820]]

### 19
My bowels, [[H4578]] my bowels! [[H4578]] I am pained [[H2342]] at my very [[H7023]] heart; [[H3820]] my heart [[H3820]] maketh a noise [[H1993]] in me; I cannot [[H3808]] hold my peace, [[H2790]] because [[H3588]] thou hast heard, [[H8085]] O my soul, [[H5315]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] the alarm [[H8643]] of war. [[H4421]]

### 20
Destruction [[H7667]] upon [[H5921]] destruction [[H7667]] is cried; [[H7121]] for [[H3588]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] is spoiled: [[H7703]] suddenly [[H6597]] are my tents [[H168]] spoiled, [[H7703]] my curtains [[H3407]] in a moment. [[H7281]]

### 21
How long [[H5704]] shall I see [[H7200]] the standard, [[H5251]] hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet? [[H7782]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] my people [[H5971]] foolish, [[H191]] they have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] me; they [[H1992]] sottish [[H5530]] children, [[H1121]] and they [[H1992]] have none [[H3808]] understanding: [[H995]] they [[H1992]] wise [[H2450]] to do evil, [[H7489]] but to do good [[H3190]] they have no [[H3808]] knowledge. [[H3045]]

### 23
I beheld [[H7200]] the earth, [[H776]] and, lo, [[H2009]] without form, [[H8414]] and void; [[H922]] and the heavens, [[H8064]] and they no [[H369]] light. [[H216]]

### 24
I beheld [[H7200]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and, lo, [[H2009]] they trembled, [[H7493]] and all [[H3605]] the hills [[H1389]] moved lightly. [[H7043]]

### 25
I beheld, [[H7200]] and, lo, [[H2009]] no [[H369]] man, [[H120]] and all [[H3605]] the birds [[H5775]] of the heavens [[H8064]] were fled. [[H5074]]

### 26
I beheld, [[H7200]] and, lo, [[H2009]] the fruitful place [[H3759]] a wilderness, [[H4057]] and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] thereof were broken down [[H5422]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] by [[H6440]] his fierce [[H2740]] anger. [[H639]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] The whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate; [[H8077]] yet will I not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] a full end. [[H3617]]

### 28
For [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] shall the earth [[H776]] mourn, [[H56]] and the heavens [[H8064]] above [[H4605]] be black: [[H6937]] because [[H5921]] I have spoken [[H1696]] I have purposed [[H2161]] and will not [[H3808]] repent, [[H5162]] neither [[H3808]] will I turn back [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]

### 29
The whole [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] shall flee [[H1272]] for the noise [[H6963]] of the horsemen [[H6571]] and bowmen; [[H7198]] they shall go [[H935]] into thickets, [[H5645]] and climb up [[H5927]] upon the rocks: [[H3710]] every [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] forsaken, [[H5800]] and not [[H369]] a man [[H376]] dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H2004]]

### 30
And thou [[H859]] spoiled, [[H7703]] what [[H4100]] wilt thou do? [[H6213]] Though [[H3588]] thou clothest [[H3847]] thyself with crimson, [[H8144]] though [[H3588]] thou deckest [[H5710]] thee with ornaments [[H5716]] of gold, [[H2091]] though [[H3588]] thou rentest [[H7167]] thy face [[H5869]] with painting, [[H6320]] in vain [[H7723]] shalt thou make thyself fair; [[H3302]] lovers [[H5689]] will despise [[H3988]] thee, they will seek [[H1245]] thy life. [[H5315]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] I have heard [[H8085]] a voice [[H6963]] as of a woman in travail, [[H2470]] the anguish [[H6869]] as of her that bringeth forth her first child, [[H1069]] the voice [[H6963]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] bewaileth herself, [[H3306]] spreadeth [[H6566]] her hands, [[H3709]] Woe [[H188]] me now! [[H4994]] for [[H3588]] my soul [[H5315]] is wearied [[H5888]] because of murderers. [[H2026]]
