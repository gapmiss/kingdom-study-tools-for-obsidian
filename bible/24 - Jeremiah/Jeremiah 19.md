Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Go [[H1980]] and get [[H7069]] a potter's [[H3335]] earthen [[H2789]] bottle, [[H1228]] and of the ancients [[H2205]] of the people, [[H5971]] and of the ancients [[H2205]] of the priests; [[H3548]]

### 2
And go forth [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] the valley [[H1516]] of the son [[H1121]] of Hinnom, [[H2011]] which [[H834]] by the entry [[H6607]] of the east [[H2777]] gate, [[H8179]] and proclaim [[H7121]] there [[H8033]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I shall tell [[H1696]] thee, [[H413]]

### 3
And say, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] ye the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] O kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] the which [[H834]] whosoever [[H3605]] heareth, [[H8085]] his ears [[H241]] shall tingle. [[H6750]]

### 4
Because [[H3282]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and have estranged [[H5234]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and have burned incense [[H6999]] in it unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] whom [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] they [[H1992]] nor their fathers [[H1]] have known, [[H3045]] nor the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and have filled [[H4390]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] with the blood [[H1818]] of innocents; [[H5355]]

### 5
They have built [[H1129]]  also [[H853]] the high places [[H1116]] of Baal, [[H1168]] to burn [[H8313]] their sons [[H1121]] with fire [[H784]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] unto Baal, [[H1168]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] spake [[H1696]] neither [[H3808]] came [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] my mind: [[H3820]]

### 6
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be called [[H7121]] Tophet, [[H8612]] nor The valley [[H1516]] of the son [[H1121]] of Hinnom, [[H2011]] but [[H3588]] The valley [[H1516]] of slaughter. [[H2028]]

### 7
And I will make void [[H1238]] the counsel [[H6098]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] in this [[H2088]] place; [[H4725]] and I will cause them to fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] before [[H6440]] their enemies, [[H341]] and by the hands [[H3027]] of them that seek [[H1245]] their lives: [[H5315]]  and [[H853]] their carcases [[H5038]] will I give [[H5414]] to be meat [[H3978]] for the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] and for the beasts [[H929]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
And I will make [[H7760]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] desolate, [[H8047]] and an hissing; [[H8322]] every one [[H3605]] that passeth [[H5674]] thereby [[H5921]] shall be astonished [[H8074]] and hiss [[H8319]] because [[H5921]] of all [[H3605]] the plagues [[H4347]] thereof. [[H4347]]

### 9
And I will cause them to eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of their sons [[H1121]] and the flesh [[H1320]] of their daughters, [[H1323]] and they shall eat [[H398]] every one [[H376]] the flesh [[H1320]] of his friend [[H7453]] in the siege [[H4692]] and straitness, [[H4689]] wherewith [[H834]] their enemies, [[H341]] and they that seek [[H1245]] their lives, [[H5315]] shall straiten [[H6693]] them. [[H6693]]

### 10
Then shalt thou break [[H7665]] the bottle [[H1228]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the men [[H582]] that go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] thee, [[H854]]

### 11
And shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Even so [[H3602]] will I break [[H7665]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] and this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] as [[H834]] breaketh [[H7665]] a potter's [[H3335]] vessel, [[H3627]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H3201]] be made whole again: [[H7495]] and they shall bury [[H6912]] in Tophet, [[H8612]] till no [[H369]] place [[H4725]] to bury. [[H6912]]

### 12
Thus [[H3651]] will I do [[H6213]] unto this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and to the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof, and make [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] as Tophet: [[H8612]]

### 13
And the houses [[H1004]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the houses [[H1004]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] shall be [[H1961]] defiled [[H2931]] as the place [[H4725]] of Tophet, [[H8612]] because of all [[H3605]] the houses [[H1004]] upon [[H5921]] whose [[H834]] roofs [[H1406]] they have burned incense [[H6999]] unto all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and have poured out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] unto other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

### 14
Then came [[H935]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from Tophet, [[H8612]] whither [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had sent [[H7971]] him to prophesy; [[H5012]] and he stood [[H5975]] in the court [[H2691]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house; [[H1004]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]]

### 15
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] her towns [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I have pronounced [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] it, because [[H3588]] they have hardened [[H7185]] their necks, [[H6203]] that they might not [[H1115]] hear [[H8085]] my words.
