### 1
O ye children [[H1121]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] gather yourselves to flee [[H5756]] out of the midst [[H7130]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and blow [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] in Tekoa, [[H8620]] and set up [[H5375]] a sign [[H4864]] of fire in [[H5921]] Beth-haccerem: [[H1021]] for [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] appeareth [[H8259]] out of the north, [[H6828]] and great [[H1419]] destruction. [[H7667]]

### 2
I have likened [[H1819]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] to a comely [[H5000]] and delicate [[H6026]]

### 3
The shepherds [[H7462]] with their flocks [[H5739]] shall come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her; they shall pitch [[H8628]] tents [[H168]] against [[H5921]] her round about; [[H5439]] they shall feed [[H7462]] every one [[H376]] in [[H853]] his place. [[H3027]]

### 4
Prepare [[H6942]] ye war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] her; arise, [[H6965]] and let us go up [[H5927]] at noon. [[H6672]] Woe [[H188]] unto us! for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] goeth away, [[H6437]] for [[H3588]] the shadows [[H6752]] of the evening [[H6153]] are stretched out. [[H5186]]

### 5
Arise, [[H6965]] and let us go [[H5927]] by night, [[H3915]] and let us destroy [[H7843]] her palaces. [[H759]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] said, [[H559]] Hew ye down [[H3772]] trees, [[H6097]] and cast [[H8210]] a mount [[H5550]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]] this [[H1931]] the city [[H5892]] to be visited; [[H6485]] she wholly [[H3605]] oppression [[H6233]] in the midst [[H7130]] of her. [[H7130]]

### 7
fountain [[H953]] As a casteth out her [[H6979]] waters, [[H4325]] so [[H3651]] she casteth out [[H6979]] her wickedness: [[H7451]] violence [[H2555]] and spoil [[H7701]] is heard [[H8085]] in her; before [[H5921]] me [[H6440]] continually [[H8548]] grief [[H2483]] and wounds. [[H4347]]

### 8
Be thou instructed, [[H3256]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] lest [[H6435]] my soul [[H5315]] depart [[H3363]] from [[H4480]] thee; lest [[H6435]] I make [[H7760]] thee desolate, [[H8077]] a land [[H776]] not [[H3808]] inhabited. [[H3427]]

### 9
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] They shall throughly [[H5953]] glean [[H5953]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel [[H3478]] as a vine: [[H1612]] turn back [[H7725]] thine hand [[H3027]] as a grapegatherer [[H1219]] into [[H5921]] the baskets. [[H5552]]

### 10
To [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] shall I speak, [[H1696]] and give warning, [[H5749]] that they may hear? [[H8085]] behold, [[H2009]] their ear [[H241]] uncircumcised, [[H6189]] and they cannot [[H3201]] hearken: [[H7181]] behold, [[H2009]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is [[H1961]] unto them a reproach; [[H2781]] they have no [[H3808]] delight [[H2654]] in it. [[H2654]]

### 11
Therefore I am full [[H4392]] of [[H854]] the fury [[H2534]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] I am weary [[H3811]] with holding in: [[H3557]] I will pour it out [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] the children [[H5768]] abroad, [[H2351]] and upon [[H5921]] the assembly [[H5475]] of young men [[H970]] together: [[H3162]] for [[H3588]] even [[H1571]] the husband [[H376]] with [[H5973]] the wife [[H802]] shall be taken, [[H3920]] the aged [[H2205]] with [[H5973]] full [[H4390]] of days. [[H3117]]

### 12
And their houses [[H1004]] shall be turned [[H5437]] unto others, [[H312]] fields [[H7704]] and wives [[H802]] together: [[H3162]] for [[H3588]] I will stretch out [[H5186]] my hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] from the least [[H6996]] of them even unto [[H5704]] the greatest [[H1419]] of them every one [[H3605]] given to [[H1214]] covetousness; [[H1215]] and from the prophet [[H5030]] even unto [[H5704]] the priest [[H3548]] every one [[H3605]] dealeth [[H6213]] falsely. [[H8267]]

### 14
They have healed [[H7495]]  also [[H853]] the hurt [[H7667]] of my people [[H5971]] slightly, [[H7043]] saying, [[H559]] Peace, [[H7965]] peace; [[H7965]] when no [[H369]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 15
Were they ashamed [[H3001]] when [[H3588]] they had committed [[H6213]] abomination? [[H8441]] nay, [[H1571]] they were not [[H3808]] at all [[H954]] ashamed, [[H954]] neither [[H1571]] could [[H3045]] they blush: [[H3637]] therefore [[H3651]] they shall fall [[H5307]] among them that fall: [[H5307]] at the time [[H6256]] I visit [[H6485]] them they shall be cast down, [[H3782]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Stand [[H5975]] ye in [[H5921]] the ways, [[H1870]] and see, [[H7200]] and ask [[H7592]] for the old [[H5769]] paths, [[H5410]] where [[H335]] the good [[H2896]] way, [[H1870]] and walk [[H1980]] therein, and ye shall find [[H4672]] rest [[H4771]] for your souls. [[H5315]] But they said, [[H559]] We will not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]]

### 17
Also I set [[H6965]] watchmen [[H6822]] over [[H5921]] you, Hearken [[H7181]] to the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet. [[H7782]] But they said, [[H559]] We will not [[H3808]] hearken. [[H7181]]

### 18
Therefore [[H3651]] hear, [[H8085]] ye nations, [[H1471]] and know, [[H3045]] O congregation, [[H5712]] what [[H834]] among them. [[H834]]

### 19
Hear, [[H8085]] O earth: [[H776]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] the fruit [[H6529]] of their thoughts, [[H4284]] because [[H3588]] they have not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H7181]] unto [[H5921]] my words, [[H1697]] nor to my law, [[H8451]] but rejected [[H3988]] it. [[H3988]]

### 20
To what [[H4100]] purpose [[H2088]] cometh [[H935]] there to me incense [[H3828]] from Sheba, [[H7614]] and the sweet [[H2896]] cane [[H7070]] from a far [[H4801]] country? [[H776]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] not [[H3808]] acceptable, [[H7522]] nor [[H3808]] your sacrifices [[H2077]] sweet [[H6149]] unto me. [[H6149]]

### 21
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will lay [[H5414]] stumblingblocks [[H4383]] before [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and the fathers [[H1]] and the sons [[H1121]] together [[H3162]] shall fall [[H3782]] upon them; the neighbour [[H7934]] and his friend [[H7453]] shall perish. [[H6]]

### 22
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] a people [[H5971]] cometh [[H935]] from the north [[H6828]] country, [[H776]] and a great [[H1419]] nation [[H1471]] shall be raised [[H5782]] from the sides [[H3411]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 23
They shall lay hold [[H2388]] on bow [[H7198]] and spear; [[H3591]] they [[H1931]] cruel, [[H394]] and have no [[H3808]] mercy; [[H7355]] their voice [[H6963]] roareth [[H1993]] like the sea; [[H3220]] and they ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] horses, [[H5483]] set in array [[H6186]] as men [[H376]] for war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] thee, O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion. [[H6726]]

### 24
We have heard [[H8085]] the fame [[H8089]] thereof: our hands [[H3027]] wax feeble: [[H7503]] anguish [[H6869]] hath taken hold [[H2388]] of us, pain, [[H2427]] as of a woman in travail. [[H3205]]

### 25
Go not forth [[H3318]] into the field, [[H7704]] nor [[H408]] walk [[H1980]] by the way; [[H1870]] for [[H3588]] the sword [[H2719]] of the enemy [[H341]] fear [[H4032]] on every side. [[H5439]]

### 26
O daughter [[H1323]] of my people, [[H5971]] gird [[H2296]] with sackcloth, [[H8242]] and wallow thyself [[H6428]] in ashes: [[H665]] make [[H6213]] thee mourning, [[H60]] an only son, [[H3173]] most bitter [[H8563]] lamentation: [[H4553]] for [[H3588]] the spoiler [[H7703]] shall suddenly [[H6597]] come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 27
I have set [[H5414]] thee a tower [[H969]] a fortress [[H4013]] among my people, [[H5971]] that thou mayest know [[H3045]] and try [[H974]] their way. [[H1870]]

### 28
They all [[H3605]] grievous [[H5493]] revolters, [[H5637]] walking [[H1980]] with slanders: [[H7400]] brass [[H5178]] and iron; [[H1270]] they [[H1992]] all [[H3605]] corrupters. [[H7843]]

### 29
The bellows [[H4647]] are burned, [[H2787]] the lead [[H5777]] is consumed [[H8552]] of the fire; [[H800]] the founder [[H6884]] melteth [[H6884]] in vain: [[H7723]] for the wicked [[H7451]] are not [[H3808]] plucked away. [[H5423]]

### 30
Reprobate [[H3988]] silver [[H3701]] shall call [[H7121]] them, because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath rejected [[H3988]] them. [[H3988]]
