### 1
Hear [[H8085]]  ye [[H853]] the word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] speaketh [[H1696]] unto [[H5921]] you, O house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Learn [[H3925]] not [[H408]] the way [[H1870]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] and be not [[H408]] dismayed [[H2865]] at the signs [[H226]] of heaven; [[H8064]] for [[H3588]] the heathen [[H1471]] are dismayed [[H2865]] at them. [[H1992]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the customs [[H2708]] of the people [[H5971]] vain: [[H1892]] for [[H3588]] cutteth [[H3772]] a tree [[H6086]] out of the forest, [[H3293]] the work [[H4639]] of the hands [[H3027]] of the workman, [[H2796]] with the axe. [[H4621]]

### 4
They deck [[H3302]] it with silver [[H3701]] and with gold; [[H2091]] they fasten [[H2388]] it with nails [[H4548]] and with hammers, [[H4717]] that it move [[H6328]] not. [[H6328]]

### 5
They [[H1992]] upright [[H4749]] as the palm tree, [[H8560]] but speak [[H1696]] not: [[H3808]] they must needs [[H5375]] be borne, [[H5375]] because [[H3588]] they cannot [[H3808]] go. [[H6805]] Be not [[H408]] afraid [[H3372]] of them; for [[H3588]] they cannot [[H3808]] do evil, [[H7489]] neither [[H369]] also [[H1571]] in [[H854]] them to do good. [[H3190]]

### 6
Forasmuch as none [[H369]] like unto thee, [[H3644]] O Lord; [[H3068]] thou [[H859]] great, [[H1419]] and thy name [[H8034]] great [[H1419]] in might. [[H1369]]

### 7
Who [[H4310]] would not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] thee, O King [[H4428]] of nations? [[H1471]] for [[H3588]] to thee doth it appertain: [[H2969]] forasmuch [[H3588]] as among all [[H3605]] the wise [[H2450]] of the nations, [[H1471]] and in all [[H3605]] their kingdoms, [[H4438]] none [[H369]] like unto thee. [[H369]]

### 8
But they are altogether [[H259]] brutish [[H1197]] and foolish: [[H3688]] the stock [[H6086]] a doctrine [[H4148]] of vanities. [[H1892]]

### 9
Silver [[H3701]] spread into plates [[H7554]] is brought [[H935]] from Tarshish, [[H8659]] and gold [[H2091]] from Uphaz, [[H210]] the work [[H4639]] of the workman, [[H2796]] and of the hands [[H3027]] of the founder: [[H6884]] blue [[H8504]] and purple [[H713]] their clothing: [[H3830]] they all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of cunning [[H2450]]

### 10
But the Lord [[H3068]] the true [[H571]] God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] the living [[H2416]] God, [[H430]] and an everlasting [[H5769]] king: [[H4428]] at his wrath [[H7110]] the earth [[H776]] shall tremble, [[H7493]] and the nations [[H1471]] shall not [[H3808]] be able to abide [[H3557]] his indignation. [[H2195]]

### 11
Thus [[H1836]] shall ye say [[H560]] unto them, The gods [[H426]] that [[H1768]] have not [[H3809]] made [[H5648]] the heavens [[H8065]] and the earth, [[H778]] they shall perish [[H7]] from the earth, [[H772]] and from [[H4481]] under [[H8460]] these [[H429]] heavens. [[H8065]]

### 12
He hath made [[H6213]] the earth [[H776]] by his power, [[H3581]] he hath established [[H3559]] the world [[H8398]] by his wisdom, [[H2451]] and hath stretched out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] by his discretion. [[H8394]]

### 13
When he uttereth [[H5414]] his voice, [[H6963]] a multitude [[H1995]] of waters [[H4325]] in the heavens, [[H8064]] and he causeth the vapours [[H5387]] to ascend [[H5927]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the earth; [[H776]] he maketh [[H6213]] lightnings [[H1300]] with rain, [[H4306]] and bringeth forth [[H3318]] the wind [[H7307]] out of his treasures. [[H214]]

### 14
Every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] is brutish [[H1197]] in knowledge: [[H1847]] every [[H3605]] founder [[H6884]] is confounded [[H3001]] by the graven image: [[H6459]] for [[H3588]] his molten image [[H5262]] falsehood, [[H8267]] and no [[H3808]] breath [[H7307]] in them. [[H7307]]

### 15
They [[H1992]] vanity, [[H1892]] the work [[H4639]] of errors: [[H8595]] in the time [[H6256]] of their visitation [[H6486]] they shall perish. [[H6]]

### 16
The portion [[H2506]] of Jacob [[H3290]] not [[H3808]] like them: [[H428]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the former [[H3335]] of all [[H3605]] and Israel [[H3478]] the rod [[H7626]] of his inheritance: [[H5159]] The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] his name. [[H8034]]

### 17
Gather up [[H622]] thy wares [[H3666]] out of the land, [[H776]] O inhabitant [[H3427]] of the fortress. [[H4692]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will sling out [[H7049]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] at this [[H2063]] once, [[H6471]] and will distress [[H6887]] them, that [[H4616]] they may find [[H4672]]

### 19
Woe [[H188]] is me for [[H5921]] my hurt! [[H7667]] my wound [[H4347]] is grievous: [[H2470]] but I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] Truly [[H389]] this [[H2088]] a grief, [[H2483]] and I must bear [[H5375]] it. [[H5375]]

### 20
My tabernacle [[H168]] is spoiled, [[H7703]] and all [[H3605]] my cords [[H4340]] are broken: [[H5423]] my children [[H1121]] are gone forth [[H3318]] of me, and they not: [[H369]] none [[H369]] to stretch forth [[H5186]] my tent [[H168]] any more, [[H5750]] and to set up [[H6965]] my curtains. [[H3407]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] the pastors [[H7462]] are become brutish, [[H1197]] and have not [[H3808]] sought [[H1875]] the Lord: [[H3068]] therefore [[H5921]] they shall not [[H3808]] prosper, [[H7919]] and all [[H3605]] their flocks [[H4830]] shall be scattered. [[H6327]]

### 22
Behold, [[H2009]] the noise [[H6963]] of the bruit [[H8052]] is come, [[H935]] and a great [[H1419]] commotion [[H7494]] out of the north [[H6828]] country, [[H776]] to make [[H7760]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] desolate, [[H8077]] a den [[H4583]] of dragons. [[H8577]]

### 23
O Lord, [[H3068]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the way [[H1870]] of man [[H120]] not [[H3808]] in himself: not [[H3808]] in man [[H376]] that walketh [[H1980]] to direct [[H3559]] his steps. [[H6806]]

### 24
O Lord, [[H3068]] correct [[H3256]] me, but with [[H389]] judgment; [[H4941]] not [[H408]] in thine anger, [[H639]] lest [[H6435]] thou bring me to nothing. [[H4591]]

### 25
Pour out [[H8210]] thy fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] know [[H3045]] thee not, [[H3808]] and upon [[H5921]] the families [[H4940]] that [[H834]] call [[H7121]] not [[H3808]] on thy name: [[H8034]] for [[H3588]] they have eaten up [[H398]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and devoured [[H398]] him, and consumed [[H3615]] him, and have made his habitation [[H5116]] desolate.
