### 1
At the same [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] will I be [[H1961]] the God [[H430]] of all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they [[H1992]] shall be [[H1961]] my people. [[H5971]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] The people [[H5971]] left [[H8300]] of the sword [[H2719]] found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in the wilderness; [[H4057]] Israel, [[H3478]] when I went [[H1980]] to cause him to rest. [[H7280]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] hath appeared [[H7200]] of old [[H7350]] unto me, Yea, I have loved [[H157]] thee with an everlasting [[H5769]] love: [[H160]] therefore [[H5921]] with lovingkindness [[H2617]] have I drawn [[H4900]] thee. [[H4900]]

### 4
Again [[H5750]] I will build [[H1129]] thee, and thou shalt be built, [[H1129]] O virgin [[H1330]] of Israel: [[H3478]] thou shalt again [[H5750]] be adorned [[H5710]] with thy tabrets, [[H8596]] and shalt go forth [[H3318]] in the dances [[H4234]] of them that make merry. [[H7832]]

### 5
Thou shalt yet [[H5750]] plant [[H5193]] vines [[H3754]] upon the mountains [[H2022]] of Samaria: [[H8111]] the planters [[H5193]] shall plant, [[H5193]] and shall eat as common things. [[H2490]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] there shall be [[H3426]] a day, [[H3117]] the watchmen [[H5341]] upon the mount [[H2022]] Ephraim [[H669]] shall cry, [[H7121]] Arise [[H6965]] ye, and let us go up [[H5927]] to Zion [[H6726]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Sing [[H7442]] with gladness [[H8057]] for Jacob, [[H3290]] and shout [[H6670]] among the chief [[H7218]] of the nations: [[H1471]] publish [[H8085]] ye, praise [[H1984]] ye, and say, [[H559]] O Lord, [[H3068]] save [[H3467]] thy people, [[H5971]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] them from the north [[H6828]] country, [[H776]] and gather [[H6908]] them from the coasts [[H3411]] of the earth, [[H776]] with them the blind [[H5787]] and the lame, [[H6455]] the woman with child [[H2030]] and her that travaileth with child [[H3205]] together: [[H3162]] a great [[H1419]] company [[H6951]] shall return [[H7725]] thither. [[H7725]]

### 9
They shall come [[H935]] with weeping, [[H1065]] and with supplications [[H8469]] will I lead [[H2986]] them: I will cause them to walk [[H1980]] by [[H413]] the rivers [[H5158]] of waters [[H4325]] in a straight [[H3477]] way, [[H1870]] wherein they shall not [[H3808]] stumble: [[H3782]] for [[H3588]] I am [[H1961]] a father [[H1]] to Israel, [[H3478]] and Ephraim [[H669]] my firstborn. [[H1060]]

### 10
Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] O ye nations, [[H1471]] and declare [[H5046]] in the isles [[H339]] afar off, [[H4801]] and say, [[H559]] He that scattered [[H2219]] Israel [[H3478]] will gather [[H6908]] him, and keep [[H8104]] him, as a shepherd [[H7462]] his flock. [[H5739]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath redeemed [[H6299]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and ransomed [[H1350]] him from the hand [[H3027]] of stronger [[H2389]] than [[H4480]] he. [[H4480]]

### 12
Therefore they shall come [[H935]] and sing [[H7442]] in the height [[H4791]] of Zion, [[H6726]] and shall flow together [[H5102]] to [[H413]] the goodness [[H2898]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] for [[H5921]] wheat, [[H1715]] and for [[H5921]] wine, [[H8492]] and for [[H5921]] oil, [[H3323]] and for [[H5921]] the young [[H1121]] of the flock [[H6629]] and of the herd: [[H1241]] and their soul [[H5315]] shall be [[H1961]] as a watered [[H7302]] garden; [[H1588]] and they shall not [[H3808]] sorrow [[H1669]] any more [[H3254]] at all. [[H3254]]

### 13
Then [[H227]] shall the virgin [[H1330]] rejoice [[H8055]] in the dance, [[H4234]] both young men [[H970]] and old [[H2205]] together: [[H3162]] for I will turn [[H2015]] their mourning [[H60]] into joy, [[H8342]] and will comfort [[H5162]] them, and make them rejoice [[H8055]] from their sorrow. [[H3015]]

### 14
And I will satiate [[H7301]] the soul [[H5315]] of the priests [[H3548]] with fatness, [[H1880]] and my people [[H5971]] shall be satisfied with [[H7646]] my goodness, [[H2898]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] A voice [[H6963]] was heard [[H8085]] in Ramah, [[H7414]] lamentation, [[H5092]] bitter [[H8563]] weeping; [[H1065]] Rahel [[H7354]] weeping [[H1058]] for [[H5921]] her children [[H1121]] refused [[H3985]] to be comforted [[H5162]] for [[H5921]] her children, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] they not. [[H3588]]

### 16
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Refrain [[H4513]] thy voice [[H6963]] from weeping, [[H1065]] and thine eyes [[H5869]] from tears: [[H1832]] for [[H3588]] thy work [[H6468]] shall be [[H3426]] rewarded, [[H7939]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and they shall come again [[H7725]] from the land [[H776]] of the enemy. [[H341]]

### 17
And there is [[H3426]] hope [[H8615]] in thine end, [[H319]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that thy children [[H1121]] shall come again [[H7725]] to their own border. [[H1366]]

### 18
I have surely [[H8085]] heard [[H8085]] Ephraim [[H669]] bemoaning himself [[H5110]] Thou hast chastised [[H3256]] me, and I was chastised, [[H3256]] as a bullock [[H5695]] unaccustomed [[H3808]] turn [[H7725]] thou me, and I shall be turned; [[H7725]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God. [[H430]]

### 19
Surely [[H3588]] after that [[H310]] I was turned, [[H7725]] I repented; [[H5162]] and after that [[H310]] I was instructed, [[H3045]] I smote [[H5606]] upon [[H5921]] thigh: [[H3409]] I was ashamed, [[H954]] yea, even [[H1571]] confounded, [[H3637]] because [[H3588]] I did bear [[H5375]] the reproach [[H2781]] of my youth. [[H5271]]

### 20
Ephraim [[H669]] my dear [[H3357]] son? [[H1121]] a pleasant [[H8191]] child? [[H3206]] for [[H3588]] since [[H1767]] I spake [[H1696]] against him, I do earnestly [[H2142]] remember [[H2142]] him still: [[H5750]] therefore [[H5921]] my bowels [[H4578]] are troubled [[H1993]] for him; I will surely [[H7355]] have mercy [[H7355]] upon him, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
Set thee up [[H5324]] waymarks, [[H6725]] make [[H7760]] thee high heaps: [[H8564]] set [[H7896]] thine heart [[H3820]] toward the highway, [[H4546]] the way [[H1870]] thou wentest: [[H1980]] turn again, [[H7725]] O virgin [[H1330]] of Israel, [[H3478]] turn again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] these [[H428]] thy cities. [[H5892]]

### 22
How long [[H5704]] wilt thou go about, [[H2559]] O thou backsliding [[H7728]] daughter? [[H1323]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath created [[H1254]] a new thing [[H2319]] in the earth, [[H776]] A woman [[H5347]] shall compass [[H5437]] a man. [[H1397]]

### 23
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] As yet [[H5750]] they shall use [[H559]] this [[H2088]] speech [[H1697]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the cities [[H5892]] thereof, when I shall bring again [[H7725]] their captivity; [[H7622]] The Lord [[H3068]] bless [[H1288]] thee, O habitation [[H5116]] of justice, [[H6664]] mountain [[H2022]] of holiness. [[H6944]]

### 24
And there shall dwell [[H3427]] in Judah [[H3063]] itself, and in all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] thereof together, [[H3162]] husbandmen, [[H406]] and they go forth [[H5265]] with flocks. [[H5739]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] I have satiated [[H7301]] the weary [[H5889]] soul, [[H5315]] and I have replenished [[H4390]] every [[H3605]] sorrowful [[H1669]] soul. [[H5315]]

### 26
Upon [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] I awaked, [[H6974]] and beheld; [[H7200]] and my sleep [[H8142]] was sweet [[H6149]] unto me. [[H6149]]

### 27
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will sow [[H2232]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] with the seed [[H2233]] of man, [[H120]] and with the seed [[H2233]] of beast. [[H929]]

### 28
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] like as [[H834]] I have watched over [[H8245]] them, to pluck up, [[H5428]] and to break down, [[H5422]] and to throw down, [[H2040]] and to destroy, [[H6]] and to afflict; [[H7489]] so [[H3651]] will I watch over [[H8245]] them, to build, [[H1129]] and to plant, [[H5193]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 29
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] they shall say [[H559]] no [[H3808]] more, [[H5750]] The fathers [[H1]] have eaten [[H398]] a sour grape, [[H1155]] and the children's [[H1121]] teeth [[H8127]] are set on edge. [[H6949]]

### 30
But [[H3588]] every one [[H376]] shall die [[H4191]] for his own iniquity: [[H5771]] every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] that eateth [[H398]] the sour grape, [[H1155]] his teeth [[H8127]] shall be set on edge. [[H6949]]

### 31
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will make [[H3772]] a new [[H2319]] covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and with [[H854]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah: [[H3063]]

### 32
Not [[H3808]] according to the covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] I made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] their fathers [[H1]] in the day [[H3117]] I took [[H2388]] them by the hand [[H3027]] to bring out [[H3318]] them of the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] which [[H834]] my covenant [[H1285]] they [[H1992]] brake, [[H6565]] although I [[H595]] was an husband [[H1166]] unto them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 33
But [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] the covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] I will make [[H3772]] with [[H854]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] After [[H310]] those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I will put [[H5414]] my law [[H8451]] in their inward parts, [[H7130]] and write [[H3789]] it in [[H5921]] their hearts; [[H3820]] and will be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] and they [[H1992]] shall be [[H1961]] my people. [[H5971]]

### 34
And they shall teach [[H3925]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] every man [[H376]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] and every man [[H376]] his brother, [[H251]] saying, [[H559]] Know [[H3045]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] they shall all [[H3605]] know [[H3045]] me, from the least [[H6996]] of them unto [[H5704]] the greatest [[H1419]] of them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I will forgive [[H5545]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] and I will remember [[H2142]] their sin [[H2403]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H3808]]

### 35
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which giveth [[H5414]] the sun [[H8121]] for a light [[H216]] by day, [[H3119]] the ordinances [[H2708]] of the moon [[H3394]] and of the stars [[H3556]] for a light [[H216]] by night, [[H3915]] which divideth [[H7280]] the sea [[H3220]] when the waves [[H1530]] thereof roar; [[H1993]] The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] his name: [[H8034]]

### 36
If [[H518]] those [[H428]] ordinances [[H2706]] depart [[H4185]] from before [[H6440]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the seed [[H2233]] of Israel [[H3478]] also [[H1571]] shall cease [[H7673]] from being [[H1961]] a nation [[H1471]] before [[H6440]] me for ever. [[H3117]]

### 37
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] If [[H518]] heaven [[H8064]] above [[H4605]] can be measured, [[H4058]] and the foundations [[H4146]] of the earth [[H776]] searched out [[H2713]] beneath, [[H4295]] I [[H589]] will also [[H1571]] cast off [[H3988]] all [[H3605]] the seed [[H2233]] of Israel [[H3478]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they have done, [[H6213]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 38
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that the city [[H5892]] shall be built [[H1129]] to the Lord [[H3068]] from the tower [[H4026]] of Hananeel [[H2606]] unto the gate [[H8179]] of the corner. [[H6438]]

### 39
And the measuring [[H4060]] line [[H6961]] shall yet [[H5750]] go forth [[H3318]] over against [[H5048]] it upon [[H5921]] the hill [[H1389]] Gareb, [[H1619]] and shall compass about [[H5437]] to Goath. [[H1601]]

### 40
And the whole [[H3605]] valley [[H6010]] of the dead bodies, [[H6297]] and of the ashes, [[H1880]] and all [[H3605]] the fields [[H8309]] unto [[H5704]] the brook [[H5158]] of Kidron, [[H6939]] unto [[H5704]] the corner [[H6438]] of the horse [[H5483]] gate [[H8179]] toward the east, [[H4217]] holy [[H6944]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] it shall not [[H3808]] be plucked up, [[H5428]] nor [[H3808]] thrown down [[H2040]] any more [[H5750]] for ever. [[H5769]]
