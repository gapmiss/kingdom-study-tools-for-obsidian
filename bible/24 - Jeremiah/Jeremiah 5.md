### 1
Run ye to and fro [[H7751]] through the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and see [[H7200]] now, [[H4994]] and know, [[H3045]] and seek [[H1245]] in the broad places [[H7339]] thereof, if [[H518]] ye can find [[H4672]] a man, [[H376]] if [[H518]] there be [[H3426]] that executeth [[H6213]] judgment, [[H4941]] that seeketh [[H1245]] the truth; [[H530]] and I will pardon [[H5545]] it. [[H5545]]

### 2
And though [[H518]] they say, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] liveth; [[H2416]] surely [[H3651]] they swear [[H7650]] falsely. [[H8267]]

### 3
O Lord, [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] thine eyes [[H5869]] upon the truth? [[H530]] thou hast stricken [[H5221]] them, but they have not [[H3808]] grieved; [[H2342]] thou hast consumed [[H3615]] them, they have refused [[H3985]] to receive [[H3947]] correction: [[H4148]] they have made their faces [[H6440]] harder [[H2388]] than a rock; [[H5553]] they have refused [[H3985]] to return. [[H7725]]

### 4
Therefore I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] these [[H1992]] poor; [[H1800]] they are foolish: [[H2973]] for [[H3588]] they know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the way [[H1870]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the judgment [[H4941]] of their God. [[H430]]

### 5
I will get [[H1980]] me unto [[H413]] the great men, [[H1419]] and will speak unto [[H1696]] them; for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] have known [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the judgment [[H4941]] of their God: [[H430]] but [[H389]] these [[H1992]] have altogether [[H3162]] broken [[H7665]] the yoke, [[H5923]] burst [[H5423]] the bonds. [[H4147]]

### 6
Wherefore [[H5921]] a lion [[H738]] out of the forest [[H3293]] shall slay [[H5221]] them, a wolf [[H2061]] of the evenings [[H6160]] shall spoil [[H7703]] them, a leopard [[H5246]] shall watch [[H8245]] over [[H5921]] their cities: [[H5892]] every one [[H3605]] that goeth out [[H3318]] thence shall [[H2007]] be torn in pieces: [[H2963]] because [[H3588]] their transgressions [[H6588]] are many, [[H7231]] their backslidings [[H4878]] are increased. [[H6105]]

### 7
How [[H335]] shall I pardon [[H5545]] thee for this? [[H2063]] thy children [[H1121]] have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and sworn [[H7650]] by no [[H3808]] gods: [[H430]] when I had fed them to the full, [[H7650]] they then committed adultery, [[H5003]] and assembled themselves by troops [[H1413]] in the harlots' [[H2181]] houses. [[H1004]]

### 8
They were [[H1961]] fed [[H2109]] horses [[H5483]] in the morning: [[H7904]] every one [[H376]] neighed [[H6670]] after [[H413]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife. [[H802]]

### 9
Shall I not [[H3808]] visit [[H6485]] for [[H5921]] these [[H428]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and [[H518]] shall not [[H3808]] my soul [[H5315]] be avenged [[H5358]] on such [[H834]] a nation [[H1471]] as this? [[H1471]]

### 10
Go ye up [[H5927]] upon her walls, [[H8284]] and destroy; [[H7843]] but make [[H6213]] not [[H408]] a full end: [[H3617]] take away [[H5493]] her battlements; [[H5189]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] the Lord's. [[H3068]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] have dealt very [[H898]] treacherously [[H898]] against me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
They have belied [[H3584]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] he; [[H1931]] neither [[H3808]] shall evil [[H7451]] come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us; neither [[H3808]] shall we see [[H7200]] sword [[H2719]] nor famine: [[H7458]]

### 13
And the prophets [[H5030]] shall become [[H1961]] wind, [[H7307]] and the word [[H1699]] not [[H369]] in them: thus [[H3541]] shall it be done [[H6213]] unto them. [[H6213]]

### 14
Wherefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Because [[H3282]] ye speak [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] behold, [[H2005]] I will make [[H5414]] my words [[H1697]] in thy mouth [[H6310]] fire, [[H784]] and this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] wood, [[H6086]] and it shall devour [[H398]] them. [[H398]]

### 15
Lo, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] a nation [[H1471]] upon [[H5921]] you from far, [[H4801]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] it [[H1931]] a mighty [[H386]] nation, [[H1471]] it [[H1931]] an ancient [[H5769]] nation, [[H1471]] a nation [[H1471]] whose language [[H3956]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] understandest [[H8085]] what [[H4100]] they say. [[H1696]]

### 16
Their quiver [[H827]] as an open [[H6605]] sepulchre, [[H6913]] they all [[H3605]] mighty men. [[H1368]]

### 17
And they shall eat up [[H398]] thine harvest, [[H7105]] and thy bread, [[H3899]] thy sons [[H1121]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] should eat: [[H398]] they shall eat up [[H398]] thy flocks [[H6629]] and thine herds: [[H1241]] they shall eat up [[H398]] thy vines [[H1612]] and thy fig trees: [[H8384]] they shall impoverish [[H7567]] thy fenced [[H4013]] cities, [[H5892]] wherein [[H834]] thou [[H2007]] trustedst, [[H982]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 18
Nevertheless [[H1571]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I will not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] a full end [[H3617]] with [[H854]] you. [[H854]]

### 19
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] ye shall say, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H8478]] doeth [[H6213]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] unto us? then shalt thou answer [[H559]] them, Like [[H834]] as ye have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and served [[H5647]] strange [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] in your land, [[H776]] so [[H3651]] shall ye serve [[H5647]] strangers [[H2114]] in a land [[H776]] not [[H3808]] yours. [[H3808]]

### 20
Declare [[H5046]] this [[H2063]] in the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and publish [[H8085]] it in Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]]

### 21
Hear [[H8085]] now [[H4994]] this, [[H2063]] O foolish [[H5530]] people, [[H5971]] and without [[H369]] understanding; [[H3820]] which have eyes, [[H5869]] and see [[H7200]] not; [[H3808]] which have ears, [[H241]] and hear [[H8085]] not: [[H8085]]

### 22
Fear [[H3372]] ye not [[H3808]] me? saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] will ye not [[H3808]] tremble [[H2342]] at my presence, [[H6440]] which [[H834]] have placed [[H7760]] the sand [[H2344]] the bound [[H1366]] of the sea [[H3220]] by a perpetual [[H5769]] decree, [[H2706]] that it cannot [[H3808]] pass [[H5674]] it: and though the waves [[H1530]] thereof toss themselves, [[H1607]] yet can they not [[H3808]] prevail; [[H3201]] though they roar, [[H1993]] yet can they not [[H3808]] pass over [[H5674]] it? [[H5674]]

### 23
But this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] hath [[H1961]] a revolting [[H5637]] and a rebellious [[H4784]] heart; [[H3820]] they are revolted [[H5493]] and gone. [[H1980]]

### 24
Neither [[H3808]] say [[H559]] they in their heart, [[H3824]] Let us now [[H4994]] fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] that giveth [[H5414]] rain, [[H1653]] both the former [[H3138]] and the latter, [[H4456]] in his season: [[H6256]] he reserveth [[H8104]] unto us the appointed [[H2708]] weeks [[H7620]] of the harvest. [[H7105]]

### 25
Your iniquities [[H5771]] have turned away [[H5186]] these [[H428]] and your sins [[H2403]] have withholden [[H4513]] good [[H2896]] from [[H4480]] you. [[H4480]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] among my people [[H5971]] are found [[H4672]] wicked [[H7563]] they lay wait, [[H7789]] as he that setteth [[H7918]] snares; [[H3353]] they set [[H5324]] a trap, [[H4889]] they catch [[H3920]] men. [[H582]]

### 27
As a cage [[H3619]] is full [[H4392]] of birds, [[H5775]] so [[H3651]] their houses [[H1004]] full [[H4392]] of deceit: [[H4820]] therefore [[H5921]] they are become great, [[H1431]] and waxen rich. [[H6238]]

### 28
They are waxen fat, [[H8080]] they shine: [[H6245]] yea, [[H1571]] they overpass [[H5674]] the deeds [[H1697]] of the wicked: [[H7451]] they judge [[H1777]] not [[H3808]] the cause, [[H1779]] the cause [[H1779]] of the fatherless, [[H3490]] yet they prosper; [[H6743]] and the right [[H4941]] of the needy [[H34]] do they not [[H3808]] judge. [[H8199]]

### 29
Shall I not [[H3808]] visit [[H6485]] for [[H5921]] these [[H428]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] shall not [[H3808]] my soul [[H5315]] be avenged [[H5358]] on such [[H834]] a nation [[H1471]] as this? [[H1471]]

### 30
A wonderful [[H8047]] and horrible thing [[H8186]] is committed [[H1961]] in the land; [[H776]]

### 31
The prophets [[H5030]] prophesy [[H5012]] falsely, [[H8267]] and the priests [[H3548]] bear rule [[H7287]] by [[H5921]] their means; [[H3027]] and my people [[H5971]] love [[H157]] so: [[H3651]] and what [[H4100]] will ye do [[H6213]] in the end [[H319]] thereof? [[H319]]
