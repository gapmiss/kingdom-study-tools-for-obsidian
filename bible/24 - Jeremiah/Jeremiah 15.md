### 1
Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, Though [[H518]] Moses [[H4872]] and Samuel [[H8050]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] me, my mind [[H5315]] not [[H369]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people: [[H5971]] cast out [[H7971]] of [[H5921]] my sight, [[H6440]] and let them go forth. [[H3318]]

### 2
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H3588]] they say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, Whither [[H575]] shall we go forth? [[H3318]] then thou shalt tell [[H559]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Such as [[H834]] for death, [[H4194]] to death; [[H4194]] and such as [[H834]] for the sword, [[H2719]] to the sword; [[H2719]] and such as [[H834]] for the famine, [[H7458]] to the famine; [[H7458]] and such as [[H834]] for the captivity, [[H7628]] to the captivity. [[H7628]]

### 3
And I will appoint [[H6485]] over [[H5921]] them four [[H702]] kinds, [[H4940]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] the sword [[H2719]] to slay, [[H2026]] and the dogs [[H3611]] to tear, [[H5498]] and the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] and the beasts [[H929]] of the earth, [[H776]] to devour [[H398]] and destroy. [[H7843]]

### 4
And I will cause [[H5414]] them to be removed [[H2113]] into all [[H3605]] kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth, [[H776]] because of [[H1558]] Manasseh [[H4519]] the son [[H1121]] of Hezekiah [[H3169]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] for [[H5921]] which [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] shall have pity [[H2550]] upon [[H5921]] thee, O Jerusalem? [[H3389]] or who [[H4310]] shall bemoan [[H5110]] thee? or who [[H4310]] shall go aside [[H5493]] to ask [[H7592]] how thou doest? [[H7965]]

### 6
Thou [[H859]] hast forsaken [[H5203]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] thou art gone [[H1980]] backward: [[H268]] therefore will I stretch out [[H5186]] my hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] thee, and destroy [[H7843]] thee; I am weary [[H3811]] with repenting. [[H5162]]

### 7
And I will fan [[H2219]] them with a fan [[H4214]] in the gates [[H8179]] of the land; [[H776]] I will bereave [[H7921]] of children, I will destroy [[H6]] my people, [[H5971]] they return [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] from their ways. [[H1870]]

### 8
Their widows [[H490]] are increased [[H6105]] to me above the sand [[H2344]] of the seas: [[H3220]] I have brought [[H935]] upon them against [[H5921]] the mother [[H517]] of the young men [[H970]] a spoiler [[H7703]] at noonday: [[H6672]] I have caused to fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] it suddenly, [[H6597]] and terrors [[H928]] upon the city. [[H5892]]

### 9
She that hath borne [[H3205]] seven [[H7651]] languisheth: [[H535]] she hath given up [[H5301]] the ghost; [[H5315]] her sun [[H8121]] is gone down [[H935]] while [[H5750]] yet day: [[H3119]] she hath been ashamed [[H954]] and confounded: [[H2659]] and the residue [[H7611]] of them will I deliver [[H5414]] to the sword [[H2719]] before [[H6440]] their enemies, [[H341]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
Woe [[H188]] is me, my mother, [[H517]] that [[H3588]] thou hast borne [[H3205]] me a man [[H376]] of strife [[H7379]] and a man [[H376]] of contention [[H4066]] to the whole [[H3605]] earth! [[H776]] I have neither [[H3808]] lent on usury, [[H5383]] nor [[H3808]] men have lent to me on usury; [[H5383]] every one [[H3605]] of them doth curse [[H7043]] me. [[H7043]]

### 11
The Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Verily [[H3808]] it shall be well [[H2896]] with thy remnant; [[H8293]] verily [[H518]]  I will cause [[H853]] the enemy [[H341]] to entreat [[H6293]] thee in the time [[H6256]] of evil [[H7451]] and in the time [[H6256]] of affliction. [[H6869]]

### 12
Shall iron [[H1270]] break [[H7489]] the northern [[H6828]] iron [[H1270]] and the steel? [[H5178]]

### 13
Thy substance [[H2428]] and thy treasures [[H214]] will I give [[H5414]] to the spoil [[H957]] without [[H3808]] price, [[H4242]] and for all [[H3605]] thy sins, [[H2403]] even in all [[H3605]] thy borders. [[H1366]]

### 14
And I will make to pass [[H5674]] with [[H854]] thine enemies [[H341]] into a land [[H776]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not: [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] a fire [[H784]] is kindled [[H6919]] in mine anger, [[H639]] shall burn [[H3344]] upon [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 15
O Lord, [[H3068]] thou [[H859]] knowest: [[H3045]] remember [[H2142]] me, and visit [[H6485]] me, and revenge [[H5358]] me of my persecutors; [[H7291]] take away [[H3947]] me not [[H408]] in thy longsuffering: [[H639]] know [[H3045]] that for [[H5921]] thy sake I have suffered [[H5375]] rebuke. [[H2781]]

### 16
Thy words [[H1697]] were found, [[H4672]] and I did eat [[H398]] them; and thy word [[H1697]] was [[H1961]] unto me the joy [[H8342]] and rejoicing [[H8057]] of mine heart: [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] I am called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] thy name, [[H8034]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 17
I sat [[H3427]] not [[H3808]] in the assembly [[H5475]] of the mockers, [[H7832]] nor rejoiced; [[H5937]] I sat [[H3427]] alone [[H910]] because [[H6440]] of thy hand: [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] thou hast filled [[H4390]] me with indignation. [[H2195]]

### 18
Why [[H4100]] is [[H1961]] my pain [[H3511]] perpetual, [[H5331]] and my wound [[H4347]] incurable, [[H605]] refuseth [[H3985]] to be healed? [[H7495]] wilt thou be altogether [[H1961]] unto me as [[H3644]] a liar, [[H391]] waters [[H4325]] fail? [[H539]]

### 19
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] If [[H518]] thou return, [[H7725]] then will I bring thee again, [[H7725]] thou shalt stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] me: and if [[H518]] thou take forth [[H3318]] the precious [[H3368]] from the vile, [[H2151]] thou shalt be [[H1961]] as my mouth: [[H6310]] let them return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] thee; but return [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 20
And I will make [[H5414]] thee unto this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] a fenced [[H1219]] brasen [[H5178]] wall: [[H2346]] and they shall fight [[H3898]] against [[H413]] thee, but they shall not [[H3808]] prevail [[H3201]] against thee: for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] thee to save [[H3467]] thee and to deliver [[H5337]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
And I will deliver [[H5337]] thee out of the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked, [[H7451]] and I will redeem [[H6299]] thee out of the hand [[H3709]] of the terrible. [[H6184]]
