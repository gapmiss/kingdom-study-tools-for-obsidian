The word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and all [[H3605]] his army, [[H2428]] and all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth [[H776]] of his dominion, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] fought [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] thereof, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Go [[H1980]] and speak [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and tell [[H559]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he shall burn [[H8313]] it with fire: [[H784]]

### 3
And thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] escape out [[H4422]] of his hand, [[H3027]] but [[H3588]] shalt surely [[H8610]] be taken, [[H8610]] and delivered [[H5414]] into his hand; [[H3027]] and thine eyes [[H5869]] shall behold [[H7200]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he shall speak [[H1696]] with [[H854]] thee mouth [[H6310]] to mouth, [[H6310]] and thou shalt go [[H935]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 4
Yet [[H389]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] O Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah; [[H3063]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of [[H5921]] thee, Thou shalt not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] by the sword: [[H2719]]

### 5
thou shalt die [[H4191]] in peace: [[H7965]] and with the burnings [[H4955]] of thy fathers, [[H1]] the former [[H7223]] kings [[H4428]] which [[H834]] were [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] thee, so [[H3651]] shall they burn [[H8313]] for thee; and they will lament [[H5594]] thee, Ah [[H1945]] lord! [[H113]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have pronounced [[H1696]] the word, [[H1697]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] spake [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]]

### 7
When the king [[H4428]] of Babylon's [[H894]] army [[H2428]] fought [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] that were left, [[H3498]] against [[H413]] Lachish, [[H3923]] and against [[H413]] Azekah: [[H5825]] for [[H3588]] these [[H2007]] defenced [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] remained [[H7604]] of the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 8
the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the Lord, [[H3068]] after that [[H310]] the king [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] had made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to proclaim [[H7121]] liberty [[H1865]] unto them; [[H1865]]

### 9
That every man [[H376]]  should let [[H853]] his manservant, [[H5650]] and every man [[H376]] his maidservant, [[H8198]] an Hebrew [[H5680]] or an Hebrewess, [[H5680]] go [[H7971]] free; [[H2670]] that none [[H1115]] should serve [[H5647]] himself of them, of a Jew [[H3064]] his brother. [[H251]]

### 10
Now when all [[H3605]] the princes, [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] had entered [[H935]] into the covenant, [[H1285]] heard [[H8085]] that every one [[H376]]  should let [[H853]] his manservant, [[H5650]] and every one [[H376]] his maidservant, [[H8198]] go [[H7971]] free, [[H2670]] that none [[H1115]] should serve [[H5647]] themselves of them any more, [[H5750]] then they obeyed, [[H8085]] and let go. [[H7971]]

### 11
But afterward [[H310]] they turned, [[H7725]]  and caused [[H853]] the servants [[H5650]] and the handmaids, [[H8198]] whom [[H834]] they had let go [[H7971]] free, [[H2670]] to return, [[H7725]] and brought them into subjection [[H3533]] for servants [[H5650]] and for handmaids. [[H8198]]

### 12
Therefore the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 13
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] I [[H595]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] your fathers [[H1]] in the day [[H3117]] that I brought them forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of bondmen, [[H5650]] saying, [[H559]]

### 14
At the end [[H7093]] of seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] let ye go [[H7971]] every man [[H376]] his brother [[H251]] an Hebrew, [[H5680]] which [[H834]] hath been sold [[H4376]] unto thee; and when he hath served [[H5647]] thee six [[H8337]] years, [[H8141]] thou shalt let him go [[H7971]] free [[H2670]] from [[H5973]] thee: but your fathers [[H1]] hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] me, neither [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] their ear. [[H241]]

### 15
And ye [[H859]] were now [[H3117]] turned, [[H7725]] and had done [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in my sight, [[H5869]] in proclaiming [[H7121]] liberty [[H1865]] every man [[H376]] to his neighbour; [[H7453]] and ye had made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] me in the house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] my name: [[H8034]]

### 16
But ye turned [[H7725]] and polluted [[H2490]] my name, [[H8034]] and caused every man [[H376]] his servant, [[H5650]] and every man [[H376]] his handmaid, [[H8198]] whom [[H834]] ye had set [[H7971]] at liberty [[H2670]] at their pleasure, [[H5315]] to return, [[H7725]] and brought them into subjection, [[H3533]] to be [[H1961]] unto you for servants [[H5650]] and for handmaids. [[H8198]]

### 17
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Ye [[H859]] have not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, in proclaiming [[H7121]] liberty, [[H1865]] every one [[H376]] to his brother, [[H251]] and every man [[H376]] to his neighbour: [[H7453]] behold, [[H2005]] I proclaim [[H7121]] a liberty [[H1865]] for you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to [[H413]] the sword, [[H2719]] to [[H413]] the pestilence, [[H1698]] and to [[H413]] the famine; [[H7458]] and I will make [[H5414]] you to be removed [[H2113]] into all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 18
And I will give [[H5414]] the men [[H376]] that have transgressed [[H5674]] my covenant, [[H1285]] which [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] performed [[H6965]] the words [[H1697]] of the covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] they had made [[H3772]] before [[H6440]] me, when [[H834]] they cut [[H3772]] the calf [[H5695]] in twain, [[H8147]] and passed [[H5674]] between [[H996]] the parts [[H1335]] thereof, [[H1335]]

### 19
The princes [[H8269]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the princes [[H8269]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the eunuchs, [[H5631]] and the priests, [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] which passed [[H5674]] between [[H996]] the parts [[H1335]] of the calf; [[H5695]]

### 20
I will even give [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H341]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of them that seek [[H1245]] their life: [[H5315]] and their dead bodies [[H5038]] shall be [[H1961]] for meat [[H3978]] unto the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] and to the beasts [[H929]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 21
And Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and his princes [[H8269]] will I give [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H341]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of them that seek [[H1245]] their life, [[H5315]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon's [[H894]] army, [[H2428]] which are gone up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 22
Behold, [[H2005]] I will command, [[H6680]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and cause them to return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city; [[H5892]] and they shall fight [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] it, and take [[H3920]] it, and burn [[H8313]] it with fire: [[H784]] and I will make [[H5414]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] a desolation [[H8077]] without [[H369]] an inhabitant.
