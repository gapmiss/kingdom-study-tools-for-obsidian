### 1
The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] after that [[H310]] Nebuzar-adan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] had let him go [[H7971]] from [[H4480]] Ramah, [[H7414]] when he had taken [[H3947]] him being bound [[H631]] in chains [[H246]] among [[H8432]] all [[H3605]] that were carried away captive [[H1546]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah, [[H3063]] which were carried away captive [[H1540]] unto Babylon. [[H894]]

### 2
And the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] took [[H3947]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath pronounced [[H1696]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 3
Now the Lord [[H3068]] hath brought [[H935]] and done [[H6213]] according as [[H834]] he hath said: [[H1696]] because [[H3588]] ye have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] and have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] his voice, [[H6963]] therefore this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] is come [[H1961]] upon you. [[H1961]]

### 4
And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] I loose [[H6605]] thee this day [[H3117]] from [[H4480]] the chains [[H246]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] thine hand. [[H3027]] If [[H518]] it seem good [[H2896]] to come [[H935]] with [[H854]] me into Babylon, [[H894]] come; [[H935]] and I will look well [[H7760]]  unto thee [[H5869]] unto thee: [[H5921]] but if [[H518]] it seem ill [[H7489]]  unto thee [[H5869]] to come [[H935]] with [[H854]] me into Babylon, [[H894]] forbear: [[H2308]] behold, [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] before [[H6440]] thee: whither [[H413]] it seemeth good [[H2896]] and convenient [[H3477]] for thee to go, [[H1980]] thither [[H8033]] go. [[H1980]]

### 5
Now while he was not [[H3808]] yet [[H5750]] gone back, [[H7725]] Go back [[H7725]] also to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] hath made governor [[H6485]] over the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] him among [[H8432]] the people: [[H5971]] or [[H176]] go [[H1980]] wheresoever [[H413]] it seemeth [[H5869]] convenient [[H3477]] unto thee to go. [[H1980]] So the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] gave [[H5414]] him victuals [[H737]] and a reward, [[H4864]] and let him go. [[H7971]]

### 6
Then went [[H935]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] unto [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] to Mizpah; [[H4708]] and dwelt [[H3427]] with [[H854]] him among [[H8432]] the people [[H5971]] that were left [[H7604]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 7
Now when all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] of the forces [[H2428]] which [[H834]] in the fields, [[H7704]] they [[H1992]] and their men, [[H376]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]]  had made [[H853]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] governor [[H6485]] in the land, [[H776]] and [[H3588]] had committed [[H6485]] unto [[H854]] him men, [[H376]] and women, [[H802]] and children, [[H2945]] and of the poor [[H1803]] of the land, [[H776]] of them that [[H834]] were not [[H3808]] carried away captive [[H1540]] to Babylon; [[H894]]

### 8
Then they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] to Mizpah, [[H4708]] even Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] and Johanan [[H3110]] and Jonathan [[H3129]] the sons [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and Seraiah [[H8304]] the son [[H1121]] of Tanhumeth, [[H8576]] and the sons [[H1121]] of Ephai [[H5778]] the Netophathite, [[H5200]] and Jezaniah [[H3153]] the son [[H1121]] of a Maachathite, [[H4602]] they [[H1992]] and their men. [[H582]]

### 9
And Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan [[H8227]] sware [[H7650]] unto them and to their men, [[H376]] saying, [[H559]] Fear [[H3372]] not [[H408]] to serve [[H5647]] the Chaldeans: [[H3778]] dwell in [[H3427]] the land, [[H776]] and serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and it shall be well [[H3190]] with you. [[H3190]]

### 10
As for me, [[H589]] behold, [[H2005]] I will dwell [[H3427]] at Mizpah [[H4709]] to serve [[H5975]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] which [[H834]] will come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] us: but ye, [[H859]] gather [[H622]] ye wine, [[H3196]] and summer fruits, [[H7019]] and oil, [[H8081]] and put [[H7760]] in your vessels, [[H3627]] and dwell [[H3427]] in your cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] ye have taken. [[H8610]]

### 11
Likewise [[H1571]] when all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] that [[H834]] in Moab, [[H4124]] and among the Ammonites, [[H5983]] and in Edom, [[H123]] and that [[H834]] in all [[H3605]] the countries, [[H776]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had left [[H5414]] a remnant [[H7611]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and that [[H3588]] he had set [[H6485]] over [[H5921]]  them [[H853]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan; [[H8227]]

### 12
Even all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] returned out [[H7725]] of all [[H3605]] places [[H4725]] whither [[H834]] they were driven, [[H5080]] and came [[H935]] to the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah, [[H1436]] unto Mizpah, [[H4708]] and gathered [[H622]] wine [[H3196]] and summer fruits [[H7019]] very [[H3966]] much. [[H7235]]

### 13
Moreover Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] of the forces [[H2428]] that [[H834]] in the fields, [[H7704]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] to Mizpah, [[H4708]]

### 14
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Dost thou certainly [[H3045]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Baalis [[H1185]] the king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] hath sent [[H7971]] Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] to slay [[H5221]] thee? But Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] believed [[H539]] them not. [[H539]]

### 15
Then Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah [[H7143]] spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] in Mizpah [[H4709]] secretly, [[H5643]] saying, [[H559]] Let me go, [[H1980]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and I will slay [[H5221]] Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] and no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] shall know [[H3045]] wherefore [[H4100]] should he slay [[H5221]] thee, that all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] which are gathered [[H6908]] unto [[H413]] thee should be scattered, [[H6327]] and the remnant [[H7611]] in Judah [[H3063]] perish? [[H6]]

### 16
But Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] Thou shalt not [[H408]] do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing: [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] speakest [[H1696]] falsely [[H8267]] of [[H413]] Ishmael.
