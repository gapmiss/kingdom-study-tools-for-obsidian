### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] against [[H5921]] the Gentiles; [[H1471]]

### 2
Against Egypt, [[H4714]] against [[H5921]] the army [[H2428]] of Pharaoh-necho [[H6549]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] which [[H834]] was [[H1961]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H5104]] Euphrates [[H6578]] in Carchemish, [[H3751]] which [[H834]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] smote [[H5221]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 3
Order [[H6186]] ye the buckler [[H4043]] and shield, [[H6793]] and draw near [[H5066]] to battle. [[H4421]]

### 4
Harness [[H631]] the horses; [[H5483]] and get up, [[H5927]] ye horsemen, [[H6571]] and stand forth [[H3320]] with helmets; [[H3553]] furbish [[H4838]] the spears, [[H7420]] put on [[H3847]] the brigandines. [[H5630]]

### 5
Wherefore [[H4069]] have I seen [[H7200]] them [[H1992]] dismayed [[H2844]] turned away [[H5472]] back? [[H268]] and their mighty ones [[H1368]] are beaten down, [[H3807]] and are fled [[H5127]] apace, [[H4498]] and look not back: [[H6437]] fear [[H4032]] round about, [[H5439]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
Let not [[H408]] the swift [[H7031]] flee away, [[H5127]] nor [[H408]] the mighty man [[H1368]] escape; [[H4422]] they shall stumble, [[H3782]] and fall [[H5307]] toward the north [[H6828]] by [[H3027]] the river [[H5104]] Euphrates. [[H6578]]

### 7
Who [[H4310]] this [[H2088]] cometh up [[H5927]] as a flood, [[H2975]] whose waters [[H4325]] are moved [[H1607]] as the rivers? [[H5104]]

### 8
Egypt [[H4714]] riseth up [[H5927]] like a flood, [[H2975]] and waters [[H4325]] are moved [[H1607]] like the rivers; [[H5104]] and he saith, [[H559]] I will go up, [[H5927]] will cover [[H3680]] the earth; [[H776]] I will destroy [[H6]] the city [[H5892]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof. [[H3427]]

### 9
Come up, [[H5927]] ye horses; [[H5483]] and rage, [[H1984]] ye chariots; [[H7393]] and let the mighty men [[H1368]] come forth; [[H3318]] the Ethiopians [[H3568]] and the Libyans, [[H6316]] that handle [[H8610]] the shield; [[H4043]] and the Lydians, [[H3866]] that handle [[H8610]] bend [[H1869]] the bow. [[H7198]]

### 10
For this [[H1931]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts, [[H6635]] a day [[H3117]] of vengeance, [[H5360]] that he may avenge [[H5358]] him of his adversaries: [[H6862]] and the sword [[H2719]] shall devour, [[H398]] and it shall be satiate [[H7646]] and made drunk [[H7301]] with their blood: [[H1818]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath a sacrifice [[H2077]] in the north [[H6828]] country [[H776]] by [[H413]] the river [[H5104]] Euphrates. [[H6578]]

### 11
Go up [[H5927]] into Gilead, [[H1568]] and take [[H3947]] balm, [[H6875]] O virgin, [[H1330]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] in vain [[H7723]] shalt thou use many [[H7235]] medicines; [[H7499]] thou shalt not [[H369]] be cured. [[H8585]]

### 12
The nations [[H1471]] have heard [[H8085]] of thy shame, [[H7036]] and thy cry [[H6682]] hath filled [[H4390]] the land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] the mighty man [[H1368]] hath stumbled [[H3782]] against the mighty, [[H1368]] they are fallen [[H5307]] both [[H8147]] together. [[H3162]]

### 13
The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] how Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] should come [[H935]] smite [[H5221]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 14
Declare [[H5046]] ye in Egypt, [[H4714]] and publish [[H8085]] in Migdol, [[H4024]] and publish [[H8085]] in Noph [[H5297]] and in Tahpanhes: [[H8471]] say [[H559]] ye, Stand fast, [[H3320]] and prepare [[H3559]] thee; for [[H3588]] the sword [[H2719]] shall devour [[H398]] round about [[H5439]] thee. [[H5439]]

### 15
Why [[H4069]] are thy valiant [[H47]] swept away? [[H5502]] they stood [[H5975]] not, [[H3808]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] did drive [[H1920]] them. [[H1920]]

### 16
He made many [[H7235]] to fall, [[H3782]] yea, [[H1571]] one [[H376]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H413]] another: [[H7453]] and they said, [[H559]] Arise, [[H6965]] and let us go again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] our own people, [[H5971]] and to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of our nativity, [[H4138]] from [[H6440]] the oppressing [[H3238]] sword. [[H2719]]

### 17
They did cry [[H7121]] there, [[H8033]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] a noise; [[H7588]] he hath passed [[H5674]] the time appointed. [[H4150]]

### 18
I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the King, [[H4428]] whose name [[H8034]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Surely [[H3588]] as Tabor [[H8396]] among the mountains, [[H2022]] and as Carmel [[H3760]] by the sea, [[H3220]] shall he come. [[H935]]

### 19
O thou daughter [[H1323]] dwelling [[H3427]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] furnish [[H6213]] thyself to go into captivity: [[H3627]] for [[H3588]] Noph [[H5297]] shall be [[H1961]] waste [[H8047]] and desolate [[H3341]] without [[H369]] an inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 20
Egypt [[H4714]] a very fair [[H3304]] heifer, [[H5697]] destruction [[H7171]] cometh; [[H935]] it cometh out [[H935]] of the north. [[H6828]]

### 21
Also [[H1571]] her hired men [[H7916]] in the midst [[H7130]] of her like fatted [[H4770]] bullocks; [[H5695]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] are turned back, [[H6437]] are fled away [[H5127]] together: [[H3162]] they did not [[H3808]] stand, [[H5975]] because [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of their calamity [[H343]] was come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] them, the time [[H6256]] of their visitation. [[H6486]]

### 22
The voice [[H6963]] thereof shall go [[H1980]] like a serpent; [[H5175]] for [[H3588]] they shall march [[H1980]] with an army, [[H2428]] and come [[H935]] against her with axes, [[H7134]] as hewers [[H2404]] of wood. [[H6086]]

### 23
They shall cut down [[H3772]] her forest, [[H3293]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] though [[H3588]] it cannot [[H3808]] be searched; [[H2713]] because [[H3588]] they are more [[H7231]] than the grasshoppers, [[H697]] and innumerable. [[H369]]

### 24
The daughter [[H1323]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall be confounded; [[H3001]] she shall be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the people [[H5971]] of the north. [[H6828]]

### 25
The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith; [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will punish [[H6485]] the multitude [[H527]] of No, [[H4996]] and Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and Egypt, [[H4714]] with [[H5921]] their gods, [[H430]] and their kings; [[H4428]] even Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and them that trust [[H982]] in him: [[H982]]

### 26
And I will deliver [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of those that seek [[H1245]] their lives, [[H5315]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of his servants: [[H5650]] and afterward [[H310]] it shall be inhabited, [[H7931]] as in the days [[H3117]] of old, [[H6924]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
But fear [[H3372]] not [[H408]] thou, [[H859]] O my servant [[H5650]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and be not [[H408]] dismayed, [[H2865]] O Israel: [[H3478]] for, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I will save [[H3467]] thee from afar off, [[H7350]] and thy seed [[H2233]] from the land [[H776]] of their captivity; [[H7628]] and Jacob [[H3290]] shall return, [[H7725]] and be in rest [[H8252]] and at ease, [[H7599]] and none [[H369]] shall make afraid. [[H2729]]

### 28
Fear [[H3372]] thou [[H859]] not, [[H408]] O Jacob [[H3290]] my servant, [[H5650]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] thee; for [[H3588]] I will make [[H6213]] a full end [[H3617]] of all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] I have driven [[H5080]] thee: but I will not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] a full end [[H3617]] of thee, but correct [[H3256]] thee in measure; [[H4941]] yet will I not [[H3808]] leave thee wholly [[H5352]] unpunished.
