### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] concerning [[H1697]] the dearth. [[H1226]]

### 2
Judah [[H3063]] mourneth, [[H56]] and the gates [[H8179]] thereof languish; [[H535]] they are black [[H6937]] unto the ground; [[H776]] and the cry [[H6682]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] is gone up. [[H5927]]

### 3
And their nobles [[H117]] have sent [[H7971]] their little ones [[H6810]] to the waters: [[H4325]] they came [[H935]] to [[H5921]] the pits, [[H1356]] found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] water; [[H4325]] they returned [[H7725]] with their vessels [[H3627]] empty; [[H7387]] they were ashamed [[H954]] and confounded, [[H3637]] and covered [[H2645]] their heads. [[H7218]]

### 4
Because [[H5668]] the ground [[H127]] is chapt, [[H2865]] for [[H3588]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain [[H1653]] in the earth, [[H776]] the plowmen [[H406]] were ashamed, [[H954]] they covered [[H2645]] their heads. [[H7218]]

### 5
Yea, [[H1571]] the hind [[H365]] also calved [[H3205]] in the field, [[H7704]] and forsook [[H5800]] because [[H3588]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] grass. [[H1877]]

### 6
And the wild asses [[H6501]] did stand [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] the high places, [[H8205]] they snuffed up [[H7602]] the wind [[H7307]] like dragons; [[H8577]] their eyes [[H5869]] did fail, [[H3615]] because [[H3588]] no [[H369]] grass. [[H6212]]

### 7
O Lord, [[H3068]] though [[H518]] our iniquities [[H5771]] testify [[H6030]] against us, do [[H6213]] thou for thy name's [[H8034]] sake: [[H4616]] for [[H3588]] our backslidings [[H4878]] are many; [[H7231]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against thee. [[H2398]]

### 8
O the hope [[H4723]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the saviour [[H3467]] thereof in time [[H6256]] of trouble, [[H6869]] why [[H4100]] shouldest thou be [[H1961]] as a stranger [[H1616]] in the land, [[H776]] and as a wayfaring man [[H732]] turneth aside [[H5186]] to tarry night? [[H3885]] for a [[H3885]]

### 9
Why [[H4100]] shouldest thou be [[H1961]] as a man [[H376]] astonied, [[H1724]] as a mighty man [[H1368]] cannot [[H3201]] save? [[H3467]] yet thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] in the midst [[H7130]] of us, and we are called [[H7121]] by thy name; [[H8034]] leave [[H3240]] us not. [[H3240]]

### 10
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] Thus [[H3651]] have they loved [[H157]] to wander, [[H5128]] they have not [[H3808]] refrained [[H2820]] their feet, [[H7272]] therefore the Lord [[H3068]] doth not [[H3808]] accept [[H7521]] them; he will now [[H6258]] remember [[H2142]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] and visit [[H6485]] their sins. [[H2403]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, Pray [[H6419]] not [[H408]] for [[H1157]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] for good. [[H2896]]

### 12
When [[H3588]] they fast, [[H6684]] I will not [[H369]] hear [[H8085]] their cry; [[H7440]] and when [[H3588]] they offer [[H5927]] burnt offering [[H5930]] and an oblation, [[H4503]] I will not [[H369]] accept [[H7521]] them: but [[H3588]] I [[H595]] will consume [[H3615]] them by the sword, [[H2719]] and by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence. [[H1698]]

### 13
Then said [[H559]] I, Ah, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] God! [[H3069]] behold, [[H2009]] the prophets [[H5030]] say [[H559]] unto them, Ye shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] the sword, [[H2719]] neither [[H3808]] shall ye have [[H1961]] famine; [[H7458]] but [[H3588]] I will give [[H5414]] you assured [[H571]] peace [[H7965]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 14
Then the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, The prophets [[H5030]] prophesy [[H5012]] lies [[H8267]] in my name: [[H8034]] I sent [[H7971]] them not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] have I commanded [[H6680]] them, neither [[H3808]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them: they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] unto you a false [[H8267]] vision [[H2377]] and divination, [[H7081]] and a thing of nought, [[H457]] and the deceit [[H8649]] of their heart. [[H3820]]

### 15
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] concerning [[H5921]] the prophets [[H5030]] that prophesy [[H5012]] in my name, [[H8034]] and I [[H589]] sent [[H7971]] them not, [[H3808]] yet they [[H1992]] say, [[H559]] Sword [[H2719]] and famine [[H7458]] shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] in this [[H2063]] land; [[H776]] By sword [[H2719]] and famine [[H7458]] shall those [[H1992]] prophets [[H5030]] be consumed. [[H8552]]

### 16
And the people [[H5971]] to whom [[H834]] they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] shall be [[H1961]] cast out [[H7993]] in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] because [[H6440]] of the famine [[H7458]] and the sword; [[H2719]] and they shall have none [[H369]] to bury [[H6912]] them, [[H1992]] them, [[H1992]] their wives, [[H802]] nor their sons, [[H1121]] nor their daughters: [[H1323]] for I will pour [[H8210]] their wickedness [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 17
Therefore thou shalt say [[H559]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] them; Let mine eyes [[H5869]] run down [[H3381]] with tears [[H1832]] night [[H3915]] and day, [[H3119]] and let them not [[H408]] cease: [[H1820]] for [[H3588]] the virgin [[H1330]] daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] is broken [[H7665]] with a great [[H1419]] breach, [[H7667]] with a very [[H3966]] grievous [[H2470]] blow. [[H4347]]

### 18
If [[H518]] I go forth [[H3318]] into the field, [[H7704]] then behold [[H2009]] the slain [[H2491]] with the sword! [[H2719]] and if [[H518]] I enter [[H935]] into the city, [[H5892]] then behold [[H2009]] them that are sick [[H8463]] with famine! [[H7458]] yea, [[H3588]] both [[H1571]] the prophet [[H5030]] and [[H1571]] the priest [[H3548]] go about [[H5503]] into [[H413]] a land [[H776]] that they know [[H3045]] not. [[H3045]]

### 19
Hast thou utterly [[H3988]] rejected [[H3988]] Judah? [[H3063]] hath thy soul [[H5315]] lothed [[H1602]] Zion? [[H6726]] why [[H4069]] hast thou smitten [[H5221]] us, and no [[H369]] healing [[H4832]] for us? we looked [[H6960]] for peace, [[H7965]] and no [[H369]] good; [[H2896]] and for the time [[H6256]] of healing, [[H4832]] and behold [[H2009]] trouble! [[H1205]]

### 20
We acknowledge, [[H3045]] O Lord, [[H3068]] our wickedness, [[H7562]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of our fathers: [[H1]] for [[H3588]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against thee. [[H2398]]

### 21
Do not [[H408]] abhor [[H5006]] for thy name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]] do not [[H408]] disgrace [[H5034]] the throne [[H3678]] of thy glory: [[H3519]] remember, [[H2142]] break [[H6565]] not [[H408]] thy covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] us. [[H854]]

### 22
Are there [[H3426]] among the vanities [[H1892]] of the Gentiles [[H1471]] that can cause rain? [[H1652]] or [[H518]] can the heavens [[H8064]] give [[H5414]] showers? [[H7241]] not [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] he, [[H1931]] O Lord [[H3068]] our God? [[H430]] therefore we will wait [[H6960]] upon thee: for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]]
