### 1
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the second [[H8145]] time, while he [[H1931]] was yet [[H5750]] shut up [[H6113]] in the court [[H2691]] of the prison, [[H4307]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] the maker [[H6213]] thereof, the Lord [[H3068]] that formed [[H3335]] it, to establish [[H3559]] it; the Lord [[H3068]] his name; [[H8034]]

### 3
Call [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] me, and I will answer [[H6030]] thee, and shew [[H5046]] thee great [[H1419]] and mighty things, [[H1219]] which thou knowest [[H3045]] not. [[H3045]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] concerning [[H5921]] the houses [[H1004]] of this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and concerning [[H5921]] the houses [[H1004]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which are thrown down [[H5422]] by [[H413]] the mounts, [[H5550]] and by [[H413]] the sword; [[H2719]]

### 5
They come [[H935]] to fight [[H3898]] with [[H854]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] but to fill [[H4390]] them with [[H854]] the dead bodies [[H6297]] of men, [[H120]] whom [[H834]] I have slain [[H5221]] in mine anger [[H639]] and in my fury, [[H2534]] and for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] whose [[H834]] wickedness [[H7451]] I have hid [[H5641]] my face [[H6440]] from this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]]

### 6
Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H5927]] it health [[H724]] and cure, [[H4832]] and I will cure [[H7495]] them, and will reveal [[H1540]] unto them the abundance [[H6283]] of peace [[H7965]] and truth. [[H571]]

### 7
And I will cause [[H853]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the captivity [[H7622]] of Israel [[H3478]] to return, [[H7725]] and will build [[H1129]] them, as at the first. [[H7223]]

### 8
And I will cleanse [[H2891]] them from all [[H3605]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] whereby [[H834]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against me; and I will pardon [[H5545]] all [[H3605]] their iniquities, [[H5771]] whereby [[H834]] they have sinned, [[H2398]] and whereby [[H834]] they have transgressed against me. [[H6586]]

### 9
And it shall be [[H1961]] to me a name [[H8034]] of joy, [[H8342]] a praise [[H8416]] and an honour [[H8597]] before all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth, [[H776]] which [[H834]] shall hear [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] do unto [[H6213]] them: and they shall fear [[H6342]] and tremble [[H7264]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the goodness [[H2896]] and for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the prosperity [[H7965]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] procure [[H6213]] unto it. [[H6213]]

### 10
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Again [[H5750]] there shall be heard [[H8085]] in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] which [[H834]] ye [[H859]] say [[H559]] desolate [[H2720]] without [[H369]] man [[H120]] and without [[H369]] beast, [[H929]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that are desolate, [[H8074]] without [[H369]] man, [[H120]] and without [[H369]] inhabitant, [[H3427]] and without [[H369]] beast, [[H929]]

### 11
The voice [[H6963]] of joy, [[H8342]] and the voice [[H6963]] of gladness, [[H8057]] the voice [[H6963]] of the bridegroom, [[H2860]] and the voice [[H6963]] of the bride, [[H3618]] the voice [[H6963]] of them that shall say, [[H559]] Praise [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] good; [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] his mercy [[H2617]] for ever: [[H5769]] of them that shall bring [[H935]] the sacrifice of praise [[H8426]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] I will cause to return [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of the land, [[H776]] as at the first, [[H7223]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Again [[H5750]] in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] which is desolate [[H2720]] without [[H369]] man [[H120]] and without [[H5704]] beast, [[H929]] and in all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] thereof, shall be [[H1961]] an habitation [[H5116]] of shepherds [[H7462]] causing flocks [[H6629]] to lie down. [[H7257]]

### 13
In the cities [[H5892]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the vale, [[H8219]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of the south, [[H5045]] and in the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and in the places about [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] shall the flocks [[H6629]] pass again [[H5674]] under [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of him that telleth [[H4487]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will perform [[H6965]] that good [[H2896]] thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I have promised [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and to [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 15
In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] and at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] will I cause the Branch [[H6780]] of righteousness [[H6666]] to grow up [[H6779]] unto David; [[H1732]] and he shall execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 16
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] shall Judah [[H3063]] be saved, [[H3467]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall dwell [[H7931]] safely: [[H983]] and this [[H2088]] wherewith [[H834]] she shall be called, [[H7121]] The Lord [[H3068]] our righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] David [[H1732]] shall never [[H3808]] want [[H3772]] a man [[H376]] to sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]]

### 18
Neither [[H3808]] shall the priests [[H3548]] the Levites [[H3881]] want [[H3772]] a man [[H376]] before [[H6440]] me to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and to kindle [[H6999]] meat offerings, [[H4503]] and to do [[H6213]] sacrifice [[H2077]] continually. [[H3117]]

### 19
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 20
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] If [[H518]] ye can break [[H6565]] my covenant [[H1285]] of the day, [[H3117]] and my covenant [[H1285]] of the night, [[H3915]] and that there should not [[H1115]] be [[H1961]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] in their season; [[H6256]]

### 21
may also [[H1571]] my covenant [[H1285]] be broken [[H6565]] with [[H854]] David [[H1732]] my servant, [[H5650]] that he should not have [[H1961]] a son [[H1121]] to reign [[H4427]] upon [[H5921]] his throne; [[H3678]] and with [[H854]] the Levites [[H3881]] the priests, [[H3548]] my ministers. [[H8334]]

### 22
As [[H834]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] cannot [[H3808]] be numbered, [[H5608]] neither [[H3808]] the sand [[H2344]] of the sea [[H3220]] measured: [[H4058]] so [[H3651]] will I multiply [[H7235]] the seed [[H2233]] of David [[H1732]] my servant, [[H5650]] and the Levites [[H3881]] that minister unto [[H8334]] me. [[H8334]]

### 23
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 24
Considerest [[H7200]] thou not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] have spoken, [[H1696]] saying, [[H559]] The two [[H8147]] families [[H4940]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath chosen, [[H977]] he hath even cast them off? [[H3988]] thus they have despised [[H5006]] my people, [[H5971]] that they should be no [[H1961]] more [[H5750]] a nation [[H1471]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 25
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] If [[H518]] my covenant [[H1285]] not [[H3808]] with day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] I have not [[H3808]] appointed [[H7760]] the ordinances [[H2708]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth; [[H776]]

### 26
Then [[H1571]] will I cast away [[H3988]] the seed [[H2233]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and David [[H1732]] my servant, [[H5650]] that I will not take [[H3947]] of his seed [[H2233]] rulers [[H4910]] over [[H413]] the seed [[H2233]] of Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3446]] and Jacob: [[H3290]] for [[H3588]]  I will cause [[H853]] their captivity [[H7622]] to return, [[H7725]] and have mercy [[H7355]] on them.
