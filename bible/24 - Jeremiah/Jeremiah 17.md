### 1
The sin [[H2403]] of Judah [[H3063]] written [[H3789]] with a pen [[H5842]] of iron, [[H1270]] with the point [[H6856]] of a diamond: [[H8068]] graven [[H2790]] upon [[H5921]] the table [[H3871]] of their heart, [[H3820]] and upon the horns [[H7161]] of your altars; [[H4196]]

### 2
Whilst their children [[H1121]] remember [[H2142]] their altars [[H4196]] and their groves [[H842]] by [[H5921]] the green [[H7488]] trees [[H6086]] upon [[H5921]] the high [[H1364]] hills. [[H1389]]

### 3
O my mountain [[H2042]] in the field, [[H7704]] I will give [[H5414]] thy substance [[H2428]] all [[H3605]] thy treasures [[H214]] to the spoil, [[H957]] thy high places [[H1116]] for sin, [[H2403]] throughout all [[H3605]] thy borders. [[H1366]]

### 4
And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue [[H8058]] from thine heritage [[H5159]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] thee; and I will cause thee to serve [[H5647]] thine enemies [[H341]] in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not: [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] ye have kindled [[H6919]] a fire [[H784]] in mine anger, [[H639]] shall burn [[H3344]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 5
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Cursed [[H779]] the man [[H1397]] that [[H834]] trusteth [[H982]] in man, [[H120]] and maketh [[H7760]] flesh [[H1320]] his arm, [[H2220]] and whose heart [[H3820]] departeth [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
For he shall be [[H1961]] like the heath [[H6176]] in the desert, [[H6160]] and shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] when [[H3588]] good [[H2896]] cometh; [[H935]] but shall inhabit [[H7931]] the parched places [[H2788]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] a salt [[H4420]] land [[H776]] and not [[H3808]] inhabited. [[H3427]]

### 7
Blessed [[H1288]] the man [[H1397]] that [[H834]] trusteth [[H982]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] and whose hope [[H4009]] the Lord [[H3068]] is. [[H3068]]

### 8
For he shall be [[H1961]] as a tree [[H6086]] planted [[H8362]] by [[H5921]] the waters, [[H4325]] and spreadeth out [[H7971]] her roots [[H8328]] by [[H5921]] the river, [[H3105]] and shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] when [[H3588]] heat [[H2527]] cometh, [[H935]] but her leaf [[H5929]] shall be [[H1961]] green; [[H7488]] and shall not [[H3808]] be careful [[H1672]] in the year [[H8141]] of drought, [[H1226]] neither [[H3808]] shall cease [[H4185]] from yielding [[H6213]] fruit. [[H6529]]

### 9
The heart [[H3820]] deceitful [[H6121]] above all [[H3605]] and desperately wicked: [[H605]] who [[H4310]] can know [[H3045]] it? [[H3045]]

### 10
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] search [[H2713]] the heart, [[H3820]] try [[H974]] the reins, [[H3629]] even to give [[H5414]] every man [[H376]] according to his ways, [[H1870]] according to the fruit [[H6529]] of his doings. [[H4611]]

### 11
the partridge [[H7124]] sitteth [[H1716]] and hatcheth [[H3205]] not; [[H3808]] he that getteth [[H6213]] riches, [[H6239]] and not [[H3808]] by right, [[H4941]] shall leave [[H5800]] them in the midst [[H2677]] of his days, [[H3117]] and at his end [[H319]] shall be [[H1961]] a fool. [[H5036]]

### 12
A glorious [[H3519]] high [[H4791]] throne [[H3678]] from the beginning [[H7223]] the place [[H4725]] of our sanctuary. [[H4720]]

### 13
O Lord, [[H3068]] the hope [[H4723]] of Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] that forsake [[H5800]] thee shall be ashamed, [[H954]] they that depart from me [[H3249]] shall be written [[H3789]] in the earth, [[H776]] because [[H3588]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the fountain [[H4726]] of living [[H2416]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 14
Heal [[H7495]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] and I shall be healed; [[H7495]] save [[H3467]] me, and I shall be saved: [[H3467]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my praise. [[H8416]]

### 15
Behold, [[H2009]] they [[H1992]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Where [[H346]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord? [[H3068]] let it come [[H935]] now. [[H935]]

### 16
As for me, I [[H589]] have not [[H3808]] hastened [[H213]] from a pastor [[H7462]] to follow [[H310]] thee: neither [[H3808]] have I desired [[H183]] the woeful [[H605]] day; [[H3117]] thou [[H859]] knowest: [[H3045]] that which came out [[H4161]] of [[H6440]] my lips [[H8193]] was [[H1961]] before thee. [[H5227]]

### 17
Be [[H1961]] not [[H408]] a terror [[H4288]] unto me: thou [[H859]] my hope [[H4268]] in the day [[H3117]] of evil. [[H7451]]

### 18
Let them be confounded [[H954]] that persecute [[H7291]] me, but let not [[H408]] me [[H589]] be confounded: [[H954]] let them [[H1992]] be dismayed, [[H2865]] but let not [[H408]] me [[H589]] be dismayed: [[H2865]] bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] them the day [[H3117]] of evil, [[H7451]] and destroy [[H7665]] them with double [[H4932]] destruction. [[H7670]]

### 19
Thus [[H3541]] said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me; Go [[H1980]] and stand [[H5975]] in the gate [[H8179]] of the children [[H1121]] of the people, [[H5971]] whereby [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] come in, [[H935]] and by the which [[H834]] they go out, [[H3318]] and in all [[H3605]] the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]]

### 20
And say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Hear [[H8085]] ye the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] ye kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] Judah, [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that enter in [[H935]] by these [[H428]] gates: [[H8179]]

### 21
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Take heed [[H8104]] to yourselves, [[H5315]] and bear [[H5375]] no [[H408]] burden [[H4853]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] nor bring [[H935]] in by the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]]

### 22
Neither [[H3808]] carry forth [[H3318]] a burden [[H4853]] out of your houses [[H1004]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] neither [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] ye any [[H3605]] work, [[H4399]] but hallow [[H6942]]  ye [[H853]] the sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] as [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] your fathers. [[H1]]

### 23
But they obeyed [[H8085]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] their ear, [[H241]]  but made [[H853]] their neck [[H6203]] stiff, [[H7185]] that they might not [[H1115]] hear, [[H8085]] nor [[H1115]] receive [[H3947]] instruction. [[H4148]]

### 24
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] ye diligently [[H8085]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to bring in [[H935]] no [[H1115]] burden [[H4853]] through the gates [[H8179]] of this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] but hallow [[H6942]] the sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] to do [[H6213]] no [[H1115]] work [[H4399]] therein; [[H4399]]

### 25
Then shall there enter [[H935]] into the gates [[H8179]] of this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] kings [[H4428]] and princes [[H8269]] sitting [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David, [[H1732]] riding [[H7392]] in chariots [[H7393]] and on horses, [[H5483]] they, [[H1992]] and their princes, [[H8269]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] shall remain [[H3427]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 26
And they shall come [[H935]] from the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and from the places about [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and from the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and from [[H4480]] the plain, [[H8219]] and from [[H4480]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and from [[H4480]] the south, [[H5045]] bringing [[H935]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and sacrifices, [[H2077]] and meat offerings, [[H4503]] and incense, [[H3828]] and bringing [[H935]] sacrifices of praise, [[H8426]] unto the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
But if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me to hallow [[H6942]] the sabbath [[H7676]] day, [[H3117]] and not [[H1115]] to bear [[H5375]] a burden, [[H4853]] even entering in [[H935]] at the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] on the sabbath [[H7676]] day; [[H3117]] then will I kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in the gates [[H8179]] thereof, and it shall devour [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and it shall not [[H3808]] be quenched.
