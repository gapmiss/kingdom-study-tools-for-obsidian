### 1
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] also unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] thee a wife, [[H802]] neither [[H3808]] shalt thou have [[H1961]] sons [[H1121]] or daughters [[H1323]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] concerning [[H5921]] the sons [[H1121]] and concerning [[H5921]] the daughters [[H1323]] that are born [[H3205]] in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and concerning [[H5921]] their mothers [[H517]] that bare [[H3205]] them, and concerning [[H5921]] their fathers [[H1]] that begat [[H3205]] them in this [[H2063]] land; [[H776]]

### 4
They shall die [[H4191]] of grievous [[H8463]] deaths; [[H4463]] they shall not [[H3808]] be lamented; [[H5594]] neither [[H3808]] shall they be buried; [[H6912]] they shall be as dung [[H1828]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth: [[H127]] and they shall be [[H1961]] consumed [[H3615]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and by famine; [[H7458]] and their carcases [[H5038]] shall be meat [[H3978]] for the fowls [[H5775]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and for the beasts [[H929]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Enter [[H935]] not [[H408]] into the house [[H1004]] of mourning, [[H4798]] neither [[H408]] go [[H1980]] to lament [[H5594]] nor [[H408]] bemoan [[H5110]] them: for [[H3588]] I have taken away [[H622]] my peace [[H7965]] from [[H853]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] lovingkindness [[H2617]] and mercies. [[H7356]]

### 6
Both the great [[H1419]] and the small [[H6996]] shall die [[H4191]] in this [[H2063]] land: [[H776]] they shall not [[H3808]] be buried, [[H6912]] neither [[H3808]] shall lament [[H5594]] for them, nor [[H3808]] cut themselves, [[H1413]] nor [[H3808]] make themselves bald [[H7139]] for them: [[H7139]]

### 7
Neither [[H3808]] shall tear [[H6536]] for them in [[H5921]] mourning, [[H60]] to comfort [[H5162]] them for [[H5921]] the dead; [[H4191]] neither [[H3808]] shall give them the cup [[H3563]] of consolation [[H8575]] to drink [[H8248]] for [[H5921]] their father [[H1]] or for [[H5921]] their mother. [[H517]]

### 8
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] also go [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of feasting, [[H4960]] to sit [[H3427]] with [[H854]] them to eat [[H398]] and to drink. [[H8354]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will cause to cease [[H7673]] out of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] and in your days, [[H3117]] the voice [[H6963]] of mirth, [[H8342]] and the voice [[H6963]] of gladness, [[H8057]] the voice [[H6963]] of the bridegroom, [[H2860]] and the voice [[H6963]] of the bride. [[H3618]]

### 10
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] thou shalt shew [[H5046]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] and they shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, Wherefore [[H5921]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] pronounced [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] us? or what [[H4100]] our iniquity? [[H5771]] or what [[H4100]] our sin [[H2403]] that [[H834]] we have committed [[H2398]] against the Lord [[H3068]] our God? [[H430]]

### 11
Then shalt thou say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Because [[H5921]] your fathers [[H1]] have forsaken [[H5800]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and have walked [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and have served [[H5647]] them, and have worshipped [[H7812]] them, and have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] my law; [[H8451]]

### 12
And ye [[H859]] have done [[H6213]] worse [[H7489]] than your fathers; [[H1]] for, behold, [[H2005]] ye walk [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] after [[H310]] the imagination [[H8307]] of his evil [[H7451]] heart, [[H3820]] that they may not [[H1115]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me: [[H413]]

### 13
Therefore will I cast [[H2904]] you out of [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] into [[H5921]] a land [[H776]] that [[H834]] ye know [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] ye [[H859]] nor your fathers; [[H1]] and there [[H8033]] shall ye serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] day [[H3119]] and night; [[H3915]] where [[H834]] I will not [[H3808]] shew [[H5414]] you favour. [[H2594]]

### 14
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that it shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] that [[H834]] brought up [[H5927]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]]

### 15
But, [[H3588]] The Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] that [[H834]] brought up [[H5927]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] from the land [[H776]] of the north, [[H6828]] and from all [[H3605]] the lands [[H776]] whither [[H834]] he had driven [[H5080]] them: and I will bring them again [[H7725]] into [[H5921]] their land [[H127]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] unto their fathers. [[H1]]

### 16
Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] for many [[H7227]] fishers, [[H1771]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and they shall fish [[H1770]] them; and after [[H310]] will I send [[H7971]] for many [[H7227]] hunters, [[H6719]] and they shall hunt [[H6679]] them from [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] mountain, [[H2022]] and from [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] hill, [[H1389]] and out of the holes [[H5357]] of the rocks. [[H5553]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] mine eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their ways: [[H1870]] they are not [[H3808]] hid [[H5641]] from my face, [[H6440]] neither [[H3808]] is their iniquity [[H5771]] hid [[H6845]] from [[H5048]] mine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 18
And first [[H7223]] I will recompense [[H7999]] their iniquity [[H5771]] and their sin [[H2403]] double; [[H4932]] because [[H5921]] they have defiled [[H2490]] my land, [[H776]] they have filled [[H4390]] mine inheritance [[H5159]] with the carcases [[H5038]] of their detestable [[H8251]] and abominable things. [[H8441]]

### 19
O Lord, [[H3068]] my strength, [[H5797]] and my fortress, [[H4581]] and my refuge [[H4498]] in the day [[H3117]] of affliction, [[H6869]] the Gentiles [[H1471]] shall come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee from the ends [[H657]] of the earth, [[H776]] and shall say, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] our fathers [[H1]] have inherited [[H5157]] lies, [[H8267]] vanity, [[H1892]] and wherein no [[H369]] profit. [[H3276]]

### 20
Shall a man [[H120]] make [[H6213]] gods [[H430]] unto himself, and they [[H1992]] no [[H3808]] gods? [[H430]]

### 21
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I will this [[H2063]] once [[H6471]] cause them to know, [[H3045]] I will cause them to know [[H3045]] mine hand [[H3027]] and my might; [[H1369]] and they shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] my name [[H8034]] The Lord. [[H3068]]
