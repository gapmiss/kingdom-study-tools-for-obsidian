### 1
Now these [[H428]] the words [[H1697]] of the letter [[H5612]] that [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] sent [[H7971]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto [[H413]] the residue [[H3499]] of the elders [[H2205]] which were carried away captives, [[H1473]] and to [[H413]] the priests, [[H3548]] and to [[H413]] the prophets, [[H5030]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] had carried away captive [[H1540]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Babylon; [[H894]]

### 2
(After that [[H310]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] the king, [[H4428]] and the queen, [[H1377]] and the eunuchs, [[H5631]] the princes [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the carpenters, [[H2796]] and the smiths, [[H4525]] were departed [[H3318]] from Jerusalem;) [[H3389]]

### 3
By the hand [[H3027]] of Elasah [[H501]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] and Gemariah [[H1587]] the son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] (whom [[H834]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] sent [[H7971]] unto Babylon [[H894]] to [[H413]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon) [[H894]] saying, [[H559]]

### 4
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] unto all [[H3605]] that are carried away captives, [[H1473]] whom [[H834]] I have caused to be carried away [[H1540]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto Babylon; [[H894]]

### 5
Build [[H1129]] ye houses, [[H1004]] and dwell [[H3427]] and plant [[H5193]] gardens, [[H1593]] and eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of them; [[H6529]]

### 6
Take [[H3947]] ye wives, [[H802]] and beget [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters; [[H1323]] and take [[H3947]] wives [[H802]] for your sons, [[H1121]] and give [[H5414]] your daughters [[H1323]] to husbands, [[H582]] that they may bear [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters; [[H1323]] that ye may be increased [[H7235]] there, [[H8033]] and not [[H408]] diminished. [[H4591]]

### 7
And seek [[H1875]] the peace [[H7965]] of the city [[H5892]] whither [[H834]] I have caused you to be carried away captives, [[H1540]] and pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] for [[H1157]] it: for [[H3588]] in the peace [[H7965]] thereof shall ye have [[H1961]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Let not [[H408]] your prophets [[H5030]] and your diviners, [[H7080]] that [[H834]] in the midst [[H7130]] of you, deceive [[H5377]] you, neither [[H408]] hearken [[H8085]] to [[H413]] your dreams [[H2472]] which [[H834]] ye [[H859]] cause to be dreamed. [[H2492]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] falsely [[H8267]] unto you in my name: [[H8034]] I have not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] That [[H3588]] after [[H6310]] seventy [[H7657]] years [[H8141]] be accomplished [[H4390]] at Babylon [[H894]] I will visit [[H6485]] you, and perform [[H6965]] my good [[H2896]] word [[H1697]] toward [[H5921]] you, in causing you to return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] know [[H3045]] the thoughts [[H4284]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] think [[H2803]] toward [[H5921]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] thoughts [[H4284]] of peace, [[H7965]] and not [[H3808]] of evil, [[H7451]] to give [[H5414]] you an expected [[H8615]] end. [[H319]]

### 12
Then shall ye call upon [[H7121]] me, and ye shall go [[H1980]] and pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] me, and I will hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 13
And ye shall seek [[H1245]] me, and find [[H4672]] when [[H3588]] ye shall search for [[H1875]] me with all [[H3605]] your heart. [[H3824]]

### 14
And I will be found [[H4672]] of you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and I will turn away [[H7725]] your captivity, [[H7622]] and I will gather [[H6908]] you from all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H1471]] and from all [[H3605]] the places [[H4725]] whither [[H834]] I have driven [[H5080]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and I will bring you again [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] whence [[H834]] I caused you to be carried away captive. [[H1540]]

### 15
Because [[H3588]] ye have said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath raised us up [[H6965]] prophets [[H5030]] in Babylon; [[H894]]

### 16
that [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] that sitteth [[H3427]] upon [[H413]] the throne [[H3678]] of David, [[H1732]] and of [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that dwelleth [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] of your brethren [[H251]] that [[H834]] are not [[H3808]] gone forth [[H3318]] with [[H854]] you into captivity; [[H1473]]

### 17
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]]  upon them [[H853]] the sword, [[H2719]] the famine, [[H7458]] and the pestilence, [[H1698]] and will make [[H5414]] them like vile [[H8182]] figs, [[H8384]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be eaten, [[H398]] they are so evil. [[H7455]]

### 18
And I will persecute [[H7291]] them [[H310]] with the sword, [[H2719]] with the famine, [[H7458]] and with the pestilence, [[H1698]] and will deliver [[H5414]] them to be removed [[H2113]] to all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth, [[H776]] to be a curse, [[H423]] and an astonishment, [[H8047]] and an hissing, [[H8322]] and a reproach, [[H2781]] among all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] I have driven [[H5080]] them: [[H5080]]

### 19
Because [[H8478]] they have not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] my words, [[H1697]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] I sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] them by my servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] rising up early [[H7925]] and sending [[H7971]] but ye would not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
Hear [[H8085]] ye [[H859]] therefore the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] ye of the captivity, [[H1473]] whom [[H834]] I have sent [[H7971]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Babylon: [[H894]]

### 21
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] of [[H413]] Ahab [[H256]] the son [[H1121]] of Kolaiah, [[H6964]] and of [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] the son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah, [[H4641]] which prophesy [[H5012]] a lie [[H8267]] unto you in my name; [[H8034]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will deliver [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon; [[H894]] and he shall slay [[H5221]] them before your eyes; [[H5869]]

### 22
And of them shall be taken up [[H3947]] a curse [[H7045]] by all [[H3605]] the captivity [[H1546]] of Judah [[H3063]] which [[H834]] in Babylon, [[H894]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] make [[H7760]] thee like Zedekiah [[H6667]] and like Ahab, [[H256]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] roasted [[H7033]] in the fire; [[H784]]

### 23
Because [[H3282]] they have committed [[H6213]] villany [[H5039]] in Israel, [[H3478]] and have committed adultery [[H5003]] with [[H854]] their neighbours' [[H7453]] wives, [[H802]] and have spoken [[H1696]] lying [[H8267]] words [[H1697]] in my name, [[H8034]] which [[H834]] I have not [[H3808]] commanded [[H6680]] them; even I [[H595]] know, [[H3045]] and a witness, [[H5707]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 24
shalt thou also speak [[H559]] to [[H413]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the Nehelamite, [[H5161]] saying, [[H559]]

### 25
Thus [[H3541]] speaketh [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Because [[H3282]] thou [[H859]] hast sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] in thy name [[H8034]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and to [[H413]] Zephaniah [[H6846]] the son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah [[H4641]] the priest, [[H3548]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the priests, [[H3548]] saying, [[H559]]

### 26
The Lord [[H3068]] hath made [[H5414]] thee priest [[H3548]] in the stead of [[H8478]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest, [[H3548]] that ye should be [[H1961]] officers [[H6496]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] for every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] mad, [[H7696]] and maketh himself a prophet, [[H5012]] that thou shouldest put [[H5414]] him in [[H413]] prison, [[H4115]] and in [[H413]] the stocks. [[H6729]]

### 27
Now [[H6258]] therefore why [[H4100]] hast thou not [[H3808]] reproved [[H1605]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] of Anathoth, [[H6069]] which maketh himself a prophet [[H5012]] to you? [[H5012]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] therefore [[H5921]] he sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] us Babylon, [[H894]] saying, [[H559]] This [[H1931]] long: [[H752]] build [[H1129]] ye houses, [[H1004]] and dwell [[H3427]] and plant [[H5193]] gardens, [[H1593]] and eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of them. [[H6529]]

### 29
And Zephaniah [[H6846]] the priest [[H3548]] read [[H7121]] this [[H2088]] letter [[H5612]] in the ears [[H241]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet. [[H5030]]

### 30
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 31
Send [[H7971]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] them of the captivity, [[H1473]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] concerning [[H413]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the Nehelamite; [[H5161]] Because [[H3282]] that Shemaiah [[H8098]] hath prophesied [[H5012]] unto you, and I [[H589]] sent [[H7971]] him not, [[H3808]] and he caused you to trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] a lie: [[H8267]]

### 32
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will punish [[H6485]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the Nehelamite, [[H5161]] and his seed: [[H2233]] he shall not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] to dwell [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] this [[H2088]] people; [[H5971]] neither [[H3808]] shall he behold [[H7200]] the good [[H2896]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] for my people, [[H5971]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] he hath taught [[H1696]] rebellion [[H5627]] against [[H5921]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
