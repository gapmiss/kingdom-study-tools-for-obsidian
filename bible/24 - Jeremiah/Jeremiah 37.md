### 1
And king [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] reigned [[H4427]] instead [[H8478]] of Coniah [[H3659]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim, [[H3079]] whom [[H834]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] made king [[H4427]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
But neither [[H3808]] he, [[H1931]] nor his servants, [[H5650]] nor the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] did hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah. [[H3414]]

### 3
And Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] Jehucal [[H3081]] the son [[H1121]] of Shelemiah [[H8018]] and Zephaniah [[H6846]] the son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah [[H4641]] the priest [[H3548]] to [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]] Pray [[H6419]] now [[H4994]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] for us. [[H5704]]

### 4
Now Jeremiah [[H3414]] came in [[H935]] and went out [[H3318]] among [[H8432]] the people: [[H5971]] for they had not [[H3808]] put [[H5414]] him into prison. [[H1004]]

### 5
Then Pharaoh's [[H6547]] army [[H2428]] was come forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt: [[H4714]] and when the Chaldeans [[H3778]] that besieged [[H6696]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] heard [[H8085]] tidings [[H8088]] of them, they departed [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 6
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 7
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that sent [[H7971]] you unto [[H413]] me to inquire [[H1875]] of me; Behold, [[H2009]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] army, [[H2428]] which is come forth [[H3318]] to help [[H5833]] you, shall return [[H7725]] to Egypt [[H4714]] into their own land. [[H776]]

### 8
And the Chaldeans [[H3778]] shall come again, [[H7725]] and fight [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and take [[H3920]] it, and burn [[H8313]] it with fire. [[H784]]

### 9
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Deceive [[H5377]] not [[H408]] yourselves, [[H5315]] saying, [[H559]] The Chaldeans [[H3778]] shall surely [[H1980]] depart [[H1980]] from [[H5921]] us: for [[H3588]] they shall not [[H3808]] depart. [[H1980]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] though [[H518]] ye had smitten [[H5221]] the whole [[H3605]] army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] that fight [[H3898]] against [[H854]] you, and there remained [[H7604]] wounded [[H1856]] men [[H376]] among them, should they rise up [[H6965]] every man [[H376]] in his tent, [[H168]] and burn [[H8313]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that when the army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] was broken up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] for fear [[H6440]] of Pharaoh's [[H6547]] army, [[H2428]]

### 12
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] went forth [[H3318]] out of Jerusalem [[H3389]] to go [[H1980]] into the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] to separate himself [[H2505]] thence [[H8033]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 13
And when he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] in the gate [[H8179]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] a captain [[H1167]] of the ward [[H6488]] there, [[H8033]] whose name [[H8034]] Irijah, [[H3376]] the son [[H1121]] of Shelemiah, [[H8018]] the son [[H1121]] of Hananiah; [[H2608]] and he took [[H8610]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] fallest away [[H5307]] to [[H413]] the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 14
Then said [[H559]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] false; [[H8267]] I fall away [[H5307]] not [[H369]] to [[H5921]] the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] But he hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] to [[H413]] him: so Irijah [[H3376]] took [[H8610]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] and brought [[H935]] him to [[H413]] the princes. [[H8269]]

### 15
Wherefore the princes [[H8269]] were wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] and smote [[H5221]] him, and put [[H5414]] him in prison [[H612]] in the house [[H1004]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] the scribe: [[H5608]] for [[H3588]] they had made [[H6213]] that the prison. [[H3608]]

### 16
When [[H3588]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] was entered [[H935]] into [[H413]] the dungeon, [[H1004]] and into [[H413]] the cabins, [[H2588]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] had remained [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] many [[H7227]] days; [[H3117]]

### 17
Then Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] sent, [[H7971]] and took out: [[H3947]] him and the king [[H4428]] asked [[H7592]] him secretly [[H5643]] in his house, [[H1004]] and said, [[H559]] Is there [[H3426]] word [[H1697]] from [[H853]] the Lord? [[H3068]] And Jeremiah [[H3414]] said, [[H559]] There is: [[H3426]] for, said [[H559]] he, thou shalt be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 18
Moreover Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Zedekiah, [[H6667]] What [[H4100]] have I offended [[H2398]] against thee, or against thy servants, [[H5650]] or against this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] ye have put [[H5414]] me in [[H413]] prison? [[H1004]]

### 19
Where [[H346]] now your prophets [[H5030]] which [[H834]] prophesied [[H5012]] unto you, saying, [[H559]] The king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] shall not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] against [[H5921]] you, nor against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land? [[H776]]

### 20
Therefore hear [[H8085]] now, [[H6258]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] O my lord [[H113]] the king: [[H4428]] let my supplication, [[H8467]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] be accepted [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] thee; that thou cause me not [[H408]] to return [[H7725]] to the house [[H1004]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] the scribe, [[H5608]] lest [[H3808]] I die [[H4191]] there. [[H4191]]

### 21
Then Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] that they should commit [[H6485]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] into the court [[H2691]] of the prison, [[H4307]] and that they should give [[H5414]] him daily [[H3117]] a piece [[H3603]] of bread [[H3899]] out of the bakers' [[H644]] street, [[H2351]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the bread [[H3899]] in [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] were spent. [[H8552]] Thus Jeremiah [[H3414]] remained [[H3427]] in the court [[H2691]] of the prison. [[H4307]]
