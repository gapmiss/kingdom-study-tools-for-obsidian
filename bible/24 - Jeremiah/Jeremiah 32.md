The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the tenth [[H6224]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which [[H1931]] the eighteenth [[H6240]] year [[H8141]] of Nebuchadrezzar. [[H5019]]

### 2
For then [[H227]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon's [[H894]] army [[H2428]] besieged [[H6696]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] was [[H1961]] shut up [[H3607]] in the court [[H2691]] of the prison, [[H4307]] which [[H834]] in the king [[H4428]] of Judah's [[H3063]] house. [[H1004]]

### 3
For [[H834]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had shut him up, [[H3607]] saying, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4069]] dost thou [[H859]] prophesy, [[H5012]] and say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he shall take [[H3920]] it; [[H3920]]

### 4
And Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] shall not [[H3808]] escape [[H4422]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] but [[H3588]] shall surely [[H5414]] be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and shall speak [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] him mouth [[H6310]] to mouth, [[H6310]] and his eyes [[H5869]] shall behold [[H7200]] his eyes; [[H5869]]

### 5
And he shall lead [[H1980]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] to Babylon, [[H894]] and there [[H8033]] shall he be [[H1961]] until [[H5704]] I visit [[H6485]] him, saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] though [[H3588]] ye fight [[H3898]] with [[H854]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] ye shall not [[H3808]] prosper? [[H6743]]

### 6
And Jeremiah [[H3414]] said, [[H559]] The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2009]] Hanameel [[H2601]] the son [[H1121]] of Shallum [[H7967]] thine uncle [[H1730]] shall come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Buy [[H7069]]  thee [[H853]] my field [[H7704]] that [[H834]] in Anathoth: [[H6068]] for [[H3588]] the right [[H4941]] of redemption [[H1353]] thine to buy [[H7069]]

### 8
So Hanameel [[H2601]] mine uncle's [[H1730]] son [[H1121]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] me in [[H413]] the court [[H2691]] of the prison [[H4307]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Buy [[H7069]] my field, [[H7704]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] that [[H834]] in Anathoth, [[H6068]] which [[H834]] in the country [[H776]] of Benjamin: [[H1144]] for [[H3588]] the right [[H4941]] of inheritance [[H3425]] thine, and the redemption [[H1353]] thine; buy [[H7069]] for thyself. Then I knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And I bought [[H7069]] the field [[H7704]] of [[H853]] Hanameel [[H2601]] my uncle's [[H1730]] son, [[H1121]] that [[H834]] in Anathoth, [[H6068]] and weighed [[H8254]]  him [[H853]] the money, [[H3701]] seventeen [[H7651]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 10
And I subscribed [[H3789]] the evidence, [[H5612]] and sealed [[H2856]] and took [[H5749]] witnesses, [[H5707]] and weighed [[H8254]] the money [[H3701]] in the balances. [[H3976]]

### 11
So I took [[H3947]] the evidence [[H5612]] of the purchase, [[H4736]] that which was sealed [[H2856]] to the law [[H4687]] and custom, [[H2706]] and that which was open: [[H1540]]

### 12
And I gave [[H5414]] the evidence [[H5612]] of the purchase [[H4736]] unto [[H413]] Baruch [[H1263]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah, [[H5374]] the son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah, [[H4271]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Hanameel [[H2601]] mine uncle's [[H1730]] and in the presence [[H5869]] of the witnesses [[H5707]] that subscribed [[H3789]] the book [[H5612]] of the purchase, [[H4736]] before [[H5869]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] that sat [[H3427]] in the court [[H2691]] of the prison. [[H4307]]

### 13
And I charged [[H6680]] Baruch [[H1263]] before [[H5869]] them, saying, [[H559]]

### 14
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Take [[H3947]] these [[H428]] evidences, [[H5612]] this [[H2088]] evidence [[H5612]] of the purchase, [[H4736]] both which is sealed, [[H2856]] and this [[H2088]] evidence [[H5612]] which is open; [[H1540]] and put [[H5414]] them in an earthen [[H2789]] vessel, [[H3627]] that [[H4616]] they may continue [[H5975]] many [[H7227]] days. [[H3117]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Houses [[H1004]] and fields [[H7704]] and vineyards [[H3754]] shall be possessed again [[H7069]] in this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]]

### 16
Now when [[H310]] I had delivered [[H5414]] the evidence [[H5612]] of the purchase [[H4736]] unto [[H413]] Baruch [[H1263]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah, [[H5374]] I prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 17
Ah [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] God! [[H3068]] behold, [[H2009]] thou [[H859]] hast made [[H6213]] the heaven [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] by thy great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and stretched out [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] there is nothing [[H1697]] too hard [[H6381]] for [[H4480]] thee: [[H4480]]

### 18
Thou shewest [[H6213]] lovingkindness [[H2617]] unto thousands, [[H505]] and recompensest [[H7999]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] into [[H413]] the bosom [[H2436]] of their children [[H1121]] after [[H310]] them: the Great, [[H1419]] the Mighty [[H1368]] God, [[H410]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] his name, [[H8034]]

### 19
Great [[H1419]] in counsel, [[H6098]] and mighty [[H7227]] in work: [[H5950]] for [[H834]] thine eyes [[H5869]] open [[H6491]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men: [[H120]] to give [[H5414]] every one [[H376]] according to his ways, [[H1870]] and according to the fruit [[H6529]] of his doings: [[H4611]]

### 20
Which [[H834]] hast set [[H7760]] signs [[H226]] and wonders [[H4159]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] and in Israel, [[H3478]] and among men; [[H120]] and hast made [[H6213]] thee a name, [[H8034]] as at this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]]

### 21
And hast brought forth [[H3318]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with signs, [[H226]] and with wonders, [[H4159]] and with a strong [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and with a stretched out [[H5186]] arm, [[H248]] and with great [[H1419]] terror; [[H4172]]

### 22
And hast given [[H5414]]  them [[H853]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou didst swear [[H7650]] to their fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] them, a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey; [[H1706]]

### 23
And they came in, [[H935]] and possessed [[H3423]] it; but they obeyed [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] thy voice, [[H6963]] neither [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in thy law; [[H8451]] they have done [[H6213]] nothing [[H3808]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou commandedst [[H6680]] them to do: [[H6213]]  therefore thou hast caused [[H853]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] to come upon [[H7122]] them: [[H7122]]

### 24
Behold [[H2009]] the mounts, [[H5550]] they are come [[H935]] unto the city [[H5892]] to take [[H3920]] it; and the city [[H5892]] is given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] that fight [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] it, because [[H6440]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and of the famine, [[H7458]] and of the pestilence: [[H1698]] and what [[H834]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] is come to pass; [[H1961]] and, behold, [[H2005]] thou seest [[H7200]]

### 25
And thou [[H859]] hast said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] Buy [[H7069]] thee the field [[H7704]] for money, [[H3701]] and take [[H5749]] witnesses; [[H5707]] for the city [[H5892]] is given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 26
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 27
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of all [[H3605]] flesh: [[H1320]] is there any [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] too hard [[H6381]] for [[H4480]] me? [[H4480]]

### 28
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will give [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he shall take [[H3920]] it: [[H3920]]

### 29
And the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] that fight [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] shall come [[H935]] and set [[H3341]] fire [[H784]]  on [[H853]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and burn [[H8313]] it with the houses, [[H1004]] upon [[H5921]] whose [[H834]] roofs [[H1406]] they have offered incense [[H6999]] unto Baal, [[H1168]] and poured out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] to [[H4616]] provoke me to anger. [[H3707]]

### 30
For [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] have [[H1961]] only [[H389]] done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] before [[H5869]] me from their youth: [[H5271]] for [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] have only [[H389]] provoked me to anger [[H3707]] with the work [[H4639]] of their hands, [[H3027]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] hath been [[H1961]] to me a provocation of [[H5921]] mine anger [[H639]] and of [[H5921]] my fury [[H2534]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] they built [[H1129]] it even unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]] that I should remove [[H5493]] it from before [[H5921]] my face, [[H6440]]

### 32
Because [[H5921]] of all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and of the children [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which [[H834]] they have done [[H6213]] to provoke me to anger, [[H3707]] they, [[H1992]] their kings, [[H4428]] their princes, [[H8269]] their priests, [[H3548]] and their prophets, [[H5030]] and the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 33
And they have turned [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] me the back, [[H6203]] and not [[H3808]] the face: [[H6440]] though I taught [[H3925]] them, rising up early [[H7925]] and teaching [[H3925]] yet they have not [[H369]] hearkened [[H8085]] to receive [[H3947]] instruction. [[H4148]]

### 34
But they set [[H7760]] their abominations [[H8251]] in the house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] my name, [[H8034]] to defile [[H2930]] it. [[H2930]]

### 35
And they built [[H1129]] the high places [[H1116]] of Baal, [[H1168]] which [[H834]] in the valley [[H1516]] of the son [[H1121]] of Hinnom, [[H2011]]  to cause [[H853]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters [[H1323]] to pass through [[H5674]] unto Molech; [[H4432]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] them not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] came [[H5927]] it into [[H5921]] my mind, [[H3820]] that they should do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] abomination, [[H8441]] to [[H4616]]  cause [[H853]] Judah [[H3063]] to sin. [[H2398]]

### 36
And now [[H6258]] therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] concerning [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] whereof [[H834]] ye [[H859]] say, [[H559]] It shall be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence; [[H1698]]

### 37
Behold, [[H2005]] I will gather out [[H6908]] them of all [[H3605]] countries, [[H776]] whither [[H834]] I have driven [[H5080]] them in mine anger, [[H639]] and in my fury, [[H2534]] and in great [[H1419]] wrath; [[H7110]] and I will bring them again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and I will cause them to dwell [[H3427]] safely: [[H983]]

### 38
And they shall be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their God: [[H430]]

### 39
And I will give [[H5414]] them one [[H259]] heart, [[H3820]] and one [[H259]] way, [[H1870]] that they may fear [[H3372]] me for ever, [[H3117]] for the good [[H2896]] of them, and of their children [[H1121]] after [[H310]] them: [[H310]]

### 40
And I will make [[H3772]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] with them, that [[H834]] I will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] from [[H310]] them, to do them good; [[H3190]] but I will put [[H5414]] my fear [[H3374]] in their hearts, [[H3824]] that they shall not [[H1115]] depart [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 41
Yea, I will rejoice [[H7797]] over [[H5921]] them to do them good, [[H2895]] and I will plant [[H5193]] them in this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] assuredly [[H571]] with my whole [[H3605]] heart [[H3820]] and with my whole [[H3605]] soul. [[H5315]]

### 42
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Like as [[H834]] I have brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] so [[H3651]] will I [[H595]] bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]]  them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] have promised [[H1696]] them. [[H5921]]

### 43
And fields [[H7704]] shall be bought [[H7069]] in this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] whereof [[H834]] ye [[H859]] say, [[H559]] desolate [[H8077]] without [[H369]] man [[H120]] or beast; [[H929]] it is given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 44
Men shall buy [[H7069]] fields [[H7704]] for money, [[H3701]] and subscribe [[H3789]] evidences, [[H5612]] and seal [[H2856]] and take [[H5749]] witnesses [[H5707]] in the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and in the places about [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of the valley, [[H8219]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of the south: [[H5045]] for [[H3588]]  I will cause [[H853]] their captivity [[H7622]] to return, [[H7725]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
