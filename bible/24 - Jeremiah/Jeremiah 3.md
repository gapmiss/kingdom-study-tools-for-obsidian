### 1
They say, [[H559]] If [[H2005]] a man [[H376]] put away [[H7971]] his wife, [[H802]] and she go [[H1980]] from [[H853]] him, and become [[H1961]] another [[H312]] man's, [[H376]] shall he return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]]  her again? [[H5750]] shall not [[H3808]] that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] be greatly [[H2610]] polluted? [[H2610]] but thou [[H859]] hast played the harlot [[H2181]] with many [[H7227]] lovers; [[H7453]] yet return again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
Lift up [[H5375]] thine eyes [[H5869]] unto [[H5921]] the high places, [[H8205]] and see [[H7200]] where [[H375]] thou hast not [[H3808]] been lien [[H7693]] with. In [[H5921]] the ways [[H1870]] hast thou sat [[H3427]] for them, as the Arabian [[H6163]] in the wilderness; [[H4057]] and thou hast polluted [[H2610]] the land [[H776]] with thy whoredoms [[H2184]] and with thy wickedness. [[H7451]]

### 3
Therefore the showers [[H7241]] have been withholden, [[H4513]] and there hath been [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] latter rain; [[H4456]] and thou hadst a whore's [[H2181]] forehead, [[H4696]] thou refusedst [[H3985]] to be ashamed. [[H3637]]

### 4
Wilt thou not [[H3808]] from this time [[H6258]] cry [[H7121]] unto me, My father, [[H1]] thou [[H859]] the guide [[H441]] of my youth? [[H5271]]

### 5
Will he reserve [[H5201]] for ever? [[H5769]] will he keep [[H8104]] to the end? [[H5331]] Behold, [[H2009]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] and done [[H6213]] evil things [[H7451]] as thou couldest. [[H3201]]

### 6
The Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] also unto [[H413]] me in the days [[H3117]] of Josiah [[H2977]] the king, [[H4428]] Hast thou seen [[H7200]] which [[H834]] backsliding [[H4878]] Israel [[H3478]] hath done? [[H6213]] she [[H1931]] is gone up [[H1980]] upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] mountain [[H2022]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree, [[H6086]] and there [[H8033]] hath played the harlot. [[H2181]]

### 7
And I said [[H559]] after [[H310]] she had done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] Turn [[H7725]] thou unto [[H413]] me. But she returned [[H7725]] not. [[H3808]] And her treacherous [[H901]] sister [[H269]] Judah [[H3063]] saw [[H7200]]

### 8
And I saw, [[H7200]] when [[H3588]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the causes [[H182]] whereby [[H834]] backsliding [[H4878]] Israel [[H3478]] committed adultery [[H5003]] I had put her away, [[H7971]] and given [[H5414]]  her [[H853]] a bill [[H5612]] of divorce; [[H3748]] yet her treacherous [[H898]] sister [[H269]] Judah [[H3063]] feared [[H3372]] not, [[H3808]] but went [[H1980]] and played the harlot [[H2181]] also. [[H2181]]

### 9
And it came to pass [[H1961]] through the lightness [[H6963]] of her whoredom, [[H2184]] that she defiled [[H2610]] the land, [[H776]] and committed adultery [[H5003]] with [[H854]] stones [[H68]] and with [[H854]] stocks. [[H6086]]

### 10
And yet [[H1571]] for all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] her treacherous [[H901]] sister [[H269]] Judah [[H3063]] hath not [[H3808]] turned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] me with her whole [[H3605]] heart, [[H3820]] but [[H3588]] feignedly, [[H8267]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, The backsliding [[H4878]] Israel [[H3478]] hath justified [[H6663]] herself [[H5315]] more than treacherous [[H898]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 12
Go [[H1980]] and proclaim [[H7121]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] toward the north, [[H6828]] and say, [[H559]] Return, [[H7725]] thou backsliding [[H4878]] Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] I will not [[H3808]] cause mine anger [[H6440]] to fall [[H5307]] upon you: for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] merciful, [[H2623]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I will not [[H3808]] keep [[H5201]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 13
Only [[H389]] acknowledge [[H3045]] thine iniquity, [[H5771]] that [[H3588]] thou hast transgressed [[H6586]] against the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and hast scattered [[H6340]] thy ways [[H1870]] to the strangers [[H2114]] under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree, [[H6086]] and ye have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
Turn, [[H7725]] O backsliding [[H7726]] children, [[H1121]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am married [[H1166]] unto you: and I will take [[H3947]] you one [[H259]] of a city, [[H5892]] and two [[H8147]] of a family, [[H4940]] and I will bring [[H935]] you to Zion: [[H6726]]

### 15
And I will give [[H5414]] you pastors [[H7462]] according to mine heart, [[H3820]] which shall feed [[H7462]] you with knowledge [[H1844]] and understanding. [[H7919]]

### 16
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] ye be multiplied [[H7235]] and increased [[H6509]] in the land, [[H776]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] they shall say [[H559]] no [[H3808]] more, [[H5750]] The ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] neither [[H3808]] shall it come [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] mind: [[H3820]] neither [[H3808]] shall they remember [[H2142]] it; neither [[H3808]] shall they visit [[H6485]] neither [[H3808]] shall be done [[H6213]] any more. [[H6213]]

### 17
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] they shall call [[H7121]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] the throne [[H3678]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] shall be gathered [[H6960]] unto [[H413]] it, to the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to Jerusalem: [[H3389]] neither [[H3808]] shall they walk [[H1980]] any more [[H5750]] after [[H310]] the imagination [[H8307]] of their evil [[H7451]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 18
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] shall walk [[H1980]] with [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they shall come [[H935]] together [[H3162]] out of the land [[H776]] of the north [[H6828]] to [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I have given for an inheritance [[H5157]]  unto [[H853]] your fathers. [[H1]]

### 19
But I [[H595]] said, [[H559]] How [[H349]] shall I put [[H7896]] thee among the children, [[H1121]] and give [[H5414]] thee a pleasant [[H2532]] land, [[H776]] a goodly [[H6643]] heritage [[H5159]] of the hosts [[H6635]] of nations? [[H1471]] and I said, [[H559]] Thou shalt call [[H7121]] me, My father; [[H1]] and shalt not [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] from [[H310]] me. [[H310]]

### 20
Surely [[H403]] a wife [[H802]] treacherously departeth [[H898]] from her husband, [[H7453]] so [[H3651]] have ye dealt treacherously [[H898]] with me, O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
A voice [[H6963]] was heard [[H8085]] upon [[H5921]] the high places, [[H8205]] weeping [[H1065]] supplications [[H8469]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] they have perverted [[H5753]] their way, [[H1870]] they have forgotten [[H7911]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]]

### 22
Return, [[H7725]] ye backsliding [[H7726]] children, [[H1121]] I will heal [[H7495]] your backslidings. [[H4878]] Behold, [[H2005]] we come [[H857]] unto thee; for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 23
Truly [[H403]] in vain [[H8267]] from the hills, [[H1389]] the multitude [[H1995]] of mountains: [[H2022]] truly [[H403]] in the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] the salvation [[H8668]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
For shame [[H1322]] hath devoured [[H398]] the labour [[H3018]] of our fathers [[H1]] from our youth; [[H5271]] their flocks [[H6629]] and their herds, [[H1241]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters. [[H1323]]

### 25
We lie down [[H7901]] in our shame, [[H1322]] and our confusion [[H3639]] covereth [[H3680]] us: for [[H3588]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] we [[H587]] and our fathers, [[H1]] from our youth [[H5271]] even unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] and have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God.
