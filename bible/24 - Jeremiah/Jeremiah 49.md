### 1
Concerning the Ammonites, [[H1121]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Hath Israel [[H3478]] no [[H369]] sons? [[H1121]] hath he no [[H369]] heir? [[H3423]] why [[H4069]] doth their king [[H4428]] inherit [[H3423]] Gad, [[H1410]] and his people [[H5971]] dwell [[H3427]] in his cities? [[H5892]]

### 2
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will cause an alarm [[H8643]] of war [[H4421]] to be heard [[H8085]] in [[H413]] Rabbah [[H7237]] of the Ammonites; [[H1121]] and it shall be [[H1961]] a desolate [[H8077]] heap, [[H8510]] and her daughters [[H1323]] shall be burned [[H3341]] with fire: [[H784]] then shall Israel [[H3478]] be heir [[H3423]]  unto them that were [[H853]] his heirs, [[H3423]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
Howl, [[H3213]] O Heshbon, [[H2809]] for [[H3588]] Ai [[H5857]] is spoiled: [[H7703]] cry, [[H6817]] ye daughters [[H1323]] of Rabbah, [[H7237]] gird [[H2296]] you with sackcloth; [[H8242]] lament, [[H5594]] and run to and fro [[H7751]] by the hedges; [[H1448]] for [[H3588]] their king [[H4428]] shall go [[H1980]] into captivity, [[H1473]] his priests [[H3548]] and his princes [[H8269]] together. [[H3162]]

### 4
Wherefore [[H4100]] gloriest [[H1984]] thou in the valleys, [[H6010]] thy flowing [[H2100]] valley, [[H6010]] O backsliding [[H7728]] daughter? [[H1323]] that trusted [[H982]] in her treasures, [[H214]] Who [[H4310]] shall come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me? [[H413]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] a fear [[H6343]] upon [[H5921]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts, [[H6635]] from all [[H3605]] those that be about [[H5439]] thee; and ye shall be driven out [[H5080]] every man [[H376]] right forth; [[H6440]] and none [[H369]] shall gather up [[H6908]] him that wandereth. [[H5074]]

### 6
And afterward [[H310]] I will bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
Concerning Edom, [[H123]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] wisdom [[H2451]] no [[H369]] more [[H5750]] in Teman? [[H8487]] is counsel [[H6098]] perished [[H6]] from the prudent? [[H995]] is their wisdom [[H2451]] vanished? [[H5628]]

### 8
Flee [[H5127]] ye, turn back, [[H6437]] dwell [[H3427]] deep, [[H6009]] O inhabitants [[H3427]] of Dedan; [[H1719]] for [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] the calamity [[H343]] of Esau [[H6215]] upon [[H5921]] him, the time [[H6256]] I will visit [[H6485]] him. [[H6485]]

### 9
If [[H518]] grapegatherers [[H1219]] come [[H935]] to thee, would they not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] gleaning grapes? [[H5955]] if [[H518]] thieves [[H1590]] by night, [[H3915]] they will destroy [[H7843]] till they have enough. [[H1767]]

### 10
But [[H3588]] I [[H589]]  have made [[H853]] Esau [[H6215]] bare, [[H2834]] I have uncovered [[H1540]] his secret places, [[H4565]] and he shall not [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to hide himself: [[H2247]] his seed [[H2233]] is spoiled, [[H7703]] and his brethren, [[H251]] and his neighbours, [[H7934]] and he not. [[H7934]]

### 11
Leave [[H5800]] thy fatherless children, [[H3490]] I [[H589]] will preserve alive; [[H2421]] and let thy widows [[H490]] trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] they whose [[H834]] judgment [[H4941]] not [[H369]] to drink [[H8354]] of the cup [[H3563]] have assuredly [[H8354]] drunken; [[H8354]] and thou [[H859]] he [[H1931]] shall altogether [[H5352]] go unpunished? [[H5352]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] go unpunished, [[H5352]] but [[H3588]] thou shalt surely [[H8354]] drink [[H8354]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] I have sworn [[H7650]] by myself, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] Bozrah [[H1224]] shall become [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H8047]] a reproach, [[H2781]] a waste, [[H2721]] and a curse; [[H7045]] and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] thereof shall be [[H1961]] perpetual [[H5769]] wastes. [[H2723]]

### 14
I have heard [[H8085]] a rumour [[H8052]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and an ambassador [[H6735]] is sent [[H7971]] unto the heathen, [[H1471]] Gather ye together, [[H6908]] and come [[H935]] against [[H5921]] her, and rise up [[H6965]] to the battle. [[H4421]]

### 15
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] I will make [[H5414]] thee small [[H6996]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] despised [[H959]] among men. [[H120]]

### 16
Thy terribleness [[H8606]] hath deceived [[H5377]] thee, the pride [[H2087]] of thine heart, [[H3820]] O thou that dwellest [[H7931]] in the clefts [[H2288]] of the rock, [[H5553]] that holdest [[H8610]] the height [[H4791]] of the hill: [[H1389]] though [[H3588]] thou shouldest make thy nest [[H7064]] as high [[H1361]] as the eagle, [[H5404]] I will bring thee down [[H3381]] from thence, [[H8033]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
Also Edom [[H123]] shall be [[H1961]] a desolation: [[H8047]] every one [[H3605]] that goeth [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] it shall be astonished, [[H8074]] and shall hiss [[H8319]] at [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the plagues [[H4347]] thereof. [[H4347]]

### 18
As in the overthrow [[H4114]] of Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] and the neighbour [[H7934]] thereof, saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] shall abide [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] neither [[H3808]] shall a son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] dwell [[H1481]] in it. [[H1481]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2009]] he shall come up [[H5927]] like a lion [[H738]] from the swelling [[H1347]] of Jordan [[H3383]] against [[H413]] the habitation [[H5116]] of the strong: [[H386]] but [[H3588]] I will suddenly [[H7280]] make him run away [[H7323]] from [[H5921]] her: and who [[H4310]] a chosen [[H977]] I may appoint [[H6485]] over [[H413]] her? for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] like me? [[H3644]] and who [[H4310]] will appoint time? [[H3259]] me the and who [[H4310]] that [[H2088]] shepherd [[H7462]] that [[H834]] will stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] me? [[H6440]]

### 20
Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] he hath taken [[H3289]] against [[H413]] Edom; [[H123]] and his purposes, [[H4284]] that [[H834]] he hath purposed [[H2803]] against [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Teman: [[H8487]] Surely [[H518]] the least [[H6810]] of the flock [[H6629]] shall draw them out: [[H5498]] surely [[H518]] he shall make their habitations [[H5116]] desolate [[H8074]] with [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 21
The earth [[H776]] is moved [[H7493]] at the noise [[H6963]] of their fall, [[H5307]] at the cry [[H6818]] the noise [[H6963]] thereof was heard [[H8085]] in the Red [[H5488]] sea. [[H3220]]

### 22
Behold, [[H2009]] he shall come up [[H5927]] and fly [[H1675]] as the eagle, [[H5404]] and spread [[H6566]] his wings [[H3671]] over [[H5921]] Bozrah: [[H1224]] and at that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall the heart [[H3820]] of the mighty men [[H1368]] of Edom [[H123]] be [[H1961]] as the heart [[H3820]] of a woman [[H802]] in her pangs. [[H6887]]

### 23
Concerning Damascus. [[H1834]] Hamath [[H2574]] is confounded, [[H954]] and Arpad: [[H774]] for [[H3588]] they have heard [[H8085]] evil [[H7451]] tidings: [[H8052]] they are fainthearted; [[H4127]] sorrow [[H1674]] on the sea; [[H3220]] it cannot [[H3201]] be quiet. [[H8252]]

### 24
Damascus [[H1834]] is waxed feeble, [[H7503]] turneth herself [[H6437]] to flee, [[H5127]] and fear [[H7374]] hath seized [[H2388]] on anguish [[H6869]] and sorrows [[H2256]] have taken [[H270]] her, as a woman in travail. [[H3205]]

### 25
How [[H349]] is the city [[H5892]] of praise [[H8416]] not [[H3808]] left, [[H5800]] the city [[H7151]] of my joy! [[H4885]]

### 26
Therefore [[H3651]] her young men [[H970]] shall fall [[H5307]] in her streets, [[H7339]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] shall be cut off [[H1826]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 27
And I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in the wall [[H2346]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] and it shall consume [[H398]] the palaces [[H759]] of Ben-hadad. [[H1130]]

### 28
Concerning Kedar, [[H6938]] and concerning the kingdoms [[H4467]] of Hazor, [[H2674]] which [[H834]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] shall smite, [[H5221]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Arise [[H6965]] ye, go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Kedar, [[H6938]] and spoil [[H7703]] the men [[H1121]] of the east. [[H6924]]

### 29
Their tents [[H168]] and their flocks [[H6629]] shall they take away: [[H3947]] they shall take [[H5375]] to themselves their curtains, [[H3407]] and all [[H3605]] their vessels, [[H3627]] and their camels; [[H1581]] and they shall cry [[H7121]] unto [[H5921]] them, Fear [[H4032]] on every side. [[H5439]]

### 30
Flee, [[H5127]] get [[H5110]] you far off, [[H3966]] dwell [[H3427]] deep, [[H6009]] O ye inhabitants [[H3427]] of Hazor, [[H2674]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] hath taken [[H3289]] counsel [[H6098]] against [[H5921]] you, and hath conceived [[H2803]] a purpose [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 31
Arise, [[H6965]] get you up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] the wealthy [[H7961]] nation, [[H1471]] that dwelleth [[H3427]] without care, [[H983]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which have neither [[H3808]] gates [[H1817]] nor [[H3808]] bars, [[H1280]] dwell [[H7931]] alone. [[H910]]

### 32
And their camels [[H1581]] shall be [[H1961]] a booty, [[H957]] and the multitude [[H1995]] of their cattle [[H4735]] a spoil: [[H7998]] and I will scatter [[H2219]] into all [[H3605]] winds [[H7307]] them in the utmost [[H7112]] corners; [[H6285]] and I will bring [[H935]] their calamity [[H343]] from all [[H3605]] sides [[H5676]] thereof, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 33
And Hazor [[H2674]] shall be [[H1961]] a dwelling [[H4583]] for dragons, [[H8577]] a desolation [[H8077]] for [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]] there shall no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] abide [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] nor [[H3808]] son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] dwell [[H1481]] in it. [[H1481]]

### 34
The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] against [[H413]] Elam [[H5867]] in the beginning [[H7225]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]]

### 35
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will break [[H7665]] the bow [[H7198]] of Elam, [[H5867]] the chief [[H7225]] of their might. [[H1369]]

### 36
And upon [[H413]] Elam [[H5867]] will I bring [[H935]] the four [[H702]] winds [[H7307]] from the four [[H702]] quarters [[H7098]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and will scatter [[H2219]] them toward all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] winds; [[H7307]] and there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] nation [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] the outcasts [[H5080]] of Elam [[H5867]] shall not [[H3808]] come. [[H935]]

### 37
For I will cause [[H853]] Elam [[H5867]] to be dismayed [[H2865]] before [[H6440]] their enemies, [[H341]] and before [[H6440]] them that seek [[H1245]] their life: [[H5315]] and I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]]  them, [[H853]] my fierce [[H2740]] anger, [[H639]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and I will send [[H7971]] the sword [[H2719]] after [[H310]] them, till [[H5704]] I have consumed [[H3615]] them: [[H3615]]

### 38
And I will set [[H7760]] my throne [[H3678]] in Elam, [[H5867]] and will destroy [[H6]] from thence [[H8033]] the king [[H4428]] and the princes, [[H8269]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 39
But it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in the latter [[H319]] days, [[H3117]] I will bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Elam, [[H5867]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
