### 1
Oh that [[H5414]] my head [[H7218]] were waters, [[H4325]] and mine eyes [[H5869]] a fountain [[H4726]] of tears, [[H1832]] that I might weep [[H1058]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] for [[H853]] the slain [[H2491]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people! [[H5971]]

### 2
Oh that [[H5414]] I had [[H4310]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] a lodging place [[H4411]] of wayfaring men; [[H732]] that I might leave [[H5800]] my people, [[H5971]] and go [[H1980]] from [[H853]] them! for [[H3588]] they all [[H3605]] adulterers, [[H5003]] an assembly [[H6116]] of treacherous men. [[H898]]

### 3
And they bend [[H1869]] their tongues [[H3956]] their bow [[H7198]] lies: [[H8267]] but they are not [[H3808]] valiant [[H1396]] for the truth [[H530]] upon the earth; [[H776]] for [[H3588]] they proceed [[H3318]] from evil [[H7451]] to [[H413]] evil, [[H7451]] and they know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
Take ye heed [[H8104]] every one [[H376]] of his neighbour, [[H7453]] and trust [[H982]] ye not [[H408]] in [[H5921]] any [[H3605]] brother: [[H251]] for [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] brother [[H251]] will utterly [[H6117]] supplant, [[H6117]] and every [[H3605]] neighbour [[H7453]] will walk [[H1980]] with slanders. [[H7400]]

### 5
And they will deceive [[H2048]] every one [[H376]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] and will not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] the truth: [[H571]] they have taught [[H3925]] their tongue [[H3956]] to speak [[H1696]] lies, [[H8267]] weary themselves [[H3811]] to commit iniquity. [[H5753]]

### 6
Thine habitation [[H3427]] in the midst [[H8432]] of deceit; [[H4820]] through deceit [[H4820]] they refuse [[H3985]] to know [[H3045]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will melt [[H6884]] them, and try [[H974]] them; for [[H3588]] how [[H349]] shall I do [[H6213]] for [[H6440]] the daughter [[H1323]] of my people? [[H5971]]

### 8
Their tongue [[H3956]] an arrow [[H2671]] shot out; [[H7819]] it speaketh [[H1696]] deceit: [[H4820]] speaketh [[H1696]] peaceably [[H7965]] to [[H854]] his neighbour [[H7453]] with his mouth, [[H6310]] but in heart [[H7130]] he layeth [[H7760]] his wait. [[H696]]

### 9
Shall I not [[H3808]] visit [[H6485]] them for [[H5921]] these [[H428]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] shall not [[H3808]] my soul [[H5315]] be avenged [[H5358]] on such [[H834]] a nation [[H1471]] as this? [[H1471]]

### 10
For [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] will I take up [[H5375]] a weeping [[H1065]] and wailing, [[H5092]] and for [[H5921]] the habitations [[H4999]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] a lamentation, [[H7015]] because [[H3588]] they are burned up, [[H3341]] so that none [[H376]] can pass through [[H5674]] neither [[H3808]] can hear [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the cattle; [[H4735]] both the fowl [[H5775]] of the heavens [[H8064]] and the beast [[H929]] are fled; [[H5074]] they are gone. [[H1980]]

### 11
And I will make [[H5414]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] heaps, [[H1530]] a den [[H4583]] of dragons; [[H8577]] and I will make [[H5414]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] desolate, [[H8077]] without [[H1097]] an inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 12
Who [[H4310]] the wise [[H2450]] man, [[H376]] that may understand [[H995]] this? [[H2063]] and to [[H413]] whom the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken, [[H1696]] that he may declare [[H5046]] it, for [[H5921]] what [[H4100]] the land [[H776]] perisheth [[H6]] is burned up [[H3341]] like a wilderness, [[H4057]] that none [[H1097]] passeth through? [[H5674]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] saith, [[H559]] Because [[H5921]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] my law [[H8451]] which [[H834]] I set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] them, and have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] neither [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] therein; [[H1980]]

### 14
But have walked [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the imagination [[H8307]] of their own heart, [[H3820]] and after [[H310]] Baalim, [[H1168]] which [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] taught [[H3925]] them: [[H3925]]

### 15
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will feed [[H398]]  them, [[H853]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] with wormwood, [[H3939]] and give them water [[H4325]] of gall [[H7219]] to drink. [[H8248]]

### 16
I will scatter [[H6327]] them also among the heathen, [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] they [[H1992]] nor their fathers [[H1]] have known: [[H3045]] and I will send [[H7971]] a sword [[H2719]] after [[H310]] them, till [[H5704]] I have consumed [[H3615]] them. [[H3615]]

### 17
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Consider [[H995]] ye, and call [[H7121]] for the mourning women, [[H6969]] that they may come; [[H935]] and send [[H7971]] for [[H413]] cunning [[H2450]] that they may come: [[H935]]

### 18
And let them make haste, [[H4116]] and take up [[H5375]] a wailing [[H5092]] for [[H5921]] us, that our eyes [[H5869]] may run down [[H3381]] with tears, [[H1832]] and our eyelids [[H6079]] gush out [[H5140]] with waters. [[H4325]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] a voice [[H6963]] of wailing [[H5092]] is heard [[H8085]] out of Zion, [[H6726]] How [[H349]] are we spoiled! [[H7703]] we are greatly [[H3966]] confounded, [[H954]] because [[H3588]] we have forsaken [[H5800]] the land, [[H776]] because [[H3588]] our dwellings [[H4908]] have cast out. [[H7993]]

### 20
Yet [[H3588]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] O ye women, [[H802]] and let your ear [[H241]] receive [[H3947]] the word [[H1697]] of his mouth, [[H6310]] and teach [[H3925]] your daughters [[H1323]] wailing, [[H5092]] and every one [[H802]] her neighbour [[H7468]] lamentation. [[H7015]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] death [[H4194]] is come up [[H5927]] into our windows, [[H2474]] is entered [[H935]] into our palaces, [[H759]] to cut off [[H3772]] the children [[H5768]] from without, [[H2351]] the young men [[H970]] from the streets. [[H7339]]

### 22
Speak, [[H1696]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Even the carcases [[H5038]] of men [[H120]] shall fall [[H5307]] as dung [[H1828]] upon [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field, [[H7704]] and as the handful [[H5995]] after [[H310]] the harvestman, [[H7114]] and none [[H369]] shall gather [[H622]]

### 23
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Let not [[H408]] the wise [[H2450]] glory [[H1984]] in his wisdom, [[H2451]] neither [[H408]] let the mighty [[H1368]] glory [[H1984]] in his might, [[H1369]] let not [[H408]] the rich [[H6223]] glory [[H1984]] in his riches: [[H6239]]

### 24
But [[H3588]] let him that glorieth [[H1984]] glory [[H1984]] in this, [[H2063]] that he understandeth [[H7919]] and knoweth [[H3045]] me, that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] which exercise [[H6213]] lovingkindness, [[H2617]] judgment, [[H4941]] and righteousness, [[H6666]] in the earth: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] in these [[H428]] I delight, [[H2654]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 25
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will punish [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] circumcised [[H4135]] with the uncircumcised; [[H6190]]

### 26
Egypt, [[H4714]] and Judah, [[H3063]] and Edom, [[H123]] and the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and Moab, [[H4124]] and all [[H3605]] in the utmost [[H7112]] corners, [[H6285]] that dwell [[H3427]] in the wilderness: [[H4057]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] uncircumcised, [[H6189]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] in the heart.
