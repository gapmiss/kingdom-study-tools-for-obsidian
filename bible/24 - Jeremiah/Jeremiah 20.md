### 1
Now Pashur [[H6583]] the son [[H1121]] of Immer [[H564]] the priest, [[H3548]] who [[H1931]] also chief [[H6496]] governor [[H5057]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]]  that [[H853]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] prophesied [[H5012]] these [[H428]] things. [[H1697]]

### 2
Then Pashur [[H6583]] smote [[H5221]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and put [[H5414]] him in [[H5921]] the stocks [[H4115]] that [[H834]] in the high [[H5945]] gate [[H8179]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] which [[H834]] by the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that Pashur [[H6583]] brought forth [[H3318]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] out of [[H4480]] the stocks. [[H4115]] Then said [[H559]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] unto [[H413]] him, The Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] called [[H7121]] thy name [[H8034]] Pashur, [[H6583]] but [[H3588]] Magor-missabib. [[H4036]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will make [[H5414]] thee a terror [[H4032]] to thyself, and to all [[H3605]] thy friends: [[H157]] and they shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] of their enemies, [[H341]] and thine eyes [[H5869]] shall behold [[H7200]] and I will give [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he shall carry them captive [[H1540]] into Babylon, [[H894]] and shall slay [[H5221]] them with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 5
Moreover I will deliver [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the strength [[H2633]] of this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and all [[H3605]] the labours [[H3018]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the precious things [[H3366]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the treasures [[H214]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] will I give [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H341]] which shall spoil [[H962]] them, and take [[H3947]] them, and carry [[H935]] them to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 6
And thou, [[H859]] Pashur, [[H6583]] and all [[H3605]] that dwell [[H3427]] in thine house [[H1004]] shall go [[H1980]] into captivity: [[H7628]] and thou shalt come [[H935]] to Babylon, [[H894]] and there [[H8033]] thou shalt die, [[H4191]] and shalt be buried [[H6912]] there, [[H8033]] thou, [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] thy friends, [[H157]] to whom [[H834]] thou hast prophesied [[H5012]] lies. [[H8267]]

### 7
O Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast deceived [[H6601]] me, and I was deceived: [[H6601]] thou art stronger [[H2388]] than I, and hast prevailed: [[H3201]] I am [[H1961]] in derision [[H7814]] daily, [[H3117]] every one [[H3605]] mocketh [[H3932]] me. [[H3932]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] since [[H1767]] I spake, [[H1696]] I cried out, [[H2199]] I cried [[H7121]] violence [[H2555]] and spoil; [[H7701]] because [[H3588]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was made [[H1961]] a reproach [[H2781]] unto me, and a derision, [[H7047]] daily. [[H3117]]

### 9
Then I said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] make mention [[H2142]] of him, nor [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] any more [[H5750]] in his name. [[H8034]] But was [[H1961]] in mine heart [[H3820]] as a burning [[H1197]] fire [[H784]] shut up [[H6113]] in my bones, [[H6106]] and I was weary [[H3811]] with forbearing, [[H3557]] and I could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] I heard [[H8085]] the defaming [[H1681]] of many, [[H7227]] fear [[H4032]] on every side. [[H5439]] Report, [[H5046]] and we will report [[H5046]] it. All [[H3605]] my familiars [[H582]] watched [[H8104]] for my halting, [[H6761]] Peradventure [[H194]] he will be enticed, [[H6601]] and we shall prevail [[H3201]] against him, and we shall take [[H3947]] our revenge [[H5360]] on [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 11
But the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H854]] me as a mighty [[H1368]] terrible one: [[H6184]] therefore [[H5921]] my persecutors [[H7291]] shall stumble, [[H3782]] and they shall not [[H3808]] prevail: [[H3201]] they shall be greatly [[H3966]] ashamed; [[H954]] for [[H3588]] they shall not [[H3808]] prosper: [[H7919]] everlasting [[H5769]] confusion [[H3639]] shall never [[H3808]] be forgotten. [[H7911]]

### 12
But, O Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] that triest [[H974]] the righteous, [[H6662]] seest [[H7200]] the reins [[H3629]] and the heart, [[H3820]] let me see [[H7200]] thy vengeance [[H5360]] on them: for [[H3588]] unto [[H413]] thee have I opened [[H1540]] my cause. [[H7379]]

### 13
Sing [[H7891]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] praise [[H1984]]  ye [[H853]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he hath delivered [[H5337]] the soul [[H5315]] of the poor [[H34]] from the hand [[H3027]] of evildoers. [[H7489]]

### 14
Cursed [[H779]] the day [[H3117]] wherein [[H834]] I was born: [[H3205]] let not [[H408]] the day [[H3117]] wherein [[H834]] my mother [[H517]] bare [[H3205]] me be [[H1961]] blessed. [[H1288]]

### 15
Cursed [[H779]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] brought tidings [[H1319]]  to [[H853]] my father, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] A man [[H2145]] child [[H1121]] is born unto thee; [[H3205]] making him very [[H8056]] glad. [[H8056]]

### 16
And let that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] be [[H1961]] as the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] overthrew, [[H2015]] and repented [[H5162]] not: [[H3808]] and let him hear [[H8085]] the cry [[H2201]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and the shouting [[H8643]] at noontide; [[H6256]]

### 17
Because [[H834]] he slew [[H4191]] me not [[H3808]] from the womb; [[H7358]] or that my mother [[H517]] might have been [[H1961]] my grave, [[H6913]] and her womb [[H7358]] always [[H5769]] great [[H2030]]

### 18
Wherefore [[H4100]] came I forth [[H3318]] out of the womb [[H7358]] to see [[H7200]] labour [[H5999]] and sorrow, [[H3015]] that my days [[H3117]] should be consumed [[H3615]] with shame? [[H1322]]
