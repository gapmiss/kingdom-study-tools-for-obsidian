### 1
The word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Arise, [[H6965]] and go down [[H3381]] to the potter's [[H3335]] house, [[H1004]] and there [[H8033]] I will cause thee to hear [[H8085]] my words. [[H1697]]

### 3
Then I went down [[H3381]] to the potter's [[H3335]] house, [[H1004]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he wrought [[H6213]] a work [[H4399]] on [[H5921]] the wheels. [[H70]]

### 4
And the vessel [[H3627]] that [[H834]] he [[H1931]] made [[H6213]] of clay [[H2563]] was marred [[H7843]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the potter: [[H3335]] so he made [[H6213]] it again [[H7725]] another [[H312]] vessel, [[H3627]] as [[H834]] seemed [[H5869]] good [[H3474]] to the potter [[H3335]] to make [[H6213]]

### 5
Then the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 6
O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] cannot [[H3201]] I do [[H6213]] with you as this [[H2088]] potter? [[H3335]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] as the clay [[H2563]] in the potter's [[H3335]] hand, [[H3027]] so [[H3651]] ye [[H859]] in mine hand, [[H3027]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
instant [[H7281]] I shall speak [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] a nation, [[H1471]] and concerning [[H5921]] a kingdom, [[H4467]] to pluck up, [[H5428]] and to pull down, [[H5422]] and to destroy [[H6]]

### 8
If that [[H1931]] nation, [[H1471]] against [[H5921]] whom [[H834]] I have pronounced, [[H1696]] turn [[H7725]] from their evil, [[H7451]] I will repent [[H5162]] of [[H5921]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I thought [[H2803]] to do [[H6213]] unto them. [[H6213]]

### 9
And instant [[H7281]] I shall speak [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] a nation, [[H1471]] and concerning [[H5921]] a kingdom, [[H4467]] to build [[H1129]] and to plant [[H5193]]

### 10
If it do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in my sight, [[H5869]] that it obey [[H8085]] not [[H1115]] my voice, [[H6963]] then I will repent [[H5162]] of [[H5921]] the good, [[H2896]] wherewith [[H834]] I said [[H559]] I would benefit [[H3190]] them. [[H3190]]

### 11
Now [[H6258]] therefore go [[H4994]] to, speak [[H559]] to [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and to [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] frame [[H3335]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] you, and devise [[H2803]] a device [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] you: return [[H7725]] ye now [[H4994]] every one [[H376]] from his evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] and make your ways [[H1870]] and your doings [[H4611]] good. [[H3190]]

### 12
And they said, [[H559]] There is no hope: [[H2976]] but [[H3588]] we will walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] our own devices, [[H4284]] and we will every one [[H376]] do [[H6213]] the imagination [[H8307]] of his evil [[H7451]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 13
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Ask [[H7592]] ye now [[H4994]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] who [[H4310]] hath heard [[H8085]] such [[H428]] things: the virgin [[H1330]] of Israel [[H3478]] hath done [[H6213]] a very [[H3966]] horrible thing. [[H8186]]

### 14
Will leave [[H5800]] the snow [[H7950]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] from the rock [[H6697]] of the field? [[H7704]] shall the cold [[H7119]] flowing [[H5140]] waters [[H4325]] that come from another place [[H2114]] be forsaken? [[H5428]]

### 15
Because [[H3588]] my people [[H5971]] hath forgotten [[H7911]] me, they have burned incense [[H6999]] to vanity, [[H7723]] and they have caused them to stumble [[H3782]] in their ways [[H1870]] the ancient [[H5769]] paths, [[H7635]] to walk [[H1980]] in paths, [[H5410]] a way [[H1870]] not [[H3808]] cast up; [[H5549]]

### 16
To make [[H7760]] their land [[H776]] desolate, [[H8047]] a perpetual [[H5769]] hissing; [[H8292]] every one [[H3605]] that passeth [[H5674]] thereby [[H5921]] shall be astonished, [[H8074]] and wag [[H5110]] his head. [[H7218]]

### 17
I will scatter [[H6327]] them as with an east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] before [[H6440]] the enemy; [[H341]] I will shew [[H7200]] them the back, [[H6203]] and not [[H3808]] the face, [[H6440]] in the day [[H3117]] of their calamity. [[H343]]

### 18
Then said [[H559]] they, Come, [[H1980]] and let us devise [[H2803]] devices [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] Jeremiah; [[H3414]] for [[H3588]] the law [[H8451]] shall not [[H3808]] perish [[H6]] from the priest, [[H3548]] nor counsel [[H6098]] from the wise, [[H2450]] nor the word [[H1697]] from the prophet. [[H5030]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us smite [[H5221]] him with the tongue, [[H3956]] and let us not [[H408]] give heed [[H7181]] to [[H413]] any [[H3605]] of his words. [[H1697]]

### 19
Give heed [[H7181]] to [[H413]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] and hearken [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of them that contend [[H3401]] with me. [[H3401]]

### 20
Shall evil [[H7451]] be recompensed [[H7999]] for [[H8478]] good? [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] they have digged [[H3738]] a pit [[H7745]] for my soul. [[H5315]] Remember [[H2142]] that I stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] thee to speak [[H1696]] good [[H2896]] for [[H5921]] them, to turn away [[H7725]] thy wrath [[H2534]] from them. [[H2534]]

### 21
Therefore [[H3651]] deliver up [[H5414]] their children [[H1121]] to the famine, [[H7458]] and pour out [[H5064]] their by [[H5921]] the force [[H3027]] of the sword; [[H2719]] and let their wives [[H802]] be [[H1961]] bereaved [[H7909]] of their children, and widows; [[H490]] and let their men [[H376]] be [[H1961]] put [[H2026]] to death; [[H4194]] their young men [[H970]] slain [[H5221]] by the sword [[H2719]] in battle. [[H4421]]

### 22
Let a cry [[H2201]] be heard [[H8085]] from their houses, [[H1004]] when [[H3588]] thou shalt bring [[H935]] a troop [[H1416]] suddenly [[H6597]] upon [[H5921]] them: for [[H3588]] they have digged [[H3738]] a pit [[H7745]] to take [[H3920]] me, and hid [[H2934]] snares [[H6341]] for my feet. [[H7272]]

### 23
Yet, Lord, [[H3068]] thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] their counsel [[H6098]] against [[H5921]] me to slay [[H4194]] forgive [[H3722]] not [[H408]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] neither [[H408]] blot out [[H4229]] their sin [[H2403]] from thy sight, [[H6440]] but let them be [[H1961]] overthrown [[H3782]] before [[H6440]] thee; deal [[H6213]] with them in the time [[H6256]] of thine anger.
