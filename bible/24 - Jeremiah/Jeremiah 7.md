### 1
The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Stand [[H5975]] in the gate [[H8179]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] and proclaim [[H7121]] there [[H8033]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] and say, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] Judah, [[H3063]] that enter in [[H935]] at these [[H428]] gates [[H8179]] to worship [[H7812]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Amend [[H3190]] your ways [[H1870]] and your doings, [[H4611]] and I will cause you to dwell [[H7931]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 4
Trust [[H982]] ye not [[H408]] in [[H413]] lying [[H8267]] words, [[H1697]] saying, [[H559]] The temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] The temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] The temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] these. [[H3068]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] ye throughly [[H3190]] amend [[H3190]] your ways [[H1870]] and your doings; [[H4611]] if [[H518]] ye throughly [[H6213]] execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] between [[H996]] a man [[H376]] and his neighbour; [[H7453]]

### 6
ye oppress [[H6231]] not [[H3808]] the stranger, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow, [[H490]] and shed [[H8210]] not [[H408]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] neither [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] hurt: [[H7451]] to your [[H0]]

### 7
Then will I cause you to dwell [[H7931]] in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] in the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to your fathers, [[H1]] for [[H5704]] ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5769]]

### 8
Behold, [[H2009]] ye [[H859]] trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] lying [[H8267]] words, [[H1697]] that cannot [[H1115]] profit. [[H3276]]

### 9
Will ye steal, [[H1589]] murder, [[H7523]] and commit adultery, [[H5003]] and swear [[H7650]] falsely, [[H8267]] and burn incense [[H6999]] unto Baal, [[H1168]] and walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] whom [[H834]] ye know [[H3045]] not; [[H3045]]

### 10
And come [[H935]] and stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] me in this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] my name, [[H8034]] and say, [[H559]] We are delivered [[H5337]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] abominations? [[H8441]]

### 11
Is this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] my name, [[H8034]] become [[H1961]] a den [[H4631]] of robbers [[H6530]] in your eyes? [[H5869]] Behold, [[H2009]] even [[H1571]] I [[H595]] have seen [[H7200]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
But [[H3588]] go [[H1980]] ye now [[H4994]] unto [[H413]] my place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] in Shiloh, [[H7887]] where [[H834]] I set [[H7931]] my name [[H8034]] at the first, [[H7223]] and see [[H7200]] what [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] to it for [[H6440]] the wickedness [[H7451]] of my people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 13
And now, [[H6258]] because [[H3282]] ye have done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] works, [[H4639]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you, rising up early [[H7925]] and speaking, [[H1696]] but ye heard [[H8085]] not; [[H3808]] and I called [[H7121]] you, but ye answered [[H6030]] not; [[H6030]]

### 14
Therefore will I do [[H6213]] unto house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] my name, [[H8034]] wherein [[H834]] ye [[H859]] trust, [[H982]] and unto the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to you and to your fathers, [[H1]] as [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] to Shiloh. [[H7887]]

### 15
And I will cast you out [[H7993]] of my [[H5921]] sight, [[H6440]] as [[H834]] I have cast out [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] your brethren, [[H251]] the whole [[H3605]] seed [[H2233]] of Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 16
Therefore pray [[H6419]] not [[H408]] thou [[H859]] for [[H1157]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] neither [[H408]] lift up [[H5375]] cry [[H7440]] nor prayer [[H8605]] for them, [[H1157]] neither [[H408]] make intercession [[H6293]] to me: for [[H3588]] I will not [[H369]] hear [[H8085]] thee. [[H8085]]

### 17
Seest [[H7200]] thou not [[H369]] what [[H4100]] they [[H1992]] do [[H6213]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem? [[H3389]]

### 18
The children [[H1121]] gather [[H3950]] wood, [[H6086]] and the fathers [[H1]] kindle [[H1197]] the fire, [[H784]] and the women [[H802]] knead [[H3888]] dough, [[H1217]] to make [[H6213]] cakes [[H3561]] to the queen [[H4446]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and to pour out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] that [[H4616]] they may provoke me to anger. [[H3707]]

### 19
Do they [[H1992]] provoke me to anger? [[H3707]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] themselves to [[H4616]] the confusion [[H1322]] of their own faces? [[H6440]]

### 20
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2009]] mine anger [[H639]] and my fury [[H2534]] shall be poured out [[H5413]] upon [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] upon [[H5921]] man, [[H120]] and upon [[H5921]] beast, [[H929]] and upon [[H5921]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field, [[H7704]] and upon [[H5921]] the fruit [[H6529]] of the ground; [[H127]] and it shall burn, [[H1197]] and shall not [[H3808]] be quenched. [[H3518]]

### 21
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Put [[H5595]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] unto [[H5921]] your sacrifices, [[H2077]] and eat [[H398]] flesh. [[H1320]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] I spake [[H1696]] not [[H3808]]  unto [[H853]] your fathers, [[H1]] nor [[H3808]] commanded [[H6680]] them in the day [[H3117]] that I brought out [[H3318]] them of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] concerning [[H1697]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] or sacrifices: [[H2077]]

### 23
But [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] commanded [[H6680]] I them, saying, [[H559]] Obey [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] and I will be [[H1961]] your God, [[H430]] and ye [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] my people: [[H5971]] and walk [[H1980]] ye in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] that [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you, that [[H4616]] it may be well [[H3190]] unto you. [[H3190]]

### 24
But they hearkened [[H8085]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] their ear, [[H241]] but walked [[H1980]] in the counsels [[H4156]] in the imagination [[H8307]] of their evil [[H7451]] heart, [[H3820]] and went [[H1961]] backward, [[H268]] and not [[H3808]] forward. [[H6440]]

### 25
Since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] came forth out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] I have even sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]]  you [[H853]] all [[H3605]] my servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] daily [[H3117]] rising up early [[H7925]] and sending [[H7971]]

### 26
Yet they hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] me, nor [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] their ear, [[H241]] but hardened [[H7185]] their neck: [[H6203]] they did worse [[H7489]] than their fathers. [[H1]]

### 27
Therefore thou shalt speak [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] them; but they will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] to [[H413]] thee: thou shalt also call [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] them; but they will not [[H3808]] answer [[H6030]] thee. [[H6030]]

### 28
But thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, This [[H2088]] a nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] obeyeth [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] nor [[H3808]] receiveth [[H3947]] correction: [[H4148]] truth [[H530]] is perished, [[H6]] and is cut off [[H3772]] from their mouth. [[H6310]]

### 29
Cut off [[H1494]] thine hair, [[H5145]] and cast away, [[H7993]] and take up [[H5375]] a lamentation [[H7015]] on [[H5921]] high places; [[H8205]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath rejected [[H3988]] and forsaken [[H5203]] the generation [[H1755]] of his wrath. [[H5678]]

### 30
For [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] have done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in my sight, [[H5869]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] they have set [[H7760]] their abominations [[H8251]] in the house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] my name, [[H8034]] to pollute [[H2930]] it. [[H2930]]

### 31
And they have built [[H1129]] the high places [[H1116]] of Tophet, [[H8612]] which [[H834]] in the valley [[H1516]] of the son [[H1121]] of Hinnom, [[H2011]] to burn [[H8313]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters [[H1323]] in the fire; [[H784]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] came [[H5927]] it into [[H5921]] my heart. [[H3820]]

### 32
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that it shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be called [[H559]] Tophet, [[H8612]] nor the valley [[H1516]] of the son [[H1121]] of Hinnom, [[H2011]] but [[H3588]] the valley [[H1516]] of slaughter: [[H2028]] for they shall bury [[H6912]] in Tophet, [[H8612]] till there be no [[H369]] place. [[H4725]]

### 33
And the carcases [[H5038]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] shall be [[H1961]] meat [[H3978]] for the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] and for the beasts [[H929]] of the earth; [[H776]] and none [[H369]] shall fray away. [[H2729]]

### 34
Then will I cause to cease [[H7673]] from the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and from the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the voice [[H6963]] of mirth, [[H8342]] and the voice [[H6963]] of gladness, [[H8057]] the voice [[H6963]] of the bridegroom, [[H2860]] and the voice [[H6963]] of the bride: [[H3618]] for [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate. [[H2723]]
