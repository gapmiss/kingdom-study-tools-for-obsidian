The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H5921]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] concerning [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that [[H1931]] the first [[H7224]] year [[H8141]] of Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon; [[H894]]

### 2
The which [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
From [[H4480]] the thirteenth [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Josiah [[H2977]] the son [[H1121]] of Amon [[H526]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] even unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] that [[H2088]] the three [[H7969]] and twentieth [[H6242]] year, [[H8141]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath come [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, and I have spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you, rising early [[H7925]] and speaking; [[H1696]] but ye have not [[H3808]] hearkened. [[H8085]]

### 4
And the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]]  you [[H853]] all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] rising early [[H7925]] and sending [[H7971]] but ye have not [[H3808]] hearkened, [[H8085]] nor [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] your ear [[H241]] to hear. [[H8085]]

### 5
They said, [[H559]] Turn ye again [[H7725]] now [[H4994]] every one [[H376]] from his evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] and from the evil [[H7455]] of your doings, [[H4611]] and dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]] unto you and to your fathers [[H1]] for [[H5704]] ever [[H5769]] and ever: [[H5769]]

### 6
And go [[H1980]] not [[H408]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve [[H5647]] them, and to worship [[H7812]] them, and provoke me not to anger [[H3707]] with the works [[H4639]] of your hands; [[H3027]] and I will do you no hurt. [[H7489]]

### 7
Yet ye have not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] that [[H4616]] ye might provoke me to anger [[H3707]] with the works [[H4639]] of your hands [[H3027]] to your own hurt. [[H7451]]

### 8
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Because [[H3282]] ye have not [[H3808]] heard [[H8085]] my words, [[H1697]]

### 9
Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] and take [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the north, [[H6828]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] my servant, [[H5650]] and will bring [[H935]] them against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and against [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof, and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] round about, [[H5439]] and will utterly destroy [[H2763]] them, and make [[H7760]] them an astonishment, [[H8047]] and an hissing, [[H8322]] and perpetual [[H5769]] desolations. [[H2723]]

### 10
Moreover I will take [[H6]] from them the voice [[H6963]] of mirth, [[H8342]] and the voice [[H6963]] of gladness, [[H8057]] the voice [[H6963]] of the bridegroom, [[H2860]] and the voice [[H6963]] of the bride, [[H3618]] the sound [[H6963]] of the millstones, [[H7347]] and the light [[H216]] of the candle. [[H5216]]

### 11
And this [[H2063]] whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H2723]] an astonishment; [[H8047]] and these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] shall serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] seventy [[H7657]] years. [[H8141]]

### 12
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when seventy [[H7657]] years [[H8141]] are accomplished, [[H4390]] I will punish [[H6485]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and that [[H1931]] nation, [[H1471]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] for [[H853]] their iniquity, [[H5771]] and the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] and will make [[H7760]] it perpetual [[H5769]] desolations. [[H8077]]

### 13
And I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] all [[H3605]] my words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I have pronounced [[H1696]] against [[H5921]]  it, [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book, [[H5612]] which [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] hath prophesied [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations. [[H1471]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] and great [[H1419]] kings [[H4428]] shall serve [[H5647]] themselves [[H1992]] of them also: [[H1571]] and I will recompense [[H7999]] them according to their deeds, [[H6467]] and according to the works [[H4639]] of their own hands. [[H3027]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] me; Take [[H3947]] the wine [[H3196]] cup [[H3563]] of this [[H2063]] fury [[H2534]] at my hand, [[H3027]]  and cause [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H1471]] to whom [[H834]] I [[H595]] send [[H7971]] thee, to drink [[H8248]] it. [[H8248]]

### 16
And they shall drink, [[H8354]] and be moved, [[H1607]] and be mad, [[H1984]] because [[H6440]] of the sword [[H2719]] that [[H834]] I will send [[H7971]] among [[H996]] them. [[H996]]

### 17
Then took [[H3947]]  I [[H853]] the cup [[H3563]] at the Lord's [[H3068]] hand, [[H3027]]  and made [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] to drink, [[H8248]] unto [[H413]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had sent [[H7971]] me: [[H7971]]

### 18
Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the kings [[H4428]]  thereof, and [[H853]] the princes [[H8269]] thereof, to make [[H5414]] them a desolation, [[H2723]] an astonishment, [[H8047]] an hissing, [[H8322]] and a curse; [[H7045]] as this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]]

### 19
Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and his servants, [[H5650]] and his princes, [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] his people; [[H5971]]

### 20
And all [[H3605]] the mingled people, [[H6153]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the land [[H776]] of Uz, [[H5780]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the land [[H776]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and Ashkelon, [[H831]] and Azzah, [[H5804]] and Ekron, [[H6138]] and the remnant [[H7611]] of Ashdod, [[H795]]

### 21
Edom, [[H123]] and Moab, [[H4124]] and the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]]

### 22
And all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Tyrus, [[H6865]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Zidon, [[H6721]] and the kings [[H4428]] of the isles [[H339]] which [[H834]] beyond [[H5676]] the sea, [[H3220]]

### 23
Dedan, [[H1719]] and Tema, [[H8485]] and Buz, [[H938]] and all [[H3605]] in the utmost [[H7112]] corners, [[H6285]]

### 24
And all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Arabia, [[H6152]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the mingled people [[H6154]] that dwell [[H7931]] in the desert, [[H4057]]

### 25
And all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Zimri, [[H2174]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Elam, [[H5867]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Medes, [[H4074]]

### 26
And all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the north, [[H6828]] far [[H7350]] and near, [[H7138]] one [[H376]] with [[H413]] another, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the world, [[H776]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth: [[H127]] and the king [[H4428]] of Sheshach [[H8347]] shall drink [[H8354]] after [[H310]] them. [[H310]]

### 27
Therefore thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Drink [[H8354]] ye, and be drunken, [[H7937]] and spue, [[H7006]] and fall, [[H5307]] and rise [[H6965]] no [[H3808]] more, because [[H6440]] of the sword [[H2719]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] will send [[H7971]] among [[H996]] you. [[H996]]

### 28
And it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H3588]] they refuse [[H3985]] to take [[H3947]] the cup [[H3563]] at thine hand [[H3027]] to drink, [[H8354]] then shalt thou say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Ye shall certainly [[H8354]] drink. [[H8354]]

### 29
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] begin [[H2490]] to bring evil [[H7489]] on the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] my name, [[H8034]] and should ye [[H859]] be utterly [[H5352]] unpunished? [[H5352]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] be unpunished: [[H5352]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will call for [[H7121]] a sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth, [[H776]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 30
Therefore prophesy [[H5012]] thou [[H859]] against [[H413]]  them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, The Lord [[H3068]] shall roar [[H7580]] from on high, [[H4791]] and utter [[H5414]] his voice [[H6963]] from his holy [[H6944]] habitation; [[H4583]] he shall mightily [[H7580]] roar [[H7580]] upon [[H5921]] his habitation; [[H5116]] he shall give [[H6030]] a shout, [[H1959]] as they that tread [[H1869]] against [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 31
A noise [[H7588]] shall come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the ends [[H7097]] of the earth; [[H776]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath a controversy [[H7379]] with the nations, [[H1471]] he [[H1931]] will plead [[H8199]] with all [[H3605]] flesh; [[H1320]] he will give [[H5414]] them wicked [[H7563]] to the sword, [[H2719]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 32
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Behold, [[H2009]] evil [[H7451]] shall go forth [[H3318]] from nation [[H1471]] to [[H413]] nation, [[H1471]] and a great [[H1419]] whirlwind [[H5591]] shall be raised up [[H5782]] from the coasts [[H3411]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 33
And the slain [[H2491]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] from end [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] even unto [[H5704]] the end [[H7097]] of the earth: [[H776]] they shall not [[H3808]] be lamented, [[H5594]] neither [[H3808]] gathered, [[H622]] nor [[H3808]] buried; [[H6912]] they shall be [[H1961]] dung [[H1828]] upon [[H6440]] the ground. [[H127]]

### 34
Howl, [[H3213]] ye shepherds, [[H7462]] and cry; [[H2199]] and wallow yourselves [[H6428]] ye principal [[H117]] of the flock: [[H6629]] for [[H3588]] the days [[H3117]] of your slaughter [[H2873]] and of your dispersions [[H8600]] are accomplished; [[H4390]] and ye shall fall [[H5307]] like a pleasant [[H2532]] vessel. [[H3627]]

### 35
And the shepherds [[H7462]] shall have no way [[H4498]] to flee, [[H6]] nor the principal [[H117]] of the flock [[H6629]] to escape. [[H6413]]

### 36
A voice [[H6963]] of the cry [[H6818]] of the shepherds, [[H7462]] and an howling [[H3215]] of the principal [[H117]] of the flock, [[H6629]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoiled [[H7703]] their pasture. [[H4830]]

### 37
And the peaceable [[H7965]] habitations [[H4999]] are cut down [[H1826]] because [[H6440]] of the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 38
He hath forsaken [[H5800]] his covert, [[H5520]] as the lion: [[H3715]] for [[H3588]] their land [[H776]] is [[H1961]] desolate [[H8047]] because [[H6440]] of the fierceness [[H2740]] of the oppressor, [[H3238]] and because [[H6440]] of his fierce [[H2740]] anger. [[H639]]
