### 1
In the beginning [[H7225]] of the reign [[H4467]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] came [[H1961]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] to [[H413]] me; Make [[H6213]] thee bonds [[H4147]] and yokes, [[H4133]] and put [[H5414]] them upon [[H5921]] thy neck, [[H6677]]

### 3
And send [[H7971]] them to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Edom, [[H123]] and to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Tyrus, [[H6865]] and to the king [[H4428]] of Zidon, [[H6721]] by the hand [[H3027]] of the messengers [[H4397]] which come [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah; [[H3063]]

### 4
And command [[H6680]] them to say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] their masters, [[H113]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] your masters; [[H113]]

### 5
I [[H595]] have made [[H6213]] the earth, [[H776]] the man [[H120]] and the beast [[H929]] that [[H834]] upon [[H6440]] the ground, [[H776]] by my great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and by my outstretched [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] and have given [[H5414]] it unto whom [[H834]] it seemed [[H5869]] meet [[H3474]] unto me. [[H3474]]

### 6
And now [[H6258]] have I [[H595]] given [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] lands [[H776]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] my servant; [[H5650]]  and [[H853]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] have I given [[H5414]] him also [[H1571]] to serve [[H5647]] him. [[H5647]]

### 7
And all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] shall serve [[H5647]] him, and his son, [[H1121]] and his son's [[H1121]] son, [[H1121]] until [[H5704]] the very time [[H6256]] of his land [[H776]] come: [[H935]] and then [[H1571]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] and great [[H1419]] kings [[H4428]] shall serve [[H5647]] themselves of him. [[H5647]]

### 8
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] the nation [[H1471]] and kingdom [[H4467]] which [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]]  the same [[H853]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and that [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] put [[H5414]] their neck [[H6677]] under the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] that [[H1931]] nation [[H1471]] will I punish, [[H6485]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and with the famine, [[H7458]] and with the pestilence, [[H1698]] until [[H5704]] I have consumed [[H8552]] them by his hand. [[H3027]]

### 9
Therefore hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] ye [[H859]] to [[H413]] your prophets, [[H5030]] nor to [[H413]] your diviners, [[H7080]] nor to [[H413]] your dreamers, [[H2472]] nor to [[H413]] your enchanters, [[H6049]] nor to [[H413]] your sorcerers, [[H3786]] which [[H834]] speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, saying, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon: [[H894]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] a lie [[H8267]] unto you, to [[H4616]] remove you far [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] your land; [[H127]] and that I should drive you out, [[H5080]] and ye should perish. [[H6]]

### 11
But the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] bring [[H935]] their neck [[H6677]] under the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and serve [[H5647]] him, those will I let remain still [[H3240]] in [[H5921]] their own land, [[H127]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and they shall till [[H5647]] it, and dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 12
I spake [[H1696]] also to [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] according to all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] saying, [[H559]] Bring [[H935]] your necks [[H6677]] under the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and serve [[H5647]] him and his people, [[H5971]] and live. [[H2421]]

### 13
Why [[H4100]] will ye die, [[H4191]] thou [[H859]] and thy people, [[H5971]] by the sword, [[H2719]] by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence, [[H1698]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] against [[H413]] the nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon? [[H894]]

### 14
Therefore hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] unto [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of the prophets [[H5030]] that speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, saying, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon: [[H894]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] a lie [[H8267]] unto you. [[H8267]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] yet they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] a lie [[H8267]] in my name; [[H8034]] that [[H4616]] I might drive you out, [[H5080]] and that ye might perish, [[H6]] ye, [[H859]] and the prophets [[H5030]] that prophesy [[H5012]] unto you. [[H5012]]

### 16
Also I spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the priests [[H3548]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] to [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of your prophets [[H5030]] that prophesy [[H5012]] unto you, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house [[H1004]] shall now [[H6258]] shortly [[H4120]] be brought again [[H7725]] from Babylon: [[H894]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] a lie [[H8267]] unto you. [[H8267]]

### 17
Hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] unto [[H413]] them; serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and live: [[H2421]] wherefore [[H4100]] should this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] be [[H1961]] laid waste? [[H2723]]

### 18
But if [[H518]] they [[H1992]] prophets, [[H5030]] and if [[H518]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H3426]] with [[H854]] them, let them now [[H4994]] make intercession [[H6293]] to the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] that the vessels [[H3627]] which are left [[H3498]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the house [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] go [[H935]] not [[H1115]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] concerning [[H413]] the pillars, [[H5982]] and concerning [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] and concerning [[H5921]] the bases, [[H4350]] and concerning [[H5921]] the residue [[H3499]] of the vessels [[H3627]] that remain [[H3498]] in this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]]

### 20
Which [[H834]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] took [[H3947]] not, [[H3808]] when he carried away captive [[H1540]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Babylon, [[H894]] and all [[H3605]] the nobles [[H2715]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem; [[H3389]]

### 21
Yea, [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] concerning [[H5921]] the vessels [[H3627]] that remain [[H3498]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the house [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and of Jerusalem; [[H3389]]

### 22
They shall be carried [[H935]] to Babylon, [[H894]] and there [[H8033]] shall they be [[H1961]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] that I visit [[H6485]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] then will I bring them up, [[H5927]] and restore [[H7725]] them to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place.
