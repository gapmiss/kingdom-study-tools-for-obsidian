### 7
Then the city [[H5892]] was broken up, [[H1234]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] fled, [[H1272]] and went forth [[H3318]] out of the city [[H5892]] by night [[H3915]] by the way [[H1870]] of the gate [[H8179]] between [[H996]] the two walls, [[H2346]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the king's [[H4428]] garden; [[H1588]] (now the Chaldeans [[H3778]] by [[H5921]] the city [[H5892]] round about:) [[H5439]] and they went [[H1980]] by the way [[H1870]] of the plain.
