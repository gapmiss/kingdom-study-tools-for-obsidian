### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] the same [[H1931]] year, [[H8141]] in the beginning [[H7225]] of the reign [[H4467]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year, [[H8141]] in the fifth [[H2549]] month, [[H2320]] Hananiah [[H2608]] the son [[H1121]] of Azur [[H5809]] the prophet, [[H5030]] which [[H834]] of Gibeon, [[H1391]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] in the presence [[H5869]] of the priests [[H3548]] and of all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] speaketh [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] I have broken [[H7665]] the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 3
Within [[H5750]] two full [[H3117]] years [[H8141]] will I [[H589]] bring again [[H7725]] into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] that [[H834]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] took away [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and carried [[H935]] them to Babylon: [[H894]]

### 4
And I [[H589]] will bring again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] with all [[H3605]] the captives [[H1546]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that went [[H935]] into Babylon, [[H894]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I will break [[H7665]] the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 5
Then the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Hananiah [[H2608]] in the presence [[H5869]] of the priests, [[H3548]] and in the presence [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that stood [[H5975]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 6
Even the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] said, [[H559]] Amen: [[H543]] the Lord [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] so: [[H3651]] the Lord [[H3068]] perform [[H6965]] thy words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thou hast prophesied, [[H5012]] to bring again [[H7725]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] that is carried away captive, [[H1473]] from Babylon [[H894]] into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 7
Nevertheless [[H389]] hear [[H8085]] thou now [[H4994]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] speak [[H1696]] in thine ears, [[H241]] and in the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the people; [[H5971]]

### 8
The prophets [[H5030]] that [[H834]] have been [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] me and before [[H6440]] thee of [[H4480]] old [[H5769]] prophesied [[H5012]] both against [[H413]] many [[H7227]] countries, [[H776]] and against [[H5921]] great [[H1419]] kingdoms, [[H4467]] of war, [[H4421]] and of evil, [[H7451]] and of pestilence. [[H1698]]

### 9
The prophet [[H5030]] which [[H834]] prophesieth [[H5012]] of peace, [[H7965]] when the word [[H1697]] of the prophet [[H5030]] shall come to pass, [[H935]] shall the prophet [[H5030]] be known, [[H3045]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath truly [[H571]] sent him. [[H7971]]

### 10
Then Hananiah [[H2608]] the prophet [[H5030]] took [[H3947]] the yoke [[H4133]] from off [[H5921]] the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah's [[H3414]] neck, [[H6677]] and brake [[H7665]] it. [[H7665]]

### 11
And Hananiah [[H2608]] spake [[H559]] in the presence [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Even so [[H3602]] will I break [[H7665]] the yoke [[H5923]] of Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] from [[H5921]] the neck [[H6677]] of all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] within the space of [[H5750]] two full [[H3117]] years. [[H8141]] And the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] went [[H1980]] his way. [[H1870]]

### 12
Then the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] after that [[H310]] Hananiah [[H2608]] the prophet [[H5030]] had broken [[H7665]] the yoke [[H4133]] from off [[H5921]] the neck [[H6677]] of the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 13
Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Thou hast broken [[H7665]] the yokes [[H4133]] of wood; [[H6086]] but thou shalt make [[H6213]] for [[H8478]] them yokes [[H4133]] of iron. [[H1270]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] I have put [[H5414]] a yoke [[H5923]] of iron [[H1270]] upon [[H5921]] the neck [[H6677]] of all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] nations, [[H1471]] that they may serve [[H5647]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon; [[H894]] and they shall serve [[H5647]] him: and I have given [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] also. [[H7704]]

### 15
Then said [[H559]] the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] unto [[H413]] Hananiah [[H2608]] the prophet, [[H5030]] Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] Hananiah; [[H2608]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] thee; but thou [[H859]]  makest [[H853]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] to trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] a lie. [[H8267]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will cast [[H7971]] thee from off [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth: [[H127]] this year [[H8141]] thou [[H859]] shalt die, [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] thou hast taught [[H1696]] rebellion [[H5627]] against [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
So Hananiah [[H2608]] the prophet [[H5030]] died [[H4191]] the same [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] in the seventh [[H7637]] month. [[H2320]]
