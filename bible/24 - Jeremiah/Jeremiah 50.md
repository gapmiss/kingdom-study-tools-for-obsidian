### 1
The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] against [[H413]] Babylon [[H894]] against [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] by [[H3027]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet. [[H5030]]

### 2
Declare [[H5046]] ye among the nations, [[H1471]] and publish, [[H8085]] and set up [[H5375]] a standard; [[H5251]] publish, [[H8085]] conceal [[H3582]] not: [[H408]] say, [[H559]] Babylon [[H894]] is taken, [[H3920]] Bel [[H1078]] is confounded, [[H3001]] Merodach [[H4781]] is broken in pieces; [[H2865]] her idols [[H6091]] are confounded, [[H3001]] her images [[H1544]] are broken in pieces. [[H2865]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] out of the north [[H6828]] there cometh up [[H5927]] a nation [[H1471]] against [[H5921]] her, which [[H1931]] shall make [[H7896]] her land [[H776]] desolate, [[H8047]] and none [[H3808]] shall [[H1961]] dwell [[H3427]] therein: they shall remove, [[H5110]] they shall depart, [[H1980]] both man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]]

### 4
In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] and in that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall come, [[H935]] they [[H1992]] and the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] together, [[H3162]] going [[H1980]] and weeping: [[H1058]] they shall go, [[H1980]] and seek [[H1245]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]]

### 5
They shall ask [[H7592]] the way [[H1870]] to Zion [[H6726]] with their faces [[H6440]] thitherward, [[H2008]] Come, [[H935]] and let us join ourselves [[H3867]] to [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] in a perpetual [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] shall not [[H3808]] be forgotten. [[H7911]]

### 6
My people [[H5971]] hath been [[H1961]] lost [[H6]] sheep: [[H6629]] their shepherds [[H7462]] have caused them to go astray, [[H8582]] they have turned them away [[H7726]] the mountains: [[H2022]] they have gone [[H1980]] from mountain [[H2022]] to [[H413]] hill, [[H1389]] they have forgotten [[H7911]] their restingplace. [[H7258]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] that found [[H4672]] them have devoured [[H398]] them: and their adversaries [[H6862]] said, [[H559]] We offend [[H816]] not, [[H3808]] because [[H8478]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] the habitation [[H5116]] of justice, [[H6664]] even the Lord, [[H3068]] the hope [[H4723]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 8
Remove [[H5110]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and go forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] and be [[H1961]] as the he goats [[H6260]] before [[H6440]] the flocks. [[H6629]]

### 9
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will raise [[H5782]] and cause to come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] an assembly [[H6951]] of great [[H1419]] nations [[H1471]] from the north [[H6828]] country: [[H776]] and they shall set themselves in array [[H6186]] against her; from thence [[H8033]] she shall be taken: [[H3920]] their arrows [[H2671]] as of a mighty [[H1368]] expert man; [[H7919]] none [[H3808]] shall return [[H7725]] in vain. [[H7387]]

### 10
And Chaldea [[H3778]] shall be [[H1961]] a spoil: [[H7998]] all [[H3605]] that spoil [[H7997]] her shall be satisfied, [[H7646]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
Because [[H3588]] ye were glad, [[H8055]] because [[H3588]] ye rejoiced, [[H5937]] O ye destroyers [[H8154]] of mine heritage, [[H5159]] because [[H3588]] ye are grown fat [[H6335]] as the heifer [[H5697]] at grass, [[H1877]] and bellow [[H6670]] as bulls; [[H47]]

### 12
Your mother [[H517]] shall be sore [[H3966]] confounded; [[H954]] she that bare [[H3205]] you shall be ashamed: [[H2659]] behold, [[H2009]] the hindermost [[H319]] of the nations [[H1471]] a wilderness, [[H4057]] a dry land, [[H6723]] and a desert. [[H6160]]

### 13
Because of the wrath [[H7110]] of the Lord [[H3068]] it shall not [[H3808]] be inhabited, [[H3427]] but it shall be [[H1961]] wholly [[H3605]] desolate: [[H8077]] every one [[H3605]] that goeth [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] shall be astonished, [[H8074]] and hiss [[H8319]] at [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] her plagues. [[H4347]]

### 14
Put yourselves in array [[H6186]] against [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] round about: [[H5439]] all [[H3605]] ye that bend [[H1869]] the bow, [[H7198]] shoot [[H3034]] at [[H413]] her, spare [[H2550]] no [[H408]] arrows: [[H2671]] for [[H3588]] she hath sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
Shout [[H7321]] against [[H5921]] her round about: [[H5439]] she hath given [[H5414]] her hand: [[H3027]] her foundations [[H803]] are fallen, [[H5307]] her walls [[H2346]] are thrown down: [[H2040]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] the vengeance [[H5360]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] take vengeance [[H5358]] upon her; as [[H834]] she hath done, [[H6213]] do [[H6213]] unto her. [[H6213]]

### 16
Cut off [[H3772]] the sower [[H2232]] from Babylon, [[H894]] and him that handleth [[H8610]] the sickle [[H4038]] in the time [[H6256]] of harvest: [[H7105]] for fear [[H6440]] of the oppressing [[H3238]] sword [[H2719]] they shall turn [[H6437]] every one [[H376]] to [[H413]] his people, [[H5971]] and they shall flee [[H5127]] every one [[H376]] to his own land. [[H776]]

### 17
Israel [[H3478]] a scattered [[H6340]] sheep; [[H7716]] the lions [[H738]] have driven away: [[H5080]] first [[H7223]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] hath devoured [[H398]] him; and last [[H314]] this [[H2088]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] hath broken his bones. [[H6105]]

### 18
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will punish [[H6485]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and his land, [[H776]] as [[H834]] I have punished [[H6485]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 19
And I will bring [[H7725]] Israel [[H3478]] again to [[H413]] his habitation, [[H5116]] and he shall feed [[H7462]] on Carmel [[H3760]] and Bashan, [[H1316]] and his soul [[H5315]] shall be satisfied [[H7646]] upon mount [[H2022]] Ephraim [[H669]] and Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 20
In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] and in that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall be sought for, [[H1245]] and none; [[H369]] and the sins [[H2403]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and they shall not [[H3808]] be found: [[H4672]] for [[H3588]] I will pardon [[H5545]] them whom [[H834]] I reserve. [[H7604]]

### 21
Go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Merathaim, [[H4850]] against [[H5921]] it, and against [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Pekod: [[H6489]] waste [[H2717]] and utterly destroy [[H2763]] after [[H310]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] thee. [[H6680]]

### 22
A sound [[H6963]] of battle [[H4421]] in the land, [[H776]] and of great [[H1419]] destruction. [[H7667]]

### 23
How [[H349]] is the hammer [[H6360]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] cut asunder [[H1438]] and broken! [[H7665]] how [[H349]] is Babylon [[H894]] become [[H1961]] a desolation [[H8047]] among the nations! [[H1471]]

### 24
I have laid a snare [[H3369]] for thee, and thou art also [[H1571]] taken, [[H3920]] O Babylon, [[H894]] and thou [[H859]] wast not [[H3808]] aware: [[H3045]] thou art found, [[H4672]] and also [[H1571]] caught, [[H8610]] because [[H3588]] thou hast striven [[H1624]] against the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 25
The Lord [[H3068]] hath opened [[H6605]] his armoury, [[H214]] and hath brought forth [[H3318]] the weapons [[H3627]] of his indignation: [[H2195]] for [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] the work [[H4399]] of the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts [[H6635]] in the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 26
Come [[H935]] against her from the utmost border, [[H7093]] open [[H6605]] her storehouses: [[H3965]] cast her up [[H5549]] as heaps, [[H6194]] and destroy utterly: [[H2763]] her let nothing [[H408]] of her be [[H1961]] left. [[H7611]]

### 27
Slay [[H2717]] all [[H3605]] her bullocks; [[H6499]] let them go down [[H3381]] to the slaughter: [[H2874]] woe [[H1945]] unto [[H5921]] them! for [[H3588]] their day [[H3117]] is come, [[H935]] the time [[H6256]] of their visitation. [[H6486]]

### 28
The voice [[H6963]] of them that flee [[H5127]] and escape out [[H6405]] of the land [[H776]] of Babylon, [[H894]] to declare [[H5046]] in Zion [[H6726]] the vengeance [[H5360]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] the vengeance [[H5360]] of his temple. [[H1964]]

### 29
Call together [[H8085]] the archers [[H7228]] against [[H413]] Babylon: [[H894]] all [[H3605]] ye that bend [[H1869]] the bow, [[H7198]] camp [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] it round about; [[H5439]] let [[H1961]] none [[H408]] thereof escape: [[H6413]] recompense [[H7999]] her according to her work; [[H6467]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] she hath done, [[H6213]] do [[H6213]] unto her: for [[H3588]] she hath been proud [[H2102]] against [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] against [[H413]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 30
Therefore [[H3651]] shall her young men [[H970]] fall [[H5307]] in the streets, [[H7339]] and all [[H3605]] her men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] shall be cut off [[H1826]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 31
Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] thee, most proud, [[H2087]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts: [[H6635]] for [[H3588]] thy day [[H3117]] is come, [[H935]] the time [[H6256]] I will visit [[H6485]] thee. [[H6485]]

### 32
And the most proud [[H2087]] shall stumble [[H3782]] and fall, [[H5307]] and none [[H369]] shall raise him up: [[H6965]] and I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in his cities, [[H5892]] and it shall devour [[H398]] all [[H3605]] round about [[H5439]] him. [[H5439]]

### 33
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] The children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] oppressed [[H6231]] together: [[H3162]] and all [[H3605]] that took them captives [[H7617]] held them fast; [[H2388]] they refused [[H3985]] to let them go. [[H7971]]

### 34
Their Redeemer [[H1350]] strong; [[H2389]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] his name: [[H8034]] he shall throughly [[H7378]] plead [[H7378]] their cause, [[H7379]] that [[H4616]] he may give rest [[H7280]] to the land, [[H776]] and disquiet [[H7264]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 35
A sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and upon [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and upon [[H413]] her princes, [[H8269]] and upon [[H413]] her wise [[H2450]]

### 36
A sword [[H2719]] upon [[H413]] the liars; [[H907]] and they shall dote: [[H2973]] a sword [[H2719]] upon [[H413]] her mighty men; [[H1368]] and they shall be dismayed. [[H2865]]

### 37
A sword [[H2719]] upon [[H413]] their horses, [[H5483]] and upon [[H413]] their chariots, [[H7393]] and upon [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the mingled people [[H6154]] that [[H834]] in the midst [[H8432]] of her; and they shall become [[H1961]] as women: [[H802]] a sword [[H2719]] upon [[H413]] her treasures; [[H214]] and they shall be robbed. [[H962]]

### 38
A drought [[H2721]] upon [[H413]] her waters; [[H4325]] and they shall be dried up: [[H3001]] for [[H3588]] it the land [[H776]] of graven images, [[H6456]] and they [[H1931]] are mad [[H1984]] upon idols. [[H367]]

### 39
Therefore [[H3651]] the wild beasts of the desert [[H6728]] with [[H854]] the wild beasts of the islands [[H338]] shall dwell [[H3427]] and the owls [[H1323]] shall dwell [[H3427]] therein: and it shall be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] inhabited [[H3427]] for ever; [[H5331]] neither [[H3808]] shall it be dwelt in [[H7931]] from [[H5704]] generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]

### 40
As God [[H430]] overthrew [[H4114]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] and the neighbour [[H7934]] thereof, saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] shall no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] abide [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] neither [[H3808]] shall any son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] dwell [[H1481]] therein. [[H1481]]

### 41
Behold, [[H2009]] a people [[H5971]] shall come [[H935]] from the north, [[H6828]] and a great [[H1419]] nation, [[H1471]] and many [[H7227]] kings [[H4428]] shall be raised up [[H5782]] from the coasts [[H3411]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 42
They shall hold [[H2388]] the bow [[H7198]] and the lance: [[H3591]] they [[H1992]] cruel, [[H394]] and will not [[H3808]] shew mercy: [[H7355]] their voice [[H6963]] shall roar [[H1993]] like the sea, [[H3220]] and they shall ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] horses, [[H5483]] put in array, [[H6186]] like a man [[H376]] to the battle, [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] thee, O daughter [[H1323]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 43
The king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] hath heard [[H8085]] the report [[H8088]] of them, and his hands [[H3027]] waxed feeble: [[H7503]] anguish [[H6869]] took hold [[H2388]] of him, pangs [[H2427]] as of a woman in travail. [[H3205]]

### 44
Behold, [[H2009]] he shall come up [[H5927]] like a lion [[H738]] from the swelling [[H1347]] of Jordan [[H3383]] unto [[H413]] the habitation [[H5116]] of the strong: [[H386]] but [[H3588]] I will make them suddenly [[H7280]] run away [[H7323]] from her: [[H5921]] and who [[H4310]] a chosen [[H977]] I may appoint [[H6485]] over [[H413]] her? for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] like me? [[H3644]] and who [[H4310]] will appoint me the time? [[H3259]] and who [[H4310]] that [[H2088]] shepherd [[H7462]] that [[H834]] will stand [[H5975]] before me? [[H6440]]

### 45
Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] ye the counsel [[H6098]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] he hath taken [[H3289]] against [[H413]] Babylon; [[H894]] and his purposes, [[H4284]] that [[H834]] he hath purposed [[H2803]] against [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans: [[H3778]] Surely [[H518]] the least [[H6810]] of the flock [[H6629]] shall draw them out: [[H5498]] surely [[H518]] he shall make habitation [[H5116]] desolate [[H8074]] with [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 46
At the noise [[H6963]] of the taking [[H8610]] of Babylon [[H894]] the earth [[H776]] is moved, [[H7493]] and the cry [[H2201]] is heard [[H8085]] among the nations. [[H1471]]
