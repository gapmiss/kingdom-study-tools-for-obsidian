The word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] when king [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]]  him [[H853]] Pashur [[H6583]] the son [[H1121]] of Melchiah, [[H4441]] and Zephaniah [[H6846]] the son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah [[H4641]] the priest, [[H3548]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Inquire, [[H1875]] I pray thee, [[H4994]]  of [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] for us; [[H1157]] for [[H3588]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] maketh war [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] us; if so be [[H194]] that the Lord [[H3068]] will deal [[H6213]] with [[H854]] us according to all [[H3605]] his wondrous works, [[H6381]] that he may go up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 3
Then said [[H559]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zedekiah: [[H6667]]

### 4
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will turn back [[H5437]] the weapons [[H3627]] of war [[H4421]] that [[H834]] in your hands, [[H3027]] wherewith [[H834]] ye [[H859]] fight [[H3898]]  against [[H853]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] which besiege [[H6696]] you without [[H2351]] the walls, [[H2346]] and I will assemble [[H622]] them into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]]

### 5
And I myself [[H589]] will fight [[H3898]] against [[H854]] you with an outstretched [[H5186]] hand [[H3027]] and with a strong [[H2389]] arm, [[H2220]] even in anger, [[H639]] and in fury, [[H2534]] and in great [[H1419]] wrath. [[H7110]]

### 6
And I will smite [[H5221]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] both man [[H120]] and beast: [[H929]] they shall die [[H4191]] of a great [[H1419]] pestilence. [[H1698]]

### 7
And afterward, [[H310]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I will deliver [[H5414]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and his servants, [[H5650]] and the people, [[H5971]] and such as are left [[H7604]] in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] from [[H4480]] the pestilence, [[H1698]] from [[H4480]] the sword, [[H2719]] and from [[H4480]] the famine, [[H7458]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies, [[H341]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of those that seek [[H1245]] their life: [[H5315]] and he shall smite [[H5221]] them with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword; [[H2719]] he shall not [[H3808]] spare [[H2347]] them, neither [[H3808]] have pity, [[H2550]] nor [[H3808]] have mercy. [[H7355]]

### 8
And unto [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] thou shalt say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]]  you [[H853]] the way [[H1870]] of life, [[H2416]] and the way [[H1870]] of death. [[H4194]]

### 9
He that abideth [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] shall die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence: [[H1698]] but he that goeth out, [[H3318]] and falleth [[H5307]] to [[H5921]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] that besiege [[H6696]] you, he shall live, [[H2421]] and his life [[H5315]] shall be [[H1961]] unto him for a prey. [[H7998]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] I have set [[H7760]] my face [[H6440]] against this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] for evil, [[H7451]] and not [[H3808]] for good, [[H2896]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] it shall be given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he shall burn [[H8313]] it with fire. [[H784]]

### 11
And touching the house [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Hear [[H8085]] ye the word [[H1697]] of the Lord; [[H3068]]

### 12
O house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Execute [[H1777]] judgment [[H4941]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and deliver [[H5337]] spoiled [[H1497]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the oppressor, [[H6231]] lest [[H6435]] my fury [[H2534]] go out [[H3318]] like fire, [[H784]] and burn [[H1197]] that none [[H369]] can quench [[H3518]] because [[H6440]] of the evil [[H7455]] of your doings. [[H4611]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] thee, O inhabitant [[H3427]] of the valley, [[H6010]] rock [[H6697]] of the plain, [[H4334]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] which say, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall come down [[H5181]] against [[H5921]] us? or who [[H4310]] shall enter [[H935]] into our habitations? [[H4585]]

### 14
But I will punish [[H6485]] you according to the fruit [[H6529]] of your doings, [[H4611]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in the forest [[H3293]] thereof, and it shall devour [[H398]] all things [[H3605]] round about [[H5439]] it. [[H5439]]
