The word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] against [[H413]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] before [[H2962]] that Pharaoh [[H6547]] smote [[H5221]] Gaza. [[H5804]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] waters [[H4325]] rise up [[H5927]] out of the north, [[H6828]] and shall be [[H1961]] an overflowing [[H7857]] flood, [[H5158]] and shall overflow [[H7857]] the land, [[H776]] and all that is therein; [[H4393]] the city, [[H5892]] and them that dwell [[H3427]] therein: then the men [[H120]] shall cry, [[H2199]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] shall howl. [[H3213]]

### 3
At the noise [[H6963]] of the stamping [[H8161]] of the hoofs [[H6541]] of his strong [[H47]] at the rushing [[H7494]] of his chariots, [[H7393]] the rumbling [[H1995]] of his wheels, [[H1534]] the fathers [[H1]] shall not [[H3808]] look back [[H6437]] to [[H413]] children [[H1121]] for feebleness [[H7510]] of hands; [[H3027]]

### 4
Because of [[H5921]] the day [[H3117]] that cometh [[H935]] to spoil [[H7703]] all [[H3605]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] to cut off [[H3772]] from Tyrus [[H6865]] and Zidon [[H6721]] every [[H3605]] helper [[H5826]] that remaineth: [[H8300]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will spoil [[H7703]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the country [[H339]] of Caphtor. [[H3731]]

### 5
Baldness [[H7144]] is come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] Gaza; [[H5804]] Ashkelon [[H831]] is cut off [[H1820]] the remnant [[H7611]] of their valley: [[H6010]] how long [[H5704]] wilt thou cut [[H1413]] thyself? [[H1413]]

### 6
O [[H1945]] thou sword [[H2719]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] how long [[H5704]] ere [[H3808]] thou be quiet? [[H8252]] put up thyself [[H622]] into [[H413]] thy scabbard, [[H8593]] rest, [[H7280]] and be still. [[H1826]]

### 7
How [[H349]] can it be quiet, [[H8252]] seeing the Lord [[H3068]] hath given it a charge [[H6680]] against [[H413]] Ashkelon, [[H831]] and against [[H413]] the sea [[H3220]] shore? [[H2348]] there [[H8033]] hath he appointed [[H3259]] it. [[H3259]]
