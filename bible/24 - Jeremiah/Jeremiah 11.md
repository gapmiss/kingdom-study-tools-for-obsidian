### 1
The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Hear [[H8085]]  ye [[H853]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant, [[H1285]] and speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and to [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]]

### 3
And say [[H559]] thou unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Cursed [[H779]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] obeyeth [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant, [[H1285]]

### 4
Which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] your fathers [[H1]] in the day [[H3117]] I brought them forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the iron [[H1270]] furnace, [[H3564]] saying, [[H559]] Obey [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] and do [[H6213]] them, according to all [[H3605]] which [[H834]] I command [[H6680]] you: so shall ye be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] your God: [[H430]]

### 5
That [[H4616]] I may perform [[H6965]] the oath [[H7621]] which [[H834]] I have sworn [[H7650]] unto your fathers, [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] them a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] Then answered [[H6030]] I, and said, [[H559]] So be it, [[H543]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
Then the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Proclaim [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]]  ye [[H853]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant, [[H1285]] and do [[H6213]] them. [[H6213]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] I earnestly [[H5749]] protested [[H5749]] unto your fathers [[H1]] in the day [[H3117]] I brought them up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] rising early [[H7925]] and protesting, [[H5749]] saying, [[H559]] Obey [[H8085]] my voice. [[H6963]]

### 8
Yet they obeyed [[H8085]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] their ear, [[H241]] but walked [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] in the imagination [[H8307]] of their evil [[H7451]] heart: [[H3820]] therefore I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]]  them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant, [[H1285]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] to do; [[H6213]] but they did [[H6213]] not. [[H6213]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, A conspiracy [[H7195]] is found [[H4672]] among the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and among the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
They are turned back [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the iniquities [[H5771]] of their forefathers, [[H7223]] which [[H834]] refused [[H3985]] to hear [[H8085]] my words; [[H1697]] and they [[H1992]] went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve [[H5647]] them: the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] have broken [[H6565]] my covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] I made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] their fathers. [[H1]]

### 11
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] them, which [[H834]] they shall not [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to escape; [[H3318]] and though they shall cry [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] me, I will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 12
Then shall the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] go, [[H1980]] and cry [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the gods [[H430]] unto whom [[H834]] they [[H1992]] offer incense: [[H6999]] but they shall not [[H3808]] save [[H3467]] them at all [[H3467]] in the time [[H6256]] of their trouble. [[H7451]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] the number [[H4557]] of thy cities [[H5892]] were [[H1961]] thy gods, [[H430]] O Judah; [[H3063]] and the number [[H4557]] of the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] have ye set up [[H7760]] altars [[H4196]] to shameful thing, [[H1322]] altars [[H4196]] to burn incense [[H6999]] unto Baal. [[H1168]]

### 14
Therefore pray [[H6419]] not [[H408]] thou [[H859]] for [[H1157]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] neither [[H408]] lift up [[H5375]] a cry [[H7440]] or prayer [[H8605]] for them: [[H1157]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H369]] hear [[H8085]] in the time [[H6256]] that they cry [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] me for [[H1157]] their trouble. [[H7451]]

### 15
What [[H4100]] hath my beloved [[H3039]] to do in mine house, [[H1004]] she hath wrought [[H6213]] lewdness [[H4209]] with many, [[H7227]] and the holy [[H6944]] flesh [[H1320]] is passed [[H5674]] from [[H5921]] thee? when [[H3588]] thou doest evil, [[H7451]] then [[H227]] thou rejoicest. [[H5937]]

### 16
The Lord [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] thy name, [[H8034]] A green [[H7488]] olive tree, [[H2132]] fair, [[H3303]] of goodly [[H8389]] fruit: [[H6529]] with the noise [[H6963]] of a great [[H1419]] tumult [[H1999]] he hath kindled [[H3341]] fire [[H784]] upon [[H5921]] it, and the branches [[H1808]] of it are broken. [[H7489]]

### 17
For the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] that planted [[H5193]] thee, hath pronounced [[H1696]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] thee, for [[H1558]] the evil [[H7451]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and of the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which [[H834]] they have done [[H6213]] against themselves to provoke me to anger [[H3707]] in offering incense [[H6999]] unto Baal. [[H1168]]

### 18
And the Lord [[H3068]] hath given me knowledge [[H3045]] and I know [[H3045]] then [[H227]] thou shewedst [[H7200]] me their doings. [[H4611]]

### 19
But I [[H589]] like a lamb [[H3532]] an ox [[H441]] is brought [[H2986]] to the slaughter; [[H2873]] and I knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] they had devised [[H2803]] devices [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] me, Let us destroy [[H7843]] the tree [[H6086]] with the fruit [[H3899]] thereof, and let us cut him off [[H3772]] from the land [[H776]] of the living, [[H2416]] that his name [[H8034]] may be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] remembered. [[H2142]]

### 20
But, O Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] that judgest [[H8199]] righteously, [[H6664]] that triest [[H974]] the reins [[H3629]] and the heart, [[H3820]] let me see [[H7200]] thy vengeance [[H5360]] on them: for [[H3588]] unto [[H413]] thee have I revealed [[H1540]] my cause. [[H7379]]

### 21
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of [[H5921]] the men [[H376]] of Anathoth, [[H6068]] that seek [[H1245]] thy life, [[H5315]] saying, [[H559]] Prophesy [[H5012]] not [[H3808]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that thou die [[H4191]] not [[H3808]] by our hand: [[H3027]]

### 22
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will punish [[H6485]] them: the young men [[H970]] shall die [[H4191]] by the sword; [[H2719]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters [[H1323]] shall die [[H4191]] by famine: [[H7458]]

### 23
And there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] remnant [[H7611]] of them: for [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Anathoth, [[H6068]] the year [[H8141]] of their visitation. [[H6486]]
