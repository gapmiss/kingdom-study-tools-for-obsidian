The word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the days [[H3117]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the Rechabites, [[H7397]] and speak unto [[H1696]] them, and bring [[H935]] them into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] into [[H413]] one [[H259]] of the chambers, [[H3957]] and give them wine [[H3196]] to drink. [[H8248]]

### 3
Then I took [[H3947]] Jaazaniah [[H2970]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeremiah, [[H3414]] the son [[H1121]] of Habaziniah, [[H2262]] and his brethren, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] his sons, [[H1121]] and the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of the Rechabites; [[H7397]]

### 4
And I brought [[H935]] them into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] into [[H413]] the chamber [[H3957]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Hanan, [[H2605]] the son [[H1121]] of Igdaliah, [[H3012]] a man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] by [[H681]] the chamber [[H3957]] of the princes, [[H8269]] which [[H834]] above [[H4605]] the chamber [[H3957]] of Maaseiah [[H4641]] the son [[H1121]] of Shallum, [[H7967]] the keeper [[H8104]] of the door: [[H5592]]

### 5
And I set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] the sons [[H1121]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Rechabites [[H7397]] pots [[H1375]] full [[H4392]] of wine, [[H3196]] and cups, [[H3563]] and I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Drink [[H8354]] ye wine. [[H3196]]

### 6
But they said, [[H559]] We will drink [[H8354]] no [[H3808]] wine: [[H3196]] for [[H3588]] Jonadab [[H3122]] the son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] our father [[H1]] commanded [[H6680]] us, saying, [[H559]] Ye shall drink [[H8354]] no [[H3808]] wine, [[H3196]] ye, [[H859]] nor your sons [[H1121]] for [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]]

### 7
Neither [[H3808]] shall ye build [[H1129]] house, [[H1004]] nor [[H3808]] sow [[H2232]] seed, [[H2233]] nor [[H3808]] plant [[H5193]] vineyard, [[H3754]] nor [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] but [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] your days [[H3117]] ye shall dwell [[H3427]] in tents; [[H168]] that [[H4616]] ye may live [[H2421]] many [[H7227]] days [[H3117]] in [[H6440]] the land [[H127]] where [[H834]] ye [[H859]] strangers. [[H1481]]

### 8
Thus have we obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of Jonadab [[H3082]] the son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] our father [[H1]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath charged [[H6680]] us, to drink [[H8354]] no [[H1115]] wine [[H3196]] all [[H3605]] our days, [[H3117]] we, [[H587]] our wives, [[H802]] our sons, [[H1121]] nor our daughters; [[H1323]]

### 9
Nor [[H1115]] to build [[H1129]] houses [[H1004]] for us to dwell in: [[H3427]] neither [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] we vineyard, [[H3754]] nor field, [[H7704]] nor seed: [[H2233]]

### 10
But we have dwelt in [[H3427]] tents, [[H168]] and have obeyed, [[H8085]] and done [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Jonadab [[H3122]] our father [[H1]] commanded [[H6680]] us. [[H6680]]

### 11
But it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] came up [[H5927]] into [[H413]] the land, [[H776]] that we said, [[H559]] Come, [[H935]] and let us go [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] for fear [[H6440]] of the army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] and for fear [[H6440]] of the army [[H2428]] of the Syrians: [[H758]] so we dwell [[H3427]] at Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 12
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 13
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Will ye not [[H3808]] receive [[H3947]] instruction [[H4148]] to hearken [[H8085]] to [[H413]] my words? [[H1697]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
The words [[H1697]] of Jonadab [[H3082]] the son [[H1121]] of Rechab, [[H7394]] that [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] his sons [[H1121]] not [[H1115]] to drink [[H8354]] wine, [[H3196]] are performed; [[H6965]] for unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] they drink [[H8354]] none, [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] obey [[H8085]] their father's [[H1]] commandment: [[H4687]] notwithstanding I [[H595]] have spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you, rising early [[H7925]] and speaking; [[H1696]] but ye hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 15
I have sent [[H7971]] also unto [[H413]]  you [[H853]] all [[H3605]] my servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] rising up early [[H7925]] and sending [[H7971]] saying, [[H559]] Return [[H7725]] ye now [[H4994]] every man [[H376]] from his evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] and amend [[H3190]] your doings, [[H4611]] and go [[H1980]] not [[H408]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve [[H5647]] them, and ye shall dwell in [[H3427]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] to you and to your fathers: [[H1]] but ye have not [[H3808]] inclined [[H5186]] your ear, [[H241]] nor [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 16
Because [[H3588]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jonadab [[H3082]] the son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] have performed [[H6965]] the commandment [[H4687]] of their father, [[H1]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] them; but this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] hath not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me: [[H413]]

### 17
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H413]] Judah [[H3063]] and upon [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I have pronounced [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] them: because [[H3282]] I have spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, but they have not [[H3808]] heard; [[H8085]] and I have called [[H7121]] unto them, but they have not [[H3808]] answered. [[H6030]]

### 18
And Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] unto the house [[H1004]] of the Rechabites, [[H7397]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Because [[H3282]] ye have obeyed [[H8085]] the commandment [[H4687]] of Jonadab [[H3082]] your father, [[H1]] and kept [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] his precepts, [[H4687]] and done [[H6213]] according unto all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath commanded you: [[H6680]]

### 19
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Jonadab [[H3122]] the son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] shall not [[H3808]] want [[H3772]] a man [[H376]] to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] me for ever. [[H3117]]
