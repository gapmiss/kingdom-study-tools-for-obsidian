### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will raise up [[H5782]] against [[H5921]] Babylon, [[H894]] and against [[H413]] them that dwell [[H3427]] in the midst [[H3820]] of them that rise up [[H6965]] against me, a destroying [[H7843]] wind; [[H7307]]

### 2
And will send [[H7971]] unto Babylon [[H894]] fanners, [[H2114]] that shall fan [[H2219]] her, and shall empty [[H1238]] her land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] in the day [[H3117]] of trouble [[H7451]] they shall be [[H1961]] against [[H5921]] her round about. [[H5439]]

### 3
Against [[H413]] bendeth [[H1869]] let the archer [[H1869]] bend [[H1869]] his bow, [[H7198]] and against [[H413]] lifteth himself up [[H5927]] in his brigandine: [[H5630]] and spare [[H2550]] ye not [[H408]] her young men; [[H970]] destroy ye utterly [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] her host. [[H6635]]

### 4
Thus the slain [[H2491]] shall fall [[H5307]] in the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] and thrust through [[H1856]] in her streets. [[H2351]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] not [[H3808]] forsaken, [[H488]] nor Judah [[H3063]] of his God, [[H430]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] though [[H3588]] their land [[H776]] was filled [[H4390]] with sin [[H817]] against the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
Flee out [[H5127]] of the midst [[H8432]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and deliver [[H4422]] every man [[H376]] his soul: [[H5315]] be not [[H408]] cut off [[H1826]] in her iniquity; [[H5771]] for [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] the time [[H6256]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] vengeance; [[H5360]] he will render [[H7999]] unto her a recompence. [[H1576]]

### 7
Babylon [[H894]] a golden [[H2091]] cup [[H3563]] in the Lord's [[H3068]] hand, [[H3027]] that made all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] drunken: [[H7937]] the nations [[H1471]] have drunken [[H8354]] of her wine; [[H3196]] therefore [[H5921]] the nations [[H1471]] are mad. [[H1984]]

### 8
Babylon [[H894]] is suddenly [[H6597]] fallen [[H5307]] and destroyed: [[H7665]] howl [[H3213]] for [[H5921]] her; take [[H3947]] balm [[H6875]] for her pain, [[H4341]] if so be [[H194]] she may be healed. [[H7495]]

### 9
We would have healed [[H7495]] Babylon, [[H894]] but she is not [[H3808]] healed: [[H7495]] forsake [[H5800]] her, and let us go [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] into his own country: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] her judgment [[H4941]] reacheth [[H5060]] unto [[H413]] heaven, [[H8064]] and is lifted up [[H5375]] to [[H5704]] the skies. [[H7834]]

### 10
The Lord [[H3068]] hath brought forth [[H3318]] our righteousness: [[H6666]] come, [[H935]] and let us declare [[H5608]] in Zion [[H6726]] the work [[H4639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 11
Make bright [[H1305]] the arrows; [[H2671]] gather [[H4390]] the shields: [[H7982]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath raised up [[H5782]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the kings [[H4428]] of the Medes: [[H4074]] for [[H3588]] his device [[H4209]] against [[H5921]] Babylon, [[H894]] to destroy [[H7843]] it; because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] the vengeance [[H5360]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the vengeance [[H5360]] of his temple. [[H1964]]

### 12
Set up [[H5375]] the standard [[H5251]] upon [[H413]] the walls [[H2346]] of Babylon, [[H894]] make the watch [[H4929]] strong, [[H2388]] set up [[H6965]] the watchmen, [[H8104]] prepare [[H3559]] the ambushes: [[H693]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath both [[H1571]] devised [[H2161]] and [[H1571]] done [[H6213]] that which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] against [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 13
O thou that dwellest [[H7931]] upon [[H5921]] many [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] abundant [[H7227]] in treasures, [[H214]] thine end [[H7093]] is come, [[H935]] the measure [[H520]] of thy covetousness. [[H1215]]

### 14
The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath sworn [[H7650]] by himself, [[H5315]] Surely [[H3588]] I will fill [[H4390]] thee with men, [[H120]] as with caterpillers; [[H3218]] and they shall lift up [[H6030]] a shout [[H1959]] against [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 15
He hath made [[H6213]] the earth [[H776]] by his power, [[H3581]] he hath established [[H3559]] the world [[H8398]] by his wisdom, [[H2451]] and hath stretched out [[H5186]] the heaven [[H8064]] by his understanding. [[H8394]]

### 16
When he uttereth [[H5414]] voice, [[H6963]] a multitude [[H1995]] of waters [[H4325]] in the heavens; [[H8064]] and he causeth the vapours [[H5387]] to ascend [[H5927]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the earth: [[H776]] he maketh [[H6213]] lightnings [[H1300]] with rain, [[H4306]] and bringeth forth [[H3318]] the wind [[H7307]] out of his treasures. [[H214]]

### 17
Every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] is brutish [[H1197]] by knowledge; [[H1847]] every [[H3605]] founder [[H6884]] is confounded [[H3001]] by the graven image: [[H6459]] for [[H3588]] his molten image [[H5262]] falsehood, [[H8267]] and no [[H3808]] breath [[H7307]] in them. [[H7307]]

### 18
They [[H1992]] vanity, [[H1892]] the work [[H4639]] of errors: [[H8595]] in the time [[H6256]] of their visitation [[H6486]] they shall perish. [[H6]]

### 19
The portion [[H2506]] of Jacob [[H3290]] not [[H3808]] like them; [[H428]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the former [[H3335]] of all things: [[H3605]] and the rod [[H7626]] of his inheritance: [[H5159]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] his name. [[H8034]]

### 20
Thou [[H859]] my battle axe [[H4661]] weapons [[H3627]] of war: [[H4421]] for with thee will I break in pieces [[H5310]] the nations, [[H1471]] and with thee will I destroy [[H7843]] kingdoms; [[H4467]]

### 21
And with thee will I break in pieces [[H5310]] the horse [[H5483]] and his rider; [[H7392]] and with thee will I break in pieces [[H5310]] the chariot [[H7393]] and his rider; [[H7392]]

### 22
With thee also will I break in pieces [[H5310]] man [[H376]] and woman; [[H802]] and with thee will I break in pieces [[H5310]] old [[H2205]] and young; [[H5288]] and with thee will I break in pieces [[H5310]] the young man [[H970]] and the maid; [[H1330]]

### 23
I will also break in pieces [[H5310]] with thee the shepherd [[H7462]] and his flock; [[H5739]] and with thee will I break in pieces [[H5310]] the husbandman [[H406]] and his yoke of oxen; [[H6776]] and with thee will I break in pieces [[H5310]] captains [[H6346]] and rulers. [[H5461]]

### 24
And I will render [[H7999]] unto Babylon [[H894]] and to all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Chaldea [[H3778]] all [[H3605]] their evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] they have done [[H6213]] in Zion [[H6726]] in your sight, [[H5869]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 25
Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H413]] thee, O destroying [[H4889]] mountain, [[H2022]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which destroyest [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] and I will stretch out [[H5186]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and roll thee down [[H1556]] from [[H4480]] the rocks, [[H5553]] and will make [[H5414]] thee a burnt [[H8316]] mountain. [[H2022]]

### 26
And they shall not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] of [[H4480]] thee a stone [[H68]] for a corner, [[H6438]] nor a stone [[H68]] for foundations; [[H4146]] but [[H3588]] thou shalt be [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] for ever, [[H5769]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
Set ye up [[H5375]] a standard [[H5251]] in the land, [[H776]] blow [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] among the nations, [[H1471]] prepare [[H6942]] the nations [[H1471]] against [[H5921]] her, call together [[H8085]] against [[H5921]] her the kingdoms [[H4467]] of Ararat, [[H780]] Minni, [[H4508]] and Ashchenaz; [[H813]] appoint [[H6485]] a captain [[H2951]] against [[H5921]] her; cause the horses [[H5483]] to come up [[H5927]] as the rough [[H5569]] caterpillers. [[H3218]]

### 28
Prepare [[H6942]] against [[H5921]] her the nations [[H1471]]  with [[H853]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Medes, [[H4074]] the captains [[H6346]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the rulers [[H5461]] thereof, and all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of his dominion. [[H4475]]

### 29
And the land [[H776]] shall tremble [[H7493]] and sorrow: [[H2342]] for [[H3588]] every purpose [[H4284]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be performed [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] Babylon, [[H894]] to make [[H7760]] the land [[H776]] of Babylon [[H894]] a desolation [[H8047]] without [[H369]] an inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 30
The mighty men [[H1368]] of Babylon [[H894]] have forborn [[H2308]] to fight, [[H3898]] they have remained [[H3427]] in holds: [[H4679]] their might [[H1369]] hath failed; [[H5405]] they became [[H1961]] as women: [[H802]] they have burned [[H3341]] her dwellingplaces; [[H4908]] her bars [[H1280]] are broken. [[H7665]]

### 31
One post [[H7323]] shall run [[H7323]] to meet [[H7125]] another, [[H7323]] and one messenger [[H5046]] to meet [[H7125]] another, [[H5046]] to shew [[H5046]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] that [[H3588]] his city [[H5892]] is taken [[H3920]] at end, [[H7097]]

### 32
And that the passages [[H4569]] are stopped, [[H8610]] and the reeds [[H98]] they have burned [[H8313]] with fire, [[H784]] and the men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] are affrighted. [[H926]]

### 33
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] The daughter [[H1323]] of Babylon [[H894]] like a threshingfloor, [[H1637]] time [[H6256]] to thresh [[H1869]] her: yet [[H5750]] a little while, [[H4592]] and the time [[H6256]] of her harvest [[H7105]] shall come. [[H935]]

### 34
Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] hath devoured [[H398]] me, he hath crushed [[H2000]] me, he hath made [[H3322]] me an empty [[H7385]] vessel, [[H3627]] he hath swallowed me up [[H1104]] like a dragon, [[H8577]] he hath filled [[H4390]] his belly [[H3770]] with my delicates, [[H5730]] he hath cast me out. [[H1740]]

### 35
The violence [[H2555]] done to me and to my flesh [[H7607]] upon [[H5921]] Babylon, [[H894]] shall the inhabitant [[H3427]] of Zion [[H6726]] say; [[H559]] and my blood [[H1818]] upon [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Chaldea, [[H3778]] shall Jerusalem [[H3389]] say. [[H559]]

### 36
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will plead [[H7378]] thy cause, [[H7379]] and take vengeance [[H5358]] for thee; [[H5360]] and I will dry up [[H2717]] her sea, [[H3220]]  and make [[H853]] her springs [[H4726]] dry. [[H3001]]

### 37
And Babylon [[H894]] shall become [[H1961]] heaps, [[H1530]] a dwellingplace [[H4583]] for dragons, [[H8577]] an astonishment, [[H8047]] and an hissing, [[H8322]] without [[H369]] an inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 38
They shall roar [[H7580]] together [[H3162]] like lions: [[H3715]] they shall yell [[H5286]] as lions' [[H738]] whelps. [[H1484]]

### 39
In their heat [[H2527]] I will make [[H7896]] their feasts, [[H4960]] and I will make them drunken, [[H7937]] that [[H4616]] they may rejoice, [[H5937]] and sleep [[H3462]] a perpetual [[H5769]] sleep, [[H8142]] and not [[H3808]] wake, [[H6974]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 40
I will bring them down [[H3381]] like lambs [[H3733]] to the slaughter, [[H2873]] like rams [[H352]] with [[H5973]] he goats. [[H6260]]

### 41
How [[H349]] is Sheshach [[H8347]] taken! [[H3920]] and how is the praise [[H8416]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] surprised! [[H8610]] how [[H349]] is Babylon [[H894]] become [[H1961]] an astonishment [[H8047]] among the nations! [[H1471]]

### 42
The sea [[H3220]] is come up [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] Babylon: [[H894]] she is covered [[H3680]] with the multitude [[H1995]] of the waves [[H1530]] thereof. [[H1530]]

### 43
Her cities [[H5892]] are [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H8047]] a dry [[H6723]] land, [[H776]] and a wilderness, [[H6160]] a land [[H776]] wherein [[H2004]] no [[H3605]] man [[H376]] dwelleth, [[H3427]] neither [[H3808]] doth son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] pass [[H5674]] thereby. [[H2004]]

### 44
And I will punish [[H6485]] Bel [[H1078]] in Babylon, [[H894]] and I will bring forth [[H3318]] out of his mouth [[H6310]] that which he hath swallowed up: [[H1105]] and the nations [[H1471]] shall not [[H3808]] flow together [[H5102]] any more [[H5750]] unto [[H413]] him: yea, [[H1571]] the wall [[H2346]] of Babylon [[H894]] shall fall. [[H5307]]

### 45
My people, [[H5971]] go out [[H3318]] ye of the midst [[H8432]] of her, and deliver [[H4422]] ye every man [[H376]] his soul [[H5315]] from the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 46
And lest [[H6435]] your heart [[H3824]] faint, [[H7401]] and ye fear [[H3372]] for the rumour [[H8052]] that shall be heard [[H8085]] in the land; [[H776]] a rumour [[H8052]] shall both come [[H935]] year, [[H8141]] and after [[H310]] that in year [[H8141]] a rumour, [[H8052]] and violence [[H2555]] in the land, [[H776]] ruler [[H4910]] against [[H5921]] ruler. [[H4910]]

### 47
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] that I will do judgment [[H6485]] upon [[H5921]] the graven images [[H6456]] of Babylon: [[H894]] and her whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] shall be confounded, [[H954]] and all [[H3605]] her slain [[H2491]] shall fall [[H5307]] in the midst [[H8432]] of her. [[H8432]]

### 48
Then the heaven [[H8064]] and the earth, [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein, shall sing [[H7442]] for [[H5921]] Babylon: [[H894]] for [[H3588]] the spoilers [[H7703]] shall come [[H935]] unto her from the north, [[H6828]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 49
As [[H1571]] Babylon [[H894]] the slain [[H2491]] of Israel [[H3478]] to fall, [[H5307]] so [[H1571]] at Babylon [[H894]] shall fall [[H5307]] the slain [[H2491]] of all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 50
Ye that have escaped [[H6412]] the sword, [[H2719]] go away, [[H1980]] stand not still: [[H5975]] remember [[H2142]] the Lord [[H3068]] afar off, [[H7350]] and let Jerusalem [[H3389]] come [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] your mind. [[H3824]]

### 51
We are confounded, [[H954]] because [[H3588]] we have heard [[H8085]] reproach: [[H2781]] shame [[H3639]] hath covered [[H3680]] our faces: [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] strangers [[H2114]] are come [[H935]] into [[H5921]] the sanctuaries [[H4720]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house. [[H1004]]

### 52
Wherefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will do judgment [[H6485]] upon [[H5921]] her graven images: [[H6456]] and through all [[H3605]] her land [[H776]] the wounded [[H2491]] shall groan. [[H602]]

### 53
Though [[H3588]] Babylon [[H894]] should mount up [[H5927]] to heaven, [[H8064]] and though [[H3588]] she should fortify [[H1219]] the height [[H4791]] of her strength, [[H5797]] from me [[H854]] shall spoilers [[H7703]] come [[H935]] unto her, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 54
A sound [[H6963]] of a cry [[H2201]] from Babylon, [[H894]] and great [[H1419]] destruction [[H7667]] from the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans: [[H3778]]

### 55
Because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoiled [[H7703]] Babylon, [[H894]] and destroyed [[H6]] out of [[H4480]] her the great [[H1419]] voice; [[H6963]] when her waves [[H1530]] do roar [[H1993]] like great [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] a noise [[H7588]] of their voice [[H6963]] is uttered: [[H5414]]

### 56
Because [[H3588]] the spoiler [[H7703]] is come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] her, upon [[H5921]] Babylon, [[H894]] and her mighty men [[H1368]] are taken, [[H3920]] every one of their bows [[H7198]] is broken: [[H2865]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H410]] of recompences [[H1578]] shall surely [[H7999]] requite. [[H7999]]

### 57
And I will make drunk [[H7937]] her princes, [[H8269]] and her wise [[H2450]] her captains, [[H6346]] and her rulers, [[H5461]] and her mighty men: [[H1368]] and they shall sleep [[H3462]] a perpetual [[H5769]] sleep, [[H8142]] and not [[H3808]] wake, [[H6974]] saith [[H5002]] the King, [[H4428]] whose name [[H8034]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 58
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] The broad [[H7342]] walls [[H2346]] of Babylon [[H894]] shall be utterly [[H6209]] broken, [[H6209]] and her high [[H1364]] gates [[H8179]] shall be burned [[H3341]] with fire; [[H784]] and the people [[H5971]] shall labour [[H3021]] in vain, [[H7385]] and the folk [[H3816]] in [[H1767]] the fire, [[H784]] and they shall be weary. [[H3286]]

### 59
The word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] commanded [[H6680]] Seraiah [[H8304]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah, [[H5374]] the son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah, [[H4271]] when he went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] into Babylon [[H894]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of his reign. [[H4427]] And Seraiah [[H8304]] a quiet [[H4496]] prince. [[H8269]]

### 60
So Jeremiah [[H3414]] wrote [[H3789]] in [[H413]] a [[H259]] book [[H5612]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] should come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] Babylon, [[H894]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] that are written [[H3789]] against [[H413]] Babylon. [[H894]]

### 61
And Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Seraiah, [[H8304]] When thou comest [[H935]] to Babylon, [[H894]] and shalt see, [[H7200]] and shalt read [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words; [[H1697]]

### 62
Then shalt thou say, [[H559]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou [[H859]] hast spoken [[H1696]] against [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] to cut it off, [[H3772]] that none [[H1115]] shall [[H1961]] remain [[H3427]] in it, neither man [[H120]] nor [[H5704]] beast, [[H929]] but [[H3588]] that it shall be [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] for ever.
