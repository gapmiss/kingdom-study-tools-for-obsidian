And Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] went forth [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] Mizpah [[H4709]] to meet [[H7125]] them, weeping [[H1058]] all along [[H1980]] as he went: [[H1980]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] as he met [[H6298]] them, he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam. [[H296]]

### 7
And it was [[H1961]] when they came [[H935]] into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the city, [[H5892]] that Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] slew [[H7819]] them, into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the pit, [[H953]] he, [[H1931]] and the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him.

But ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] were found [[H4672]] among them that said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Ishmael, [[H3458]] Slay [[H4191]] us not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] we have [[H3426]] treasures [[H4301]] in the field, [[H7704]] of wheat, [[H2406]] and of barley, [[H8184]] and of oil, [[H8081]] and of honey. [[H1706]] So he forbare, [[H2308]] and slew [[H4191]] them not [[H3808]] among [[H8432]] their brethren. [[H251]]

Now the pit [[H953]] wherein [[H834]] Ishmael [[H3458]] had cast [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] the dead bodies [[H6297]] of the men, [[H376]] whom [[H834]] he had slain [[H5221]] because [[H3027]] of Gedaliah, [[H1436]] it [[H1931]] which [[H834]] Asa [[H609]] the king [[H4428]] had made [[H6213]] for fear [[H6440]] of Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel: [[H3478]] Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] filled [[H4390]] it with slain. [[H2491]]

### 10
Then Ishmael [[H3458]] carried away captive [[H7617]] all [[H3605]] the residue [[H7611]] of the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] in Mizpah, [[H4709]] the king's [[H4428]] daughters, [[H1323]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that remained [[H7604]] in Mizpah, [[H4709]] whom [[H834]] Nebuzar-adan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] had committed [[H6485]]  to [[H853]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam: [[H296]] and Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] carried them away captive, [[H7617]] and departed [[H1980]] to go over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the Ammonites.

### 12
Then they took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the men, [[H376]] and went [[H1980]] to fight [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] and found [[H4672]] him by [[H413]] the great [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] that [[H834]] in Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 13
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] when all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] with [[H854]] Ishmael [[H3458]] saw [[H7200]] Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] of the forces [[H2428]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, then they were glad. [[H8055]]

### 14
So all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] Ishmael [[H3458]] had carried away captive [[H7617]] from [[H4480]] Mizpah [[H4709]] cast about [[H5437]] and returned, [[H7725]] and went [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah. [[H7143]]

### 15
But Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] escaped [[H4422]] from [[H6440]] Johanan [[H3110]] with eight [[H8083]] men, [[H376]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the Ammonites. [[H1121]]

### 16
Then took [[H3947]] Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] of the forces [[H2428]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]]  him, [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the people [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] he had recovered [[H7725]] from [[H853]] Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] from [[H4480]] Mizpah, [[H4709]] after [[H310]] he had slain [[H5221]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] mighty [[H1397]] men [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] and the women, [[H802]] and the children, [[H2945]] and the eunuchs, [[H5631]] whom [[H834]] he had brought again [[H7725]] from Gibeon: [[H1391]]

### 17
And they departed, [[H1980]] and dwelt in [[H3427]] the habitation [[H1628]] of Chimham, [[H3643]] which [[H834]] is by [[H681]] Bethlehem, [[H1035]] to go [[H1980]] to enter into [[H935]] Egypt, [[H4714]]

### 18
Because [[H6440]] of the Chaldeans: [[H3778]] for [[H3588]] they were afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] them, because [[H3588]] Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] had slain [[H5221]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] made governor [[H6485]] in the land.
