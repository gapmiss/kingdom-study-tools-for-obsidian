### 1
Then all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] of the forces, [[H2428]] and Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and Jezaniah [[H3153]] the son [[H1121]] of Hoshaiah, [[H1955]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] from the least [[H6996]] even unto [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]] came near, [[H5066]]

### 2
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] Let, we beseech thee, [[H4994]] our supplication [[H8467]] be accepted [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] thee, and pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] us unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] for [[H1157]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] remnant; [[H7611]] (for [[H3588]] we are left [[H7604]] a few [[H4592]] of many, [[H7235]] as [[H834]] thine eyes [[H5869]] do behold [[H7200]] us:) [[H7200]]

### 3
That the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] may shew [[H5046]]  us [[H853]] the way [[H1870]] wherein [[H834]] we may walk, [[H1980]] and the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] we may do. [[H6213]]

### 4
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I have heard [[H8085]] behold, [[H2005]] I will pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] according to your words; [[H1697]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] whatsoever [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall answer [[H6030]] you, I will declare [[H5046]] unto you; I will keep [[H4513]] nothing [[H1697]]  back [[H3808]] from you. [[H4480]]

### 5
Then they [[H1992]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] The Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] a true [[H571]] and faithful [[H539]] witness [[H5707]] between us, if [[H518]] we do [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] even [[H3651]] according to all [[H3605]] things [[H1697]] for the which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall send [[H7971]] thee to [[H413]] us. [[H413]]

### 6
Whether [[H518]] good, [[H2896]] or whether [[H518]] evil, [[H7451]] we will obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] to whom [[H834]] we [[H580]] send [[H7971]] thee; that [[H4616]] it may be well [[H3190]] with us, when [[H3588]] we obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 7
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H7093]] ten [[H6235]] days, [[H3117]] that the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah. [[H3414]]

### 8
Then called [[H7121]] he Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] of the forces [[H2428]] which [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] from the least [[H6996]] even to [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]]

### 9
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] whom [[H834]] ye sent [[H7971]] me to present [[H5307]] your supplication [[H8467]] before [[H6440]] him; [[H6440]]

### 10
If [[H518]] ye will still [[H7725]] abide [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] then will I build [[H1129]] you, and not [[H3808]] pull down, [[H2040]] and I will plant [[H5193]] you, and not [[H3808]] pluck up: [[H5428]] for [[H3588]] I repent [[H5162]] me of [[H413]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] unto you. [[H6213]]

### 11
Be not [[H408]] afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] of whom [[H6440]] ye [[H859]] are afraid; [[H3373]] be not [[H408]] afraid [[H3372]] of [[H4480]] him, saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] you to save [[H3467]] you, and to deliver [[H5337]] you from his hand. [[H3027]]

### 12
And I will shew [[H5414]] mercies [[H7356]] unto you, that he may have mercy upon [[H7355]] you, and cause you to return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] your own land. [[H127]]

### 13
But if [[H518]] ye [[H859]] say, [[H559]] We will not [[H3808]] dwell [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] neither [[H1115]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]]

### 14
Saying, [[H559]] No; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] we will go [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] where [[H834]] we shall see [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] war, [[H4421]] nor [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] nor [[H3808]] have hunger [[H7456]] of bread; [[H3899]] and there [[H8033]] will we dwell: [[H3427]]

### 15
And now [[H6258]] therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] ye remnant [[H7611]] of Judah; [[H3063]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] If [[H518]] ye [[H859]] wholly [[H7760]] set [[H7760]] your faces [[H6440]] to enter into [[H935]] Egypt, [[H4714]] and go [[H935]] to sojourn [[H1481]] there; [[H1481]]

### 16
Then it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] the sword, [[H2719]] which [[H834]] ye [[H859]] feared, [[H3372]] shall overtake [[H5381]] you there [[H8033]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and the famine, [[H7458]] whereof [[H834]] ye [[H859]] were afraid, [[H1672]] shall follow close [[H1692]] after [[H310]] you there [[H8033]] in Egypt; [[H4714]] and there [[H8033]] ye shall die. [[H4191]]

### 17
So shall it be [[H1961]] with all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] set [[H7760]] their faces [[H6440]] to go into [[H935]] Egypt [[H4714]] to sojourn [[H1481]] there; [[H8033]] they shall die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence: [[H1698]] and none [[H3808]] of them shall [[H1961]] remain [[H8300]] or escape [[H6412]] from [[H6440]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] will bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] As [[H834]] mine anger [[H639]] and my fury [[H2534]] hath been poured forth [[H5413]] upon [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]] so [[H3651]] shall my fury [[H2534]] be poured forth [[H5413]] upon [[H5921]] you, when ye shall [[H1961]] enter into [[H935]] Egypt: [[H4714]] and ye shall be an execration, [[H423]] and an astonishment, [[H8047]] and a curse, [[H7045]] and a reproach; [[H2781]] and ye shall see [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H3808]]

### 19
The Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] you, O ye remnant [[H7611]] of Judah; [[H3063]] Go [[H935]] ye not [[H408]] into Egypt: [[H4714]] know [[H3045]] certainly [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have admonished [[H5749]] you this day. [[H3117]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] ye dissembled [[H8582]] in your hearts, [[H5315]] when [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]] Pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] us unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] and according unto all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] shall say, [[H559]] so [[H3651]] declare [[H5046]] unto us, and we will do [[H6213]]

### 21
And I have this day [[H3117]] declared [[H5046]] to you; but ye have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] nor any [[H3605]] for the which [[H834]] he hath sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 22
Now [[H6258]] therefore know [[H3045]] certainly [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] ye shall die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence, [[H1698]] in the place [[H4725]] whither [[H834]] ye desire [[H2654]] to go [[H935]] to sojourn. [[H1481]]
