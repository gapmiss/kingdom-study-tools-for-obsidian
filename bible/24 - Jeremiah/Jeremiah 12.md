### 1
Righteous [[H6662]] thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] when [[H3588]] I plead [[H7378]] with [[H413]] thee: yet [[H389]] let me talk [[H1696]] with [[H854]] thee of judgments: [[H4941]] Wherefore [[H4069]] doth the way [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] prosper? [[H6743]] are all [[H3605]] they happy [[H7951]] that deal very [[H899]] treacherously? [[H898]]

### 2
Thou hast planted [[H5193]] them, yea, [[H1571]] they have taken root: [[H8327]] they grow, [[H1980]] yea, [[H1571]] they bring forth [[H6213]] fruit: [[H6529]] thou [[H859]] near [[H7138]] in their mouth, [[H6310]] and far from [[H7350]] their reins. [[H3629]]

### 3
But thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] knowest [[H3045]] me: thou hast seen [[H7200]] me, and tried [[H974]] mine heart [[H3820]] toward [[H854]] thee: pull them out [[H5423]] like sheep [[H6629]] for the slaughter, [[H2878]] and prepare [[H6942]] them for the day [[H3117]] of slaughter. [[H2028]]

### 4
How long [[H5704]] shall the land [[H776]] mourn, [[H56]] and the herbs [[H6212]] of every [[H3605]] field [[H7704]] wither, [[H3001]] for the wickedness [[H7451]] of them that dwell [[H3427]] therein? the beasts [[H929]] are consumed, [[H5595]] and the birds; [[H5775]] because [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] He shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] our last end. [[H319]]

### 5
If [[H3588]] thou hast run [[H7323]] with [[H854]] the footmen, [[H7273]] and they have wearied [[H3811]] thee, then how [[H349]] canst thou contend [[H8474]] with [[H854]] horses? [[H5483]] and in the land [[H776]] of peace, [[H7965]] thou [[H859]] trustedst, [[H982]] then how [[H349]] wilt thou do [[H6213]] in the swelling [[H1347]] of Jordan? [[H3383]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] even [[H1571]] thy brethren, [[H251]] and the house [[H1004]] of thy father, [[H1]] even [[H1571]] they [[H1992]] have dealt treacherously [[H898]] with thee; yea, [[H1571]] they [[H1992]] have called [[H7121]] a multitude [[H4392]] after [[H310]] thee: believe [[H539]] them not, [[H408]] though [[H3588]] they speak [[H1696]] fair words [[H2896]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 7
I have forsaken [[H5800]] mine house, [[H1004]] I have left [[H5203]] mine heritage; [[H5159]] I have given [[H5414]] the dearly beloved [[H3033]] of my soul [[H5315]] into the hand [[H3709]] of her enemies. [[H341]]

### 8
Mine heritage [[H5159]] is [[H1961]] unto me as a lion [[H738]] in the forest; [[H3293]] it crieth out [[H5414]] against [[H5921]] me: therefore [[H5921]] have I hated [[H8130]] it. [[H8130]]

### 9
Mine heritage [[H5159]] unto me a speckled [[H6641]] bird, [[H5861]] the birds [[H5861]] round about [[H5439]] against [[H5921]] her; come [[H1980]] ye, assemble [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] come [[H857]] to devour. [[H402]]

### 10
Many [[H7227]] pastors [[H7462]] have destroyed [[H7843]] my vineyard, [[H3754]] they have trodden [[H947]] my portion [[H2513]]  under foot, [[H853]] they have made [[H5414]] my pleasant [[H2532]] portion [[H2513]] a desolate [[H8077]] wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 11
They have made [[H7760]] it desolate, [[H8076]] desolate it mourneth [[H56]] unto me; [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] is made [[H6213]] desolate, [[H8077]] because [[H3588]] no [[H369]] man [[H376]] layeth [[H7760]] to [[H5921]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 12
The spoilers [[H7703]] are come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] high places [[H8205]] through the wilderness: [[H4057]] for [[H3588]] the sword [[H2719]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall devour [[H398]] from the end [[H7097]] of the land [[H776]] even to [[H5704]] the end [[H7097]] of the land: [[H776]] no [[H369]] flesh [[H1320]] shall have peace. [[H7965]]

### 13
They have sown [[H2232]] wheat, [[H2406]] but shall reap [[H7114]] thorns: [[H6975]] they have put themselves to pain, [[H2470]] shall not [[H3808]] profit: [[H3276]] and they shall be ashamed [[H954]] of your revenues [[H8393]] because of the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] mine evil [[H7451]] neighbours, [[H7934]] that touch [[H5060]] the inheritance [[H5159]] which [[H834]]  I have caused [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] to inherit; [[H5157]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will pluck them out [[H5428]] of [[H5921]] their land, [[H127]] and pluck out [[H5428]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] from among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 15
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] after that [[H310]] I have plucked them out [[H5428]] I will return, [[H7725]] and have compassion [[H7355]] on them, and will bring them again, [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] to his heritage, [[H5159]] and every man [[H376]] to his land. [[H776]]

### 16
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] they will diligently [[H3925]] learn [[H3925]] the ways [[H1870]] of my people, [[H5971]] to swear [[H7650]] by my name, [[H8034]] The Lord [[H3068]] liveth; [[H2416]] as [[H834]] they taught [[H3925]] my people [[H5971]] to swear [[H7650]] by Baal; [[H1168]] then shall they be built [[H1129]] in the midst [[H8432]] of my people. [[H5971]]

### 17
But if [[H518]] they will not [[H3808]] obey, [[H8085]] I will utterly [[H5428]] pluck up [[H5428]] and destroy [[H6]] that [[H1931]] nation, [[H1471]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
