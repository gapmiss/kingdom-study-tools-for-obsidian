### 1
The words [[H1697]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] the son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] of [[H4480]] the priests [[H3548]] that [[H834]] in Anathoth [[H6068]] in the land [[H776]] of Benjamin: [[H1144]]

### 2
To whom [[H834]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] of Josiah [[H2977]] the son [[H1121]] of Amon [[H526]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in the thirteenth [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of his reign. [[H4427]]

### 3
It came [[H1961]] also in the days [[H3117]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] unto [[H5704]] the end [[H8552]] of the eleventh [[H6249]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] unto [[H5704]] the carrying away [[H1540]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] captive in the fifth [[H2549]] month. [[H2320]]

### 4
Then the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 5
Before [[H2962]] I formed [[H3335]] thee in the belly [[H990]] I knew [[H3045]] thee; and before [[H2962]] thou camest forth [[H3318]] out of the womb [[H7358]] I sanctified [[H6942]] thee, I ordained [[H5414]] thee a prophet [[H5030]] unto the nations. [[H1471]]

### 6
Then said [[H559]] I, Ah, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] God! [[H3069]] behold, [[H2009]] I cannot [[H3045]] speak: [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] a child. [[H5288]]

### 7
But the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Say [[H559]] not, [[H408]] I [[H595]] a child: [[H5288]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt go [[H1980]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I shall send [[H7971]] thee, and whatsoever [[H3605]] I command [[H6680]] thee thou shalt speak. [[H1696]]

### 8
Be not [[H408]] afraid [[H3372]] of their faces: [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] thee to deliver [[H5337]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
Then the Lord [[H3068]] put forth [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] and touched [[H5060]] my mouth. [[H6310]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Behold, [[H2009]] I have put [[H5414]] my words [[H1697]] in thy mouth. [[H6310]]

### 10
See, [[H7200]] I have this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] set [[H6485]] thee over [[H5921]] the nations [[H1471]] and over [[H5921]] the kingdoms, [[H4467]] to root out, [[H5428]] and to pull down, [[H5422]] and to destroy, [[H6]] and to throw down, [[H2040]] to build, [[H1129]] and to plant. [[H5193]]

### 11
Moreover the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] what [[H4100]] seest [[H7200]] thou? [[H859]] And I said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] a rod [[H4731]] of an almond tree. [[H8247]]

### 12
Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, Thou hast well [[H3190]] seen: [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will hasten [[H8245]] my word [[H1697]] to perform [[H6213]] it. [[H6213]]

### 13
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me the second time, [[H8145]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] seest [[H7200]] thou? [[H859]] And I said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] a seething [[H5301]] pot; [[H5518]] and the face [[H6440]] thereof toward [[H6440]] the north. [[H6828]]

### 14
Then the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Out of the north [[H6828]] an evil [[H7451]] shall break forth [[H6605]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 15
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2005]] I will call [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the north, [[H6828]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and they shall come, [[H935]] and they shall set [[H5414]] every one [[H376]] his throne [[H3678]] at the entering [[H6607]] of the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the walls [[H2346]] thereof round about, [[H5439]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 16
And I will utter [[H1696]] my judgments [[H4941]] against them touching [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their wickedness, [[H7451]] who [[H834]] have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and have burned incense [[H6999]] unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and worshipped [[H7812]] the works [[H4639]] of their own hands. [[H3027]]

### 17
Thou [[H859]] therefore gird up [[H247]] thy loins, [[H4975]] and arise, [[H6965]] and speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]]  them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee: be not [[H408]] dismayed [[H2865]] at their faces, [[H6440]] lest [[H6435]] I confound [[H2865]] thee before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 18
For, behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] have made [[H5414]] thee this day [[H3117]] a defenced [[H4013]] city, [[H5892]] and an iron [[H1270]] pillar, [[H5982]] and brasen [[H5178]] walls [[H2346]] against [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] land, [[H776]] against the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] against the princes [[H8269]] thereof, against the priests [[H3548]] thereof, and against the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 19
And they shall fight [[H3898]] against [[H413]] thee; but they shall not [[H3808]] prevail [[H3201]] against thee; for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to deliver [[H5337]] thee. [[H5337]]
