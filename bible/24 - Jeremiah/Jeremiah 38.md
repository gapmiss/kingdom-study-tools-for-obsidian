### 1
Then Shephatiah [[H8203]] the son [[H1121]] of Mattan, [[H4977]] and Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Pashur, [[H6583]] and Jucal [[H3116]] the son [[H1121]] of Shelemiah, [[H8018]] and Pashur [[H6583]] the son [[H1121]] of Malchiah, [[H4441]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] had spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] He that remaineth [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] shall die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] by the famine, [[H7458]] and by the pestilence: [[H1698]] but he that goeth forth [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] shall live; [[H2421]] for he shall have [[H1961]] his life [[H5315]] for a prey, [[H7998]] and shall live. [[H2421]]

### 3
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] This [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] shall surely [[H5414]] be given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon's [[H894]] army, [[H2428]] which shall take [[H3920]] it. [[H3920]]

### 4
Therefore the princes [[H8269]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] We beseech thee, [[H4994]]  let [[H853]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] be put to death: [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] thus [[H3651]] he [[H1931]] weakeneth [[H7503]] the hands [[H3027]] of the men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] that remain [[H7604]] in this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and the hands [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] in speaking [[H1696]] such [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] them: for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] seeketh [[H1875]] not [[H369]] the welfare [[H7965]] of this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] but [[H3588]] the hurt. [[H7451]]

### 5
Then Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] in your hand: [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] not [[H369]] can do [[H3201]] thing [[H1697]] against you. [[H1697]]

### 6
Then took [[H3947]]  they [[H853]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] and cast [[H7993]] him into [[H413]] the dungeon [[H953]] of Malchiah [[H4441]] the son [[H1121]] of Hammelech, [[H4429]] that [[H834]] in the court [[H2691]] of the prison: [[H4307]] and they let down [[H7971]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] with cords. [[H2256]] And in the dungeon [[H953]] no [[H369]] water, [[H4325]] but [[H3588]] mire: [[H2916]] so Jeremiah [[H3414]] sunk [[H2883]] in the mire. [[H2916]]

### 7
Now when Ebed-melech [[H5663]] the Ethiopian, [[H3569]] one [[H376]] of the eunuchs [[H5631]] which [[H1931]] was in the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] they had put [[H5414]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] in [[H413]] the dungeon; [[H953]] the king [[H4428]] then sitting [[H3427]] in the gate [[H8179]] of Benjamin; [[H1144]]

### 8
Ebed-melech [[H5663]] went forth [[H3318]] out of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]]

### 9
My lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] have done evil [[H7489]]  in [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they have done [[H6213]] to Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] whom [[H834]] they have cast [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the dungeon; [[H953]] and he is like to die [[H4191]] for [[H6440]] hunger [[H7458]] in the place where [[H8478]] he is: for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] more [[H5750]] bread [[H3899]] in the city. [[H5892]]

### 10
Then the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Ebed-melech [[H5663]] the Ethiopian, [[H3569]] saying, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] from hence [[H2088]] thirty [[H7970]] men [[H376]] with thee, [[H3027]] and take up [[H5927]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] out of [[H4480]] the dungeon, [[H953]] before [[H2962]] he die. [[H4191]]

### 11
So Ebed-melech [[H5663]] took [[H3947]] the men [[H376]] with him, [[H3027]] and went into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] under [[H413]] the treasury, [[H214]] and took [[H3947]] thence [[H8033]] old [[H1094]] cast clouts [[H5499]] and old [[H1094]] rotten rags, [[H4418]] and let them down [[H7971]] by cords [[H2256]] into [[H413]] the dungeon [[H953]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah. [[H3414]]

### 12
And Ebed-melech [[H5663]] the Ethiopian [[H3569]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] Put [[H7760]] now [[H4994]] old [[H1094]] cast clouts [[H5499]] and rotten rags [[H4418]] under [[H8478]] thine armholes [[H679]] under [[H8478]] the cords. [[H2256]] And Jeremiah [[H3414]] did [[H6213]] so. [[H6213]]

### 13
So they drew up [[H4900]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] with cords, [[H2256]] and took him up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the dungeon: [[H953]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] remained [[H3427]] in the court [[H2691]] of the prison. [[H4307]]

### 14
Then Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] sent, [[H7971]] and took [[H3947]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] unto [[H413]] him into [[H413]] the third [[H7992]] entry [[H3996]] that [[H834]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] I [[H589]] will ask [[H7592]] thee a thing; [[H1697]] hide [[H3582]] nothing [[H408]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 15
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Zedekiah, [[H6667]] If [[H3588]] I declare [[H5046]] unto thee, wilt thou not [[H3808]] surely [[H4191]] put me to death? [[H4191]] and if [[H3588]] I give thee counsel, [[H3289]] wilt thou not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me? [[H413]]

### 16
So Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] sware [[H7650]] secretly [[H5643]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] that [[H834]] made [[H6213]]  us [[H853]] this [[H2063]] soul, [[H5315]] I will not [[H518]] put thee to death, [[H4191]] neither [[H518]] will I give [[H5414]] thee into the hand [[H3027]] of these [[H428]] men [[H376]] that [[H834]] seek [[H1245]] thy life. [[H5315]]

### 17
Then said [[H559]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] unto [[H413]] Zedekiah, [[H6667]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] If [[H518]] thou wilt assuredly [[H3318]] go forth [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon's [[H894]] princes, [[H8269]] then thy soul [[H5315]] shall live, [[H2421]] and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] shall not [[H3808]] be burned [[H8313]] with fire; [[H784]] and thou [[H859]] shalt live, [[H2421]] and thine house: [[H1004]]

### 18
But if [[H518]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] go forth [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon's [[H894]] princes, [[H8269]] then shall this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] be given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] and they shall burn [[H8313]] it with fire, [[H784]] and thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] escape out [[H4422]] of their hand. [[H3027]]

### 19
And Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] I [[H589]] am afraid of [[H1672]] the Jews [[H3064]] that [[H834]] are fallen [[H5307]] to [[H413]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] lest [[H6435]] they deliver [[H5414]] me into their hand, [[H3027]] and they mock [[H5953]] me. [[H5953]]

### 20
But Jeremiah [[H3414]] said, [[H559]] They shall not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5414]] Obey, [[H8085]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee: so it shall be well [[H3190]] unto thee, and thy soul [[H5315]] shall live. [[H2421]]

### 21
But if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] refuse [[H3986]] to go forth, [[H3318]] this [[H2088]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath shewed [[H7200]] me: [[H7200]]

### 22
And, behold, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] the women [[H802]] that [[H834]] are left [[H7604]] in the king [[H4428]] of Judah's [[H3063]] house [[H1004]] brought forth [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon's [[H894]] princes, [[H8269]] and those [[H2007]] shall say, [[H559]] Thy friends [[H376]] have set on, [[H5496]] thee and have prevailed [[H3201]] against thee: thy feet [[H7272]] are sunk [[H2883]] in the mire, [[H1206]] they are turned away [[H5472]] back. [[H268]]

### 23
So they shall bring out [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] thy wives [[H802]] and thy children [[H1121]] to [[H413]] the Chaldeans: [[H3778]] and thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] escape out [[H4422]] of their hand, [[H3027]] but [[H3588]] shalt be taken [[H8610]] by the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon: [[H894]] and thou shalt cause this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] to be burned [[H8313]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 24
Then said [[H559]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] Let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] know [[H3045]] of these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 25
But if [[H3588]] the princes [[H8269]] hear [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] I have talked [[H1696]] with [[H854]] thee, and they come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, Declare [[H5046]] unto us now [[H4994]] what [[H4100]] thou hast said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] hide [[H3582]] it not [[H408]] from [[H4480]] us, and we will not [[H3808]] put thee to death; [[H4191]] also what [[H4100]] the king [[H4428]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee: [[H413]]

### 26
Then thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I [[H589]] presented [[H5307]] my supplication [[H8467]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] that he would not [[H1115]] cause me to return [[H7725]] to Jonathan's [[H3083]] house, [[H1004]] to die [[H4191]] there. [[H4191]]

### 27
Then came [[H935]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] and asked [[H7592]] him: and he told [[H5046]] them according to all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] had commanded. [[H6680]] So they left off speaking [[H2790]] with [[H4480]] him; for [[H3588]] the matter [[H1697]] was not [[H3808]] perceived. [[H8085]]

### 28
So Jeremiah [[H3414]] abode [[H3427]] in the court [[H2691]] of the prison [[H4307]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] was taken: [[H3920]] and he was [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] was taken. [[H3920]]
