### 1
The Lord [[H3068]] shewed [[H7200]] me, and, behold, [[H2009]] two [[H8147]] baskets [[H1736]] of figs [[H8384]] set [[H3259]] before [[H6440]] the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] after that [[H310]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had carried away captive [[H1540]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the princes [[H8269]] of Judah, [[H3063]] with [[H854]] the carpenters [[H2796]] and smiths, [[H4525]] from Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and had brought [[H935]] them to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 2
One [[H259]] basket [[H1731]] very [[H3966]] good [[H2896]] figs, [[H8384]] like the figs [[H8384]] first ripe: [[H1073]] and the other [[H259]] basket [[H1731]] very [[H3966]] naughty [[H7451]] figs, [[H8384]] which [[H834]] could not [[H3808]] be eaten, [[H398]] they were so bad. [[H7455]]

### 3
Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, What [[H4100]] seest [[H7200]] thou, [[H859]] Jeremiah? [[H3414]] And I said, [[H559]] Figs; [[H8384]] the good [[H2896]] figs, [[H8384]] very [[H3966]] good; [[H2896]] and the evil, [[H7451]] very [[H3966]] evil, [[H7451]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be eaten, [[H398]] they are so evil. [[H7455]]

### 4
Again the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 5
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Like these [[H428]] good [[H2896]] figs, [[H8384]] so [[H3651]] will I acknowledge [[H5234]] them that are carried away captive [[H1546]] of Judah, [[H3063]] whom [[H834]] I have sent [[H7971]] out of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] into the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] for good. [[H2896]]

### 6
For I will set [[H7760]] mine eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] them for good, [[H2896]] and I will bring them again [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land: [[H776]] and I will build [[H1129]] them, and not [[H3808]] pull down; [[H2040]] and I will plant [[H5193]] them, and not [[H3808]] pluck up. [[H5428]]

### 7
And I will give [[H5414]] them an heart [[H3820]] to know [[H3045]] me, that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and they shall be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] their God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] they shall return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] me with their whole [[H3605]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 8
And as the evil [[H7451]] figs, [[H8384]] which [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be eaten, [[H398]] they are so evil; [[H7455]] surely [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] So [[H3651]] will I give [[H5414]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and his princes, [[H8269]] and the residue [[H7611]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that remain [[H7604]] in this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and them that dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 9
And I will deliver [[H5414]] them to be removed [[H2113]] into all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth [[H776]] for hurt, [[H7451]] a reproach [[H2781]] and a proverb, [[H4912]] a taunt [[H8148]] and a curse, [[H7045]] in all [[H3605]] places [[H4725]] whither [[H834]] I shall drive [[H5080]] them. [[H5080]]

### 10
And I will send [[H7971]] the sword, [[H2719]] the famine, [[H7458]] and the pestilence, [[H1698]] among them, till [[H5704]] they be consumed [[H8552]] from off [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] unto them and to their fathers. [[H1]]
