### 1
In the ninth [[H8671]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] came [[H935]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and all [[H3605]] his army [[H2428]] against [[H413]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and they besieged [[H6696]] it. [[H6696]]

### 2
in the eleventh [[H6249]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah, [[H6667]] in the fourth [[H7243]] month, [[H2320]] the ninth [[H8672]] of the month, [[H2320]] the city [[H5892]] was broken up. [[H1234]]

### 3
And all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] came in, [[H935]] and sat [[H3427]] in the middle [[H8432]] gate, [[H8179]] Nergal-sharezer, [[H5371]] Samgar-nebo, [[H5562]] Sarsechim, [[H8310]] Rabsaris, [[H7249]] Nergal-sharezer, [[H5371]] Rab-mag, [[H7248]] with all [[H3605]] the residue [[H7611]] of the princes [[H8269]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 4
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] saw [[H7200]] them, and all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of war, [[H4421]] then they fled, [[H1272]] and went forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] by night, [[H3915]] by the way [[H1870]] of the king's [[H4428]] garden, [[H1588]] by the gate [[H8179]] betwixt [[H996]] the two walls: [[H2346]] and he went out [[H3318]] the way [[H1870]] of the plain. [[H6160]]

### 5
But the Chaldeans' [[H3778]] army [[H2428]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] them, and overtook [[H5381]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Jericho: [[H3405]] and when they had taken [[H3947]] him, they brought him up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] to Riblah [[H7247]] in the land [[H776]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] where he gave [[H1696]] judgment [[H4941]] upon [[H853]] him. [[H853]]

### 6
Then the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] slew [[H7819]] the sons [[H1121]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] in Riblah [[H7247]] before his eyes: [[H5869]] also the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] slew [[H7819]] all [[H3605]] the nobles [[H2715]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 7
Moreover he put out [[H5786]] Zedekiah's [[H6667]] eyes, [[H5869]] and bound [[H631]] him with chains, [[H5178]] to carry [[H935]] him to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 8
And the Chaldeans [[H3778]] burned [[H8313]] the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and the houses [[H1004]] of the people, [[H5971]] with fire, [[H784]] and brake down [[H5422]] the walls [[H2346]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 9
Then [[H227]] Nebuzar-adan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] carried away captive [[H1540]] into Babylon [[H894]] the remnant [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] that remained [[H7604]] in the city, [[H5892]] and those that fell away, [[H5307]] that [[H834]] fell [[H5307]] to [[H5921]]  him, with [[H853]] the rest [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] that remained. [[H7604]]

### 10
But Nebuzar-adan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] left [[H7604]] of the poor [[H1800]] of [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] had nothing, [[H3972]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and gave [[H5414]] them vineyards [[H3754]] and fields [[H3010]] at the same [[H1931]] time. [[H3117]]

### 11
Now Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] gave charge [[H6680]] concerning [[H5921]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] to [[H3027]] Nebuzar-adan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard, [[H2876]] saying, [[H559]]

### 12
Take [[H3947]] him, and look well [[H5869]] to [[H5921]] him, and do [[H6213]] him no [[H408]] harm; [[H3972]] but [[H3588]] do [[H6213]] unto [[H5973]] him even [[H3651]] as [[H834]] he shall say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 13
So Nebuzar-adan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] sent, [[H7971]] and Nebushasban, [[H5021]] Rabsaris, [[H7249]] and Nergal-sharezer, [[H5371]] Rab-mag, [[H7248]] and all [[H3605]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon's [[H894]] princes; [[H7227]]

### 14
Even they sent, [[H7971]] and took [[H3947]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] out of the court [[H2691]] of the prison, [[H4307]] and committed [[H5414]] him unto [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] that he should carry [[H3318]] him home: [[H1004]] so he dwelt [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 15
Now the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] while he was [[H1961]] shut up [[H6113]] in the court [[H2691]] of the prison, [[H4307]] saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Go [[H1980]] and speak [[H559]] to Ebed-melech [[H5663]] the Ethiopian, [[H3569]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] my words [[H1697]] upon [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] for evil, [[H7451]] and not [[H3808]] for good; [[H2896]] and they shall be [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 17
But I will deliver [[H5337]] thee in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] be given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the men [[H376]] of whom [[H6440]] thou [[H859]] afraid. [[H3016]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] I will surely [[H4422]] deliver [[H4422]] thee, and thou shalt not [[H3808]] fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] but thy life [[H5315]] shall be [[H1961]] for a prey [[H7998]] unto thee: because [[H3588]] thou hast put thy trust [[H982]] in me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
