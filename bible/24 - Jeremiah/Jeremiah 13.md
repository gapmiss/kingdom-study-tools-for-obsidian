### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] me, Go [[H1980]] and get [[H7069]] thee a linen [[H6593]] girdle, [[H232]] and put [[H7760]] it upon [[H5921]] thy loins, [[H4975]] and put [[H935]] it not [[H3808]] in water. [[H4325]]

### 2
So I got [[H7069]] a girdle [[H232]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and put [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] my loins. [[H4975]]

### 3
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me the second time, [[H8145]] saying, [[H559]]

### 4
Take [[H3947]] the girdle [[H232]] that [[H834]] thou hast got, [[H7069]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] thy loins, [[H4975]] and arise, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] to Euphrates, [[H6578]] and hide [[H2934]] it there [[H8033]] in a hole [[H5357]] of the rock. [[H5553]]

### 5
So I went, [[H1980]] and hid [[H2934]] it by Euphrates, [[H6578]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] me. [[H6680]]

### 6
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H7093]] many [[H7227]] days, [[H3117]] that the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Arise, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] to Euphrates, [[H6578]] and take [[H3947]] the girdle [[H232]] from thence, [[H8033]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] thee to hide [[H2934]] there. [[H2934]]

### 7
Then I went [[H1980]] to Euphrates, [[H6578]] and digged, [[H2658]] and took [[H3947]] the girdle [[H232]] from [[H4480]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] I had hid [[H2934]] it: and, behold, [[H2009]] the girdle [[H232]] was marred, [[H7843]] it was profitable [[H6743]] for nothing. [[H3808]]

### 8
Then the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 9
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] After this manner [[H3602]] will I mar [[H7843]] the pride [[H1347]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the great [[H7227]] pride [[H1347]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
This [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] people, [[H5971]] which refuse [[H3987]] to hear [[H8085]] my words, [[H1697]] which walk [[H1980]] in the imagination [[H8307]] of their heart, [[H3820]] and walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] to serve [[H5647]] them, and to worship [[H7812]] them, shall even be [[H1961]] as this [[H2088]] girdle, [[H232]] which [[H834]] is good [[H6743]] for nothing. [[H3808]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] as [[H834]] the girdle [[H232]] cleaveth [[H1692]] to [[H413]] the loins [[H4975]] of a man, [[H376]] so [[H3651]] have I caused to cleave [[H1692]] unto [[H413]]  me [[H853]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] that they might be [[H1961]] unto me for a people, [[H5971]] and for a name, [[H8034]] and for a praise, [[H8416]] and for a glory: [[H8597]] but they would not [[H3808]] hear. [[H8085]]

### 12
Therefore thou shalt speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]]  them [[H853]] this [[H2088]] word; [[H1697]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Every [[H3605]] bottle [[H5035]] shall be filled [[H4390]] with wine: [[H3196]] and they shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, Do we not [[H3808]] certainly [[H3045]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] bottle [[H5035]] shall be filled [[H4390]] with wine? [[H3196]]

### 13
Then shalt thou say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will fill [[H4390]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] even the kings [[H4428]] that sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] David's [[H1732]] throne, [[H3678]] and the priests, [[H3548]] and the prophets, [[H5030]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] with drunkenness. [[H7943]]

### 14
And I will dash [[H5310]] them one [[H376]] against [[H413]] another, [[H251]] even the fathers [[H1]] and the sons [[H1121]] together, [[H3162]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] I will not [[H3808]] pity, [[H2550]] nor [[H3808]] spare, [[H2347]] nor [[H3808]] have mercy, [[H7355]] but destroy [[H7843]] them. [[H7843]]

### 15
Hear [[H8085]] ye, and give ear; [[H238]] be not [[H408]] proud: [[H1361]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken. [[H1696]]

### 16
Give [[H5414]] glory [[H3519]] to the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] before [[H2962]] he cause darkness, [[H2821]] and before [[H2962]] your feet [[H7272]] stumble [[H5062]] upon [[H5921]] the dark [[H5399]] mountains, [[H2022]] and, while ye look [[H6960]] for light, [[H216]] he turn [[H7760]] it into the shadow of death, [[H6757]] make [[H7896]] gross darkness. [[H6205]]

### 17
But if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] it, my soul [[H5315]] shall weep [[H1058]] in secret places [[H4565]] for [[H6440]] pride; [[H1466]] and mine eye [[H5869]] shall weep [[H1830]] sore, [[H1830]] and run down [[H3381]] with tears, [[H1832]] because [[H3588]] the Lord's [[H3068]] flock [[H5739]] is carried away captive. [[H7617]]

### 18
Say [[H559]] unto the king [[H4428]] and to the queen, [[H1377]] Humble yourselves, [[H8213]] sit down: [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] your principalities [[H4761]] shall come down, [[H3381]] the crown [[H5850]] of your glory. [[H8597]]

### 19
The cities [[H5892]] of the south [[H5045]] shall be shut up, [[H5462]] and none [[H369]] shall open [[H6605]] Judah [[H3063]] shall be carried away captive [[H1540]] all [[H3605]] of it, it shall be wholly [[H7965]] carried away captive. [[H1540]]

### 20
Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes, [[H5869]] and behold [[H7200]] them that come [[H935]] from the north: [[H6828]] where [[H346]] the flock [[H5739]] was given [[H5414]] thee, thy beautiful [[H8597]] flock? [[H6629]]

### 21
What [[H4100]] wilt thou say [[H559]] when [[H3588]] he shall punish [[H6485]] thee? for thou [[H859]] hast taught [[H3925]] them captains, [[H441]] as chief [[H7218]] over [[H5921]] thee: shall not [[H3808]] sorrows [[H2256]] take [[H270]] thee, as [[H3644]] a woman [[H802]] in travail? [[H3205]]

### 22
And if [[H3588]] thou say [[H559]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] Wherefore [[H4069]] come [[H7122]] these things [[H428]] upon me? For the greatness [[H7230]] of thine iniquity [[H5771]] are thy skirts [[H7757]] discovered, [[H1540]] thy heels [[H6119]] made bare. [[H2554]]

### 23
Can the Ethiopian [[H3569]] change [[H2015]] his skin, [[H5785]] or the leopard [[H5246]] his spots? [[H2272]] may [[H3201]] ye [[H859]] also [[H1571]] do good, [[H3190]] that are accustomed [[H3928]] to do evil. [[H7489]]

### 24
Therefore will I scatter [[H6327]] them as the stubble [[H7179]] that passeth away [[H5674]] by the wind [[H7307]] of the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 25
This [[H2088]] thy lot, [[H1486]] the portion [[H4490]] of thy measures [[H4055]] from [[H853]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] because [[H834]] thou hast forgotten [[H7911]] me, and trusted [[H982]] in falsehood. [[H8267]]

### 26
Therefore [[H1571]] will I [[H589]] discover [[H2834]] thy skirts [[H7757]] upon [[H5921]] thy face, [[H6440]] that thy shame [[H7036]] may appear. [[H7200]]

### 27
I have seen [[H7200]] thine adulteries, [[H5004]] and thy neighings, [[H4684]] the lewdness [[H2154]] of thy whoredom, [[H2184]] thine abominations [[H8251]] on [[H5921]] the hills [[H1389]] in the fields. [[H7704]] Woe [[H188]] unto thee, O Jerusalem! [[H3389]] wilt thou not [[H3808]] be made clean? [[H2891]] when [[H310]] once [[H5750]]
