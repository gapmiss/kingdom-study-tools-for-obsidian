### 1
In the beginning [[H7225]] of the reign [[H4468]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] came [[H1961]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Stand [[H5975]] in the court [[H2691]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] and speak [[H1696]] unto [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which come [[H935]] to worship [[H7812]] in the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I command [[H6680]] thee to speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them; diminish [[H1639]] not [[H408]] a word: [[H1697]]

### 3
If so be [[H194]] they will hearken, [[H8085]] and turn [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] from his evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] that I may repent [[H5162]] me of [[H413]] the evil, [[H7451]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] purpose [[H2803]] to do [[H6213]] unto them because [[H6440]] of the evil [[H7455]] of their doings. [[H4611]]

### 4
And thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] If [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] to [[H413]] me, to walk [[H1980]] in my law, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] I have set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you, [[H6440]]

### 5
To hearken [[H8085]] to [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of my servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] whom [[H834]] I [[H595]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] you, both rising up early, [[H7925]] and sending [[H7971]] but ye have not [[H3808]] hearkened; [[H8085]]

### 6
Then will I make [[H5414]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] like Shiloh, [[H7887]] and will make [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] a curse [[H7045]] to all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 7
So the priests [[H3548]] and the prophets [[H5030]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] speaking [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Jeremiah [[H3414]] had made an end [[H3615]] of speaking [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] to speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] that the priests [[H3548]] and the prophets [[H5030]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] took [[H8610]] him, saying, [[H559]] Thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die. [[H4191]]

### 9
Why [[H4069]] hast thou prophesied [[H5012]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] shall be [[H1961]] like Shiloh, [[H7887]] and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] shall be desolate [[H2717]] without [[H369]] an inhabitant? [[H3427]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] were gathered [[H6950]] against [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
When the princes [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] heard [[H8085]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] then they came up [[H5927]] from the king's [[H4428]] house [[H1004]] unto the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and sat down [[H3427]] in the entry [[H6607]] of the new [[H2319]] gate [[H8179]] of the Lord's [[H3068]]

### 11
Then spake [[H559]] the priests [[H3548]] and the prophets [[H5030]] unto [[H413]] the princes [[H8269]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] man [[H376]] worthy [[H4941]] to die; [[H4194]] for [[H3588]] he hath prophesied [[H5012]] against [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] as [[H834]] ye have heard [[H8085]] with your ears. [[H241]]

### 12
Then spake [[H559]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] me to prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] and against [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] ye have heard. [[H8085]]

### 13
Therefore now [[H6258]] amend [[H3190]] your ways [[H1870]] and your doings, [[H4611]] and obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] and the Lord [[H3068]] will repent [[H5162]] him of [[H413]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] he hath pronounced [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 14
As for me, [[H589]] behold, [[H2005]] I in your hand: [[H3027]] do [[H6213]] with me as seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] and meet [[H3477]] unto you. [[H3477]]

### 15
But [[H389]] know [[H3045]] ye for certain, [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] if [[H518]] ye [[H859]] put me to death, [[H4191]] ye [[H859]] shall surely [[H3588]] bring [[H5414]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] yourselves, and upon [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and upon [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof: for [[H3588]] of a truth [[H571]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent [[H7971]] me unto [[H5921]] you to speak [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in your ears. [[H241]]

### 16
Then said [[H559]] the princes [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] the priests [[H3548]] and to [[H413]] the prophets; [[H5030]] This [[H2088]] man [[H376]] not [[H369]] worthy [[H4941]] to die: [[H4194]] for [[H3588]] he hath spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] us in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 17
Then rose up [[H6965]] certain [[H582]] of the elders [[H2205]] of the land, [[H776]] and spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the assembly [[H6951]] of the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Micah [[H4320]] the Morasthite [[H4183]] prophesied [[H5012]] in the days [[H3117]] of Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Zion [[H6726]] shall be plowed [[H2790]] a field, [[H7704]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall become [[H1961]] heaps, [[H5856]] and the mountain [[H2022]] of the house [[H1004]] as the high places [[H1116]] of a forest. [[H3293]]

### 19
Did Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] put him at all [[H4191]] to death? [[H4191]] did he not [[H3808]] fear [[H3373]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and besought [[H2470]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] repented [[H5162]] him of [[H413]] the evil [[H7451]] which [[H834]] he had pronounced [[H1696]] against them? [[H5921]] Thus might we [[H587]] procure [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] our souls. [[H5315]]

### 20
And there was [[H1961]] also [[H1571]] a man [[H376]] that prophesied [[H5012]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] Urijah [[H223]] the son [[H1121]] of Shemaiah [[H8098]] of Kirjath-jearim, [[H7157]] who prophesied [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] and against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] according to all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of Jeremiah: [[H3414]]

### 21
And when Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the king, [[H4428]] with all [[H3605]] his mighty men, [[H1368]] and all [[H3605]] the princes, [[H8269]] heard [[H8085]] his words, [[H1697]] the king [[H4428]] sought [[H1245]] to put him to death: [[H4191]] but when Urijah [[H223]] heard [[H8085]] it, he was afraid, [[H3372]] and fled, [[H1272]] and went into [[H935]] Egypt; [[H4714]]

### 22
And Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] men [[H376]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] Elnathan [[H494]] the son [[H1121]] of Achbor, [[H5907]] and men [[H376]] with [[H854]] him into [[H413]] Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 23
And they fetched forth [[H3318]] Urijah [[H223]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and brought [[H935]] him unto [[H413]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the king; [[H4428]] who slew [[H5221]] him with the sword, [[H2719]] and cast [[H7993]] his dead body [[H5038]] into [[H413]] the graves [[H6913]] of the common [[H1121]] people. [[H5971]]

### 24
Nevertheless [[H389]] the hand [[H3027]] of Ahikam [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan [[H8227]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] that they should not [[H1115]] give [[H5414]] him into the hand [[H3027]] of the people [[H5971]] to put him to death. [[H4191]]
