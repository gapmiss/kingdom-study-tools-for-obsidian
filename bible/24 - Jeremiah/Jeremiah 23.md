### 1
Woe [[H1945]] be unto the pastors [[H7462]] that destroy [[H6]] and scatter [[H6327]] the sheep [[H6629]] of my pasture! [[H4830]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] against [[H5921]] the pastors [[H7462]] that feed [[H7462]] my people; [[H5971]] Ye [[H859]] have scattered [[H6327]] my flock, [[H6629]] and driven them away, [[H5080]] and have not [[H3808]] visited [[H6485]] them: behold, [[H2005]] I will visit [[H6485]] upon [[H5921]]  you [[H853]] the evil [[H7455]] of your doings, [[H4611]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
And I [[H589]] will gather [[H6908]] the remnant [[H7611]] of my flock [[H6629]] out of all [[H3605]] countries [[H776]] whither [[H834]] I have driven [[H5080]] them, and will bring them again [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] their folds; [[H5116]] and they shall be fruitful [[H6509]] and increase. [[H7235]]

### 4
And I will set up [[H6965]] shepherds [[H7462]] over [[H5921]] them which shall feed [[H7462]] them: and they shall fear [[H3372]] no [[H3808]] more, [[H5750]] nor [[H3808]] be dismayed, [[H2865]] neither [[H3808]] shall they be lacking, [[H6485]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will raise [[H6965]] unto David [[H1732]] a righteous [[H6662]] Branch, [[H6780]] and a King [[H4428]] shall reign [[H4427]] and prosper, [[H7919]] and shall execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] and justice [[H6666]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 6
In his days [[H3117]] Judah [[H3063]] shall be saved, [[H3467]] and Israel [[H3478]] shall dwell [[H7931]] safely: [[H983]] and this [[H2088]] his name [[H8034]] whereby [[H834]] he shall be called, [[H7121]] THE LORD [[H3068]] OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. [[H6664]]

### 7
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that they shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] say, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] which [[H834]] brought up [[H5927]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]]

### 8
But, [[H3588]] The Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] which [[H834]] brought up [[H5927]] and which [[H834]] led [[H935]] the seed [[H2233]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of the north [[H6828]] country, [[H776]] and from all [[H3605]] countries [[H776]] whither [[H834]] I had driven [[H5080]] them; and they shall dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] their own land. [[H127]]

### 9
Mine heart [[H3820]] within [[H7130]] me is broken [[H7665]] because of the prophets; [[H5030]] all [[H3605]] my bones [[H6106]] shake; [[H7363]] I am [[H1961]] like a drunken [[H7910]] man, [[H376]] and like a man [[H1397]] whom wine [[H3196]] hath overcome, [[H5674]] because [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and because [[H6440]] of the words [[H1697]] of his holiness. [[H6944]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] is full [[H4390]] of adulterers; [[H5003]] for [[H3588]] because [[H6440]] of swearing [[H423]] the land [[H776]] mourneth; [[H56]] the pleasant places [[H4999]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] are dried up, [[H3001]] and their course [[H4794]] is [[H1961]] evil, [[H7451]] and their force [[H1369]] not [[H3808]] right. [[H3808]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] both [[H1571]] prophet [[H5030]] and [[H1571]] priest [[H3548]] are profane; [[H2610]] yea, [[H1571]] in my house [[H1004]] have I found [[H4672]] their wickedness, [[H7451]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
Wherefore [[H3651]] their way [[H1870]] shall be [[H1961]] unto them as slippery [[H2519]] in the darkness: [[H653]] they shall be driven on, [[H1760]] and fall [[H5307]] therein: for [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] them, the year [[H8141]] of their visitation, [[H6486]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And I have seen [[H7200]] folly [[H8604]] in the prophets [[H5030]] of Samaria; [[H8111]] they prophesied [[H5012]] in Baal, [[H1168]]  and caused [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] to err. [[H8582]]

### 14
I have seen [[H7200]] also in the prophets [[H5030]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] an horrible thing: [[H8186]] they commit adultery, [[H5003]] and walk [[H1980]] in lies: [[H8267]] they strengthen [[H2388]] also the hands [[H3027]] of evildoers, [[H7489]] that none [[H376]] doth return [[H7725]] from his wickedness: [[H7451]] they are [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] of them unto me as Sodom, [[H5467]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof as Gomorrah. [[H6017]]

### 15
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] concerning [[H5921]] the prophets; [[H5030]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will feed [[H398]] them with wormwood, [[H3939]] and make them drink [[H8248]] the water [[H4325]] of gall: [[H7219]] for [[H3588]] from [[H853]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] is profaneness [[H2613]] gone forth [[H3318]] into all [[H3605]] the land. [[H776]]

### 16
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] unto [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of the prophets [[H5030]] that prophesy [[H5012]] unto you: they make you vain: [[H1891]] they [[H1992]] speak [[H1696]] a vision [[H2377]] of their own heart, [[H3820]] not [[H3808]] out of the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
They say [[H559]] still [[H559]] unto them that despise [[H5006]] me, The Lord [[H3068]] hath said, [[H1696]] Ye shall have [[H1961]] peace; [[H7965]] and they say [[H559]] unto every one [[H3605]] that walketh [[H1980]] after the imagination [[H8307]] of his own heart, [[H3820]] No [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] hath stood [[H5975]] in the counsel [[H5475]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and hath perceived [[H7200]] and heard [[H8085]] his word? [[H1697]] who [[H4310]] hath marked [[H7181]] his word, [[H1697]] and heard [[H8085]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2009]] a whirlwind [[H5591]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is gone forth [[H3318]] in fury, [[H2534]] even a grievous [[H2342]] whirlwind: [[H5591]] it shall fall grievously [[H2342]] upon [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 20
The anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall not [[H3808]] return, [[H7725]] until [[H5704]] he have executed, [[H6213]] and till [[H5704]] he have performed [[H6965]] the thoughts [[H4209]] of his heart: [[H3820]] in the latter [[H319]] days [[H3117]] ye shall consider [[H995]] it perfectly. [[H998]]

### 21
I have not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] these prophets, [[H5030]] yet they [[H1992]] ran: [[H7323]] I have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] them, yet they [[H1992]] prophesied. [[H5012]]

### 22
But if [[H518]] they had stood [[H5975]] in my counsel, [[H5475]]  and had caused [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] to hear [[H8085]] my words, [[H1697]] then they should have turned [[H7725]] them from their evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] and from the evil [[H7455]] of their doings. [[H4611]]

### 23
I [[H589]] a God [[H430]] at hand, [[H7138]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and not [[H3808]] a God [[H430]] afar off? [[H7350]]

### 24
Can [[H518]] any [[H376]] hide himself [[H5641]] in secret places [[H4565]] that I [[H589]] shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] him? saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]] Do not [[H3808]] I [[H589]] fill [[H4390]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth? [[H776]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 25
I have heard [[H8085]] what [[H834]] the prophets [[H5030]] said, [[H559]] that prophesy [[H5012]] lies [[H8267]] in my name, [[H8034]] saying, [[H559]] I have dreamed, [[H2492]] I have dreamed. [[H2492]]

### 26
How long [[H5704]] shall be [[H3426]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the prophets [[H5030]] that prophesy [[H5012]] lies? [[H8267]] yea, prophets [[H5030]] of the deceit [[H8649]] of their own heart; [[H3820]]

### 27
Which think [[H2803]]  to cause [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] to forget [[H7911]] my name [[H8034]] by their dreams [[H2472]] which [[H834]] they tell [[H5608]] every man [[H376]] to his neighbour, [[H7453]] as [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] have forgotten [[H7911]] my name [[H8034]] for Baal. [[H1168]]

### 28
The prophet [[H5030]] that [[H834]] hath a dream, [[H2472]] let him tell [[H5608]] a dream; [[H2472]] and he that [[H834]] hath my word, [[H1697]] let him speak [[H1696]] my word [[H1697]] faithfully. [[H571]] What [[H4100]] the chaff [[H8401]] to [[H854]] the wheat? [[H1250]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 29
not [[H3808]] my word [[H1697]] like [[H3541]] as a fire? [[H784]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and like a hammer [[H6360]] breaketh pieces? [[H6327]] the rock [[H5553]] in [[H5553]]

### 30
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H5921]] the prophets, [[H5030]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that steal [[H1589]] my words [[H1697]] every one [[H376]] from [[H853]] his neighbour. [[H7453]]

### 31
Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H5921]] the prophets, [[H5030]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that use [[H3947]] their tongues, [[H3956]] and say, [[H5001]] He saith. [[H5002]]

### 32
Behold, [[H2005]] I against [[H5921]] them that prophesy [[H5012]] false [[H8267]] dreams, [[H2472]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and do tell [[H5608]]  them, and cause [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] to err [[H8582]] by their lies, [[H8267]] and by their lightness; [[H6350]] yet I [[H595]] sent [[H7971]] them not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] commanded [[H6680]] them: therefore they shall not [[H3808]] profit [[H3276]] this people [[H5971]] at all, [[H3276]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 33
And when [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] or [[H176]] the prophet, [[H5030]] or [[H176]] a priest, [[H3548]] shall ask [[H7592]] thee, saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] the burden [[H4853]] of the Lord? [[H3068]] thou shalt then say [[H559]] unto [[H413]]  them, [[H853]] What [[H4100]] burden? [[H4853]] I will even forsake [[H5203]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 34
And the prophet, [[H5030]] and the priest, [[H3548]] and the people, [[H5971]] that [[H834]] shall say, [[H559]] The burden [[H4853]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] I will even punish [[H6485]] that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] and his house. [[H1004]]

### 35
Thus [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] every one [[H376]] to [[H5921]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] and every one [[H376]] to [[H413]] his brother, [[H251]] What [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] answered? [[H6030]] and, What [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] spoken? [[H1696]]

### 36
And the burden [[H4853]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall ye mention [[H2142]] no [[H3808]] more: [[H5750]] for [[H3588]] every man's [[H376]] word [[H1697]] shall be [[H1961]] his burden; [[H4853]] for ye have perverted [[H2015]] the words [[H1697]] of the living [[H2416]] God, [[H430]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] our God. [[H430]]

### 37
Thus [[H3541]] shalt thou say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the prophet, [[H5030]] What [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] thee? and, What [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] spoken? [[H1696]]

### 38
But since [[H518]] ye say, [[H559]] The burden [[H4853]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Because [[H3282]] ye say [[H559]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] The burden [[H4853]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and I have sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] you, saying, [[H559]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] say, [[H559]] The burden [[H4853]] of the Lord; [[H3068]]

### 39
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I, even I, will utterly [[H5377]] forget [[H5382]] you, and I will forsake [[H5203]] you, and the city [[H5892]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] you and your fathers, [[H1]] out of [[H5921]] my presence: [[H6440]]

### 40
And I will bring [[H5414]] an everlasting [[H5769]] reproach [[H2781]] upon [[H5921]] you, and a perpetual [[H5769]] shame, [[H3640]] which [[H834]] shall not [[H3808]] be forgotten. [[H7911]]
