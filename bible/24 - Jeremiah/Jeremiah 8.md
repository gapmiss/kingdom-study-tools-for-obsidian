### 1
At that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] they shall bring out [[H3318]] the bones [[H6106]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the bones [[H6106]] of his princes, [[H8269]] and the bones [[H6106]] of the priests, [[H3548]] and the bones [[H6106]] of the prophets, [[H5030]] and the bones [[H6106]] of the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] out of their graves: [[H6913]]

### 2
And they shall spread [[H7849]] them before the sun, [[H8121]] and the moon, [[H3394]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven, [[H8064]] whom [[H834]] they have loved, [[H157]] and whom [[H834]] they have served, [[H5647]] and after [[H310]] whom [[H834]] they have walked, [[H1980]] and whom [[H834]] they have sought, [[H1875]] and whom [[H834]] they have worshipped: [[H7812]] they shall not [[H3808]] be gathered, [[H622]] nor [[H3808]] be buried; [[H6912]] they shall be [[H1961]] for dung [[H1828]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 3
And death [[H4194]] shall be chosen [[H977]] rather than life [[H2416]] by all [[H3605]] the residue [[H7611]] of them that remain [[H7604]] of [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] family, [[H4940]] which remain [[H7604]] in all [[H3605]] the places [[H4725]] whither [[H834]] I have driven [[H5080]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 4
Moreover thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Shall they fall, [[H5307]] and not [[H3808]] arise? [[H6965]] shall he turn away, [[H7725]] and not [[H3808]] return? [[H7725]]

### 5
Why [[H4069]] is this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] slidden back [[H7725]] by a perpetual [[H5329]] backsliding? [[H4878]] they hold fast [[H2388]] deceit, [[H8649]] they refuse [[H3985]] to return. [[H7725]]

### 6
I hearkened [[H7181]] and heard, [[H8085]] they spake aright: [[H1696]] not [[H3808]] no [[H369]] man [[H376]] repented [[H5162]] him of [[H5921]] his wickedness, [[H7451]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have I done? [[H6213]] every one [[H3605]] turned [[H7725]] to his course, [[H4794]] as the horse [[H5483]] rusheth [[H7857]] into the battle. [[H4421]]

### 7
Yea, [[H1571]] the stork [[H2624]] in the heaven [[H8064]] knoweth [[H3045]] her appointed times; [[H4150]] and the turtle [[H8449]] and the crane [[H5483]] and the swallow [[H5693]] observe [[H8104]] the time [[H6256]] of their coming; [[H935]] but my people [[H5971]] know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the judgment [[H4941]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
How [[H349]] do ye say, [[H559]] We [[H587]] wise, [[H2450]] and the law [[H8451]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H854]] us? Lo, [[H2009]] certainly [[H403]] in vain [[H8267]] made [[H6213]] he the pen [[H5842]] of the scribes [[H5608]] in vain. [[H8267]]

### 9
The wise [[H2450]] are ashamed, [[H954]] they are dismayed [[H2865]] and taken: [[H3920]] lo, [[H2009]] they have rejected [[H3988]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and what [[H4100]] wisdom [[H2451]] in them? [[H2451]]

### 10
Therefore [[H3651]] will I give [[H5414]] their wives [[H802]] unto others, [[H312]] their fields [[H7704]] to them that shall inherit [[H3423]] for [[H3588]] every one [[H3605]] from the least [[H6996]] even unto [[H5704]] the greatest [[H1419]] is given [[H1214]] to covetousness, [[H1215]] from the prophet [[H5030]] even unto [[H5704]] the priest [[H3548]] every one [[H3605]] dealeth [[H6213]] falsely. [[H8267]]

### 11
For they have healed [[H7495]] the hurt [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] slightly, [[H7043]] saying, [[H559]] Peace, [[H7965]] peace; [[H7965]] when no [[H369]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 12
Were they ashamed [[H3001]] when [[H3588]] they had committed [[H6213]] abomination? [[H8441]] nay, [[H1571]] they were not [[H3808]] at all [[H954]] ashamed, [[H954]] neither [[H3808]] could [[H3045]] they blush: [[H3637]] therefore [[H3651]] shall they fall [[H5307]] among them that fall: [[H5307]] in the time [[H6256]] of their visitation [[H6486]] they shall be cast down, [[H3782]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
I will surely [[H622]] consume [[H5486]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] no [[H369]] grapes [[H6025]] on the vine, [[H1612]] nor [[H369]] figs [[H8384]] on the fig tree, [[H8384]] and the leaf [[H5929]] shall fade; [[H5034]] and I have given [[H5414]] them shall pass away [[H5674]] from them. [[H5674]]

### 14
Why [[H4100]] do we [[H587]] sit still? [[H3427]] assemble yourselves, [[H622]] and let us enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the defenced [[H4013]] cities, [[H5892]] and let us be silent [[H1826]] there: [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] hath put us to silence, [[H1826]] and given us water [[H4325]] of gall [[H7219]] to drink, [[H8248]] because [[H3588]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
We looked [[H6960]] for peace, [[H7965]] but no [[H369]] good [[H2896]] for a time [[H6256]] of health, [[H4832]] and behold [[H2009]] trouble! [[H1205]]

### 16
The snorting [[H5170]] of his horses [[H5483]] was heard [[H8085]] from Dan: [[H1835]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] trembled [[H7493]] at the sound [[H6963]] of the neighing [[H4684]] of his strong ones; [[H47]] for they are come, [[H935]] and have devoured [[H398]] the land, [[H776]] and all [[H4393]] that is in it; the city, [[H5892]] and those that dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 17
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] serpents, [[H5175]] cockatrices, [[H6848]] among you, which [[H834]] not [[H369]] charmed, [[H3908]] and they shall bite [[H5391]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
I would comfort [[H4010]] myself against [[H5921]] sorrow, [[H3015]] my heart [[H3820]] faint [[H1742]] in [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 19
Behold [[H2009]] the voice [[H6963]] of the cry [[H7775]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] because of them that dwell in a far [[H4801]] country: [[H776]] not [[H369]] the Lord [[H3068]] in Zion? [[H6726]] not [[H369]] her king [[H4428]] in her? Why [[H4069]] have they provoked me to anger [[H3707]] with their graven images, [[H6456]] with strange [[H5236]] vanities? [[H1892]]

### 20
The harvest [[H7105]] is past, [[H5674]] the summer [[H7019]] is ended, [[H3615]] and we [[H587]] are not [[H3808]] saved. [[H3467]]

### 21
For [[H5921]] the hurt [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] am I hurt; [[H7665]] I am black; [[H6937]] astonishment [[H8047]] hath taken hold [[H2388]] on me. [[H2388]]

### 22
no [[H369]] balm [[H6875]] in Gilead; [[H1568]] no [[H369]] physician [[H7495]] there? [[H8033]] why [[H4069]] then [[H3588]] is not [[H3808]] the health [[H724]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] recovered? [[H5927]]
