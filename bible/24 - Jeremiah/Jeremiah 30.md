### 1
The word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] speaketh [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Write [[H3789]]  thee [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee in [[H413]] a book. [[H5612]]

### 3
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I will bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of my people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] saith [[H559]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and I will cause them to return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to their fathers, [[H1]] and they shall possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 4
And these [[H428]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] concerning [[H413]] Israel [[H3478]] and concerning [[H413]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] We have heard [[H8085]] a voice [[H6963]] of trembling, [[H2731]] of fear, [[H6343]] and not [[H369]] of peace. [[H7965]]

### 6
Ask [[H7592]] ye now, [[H4994]] and see [[H7200]] whether [[H518]] a man [[H2145]] doth travail with child? [[H3205]] wherefore [[H4069]] do I see [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] man [[H1397]] with his hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] his loins, [[H2504]] as a woman in travail, [[H3205]] and all [[H3605]] faces [[H6440]] are turned [[H2015]] into paleness? [[H3420]]

### 7
Alas! [[H1945]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] great, [[H1419]] so that none [[H369]] like it: [[H3644]] it [[H1931]] even the time [[H6256]] of Jacob's [[H3290]] trouble; [[H6869]] but he shall be saved [[H3467]] out of it. [[H4480]]

### 8
For it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] I will break [[H7665]] his yoke [[H5923]] from off [[H5921]] thy neck, [[H6677]] and will burst [[H5423]] thy bonds, [[H4147]] and strangers [[H2114]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] serve [[H5647]] themselves of him: [[H5647]]

### 9
But they shall serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and David [[H1732]] their king, [[H4428]] whom [[H834]] I will raise up [[H6965]] unto them. [[H6965]]

### 10
Therefore fear [[H3372]] thou [[H859]] not, [[H408]] O my servant [[H5650]] Jacob, [[H3290]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] neither [[H408]] be dismayed, [[H2865]] O Israel: [[H3478]] for, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2005]] I will save [[H3467]] thee from afar, [[H7350]] and thy seed [[H2233]] from the land [[H776]] of their captivity; [[H7628]] and Jacob [[H3290]] shall return, [[H7725]] and shall be in rest, [[H8252]] and be quiet, [[H7599]] and none [[H369]] shall make afraid. [[H2729]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to save [[H3467]] thee: though [[H3588]] I make [[H6213]] a full end [[H3617]] of all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] I have scattered [[H6327]] thee, yet [[H389]] will I not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] a full end [[H3617]] of thee: but I will correct [[H3256]] thee in measure, [[H4941]] and will not [[H3808]] leave thee altogether [[H5352]] unpunished. [[H5352]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Thy bruise [[H7667]] incurable, [[H605]] thy wound [[H4347]] grievous. [[H2470]]

### 13
none [[H369]] to plead [[H1777]] thy cause, [[H1779]] that thou mayest be bound up: [[H4205]] thou hast no [[H369]] healing [[H8585]] medicines. [[H7499]]

### 14
All [[H3605]] thy lovers [[H157]] have forgotten [[H7911]] thee; they seek [[H1875]] thee not; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] I have wounded [[H5221]] thee with the wound [[H4347]] of an enemy, [[H341]] with the chastisement [[H4148]] of a cruel one, [[H394]] for [[H5921]] the multitude [[H7230]] of thine iniquity; [[H5771]] thy sins [[H2403]] were increased. [[H6105]]

### 15
Why [[H4100]] criest [[H2199]] thou for [[H5921]] thine affliction? [[H7667]] thy sorrow [[H4341]] incurable [[H605]] for [[H5921]] the multitude [[H7230]] of thine iniquity: [[H5771]] thy sins [[H2403]] were increased, [[H6105]] I have done [[H6213]] these [[H428]] things unto thee. [[H428]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] all [[H3605]] they that devour [[H398]] thee shall be devoured; [[H398]] and all [[H3605]] thine adversaries, [[H6862]] every one [[H3605]] of them, shall go [[H1980]] into captivity; [[H7628]] and they that spoil [[H7601]] thee shall be [[H1961]] a spoil, [[H4933]] and all [[H3605]] that prey [[H962]] upon thee will I give [[H5414]] for a prey. [[H957]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] I will restore [[H5927]] health [[H724]] unto thee, and I will heal [[H7495]] thee of thy wounds, [[H4347]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] they called [[H7121]] thee an Outcast, [[H5080]] This [[H1931]] Zion, [[H6726]] whom no [[H369]] man seeketh after. [[H1875]]

### 18
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Jacob's [[H3290]] tents, [[H168]] and have mercy [[H7355]] on his dwellingplaces; [[H4908]] and the city [[H5892]] shall be builded [[H1129]] upon [[H5921]] her own heap, [[H8510]] and the palace [[H759]] shall remain [[H3427]] after [[H5921]] the manner [[H4941]] thereof. [[H4941]]

### 19
And out of them shall proceed [[H3318]] thanksgiving [[H8426]] and the voice [[H6963]] of them that make merry: [[H7832]] and I will multiply [[H7235]] them, and they shall not [[H3808]] be few; [[H4591]] I will also glorify [[H3513]] them, and they shall not [[H3808]] be small. [[H6819]]

### 20
Their children [[H1121]] also shall be [[H1961]] as aforetime, [[H6924]] and their congregation [[H5712]] shall be established [[H3559]] before [[H6440]] me, and I will punish [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] that oppress [[H3905]] them. [[H3905]]

### 21
And their nobles [[H117]] shall be [[H1961]] of [[H4480]] themselves, and their governor [[H4910]] shall proceed [[H3318]] from the midst [[H7130]] of them; and I will cause him to draw near, [[H7126]] and he shall approach [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] me: for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] this [[H2088]] that [[H1931]] engaged [[H6148]] his heart [[H3820]] to approach [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] me? saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
And ye shall be [[H1961]] my people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] your God. [[H430]]

### 23
Behold, [[H2009]] the whirlwind [[H5591]] of the Lord [[H3068]] goeth forth [[H3318]] with fury, [[H2534]] a continuing [[H1641]] whirlwind: [[H5591]] it shall fall with pain [[H2342]] upon [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 24
The fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall not [[H3808]] return, [[H7725]] until [[H5704]] he have done [[H6213]] and until [[H5704]] he have performed [[H6965]] the intents [[H4209]] of his heart: [[H3820]] in the latter [[H319]] days [[H3117]] ye shall consider [[H995]] it.
