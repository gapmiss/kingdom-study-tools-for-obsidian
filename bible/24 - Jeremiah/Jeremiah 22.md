### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Go down [[H3381]] to the house [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and speak [[H1696]] there [[H8033]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]]

### 2
And say, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] O king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that sittest [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David, [[H1732]] thou, [[H859]] and thy servants, [[H5650]] and thy people [[H5971]] that enter [[H935]] in by these [[H428]] gates: [[H8179]]

### 3
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Execute [[H6213]] ye judgment [[H4941]] and righteousness, [[H6666]] and deliver [[H5337]] the spoiled [[H1497]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the oppressor: [[H6216]] and do no [[H408]] wrong, [[H3238]] do no [[H408]] violence [[H2554]] to the stranger, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] nor the widow, [[H490]] neither [[H408]] shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] ye do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] indeed, [[H6213]] then shall there enter in [[H935]] by the gates [[H8179]] of this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] kings [[H4428]] sitting [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David, [[H1732]] riding [[H7392]] in chariots [[H7393]] and on horses, [[H5483]] he, [[H1931]] and his servants, [[H5650]] and his people. [[H5971]]

### 5
But if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] I swear [[H7650]] by myself, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] shall become [[H1961]] a desolation. [[H2723]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H5921]] the king's [[H4428]] house [[H1004]] of Judah; [[H3063]] Thou [[H859]] Gilead [[H1568]] unto me, the head [[H7218]] of Lebanon: [[H3844]] surely [[H518]] I will make [[H7896]] thee a wilderness, [[H4057]] cities [[H5892]] are not [[H3808]] inhabited. [[H3427]]

### 7
And I will prepare [[H6942]] destroyers [[H7843]] against [[H5921]] thee, every one [[H376]] with his weapons: [[H3627]] and they shall cut down [[H3772]] thy choice [[H4005]] cedars, [[H730]] and cast [[H5307]] into [[H5921]] the fire. [[H784]]

### 8
And many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] shall pass [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] and they shall say [[H559]] every man [[H376]] to [[H413]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] Wherefore [[H5921]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] thus [[H3602]] unto this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] city? [[H5892]]

### 9
Then they shall answer, [[H559]] Because [[H5921]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and worshipped [[H7812]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and served [[H5647]] them. [[H5647]]

### 10
Weep [[H1058]] ye not [[H408]] for the dead, [[H4191]] neither [[H408]] bemoan [[H5110]] him: weep [[H1058]] sore [[H1058]] for him that goeth away: [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] he shall return [[H7725]] no [[H3808]] more, [[H5750]] nor see [[H7200]] his native [[H4138]] country. [[H776]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] touching [[H413]] Shallum [[H7967]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which reigned [[H4427]] instead [[H8478]] of Josiah [[H2977]] his father, [[H1]] which [[H834]] went forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place; [[H4725]] He shall not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] thither [[H8033]] any more: [[H8033]]

### 12
But [[H3588]] he shall die [[H4191]] in the place [[H4725]] whither [[H834]] they have led him captive, [[H1540]] and shall see [[H7200]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H3808]]

### 13
Woe [[H1945]] unto him that buildeth [[H1129]] his house [[H1004]] by unrighteousness, [[H6664]] and his chambers [[H5944]] by wrong; [[H4941]] useth his neighbour's [[H7453]] service [[H5647]] without wages, [[H2600]] and giveth [[H5414]] him not [[H3808]] for his work; [[H6467]]

### 14
That saith, [[H559]] I will build [[H1129]] me a wide [[H4060]] house [[H1004]] and large [[H7304]] chambers, [[H5944]] and cutteth him out [[H7167]] windows; [[H2474]] and cieled [[H5603]] with cedar, [[H730]] and painted [[H4886]] with vermilion. [[H8350]]

### 15
Shalt thou reign, [[H4427]] because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] closest [[H8474]] in cedar? [[H730]] did not [[H3808]] thy father [[H1]] eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and do [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] and justice, [[H6666]] then [[H227]] well [[H2896]] with him? [[H2896]]

### 16
He judged [[H1777]] the cause [[H1779]] of the poor [[H6041]] and needy; [[H34]] then [[H227]] well [[H2896]] not [[H3808]] this [[H1931]] to know [[H1847]] me? saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
But [[H3588]] thine eyes [[H5869]] and thine heart [[H3820]] not [[H369]] but for [[H3588]] thy covetousness, [[H1215]] and for [[H5921]] to shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]] and for [[H5921]] oppression, [[H6233]] and for [[H5921]] violence, [[H4835]] to do [[H6213]]

### 18
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] concerning [[H413]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah; [[H3063]] They shall not [[H3808]] lament [[H5594]] for him, Ah [[H1945]] my brother! [[H251]] or, Ah [[H1945]] sister! [[H269]] they shall not [[H3808]] lament [[H5594]] for him, Ah [[H1945]] lord! [[H113]] or, Ah [[H1945]] his glory! [[H1935]]

### 19
He shall be buried [[H6912]] with the burial [[H6900]] of an ass, [[H2543]] drawn [[H5498]] and cast forth [[H7993]] beyond [[H1973]] the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 20
Go up [[H5927]] to Lebanon, [[H3844]] and cry; [[H6817]] and lift up [[H5414]] thy voice [[H6963]] in Bashan, [[H1316]] and cry [[H6817]] from the passages: [[H5676]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] thy lovers [[H157]] are destroyed. [[H7665]]

### 21
I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee in thy prosperity; [[H7962]] thou saidst, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] hear. [[H8085]] This [[H2088]] thy manner [[H1870]] from thy youth, [[H5271]] that [[H3588]] thou obeyedst [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] my voice. [[H6963]]

### 22
The wind [[H7307]] shall eat up [[H7462]] all [[H3605]] thy pastors, [[H7462]] and thy lovers [[H157]] shall go [[H1980]] into captivity: [[H7628]] surely [[H3588]] then [[H227]] shalt thou be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded [[H3637]] for all [[H3605]] thy wickedness. [[H7451]]

### 23
O inhabitant [[H3427]] of Lebanon, [[H3844]] that makest thy nest [[H7077]] in the cedars, [[H730]] how [[H4100]] gracious [[H2603]] shalt thou be when pangs [[H2256]] come [[H935]] upon thee, the pain [[H2427]] as of a woman in travail! [[H3205]]

### 24
I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] though [[H3588]] Coniah [[H3659]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] were [[H1961]] the signet [[H2368]] upon [[H5921]] my right [[H3225]] hand, [[H3027]] yet [[H3588]] would I pluck [[H5423]] thee thence; [[H5423]]

### 25
And I will give [[H5414]] thee into the hand [[H3027]] of them that seek [[H1245]] thy life, [[H5315]] and into the hand [[H3027]] whose [[H834]] face [[H6440]] thou [[H859]] fearest, [[H3016]] even into the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and into the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 26
And I will cast thee out, [[H2904]] and thy mother [[H517]] that [[H834]] bare [[H3205]] thee, into [[H5921]] another [[H312]] country, [[H776]] where [[H834]] ye were not [[H3808]] born; [[H3205]] and there [[H8033]] shall ye die. [[H4191]]

### 27
But to [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] whereunto [[H834]] they [[H1992]] desire [[H5375]] to return, [[H7725]] thither [[H8033]] shall they not [[H3808]] return. [[H7725]]

### 28
this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] Coniah [[H3659]] a despised [[H959]] broken [[H5310]] idol? [[H6089]] a vessel [[H3627]] wherein no [[H369]] pleasure? [[H2656]] wherefore [[H4069]] are they cast out, [[H7993]] he [[H1931]] and his seed, [[H2233]] and are cast [[H2904]] into [[H5921]] a land [[H776]] which [[H834]] they know [[H3045]] not? [[H3045]]

### 29
O earth, [[H776]] earth, [[H776]] earth, [[H776]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 30
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Write [[H3789]]  ye [[H853]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] childless, [[H6185]] a man [[H1397]] shall not [[H3808]] prosper [[H6743]] in his days: [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] of his seed [[H2233]] shall prosper, [[H6743]] sitting [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David, [[H1732]] and ruling [[H4910]] any more [[H5750]] in Judah.
