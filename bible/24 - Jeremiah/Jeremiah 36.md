### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Take [[H3947]] thee a roll [[H4039]] of a book, [[H5612]] and write [[H3789]] therein [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee against [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and against [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H1471]] from the day [[H3117]] I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee, from the days [[H3117]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] even unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 3
It may be that [[H194]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] will hear [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] purpose [[H2803]] to do [[H6213]] unto them; that [[H4616]] they may return [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] from his evil [[H7451]] way; [[H1870]] that I may forgive [[H5545]] their iniquity [[H5771]] and their sin. [[H2403]]

### 4
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] called [[H7121]] Baruch [[H1263]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah: [[H5374]] and Baruch [[H1263]] wrote [[H3789]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he had spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, upon [[H5921]] a roll [[H4039]] of a book. [[H5612]]

### 5
And Jeremiah [[H3414]] commanded [[H6680]] Baruch, [[H1263]] saying, [[H559]] I [[H589]] shut up; [[H6113]] I cannot [[H3201]] go [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 6
Therefore go [[H935]] thou, [[H859]] and read [[H7121]] in the roll, [[H4039]] which [[H834]] thou hast written [[H3789]] from my mouth, [[H6310]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the ears [[H241]] of the people [[H5971]] in the Lord's [[H3068]] house [[H1004]] upon the fasting [[H6685]] day: [[H3117]] and also [[H1571]] thou shalt read [[H7121]] them in the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] that come out [[H935]] of their cities. [[H5892]]

### 7
It may be [[H194]] they will present [[H5307]] their supplication [[H8467]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and will return [[H7725]] every one [[H376]] from his evil [[H7451]] way: [[H1870]] for [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] the anger [[H639]] and the fury [[H2534]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath pronounced [[H1696]] against [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]

### 8
And Baruch [[H1263]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah [[H5374]] did [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] commanded [[H6680]] him, reading [[H7121]] in the book [[H5612]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the Lord's [[H3068]] house. [[H1004]]

### 9
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in the ninth [[H8671]] month, [[H2320]] they proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast [[H6685]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] to all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and to all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that came [[H935]] from the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] unto Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
Then read [[H7121]] Baruch [[H1263]] in the book [[H5612]] the words [[H1697]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] in the chamber [[H3957]] of Gemariah [[H1587]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] in the higher [[H5945]] court, [[H2691]] at the entry [[H6607]] of the new [[H2319]] gate [[H8179]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] in the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 11
When Michaiah [[H4321]] the son [[H1121]] of Gemariah, [[H1587]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] had heard [[H8085]] out of [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 12
Then he went down into [[H3381]] the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] into [[H5921]] the scribe's [[H5608]] chamber: [[H3957]] and, lo, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] sat [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] Elishama [[H476]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Delaiah [[H1806]] the son [[H1121]] of Shemaiah, [[H8098]] and Elnathan [[H494]] the son [[H1121]] of Achbor, [[H5907]] and Gemariah [[H1587]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] and Zedekiah [[H6667]] the son [[H1121]] of Hananiah, [[H2608]] and all [[H3605]] the princes. [[H8269]]

### 13
Then Michaiah [[H4321]] declared [[H5046]]  unto them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he had heard, [[H8085]] when Baruch [[H1263]] read [[H7121]] the book [[H5612]] in the ears [[H241]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 14
Therefore all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] sent [[H7971]] Jehudi [[H3065]] the son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] the son [[H1121]] of Shelemiah, [[H8018]] the son [[H1121]] of Cushi, [[H3570]] unto [[H413]] Baruch, [[H1263]] saying, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] in thine hand [[H3027]] the roll [[H4039]] wherein [[H834]] thou hast read [[H7121]] in the ears [[H241]] of the people, [[H5971]] and come. [[H1980]] So Baruch [[H1263]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah [[H5374]] took [[H3947]] the roll [[H4039]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 15
And they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Sit down [[H3427]] now, [[H4994]] and read [[H7121]] it in our ears. [[H241]] So Baruch [[H1263]] read [[H7121]] in their ears. [[H241]]

### 16
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they had heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the words, [[H1697]] they were afraid [[H6342]] both [[H413]] one [[H376]] and other, [[H7453]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Baruch, [[H1263]] We will surely [[H5046]] tell [[H5046]] the king [[H4428]]  of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words. [[H1697]]

### 17
And they asked [[H7592]] Baruch, [[H1263]] saying, [[H559]] Tell [[H5046]] us now, [[H4994]] How [[H349]] didst thou write [[H3789]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] at his mouth? [[H6310]]

### 18
Then Baruch [[H1263]] answered [[H559]] them, He pronounced [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] me with his mouth, [[H6310]] and I [[H589]] wrote [[H3789]] with ink [[H1773]] in [[H5921]] the book. [[H5612]]

### 19
Then said [[H559]] the princes [[H8269]] unto [[H413]] Baruch, [[H1263]] Go, [[H1980]] hide [[H5641]] thee, thou [[H859]] and Jeremiah; [[H3414]] and let no [[H408]] man [[H376]] know [[H3045]] where [[H375]] ye be. [[H375]]

### 20
And they went in [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] into the court, [[H2691]] but they laid up [[H6485]] the roll [[H4039]] in the chamber [[H3957]] of Elishama [[H476]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and told [[H5046]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] in the ears [[H241]] of the king. [[H4428]]

### 21
So the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] Jehudi [[H3065]] to fetch [[H3947]] the roll: [[H4039]] and he took [[H3947]] it out of Elishama [[H476]] the scribe's [[H5608]] chamber. [[H3957]] And Jehudi [[H3065]] read [[H7121]] it in the ears [[H241]] of the king, [[H4428]] and in the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] which stood [[H5975]] beside [[H5921]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 22
Now the king [[H4428]] sat [[H3427]] in the winterhouse [[H1004]] in the ninth [[H8671]] month: [[H2320]] and on the hearth [[H254]] burning [[H1197]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 23
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Jehudi [[H3065]] had read [[H7121]] three [[H7969]] or four [[H702]] leaves, [[H1817]] he cut [[H7167]] it with the penknife, [[H8593]] and cast [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the fire [[H784]] that [[H834]] on [[H413]] the hearth, [[H254]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the roll [[H4039]] was consumed [[H8552]] in [[H5921]] the fire [[H784]] that [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the hearth. [[H254]]

### 24
Yet they were not [[H3808]] afraid, [[H6342]] nor [[H3808]] rent [[H7167]] their garments, [[H899]] the king, [[H4428]] nor any [[H3605]] of his servants [[H5650]] that heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words. [[H1697]]

### 25
Nevertheless [[H1571]] Elnathan [[H494]] and Delaiah [[H1806]] and Gemariah [[H1587]] had made intercession [[H6293]] to the king [[H4428]] that he would not [[H1115]] burn [[H8313]] the roll: [[H4039]] but he would not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] them. [[H413]]

### 26
But the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Jerahmeel [[H3396]] the son [[H1121]] of Hammelech, [[H4429]] and Seraiah [[H8304]] the son [[H1121]] of Azriel, [[H5837]] and Shelemiah [[H8018]] the son [[H1121]] of Abdeel, [[H5655]] to take [[H3947]] Baruch [[H1263]] the scribe [[H5608]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet: [[H5030]] but the Lord [[H3068]] hid [[H5641]] them. [[H5641]]

### 27
Then the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] after that [[H310]] the king [[H4428]] had burned [[H8313]] the roll, [[H4039]] and the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] Baruch [[H1263]] wrote [[H3789]] at the mouth [[H6310]] of Jeremiah, [[H3414]] saying, [[H559]]

### 28
Take [[H3947]] thee again [[H7725]] another [[H312]] roll, [[H4039]] and write [[H3789]] in [[H5921]]  it [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the former [[H7223]] words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] in [[H5921]] the first [[H7223]] roll, [[H4039]] which [[H834]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] hath burned. [[H8313]]

### 29
And thou shalt say [[H559]] to [[H5921]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Thou [[H859]] hast burned [[H8313]] this [[H2063]] roll, [[H4039]] saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4069]] hast thou written [[H3789]] therein, [[H5921]] saying, [[H559]] The king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] shall certainly [[H935]] come [[H935]] and destroy [[H7843]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and shall cause to cease [[H7673]] from [[H4480]] thence man [[H120]] and beast? [[H929]]

### 30
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of [[H5921]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah; [[H3063]] He shall have [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] to sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David: [[H1732]] and his dead body [[H5038]] shall be [[H1961]] cast out [[H7993]] in the day [[H3117]] to the heat, [[H2721]] and in the night [[H3915]] to the frost. [[H7140]]

### 31
And I will punish [[H6485]] him and his seed [[H2233]] and his servants [[H5650]]  for [[H853]] their iniquity; [[H5771]] and I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] them, and upon [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and upon [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I have pronounced [[H1696]] against [[H413]] them; but they hearkened [[H8085]] not. [[H8085]]

### 32
Then took [[H3947]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] another [[H312]] roll, [[H4039]] and gave [[H5414]] it to [[H413]] Baruch [[H1263]] the scribe, [[H5608]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah; [[H5374]] who wrote [[H3789]] therein [[H5921]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the book [[H5612]] which [[H834]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had burned [[H8313]] in the fire: [[H784]] and there were added [[H3254]] besides [[H5750]] unto [[H5921]] them many [[H7227]] like [[H1992]] words. [[H1697]]
