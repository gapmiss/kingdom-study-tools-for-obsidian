And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Jeremiah [[H3414]] had made an end [[H3615]] of speaking [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] for which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] had sent [[H7971]] him to [[H413]]  them, [[H853]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]]

### 2
Then spake [[H559]] Azariah [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Hoshaiah, [[H1955]] and Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the proud [[H2086]] men, [[H376]] saying [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] Thou [[H859]] speakest [[H1696]] falsely: [[H8267]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] hath not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] thee to say, [[H559]] Go [[H935]] not [[H3808]] into Egypt [[H4714]] to sojourn [[H1481]] there: [[H1481]]

### 3
But [[H3588]] Baruch [[H1263]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah [[H5374]] setteth thee on [[H5496]] against us, for to [[H4616]] deliver [[H5414]] us into the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] that they might put us to death, [[H4191]] and carry us away captives [[H1540]] into Babylon. [[H894]]

### 4
So Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] of the forces, [[H2428]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] obeyed [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 5
But Johanan [[H3110]] the son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] of the forces, [[H2428]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that [[H834]] were returned [[H7725]] from all [[H3605]] nations, [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] they had been driven, [[H5080]] to dwell [[H1481]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah; [[H3063]]

### 6
men, [[H1397]] and women, [[H802]] and children, [[H2945]] and the king's [[H4428]] daughters, [[H1323]] and every [[H3605]] person [[H5315]] that [[H834]] Nebuzar-adan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] had left [[H3240]] with [[H854]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Baruch [[H1263]] the son [[H1121]] of Neriah. [[H5374]]

### 7
So they came into [[H935]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] they obeyed [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] thus came [[H935]] they to [[H5704]] Tahpanhes. [[H8471]]

### 8
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] in Tahpanhes, [[H8471]] saying, [[H559]]

### 9
Take [[H3947]] great [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] and hide [[H2934]] them in the clay [[H4423]] in the brickkiln, [[H4404]] which [[H834]] at the entry [[H6607]] of Pharaoh's [[H6547]] house [[H1004]] in Tahpanhes, [[H8471]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the men [[H582]] of Judah; [[H3064]]

### 10
And say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] and take [[H3947]] Nebuchadrezzar [[H5019]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] my servant, [[H5650]] and will set [[H7760]] his throne [[H3678]] upon [[H4605]] these [[H428]] stones [[H68]] that [[H834]] I have hid; [[H2934]] and he shall spread [[H5186]] his royal pavilion [[H8237]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 11
And when he cometh, [[H935]] he shall smite [[H5221]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] such [[H834]] for death [[H4194]] to death; [[H4194]] and such [[H834]] for captivity [[H7628]] to captivity; [[H7628]] and such [[H834]] for the sword [[H2719]] to the sword. [[H2719]]

### 12
And I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in the houses [[H1004]] of the gods [[H430]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] and he shall burn [[H8313]] them, and carry them away captives: [[H7617]] and he shall array himself [[H5844]] with [[H854]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] as [[H834]] a shepherd [[H7462]] putteth on [[H5844]] his garment; [[H899]] and he shall go forth [[H3318]] from thence [[H8033]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 13
He shall break [[H7665]]  also [[H853]] the images [[H4676]] of Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] that [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] and the houses [[H1004]] of the gods [[H430]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall he burn [[H8313]] with fire. [[H784]]
