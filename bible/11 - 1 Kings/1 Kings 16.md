### 1
Then the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jehu [[H3058]] the son [[H1121]] of Hanani [[H2607]] against [[H5921]] Baasha, [[H1201]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Forasmuch [[H3282]] as I exalted [[H7311]] thee out of [[H4480]] the dust, [[H6083]] and made [[H5414]] thee prince [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel; [[H3478]] and thou hast walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]]  and hast made [[H853]] my people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] to sin, [[H2398]] to provoke me to anger [[H3707]] with their sins; [[H2403]]

### 3
Behold, [[H2005]] I will take away [[H1197]] the posterity [[H310]] of Baasha, [[H1201]] and the posterity [[H310]] of his house; [[H1004]] and will make [[H5414]] thy house [[H1004]] like the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat. [[H5028]]

### 4
Him that dieth [[H4191]] of Baasha [[H1201]] in the city [[H5892]] shall the dogs [[H3611]] eat; [[H398]] and him that dieth [[H4191]] of his in the fields [[H7704]] shall the fowls [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] eat. [[H398]]

### 5
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Baasha, [[H1201]] and what [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and his might, [[H1369]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 6
So Baasha [[H1201]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in Tirzah: [[H8656]] and Elah [[H425]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 7
And also [[H1571]] by the hand [[H3027]] of the prophet [[H5030]] Jehu [[H3058]] the son [[H1121]] of Hanani [[H2607]] came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] against [[H413]] Baasha, [[H1201]] and against [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] even for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] in provoking him to anger [[H3707]] with the work [[H4639]] of his hands, [[H3027]] in being [[H1961]] like the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam; [[H3379]] and because [[H5921]] he killed [[H5221]] him. [[H5221]]

### 8
In the twenty [[H6242]] and sixth [[H8337]] year [[H8141]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began Elah [[H425]] the son [[H1121]] of Baasha [[H1201]] to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Tirzah, [[H8656]] two years. [[H8141]]

### 9
And his servant [[H5650]] Zimri, [[H2174]] captain [[H8269]] of half [[H4276]] chariots, [[H7393]] conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] him, as he [[H1931]] was in Tirzah, [[H8656]] drinking [[H8354]] himself drunk [[H7910]] in the house [[H1004]] of Arza [[H777]] steward [[H5921]] of house [[H1004]] in Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 10
And Zimri [[H2174]] went in [[H935]] and smote [[H5221]] him, and killed [[H4191]] him, in the twenty [[H6242]] and seventh [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] as soon as he sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] he slew [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Baasha: [[H1201]] he left [[H7604]] him not [[H3808]] one that pisseth [[H8366]] against a wall, [[H7023]] neither of his kinsfolks, [[H1350]] nor of his friends. [[H7453]]

### 12
Thus did Zimri [[H2174]] destroy [[H8045]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Baasha, [[H1201]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] against [[H413]] Baasha [[H1201]] by [[H3027]] Jehu [[H3058]] the prophet, [[H5030]]

### 13
For [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] of Baasha, [[H1201]] and the sins [[H2403]] of Elah [[H425]] his son, [[H1121]] by which [[H834]] they sinned, [[H2398]] and by which [[H834]] they made Israel [[H3478]] to sin, [[H2398]] in provoking [[H3707]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] to anger with their vanities. [[H1892]]

### 14
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Elah, [[H425]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 15
In the twenty [[H6242]] and seventh [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] did Zimri [[H2174]] reign [[H4427]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] in Tirzah. [[H8656]] And the people [[H5971]] encamped [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] Gibbethon, [[H1405]] which [[H834]] to the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 16
And the people [[H5971]] encamped [[H2583]] heard [[H8085]] say, [[H559]] Zimri [[H2174]] hath conspired, [[H7194]] and hath also [[H1571]] slain [[H5221]] the king: [[H4428]] wherefore all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]]  made [[H853]] Omri, [[H6018]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host, [[H6635]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] in the camp. [[H4264]]

### 17
And Omri [[H6018]] went up [[H5927]] from Gibbethon, [[H1405]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, and they besieged [[H6696]] Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 18
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Zimri [[H2174]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the city [[H5892]] was taken, [[H3920]] that he went [[H935]] into [[H413]] the palace [[H759]] of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and burnt [[H8313]] the king's [[H4428]] house [[H1004]] over [[H5921]] him with fire, [[H784]] and died, [[H4191]]

### 19
For [[H5921]] his sins [[H2403]] which [[H834]] he sinned [[H2398]] in doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] in walking [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] and in his sin [[H2403]] which [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] to make Israel [[H3478]] to sin. [[H2398]]

### 20
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Zimri, [[H2174]] and his treason [[H7195]] that [[H834]] he wrought, [[H7194]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 21
Then [[H227]] were the people [[H5971]] of Israel [[H3478]] divided [[H2505]] into two parts: [[H2677]] half [[H2677]] of the people [[H5971]] followed [[H1961]] Tibni [[H8402]] the son [[H1121]] of Ginath, [[H1527]] to make him king; [[H4427]] and half [[H2677]] followed [[H310]] Omri. [[H6018]]

### 22
But the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] followed [[H310]] Omri [[H6018]] prevailed [[H2388]] against [[H854]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] followed [[H310]] Tibni [[H8402]] the son [[H1121]] of Ginath: [[H1527]] so Tibni [[H8402]] died, [[H4191]] and Omri [[H6018]] reigned. [[H4427]]

### 23
In the thirty [[H7970]] and first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began Omri [[H6018]] to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] twelve [[H8147]] years: [[H8141]] six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] reigned [[H4427]] he in Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 24
And he bought [[H7069]] the hill [[H2022]] Samaria [[H8111]] of [[H853]] Shemer [[H8106]] for two talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] and built on [[H1129]] the hill, [[H2022]] and called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] he built, [[H1129]] after [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of Shemer, [[H8106]] owner [[H113]] of the hill, [[H2022]] Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 25
But Omri [[H6018]] wrought [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and did worse [[H7489]] than all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 26
For he walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the way [[H1870]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] and in his sin [[H2403]] wherewith [[H834]] he made Israel [[H3478]] to sin, [[H2398]] to provoke [[H3707]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] to anger with their vanities. [[H1892]]

### 27
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Omri [[H6018]] which [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and his might [[H1369]] that [[H834]] he shewed, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 28
So Omri [[H6018]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in Samaria: [[H8111]] and Ahab [[H256]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 29
And in the thirty [[H7970]] and eighth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began Ahab [[H256]] the son [[H1121]] of Omri [[H6018]] to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] and Ahab [[H256]] the son [[H1121]] of Omri [[H6018]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Samaria [[H8111]] twenty [[H6242]] and two [[H8147]] years. [[H8141]]

### 30
And Ahab [[H256]] the son [[H1121]] of Omri [[H6018]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] above all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 31
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as if it had been a light thing [[H7043]] for him to walk [[H1980]] in the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] that he took [[H3947]] to wife [[H802]] Jezebel [[H348]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Ethbaal [[H856]] king [[H4428]] of the Zidonians, [[H6722]] and went [[H1980]] and served [[H5647]] Baal, [[H1168]] and worshipped [[H7812]] him. [[H7812]]

### 32
And he reared up [[H6965]] an altar [[H4196]] for Baal [[H1168]] in the house [[H1004]] of Baal, [[H1168]] which [[H834]] he had built [[H1129]] in Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 33
And Ahab [[H256]] made [[H6213]] a grove; [[H842]] and Ahab [[H256]] did [[H6213]] more [[H3254]] to provoke [[H3707]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] to anger than all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 34
In his days [[H3117]] did Hiel [[H2419]] the Beth-elite [[H1017]] build [[H1129]] Jericho: [[H3405]] he laid the foundation [[H3245]] thereof in Abiram [[H48]] his firstborn, [[H1060]] and set up [[H5324]] the gates [[H1817]] thereof in his youngest [[H6810]] Segub, [[H7687]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun. [[H5126]]
