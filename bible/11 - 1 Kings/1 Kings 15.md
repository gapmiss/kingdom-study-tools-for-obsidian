### 1
Now in the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] reigned [[H4427]] Abijam [[H38]] over [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
Three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] reigned [[H4427]] he in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Maachah, [[H4601]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Abishalom. [[H53]]

### 3
And he walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] of his father, [[H1]] which [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] before [[H6440]] him: and his heart [[H3824]] was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] perfect [[H8003]] with [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] as the heart [[H3824]] of David [[H1732]] his father. [[H1]]

### 4
Nevertheless [[H3588]] for David's [[H1732]] sake [[H4616]] did the Lord [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] give [[H5414]] him a lamp [[H5216]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to set up [[H6965]] his son [[H1121]] after [[H310]] him, and to establish [[H5975]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]]

### 5
Because [[H834]] David [[H1732]] did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and turned not aside [[H5493]] from any [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] him all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] save only [[H7535]] in the matter [[H1697]] of Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite. [[H2850]]

### 6
And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life. [[H2416]]

### 7
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Abijam, [[H38]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Abijam [[H38]] and Jeroboam. [[H3379]]

### 8
And Abijam [[H38]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers; [[H1]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in the city [[H5892]] of David: [[H1732]] and Asa [[H609]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 9
And in the twentieth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] reigned [[H4427]] Asa [[H609]] over Judah. [[H3063]]

### 10
And forty [[H705]] and one [[H259]] years [[H8141]] reigned [[H4427]] he in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Maachah, [[H4601]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Abishalom. [[H53]]

### 11
And Asa [[H609]] did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] as David [[H1732]] his father. [[H1]]

### 12
And he took away [[H5674]] the sodomites [[H6945]] out of [[H4480]] the land, [[H776]] and removed [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] the idols [[H1544]] that [[H834]] his fathers [[H1]] had made. [[H6213]]

### 13
And also [[H1571]] Maachah [[H4601]] his mother, [[H517]] even her he removed [[H5493]] from queen, [[H1377]] because [[H834]] she had made [[H6213]] an idol [[H4656]] in a grove; [[H842]] and Asa [[H609]] destroyed [[H3772]] her idol, [[H4656]] and burnt [[H8313]] by the brook [[H5158]] Kidron. [[H6939]]

### 14
But the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] removed: [[H5493]] nevertheless [[H7535]] Asa's [[H609]] heart [[H3824]] was [[H1961]] perfect [[H8003]] with [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] his days. [[H3117]]

### 15
And he brought in [[H935]] the things which his father [[H1]] had dedicated, [[H6944]] and the things which himself had dedicated, [[H6944]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] silver, [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and vessels. [[H3627]]

### 16
And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Asa [[H609]] and Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] their days. [[H3117]]

### 17
And Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]] and built [[H1129]] Ramah, [[H7414]] that he might not [[H1115]] suffer [[H5414]] any to go out [[H3318]] or come in [[H935]] to Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 18
Then Asa [[H609]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the silver [[H3701]] and the gold [[H2091]] left [[H3498]] in the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the treasures [[H214]] of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and delivered [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of his servants: [[H5650]] and king [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] sent [[H7971]] them to [[H413]] Ben-hadad, [[H1130]] the son [[H1121]] of Tabrimon, [[H2886]] the son [[H1121]] of Hezion, [[H2383]] king [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] that dwelt [[H3427]] at Damascus, [[H1834]] saying, [[H559]]

### 19
a league [[H1285]] between [[H996]] me and thee, between [[H996]] my father [[H1]] and thy father: [[H1]] behold, [[H2009]] I have sent [[H7971]] unto thee a present [[H7810]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold; [[H2091]] come [[H1980]] and break [[H6565]] thy league [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that he may depart [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 20
So Ben-hadad [[H1130]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Asa, [[H609]] and sent [[H7971]] the captains [[H8269]] of the hosts [[H2428]] which [[H834]] he had against [[H5921]] the cities [[H5892]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and smote [[H5221]] Ijon, [[H5859]] and Dan, [[H1835]] and Abel-beth-maachah, [[H62]] and all [[H3605]] Cinneroth, [[H3672]] with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Naphtali. [[H5321]]

### 21
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Baasha [[H1201]] heard [[H8085]] that he left off [[H2308]] building [[H1129]]  of [[H853]] Ramah, [[H7414]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 22
Then king [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] made a proclamation [[H8085]]  throughout [[H853]] all [[H3605]] Judah; [[H3063]] none [[H369]] exempted: [[H5355]] and they took away [[H5375]] the stones [[H68]] of Ramah, [[H7414]] and the timber [[H6086]] thereof, wherewith [[H834]] Baasha [[H1201]] had builded; [[H1129]] and king [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] built [[H1129]]  with them [[H853]] Geba [[H1387]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and Mizpah. [[H4709]]

### 23
The rest [[H3499]] of all [[H3605]] the acts [[H1697]] of Asa, [[H609]] and all [[H3605]] his might, [[H1369]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] he built, [[H1129]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] Nevertheless [[H7535]] in the time [[H6256]] of his old age [[H2209]] he was diseased [[H2470]] in his feet. [[H7272]]

### 24
And Asa [[H609]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] his father: [[H1]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 25
And Nadab [[H5070]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] began to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] two years. [[H8141]]

### 26
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of his father, [[H1]] and in his sin [[H2403]] wherewith [[H834]] he made Israel [[H3478]] to sin. [[H2398]]

### 27
And Baasha [[H1201]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahijah, [[H281]] of the house [[H1004]] of Issachar, [[H3485]] conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] him; and Baasha [[H1201]] smote [[H5221]] him at Gibbethon, [[H1405]] which [[H834]] to the Philistines; [[H6430]] for Nadab [[H5070]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] laid siege [[H6696]] to [[H5921]] Gibbethon. [[H1405]]

### 28
Even in the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] did Baasha [[H1201]] slay [[H4191]] him, and reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 29
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he reigned, [[H4427]] he smote [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam; [[H3379]] he left [[H7604]] not [[H3808]] to Jeroboam [[H3379]] any [[H3605]] that breathed, [[H5397]] until [[H5704]] he had destroyed [[H8045]] him, according unto the saying [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] his servant [[H5650]] Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite: [[H7888]]

### 30
Because [[H5921]] of the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] which [[H834]] he sinned, [[H2398]] and which [[H834]] he made Israel [[H3478]] sin, [[H2398]] by his provocation [[H3708]] wherewith [[H834]] he provoked to anger. [[H3707]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]]

### 31
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Nadab, [[H5070]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 32
And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Asa [[H609]] and Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] their days. [[H3117]]

### 33
In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] began Baasha [[H1201]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahijah [[H281]] to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] in Tirzah, [[H8656]] twenty [[H6242]] and four [[H702]] years. [[H8141]]

### 34
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] and in his sin [[H2403]] wherewith [[H834]] he made Israel [[H3478]] to sin. [[H2398]]
