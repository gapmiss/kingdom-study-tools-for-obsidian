### 1
And Ben-hadad [[H1130]] the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] gathered together: [[H6908]] all his host [[H2428]] and thirty [[H7970]] and two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] with [[H854]] him, and horses, [[H5483]] and chariots: [[H7393]] and he went up [[H5927]] and besieged [[H6696]] Samaria, [[H8111]] and warred [[H3898]] against it. [[H3898]]

### 2
And he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] into the city, [[H5892]] and said [[H559]] unto him, [[H0]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] Ben-hadad, [[H1130]]

### 3
Thy silver [[H3701]] and thy gold [[H2091]] mine; [[H1931]] thy wives [[H802]] also [[H802]] and thy children, [[H1121]] the goodliest, [[H2896]] mine. [[H1992]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] My lord, [[H113]] O king, [[H4428]] according to thy saying, [[H1697]] I [[H589]] thine, and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have. [[H834]]

### 5
And the messengers [[H4397]] came again, [[H7725]] and said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] speaketh [[H559]] Ben-hadad, [[H1130]] saying, [[H559]] Although [[H3588]] I have sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Thou shalt deliver [[H5414]] me thy silver, [[H3701]] and thy gold, [[H2091]] and thy wives, [[H802]] and thy children; [[H1121]]

### 6
Yet [[H3588]] I will send [[H7971]] my servants [[H5650]] unto [[H413]] thee to morrow [[H4279]] about [[H518]] this time, [[H6256]] and they shall search [[H2664]] thine house, [[H1004]] and the houses [[H1004]] of thy servants; [[H5650]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] whatsoever [[H3605]] is pleasant [[H4261]] in thine eyes, [[H5869]] they shall put [[H7760]] in their hand, [[H3027]] and take away. [[H3947]]

### 7
Then the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] called [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of the land, [[H776]] and said, [[H559]] Mark, [[H3045]] I pray you, [[H4994]] and see [[H7200]] how [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] seeketh [[H1245]] mischief: [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] he sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] me for my wives, [[H802]] and for my children, [[H1121]] and for my silver, [[H3701]] and for my gold; [[H2091]] and I denied [[H4513]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 8
And all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] nor [[H3808]] consent. [[H14]]

### 9
Wherefore he said [[H559]] unto the messengers [[H4397]] of Ben-hadad, [[H1130]] Tell [[H559]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou didst send [[H7971]] for to [[H413]] thy servant [[H5650]] at the first [[H7223]] I will do: [[H6213]] but this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] I may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] do. [[H6213]] And the messengers [[H4397]] departed, [[H1980]] and brought [[H7725]] him word [[H1697]] again. [[H1697]]

### 10
And Ben-hadad [[H1130]] sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] him, and said, [[H559]] The gods [[H430]] do so [[H6213]] unto me, and more also, [[H3254]] if [[H518]] the dust [[H6083]] of Samaria [[H8111]] shall suffice [[H5606]] for handfuls [[H8168]] for all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] follow [[H7272]] me. [[H7272]]

### 11
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Tell [[H1696]] Let not [[H408]] him that girdeth [[H2296]] on boast himself [[H1984]] as he that putteth it off. [[H6605]]

### 12
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when heard [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] message, [[H1697]] as he [[H1931]] drinking, [[H8354]] he [[H1931]] and the kings [[H4428]] in the pavilions, [[H5521]] that he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] Set [[H7760]] And they set [[H7760]] against [[H5921]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 13
And, behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H5066]] a [[H259]] prophet [[H5030]] unto [[H413]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Hast thou seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] multitude? [[H1995]] behold, [[H2009]] I will deliver [[H5414]] it into thine hand [[H3027]] this day; [[H3117]] and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
And Ahab [[H256]] said, [[H559]] By whom? [[H4310]] And he said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] by the young men [[H5288]] of the princes [[H8269]] of the provinces. [[H4082]] Then he said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall order [[H631]] the battle? [[H4421]] And he answered, [[H559]] Thou. [[H859]]

### 15
Then he numbered [[H6485]] the young men [[H5288]] of the princes [[H8269]] of the provinces, [[H4082]] and they were [[H1961]] two hundred [[H3967]] and thirty [[H7970]] two: [[H8147]] and after [[H310]] them he numbered [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] seven [[H7651]] thousand. [[H505]]

### 16
And they went out [[H3318]] at noon. [[H6672]] But Ben-hadad [[H1130]] drinking [[H8354]] himself drunk [[H7910]] in the pavilions, [[H5521]] he [[H1931]] and the kings, [[H4428]] the thirty [[H7970]] and two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] that helped [[H5826]] him. [[H5826]]

### 17
And the young men [[H5288]] of the princes [[H8269]] of the provinces [[H4082]] went out [[H3318]] first; [[H7223]] and Ben-hadad [[H1130]] sent out, [[H7971]] and they told [[H5046]] him, saying, [[H559]] There are men [[H582]] come out [[H3318]] of Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 18
And he said, [[H559]] Whether [[H518]] they be come out [[H3318]] for peace, [[H7965]] take [[H8610]] them alive; [[H2416]] or whether [[H518]] they be come out [[H3318]] for war, [[H4421]] take [[H8610]] them alive. [[H2416]]

### 19
So these [[H428]] young men [[H5288]] of the princes [[H8269]] of the provinces [[H4082]] came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] and the army [[H2428]] which [[H834]] followed [[H310]] them. [[H310]]

### 20
And they slew [[H5221]] every one [[H376]] his man: [[H376]] and the Syrians [[H758]] fled; [[H5127]] and Israel [[H3478]] pursued [[H7291]] them: and Ben-hadad [[H1130]] the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] escaped [[H4422]] on [[H5921]] an horse [[H5483]] with the horsemen. [[H6571]]

### 21
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went out, [[H3318]] and smote [[H5221]] the horses [[H5483]] and chariots, [[H7393]] and slew [[H5221]] the Syrians [[H758]] with a great [[H1419]] slaughter. [[H4347]]

### 22
And the prophet [[H5030]] came [[H5066]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Go, [[H1980]] strengthen thyself, [[H2388]] and mark, [[H3045]] and see [[H7200]] what [[H834]] thou doest: [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] at the return [[H8666]] of the year [[H8141]] the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] will come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 23
And the servants [[H5650]] of the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Their gods [[H430]] gods [[H430]] of the hills; [[H2022]] therefore [[H5921]] they were stronger [[H2388]] than [[H4480]] we; but [[H199]] let us fight [[H3898]] against [[H854]] them in the plain, [[H4334]] and surely [[H518]] we shall be stronger [[H2388]] than they. [[H3808]]

### 24
And do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] Take [[H5493]] the kings [[H4428]] away, every man [[H376]] out of his place, [[H4725]] and put [[H7760]] captains [[H6346]] in their rooms: [[H8478]]

### 25
And number [[H4487]] thee an army, [[H2428]] like the army [[H2428]] that thou hast lost, [[H5307]] horse [[H5483]] for horse, [[H5483]] and chariot [[H7393]] for chariot: [[H7393]] and we will fight against [[H3898]] them in the plain, [[H4334]] surely [[H518]] we shall be stronger [[H2388]] than they. And he hearkened [[H8085]] unto their voice, [[H6963]] and did so. [[H6213]]

### 26
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the return [[H8666]] of the year, [[H8141]] that Ben-hadad [[H1130]] numbered [[H6485]] the Syrians, [[H758]] and went up [[H5927]] to Aphek, [[H663]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were numbered, [[H6485]] and were all present, [[H3557]] and went [[H1980]] against [[H7125]] them: and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] pitched [[H2583]] before [[H5048]] them like two [[H8147]] little flocks [[H2835]] of kids; [[H5795]] but the Syrians [[H758]] filled [[H4390]] the country. [[H776]]

### 28
And there came [[H5066]] a man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Because [[H3282]] the Syrians [[H758]] have said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of the hills, [[H2022]] but he [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] God [[H430]] of the valleys, [[H6010]] therefore will I deliver [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] multitude [[H1995]] into thine hand, [[H3027]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 29
And they pitched [[H2583]] one [[H428]] over against [[H5227]] the other [[H428]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] And it was, [[H1961]] that in the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the battle [[H4421]] was joined: [[H7126]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] slew [[H5221]]  of [[H853]] the Syrians [[H758]] an hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] footmen [[H7273]] in one [[H259]] day. [[H3117]]

### 30
But the rest [[H3498]] fled [[H5127]] to Aphek, [[H663]] into [[H413]] the city; [[H5892]] and a wall [[H2346]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] twenty [[H6242]] and seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] of the men [[H376]] left. [[H3498]] And Ben-hadad [[H1130]] fled, [[H5127]] and came [[H935]] into [[H413]] the city, [[H5892]] into an inner [[H2315]] chamber. [[H2315]]

### 31
And his servants [[H5650]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] we have heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the kings [[H4428]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] merciful [[H2617]] kings: [[H4428]] let us, I pray thee, [[H4994]] put [[H7760]] sackcloth [[H8242]] on our loins, [[H4975]] and ropes [[H2256]] upon our heads, [[H7218]] and go out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel: [[H3478]] peradventure [[H194]] he will save [[H2421]] thy life. [[H5315]]

### 32
So they girded [[H2296]] sackcloth [[H8242]] on their loins, [[H4975]] and ropes [[H2256]] on their heads, [[H7218]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and said, [[H559]] Thy servant [[H5650]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] saith, [[H559]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] let me [[H5315]] live. [[H2421]] And he said, [[H559]] he yet [[H5750]] alive? [[H2416]] he [[H1931]] my brother. [[H251]]

### 33
Now the men [[H376]] did diligently observe [[H5172]] whether from [[H4480]] him, and did hastily [[H4116]] catch [[H2480]] and they said, [[H559]] Thy brother [[H251]] Ben-hadad. [[H1130]] Then he said, [[H559]] Go [[H935]] ye, bring [[H3947]] him. Then Ben-hadad [[H1130]] came forth [[H3318]] to [[H413]] him; and he caused him to come up [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] the chariot. [[H4818]]

### 34
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The cities, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] my father [[H1]] took [[H3947]] from [[H853]] thy father, [[H1]] I will restore; [[H7725]] and thou shalt make [[H7760]] streets [[H2351]] for thee in Damascus, [[H1834]] as [[H834]] my father [[H1]] made [[H7760]] in Samaria. [[H8111]] Then I [[H589]] will send thee away [[H7971]] with this covenant. [[H1285]] So he made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with him, and sent him away. [[H7971]]

### 35
And a certain [[H259]] man [[H376]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his neighbour [[H7453]] in the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] Smite [[H5221]] me, I pray thee. [[H4994]] And the man [[H376]] refused [[H3985]] to smite [[H5221]] him. [[H5221]]

### 36
Then said [[H559]] he unto him, Because [[H3282]] thou hast not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] behold, [[H2005]] as soon as thou art departed [[H1980]] from [[H853]] me, a lion [[H738]] shall slay [[H5221]] thee. And as soon as he was departed [[H1980]] from him, [[H681]] a lion [[H738]] found [[H4672]] him, and slew [[H5221]] him. [[H5221]]

### 37
Then he found [[H4672]] another [[H312]] man, [[H376]] and said, [[H559]] Smite [[H5221]] me, I pray thee. [[H4994]] And the man [[H376]] smote [[H5221]] him, so that in smiting [[H5221]] he wounded [[H6481]]

### 38
So the prophet [[H5030]] departed, [[H1980]] and waited [[H5975]] for the king [[H4428]] by [[H5921]] the way, [[H1870]] and disguised himself [[H2664]] with ashes [[H666]] upon [[H5921]] his face. [[H5869]]

### 39
And as [[H1961]] the king [[H4428]] passed by, [[H5674]] he [[H1931]] cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the king: [[H4428]] and he said, [[H559]] Thy servant [[H5650]] went out [[H3318]] into the midst [[H7130]] of the battle; [[H4421]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] turned aside, [[H5493]] and brought [[H935]] a man [[H376]] unto [[H413]] me, and said, [[H559]] Keep [[H8104]] this [[H2088]] man: [[H376]] if [[H518]] by any means [[H6485]] he be missing, [[H6485]] then shall thy life [[H5315]] be [[H1961]] for [[H8478]] his life, [[H5315]] or [[H176]] else thou shalt pay [[H8254]] a talent [[H3603]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 40
And as thy servant [[H5650]] was [[H1961]] busy [[H6213]] here [[H2008]] and there, [[H2008]] he [[H1931]] was gone. [[H369]] And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, So [[H3651]] thy judgment [[H4941]] thyself [[H859]] hast decided [[H2782]]

### 41
And he hasted, [[H4116]] and took [[H5493]] the ashes [[H666]] away from [[H5921]] his face; [[H5869]] and the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] discerned [[H5234]] him that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] of the prophets. [[H5030]]

### 42
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Because [[H3282]] thou hast let go [[H7971]] out of hand [[H3027]] a man [[H376]] whom I appointed to utter destruction, [[H2764]] therefore thy life [[H5315]] shall go [[H1961]] for [[H8478]] his life, [[H5315]] and thy people [[H5971]] for [[H8478]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 43
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] to [[H5921]] his house [[H1004]] heavy [[H5620]] and displeased, [[H2198]] and came [[H935]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]
