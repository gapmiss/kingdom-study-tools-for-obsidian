### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite [[H3158]] had [[H1961]] a vineyard, [[H3754]] which [[H834]] in Jezreel, [[H3157]] hard by [[H681]] the palace [[H1964]] of Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 2
And Ahab [[H256]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Naboth, [[H5022]] saying, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]]  me [[H853]] thy vineyard, [[H3754]] that I may have [[H1961]] it for a garden [[H1588]] of herbs, [[H3419]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] near [[H7138]] unto [[H681]] my house: [[H1004]] and I will give [[H5414]] thee for [[H8478]] it a better [[H2896]] vineyard [[H3754]] than [[H4480]] it; if [[H518]] it seem good [[H2896]] to thee, [[H5869]] I will give [[H5414]] thee the worth [[H4242]] of it [[H2088]] in money. [[H3701]]

### 3
And Naboth [[H5022]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahab, [[H256]] The Lord [[H3068]] forbid [[H2486]] it me, that I should give [[H5414]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of my fathers [[H1]] unto thee. [[H1]]

### 4
And Ahab [[H256]] came [[H935]] into [[H413]] his house [[H1004]] heavy [[H5620]] and displeased [[H2198]] because [[H5921]] of the word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite [[H3158]] had spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] him: for he had said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of my fathers. [[H1]] And he laid him down [[H7901]] upon [[H5921]] his bed, [[H4296]] and turned away [[H5437]] his face, [[H6440]] and would eat [[H398]] no [[H3808]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 5
But Jezebel [[H348]] his wife [[H802]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] him, and said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, Why [[H4100]] is thy spirit [[H7307]] so sad, [[H5620]] that thou eatest [[H398]] no [[H369]] bread? [[H3899]]

### 6
And he said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] her, Because [[H3588]] I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite, [[H3158]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Give [[H5414]]  me [[H853]] thy vineyard [[H3754]] for money; [[H3701]] or [[H176]] else, if [[H518]] it please [[H2655]] thee, [[H859]] I will give [[H5414]] thee vineyard [[H3754]] for [[H8478]] it: and he answered, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] my vineyard. [[H3754]]

### 7
And Jezebel [[H348]] his wife [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Dost thou [[H859]] now [[H6258]] govern [[H6213]] the kingdom [[H4410]] of Israel? [[H3478]] arise, [[H6965]] eat [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] and let thine heart [[H3820]] be merry: [[H3190]] I [[H589]] will give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] the vineyard [[H3754]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite. [[H3158]]

### 8
So she wrote [[H3789]] letters [[H5612]] in Ahab's [[H256]] name, [[H8034]] and sealed [[H2856]] with his seal, [[H2368]] and sent [[H7971]] the letters [[H5612]] unto [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] and to [[H413]] the nobles [[H2715]] that [[H834]] in his city, [[H5892]] dwelling [[H3427]] with [[H854]] Naboth. [[H5022]]

### 9
And she wrote [[H3789]] in the letters, [[H5612]] saying, [[H559]] Proclaim [[H7121]] a fast, [[H6685]] and set [[H3427]] Naboth [[H5022]] on high [[H7218]] among the people: [[H5971]]

### 10
And set [[H3427]] two [[H8147]] men, [[H582]] sons [[H1121]] of Belial, [[H1100]] before [[H5048]] him, to bear witness against [[H5749]] him, saying, [[H559]] Thou didst blaspheme [[H1288]] God [[H430]] and the king. [[H4428]] And carry him out, [[H3318]] and stone [[H5619]] him, that he may die. [[H4191]]

### 11
And the men [[H376]] of his city, [[H5892]] the elders [[H2205]] and the nobles [[H2715]] who [[H834]] were the inhabitants [[H3427]] in his city, [[H5892]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Jezebel [[H348]] had sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] them, as [[H834]] it written [[H3789]] in the letters [[H5612]] which [[H834]] she had sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 12
They proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast, [[H6685]] and set [[H3427]] Naboth [[H5022]] on high [[H7218]] among the people. [[H5971]]

### 13
And there came in [[H935]] two [[H8147]] men, [[H376]] children [[H1121]] of Belial, [[H1100]] and sat [[H3427]] before [[H5048]] him: and the men [[H376]] of Belial [[H1100]] witnessed against [[H5749]]  him, against [[H853]] Naboth, [[H5022]] in the presence [[H5048]] of the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Naboth [[H5022]] did blaspheme [[H1288]] God [[H430]] and the king. [[H4428]] Then they carried him forth [[H3318]] out [[H2351]] of the city, [[H5892]] and stoned [[H5619]] him with stones, [[H68]] that he died. [[H4191]]

### 14
Then they sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Jezebel, [[H348]] saying, [[H559]] Naboth [[H5022]] is stoned, [[H5619]] and is dead. [[H4191]]

### 15
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Jezebel [[H348]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Naboth [[H5022]] was stoned, [[H5619]] and was dead, [[H4191]] that Jezebel [[H348]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahab, [[H256]] Arise, [[H6965]] take possession [[H3423]]  of [[H853]] the vineyard [[H3754]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite, [[H3158]] which [[H834]] he refused [[H3985]] to give [[H5414]] thee for money: [[H3701]] for [[H3588]] Naboth [[H5022]] is not [[H369]] alive, [[H2416]] but [[H3588]] dead. [[H4191]]

### 16
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Ahab [[H256]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Naboth [[H5022]] was dead, [[H4191]] that Ahab [[H256]] rose up [[H6965]] to go down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the vineyard [[H3754]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite, [[H3158]] to take possession [[H3423]] of it. [[H3423]]

### 17
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite, [[H8664]] saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Arise, [[H6965]] go down [[H3381]] to meet [[H7125]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] in Samaria: [[H8111]] behold, [[H2009]] in the vineyard [[H3754]] of Naboth, [[H5022]] whither [[H834]] he is gone down [[H3381]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 19
And thou shalt speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Hast thou killed, [[H7523]] and also [[H1571]] taken possession? [[H3423]] And thou shalt speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] In the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] dogs [[H3611]] licked [[H3952]] the blood [[H1818]] of Naboth [[H5022]] shall dogs [[H3611]] lick [[H3952]] thy blood, [[H1818]] even [[H1571]] thine. [[H859]]

### 20
And Ahab [[H256]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Elijah, [[H452]] Hast thou found [[H4672]] me, O mine enemy? [[H341]] And he answered, [[H559]] I have found [[H4672]] because [[H3282]] thou hast sold [[H4376]] thyself to work [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] thee, and will take away [[H1197]] thy posterity, [[H310]] and will cut off [[H3772]] from Ahab [[H256]] him that pisseth [[H8366]] against the wall, [[H7023]] and him that is shut up [[H6113]] and left [[H5800]] in Israel, [[H3478]]

### 22
And will make [[H5414]] thine house [[H1004]] like the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] and like the house [[H1004]] of Baasha [[H1201]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahijah, [[H281]] for [[H413]] the provocation [[H3708]] wherewith [[H834]] thou hast provoked to anger, [[H3707]] and made Israel [[H3478]] to sin. [[H2398]]

### 23
And of Jezebel [[H348]] also [[H1571]] spake [[H1696]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] The dogs [[H3611]] shall eat [[H398]] Jezebel [[H348]] by the wall [[H2426]] of Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 24
Him that dieth [[H4191]] of Ahab [[H256]] in the city [[H5892]] the dogs [[H3611]] shall eat; [[H398]] and him that dieth [[H4191]] in the field [[H7704]] shall the fowls [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] eat. [[H398]]

### 25
But [[H7535]] there was [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] like unto Ahab, [[H256]] which [[H834]] did sell himself [[H4376]] to work [[H6213]] wickedness [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] whom [[H834]] Jezebel [[H348]] his wife [[H802]] stirred up. [[H5496]]

### 26
And he did very [[H3966]] abominably [[H8581]] in following [[H1980]] idols, [[H1544]] according to all [[H3605]] as [[H834]] did [[H6213]] the Amorites, [[H567]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] cast out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Ahab [[H256]] heard [[H8085]] those [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] that he rent [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] and put [[H7760]] sackcloth [[H8242]] upon [[H5921]] his flesh, [[H1320]] and fasted, [[H6684]] and lay [[H7901]] in sackcloth, [[H8242]] and went [[H1980]] softly. [[H328]]

### 28
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite, [[H8664]] saying, [[H559]]

### 29
Seest [[H7200]] thou how [[H3588]] Ahab [[H256]] humbleth himself [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] me? because [[H3282]] he humbleth himself [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] me, I will not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] the evil [[H7451]] in his days: [[H3117]] in his son's [[H1121]] days [[H3117]] will I bring [[H935]] the evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] his house.
