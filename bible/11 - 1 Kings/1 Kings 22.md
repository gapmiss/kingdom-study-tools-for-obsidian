### 1
And they continued [[H3427]] three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] without [[H369]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Syria [[H758]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the third [[H7992]] year, [[H8141]] that Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] came down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] Know [[H3045]] ye that [[H3588]] Ramoth [[H7433]] in Gilead [[H1568]] ours, and we [[H587]] still, [[H2814]] take [[H3947]] it not out of the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Syria? [[H758]]

### 4
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] Wilt thou go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] me to battle [[H4421]] to Ramoth-gilead? [[H7433]] And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I as thou [[H3644]] my people [[H5971]] as thy people, [[H5971]] my horses [[H5483]] as thy horses. [[H5483]]

### 5
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Inquire, [[H1875]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] at the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to day. [[H3117]]

### 6
Then the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] gathered together, [[H6908]] the prophets [[H5030]] about four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Shall I go [[H1980]] against [[H5921]] Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] to battle, [[H4421]] or [[H518]] shall I forbear? [[H2308]] And they said, [[H559]] Go up; [[H5927]] for the Lord [[H136]] shall deliver [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king. [[H4428]]

### 7
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said, [[H559]] not [[H369]] here [[H6311]] a prophet [[H5030]] of the Lord [[H3068]] besides, [[H5750]] that we might inquire [[H1875]] of [[H853]] him? [[H853]]

### 8
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] yet [[H5750]] one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] Micaiah [[H4321]] the son [[H1121]] of Imlah, [[H3229]] by [[H853]] whom we may inquire [[H1875]]  of [[H853]] the Lord: [[H3068]] but I [[H589]] hate [[H8130]] him; for [[H3588]] he doth not [[H3808]] prophesy [[H5012]] good [[H2896]] concerning [[H5921]] me, but [[H3588]] evil. [[H7451]] And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said, [[H559]] Let not [[H408]] the king [[H4428]] say [[H559]] so. [[H3651]]

### 9
Then the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] called [[H7121]] an [[H259]] officer, [[H5631]] and said, [[H559]] Hasten [[H4116]] Micaiah [[H4321]] the son [[H1121]] of Imlah. [[H3229]]

### 10
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] sat [[H3427]] each [[H376]] on [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] having put on [[H3847]] their robes, [[H899]] in a void place [[H1637]] in the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of Samaria; [[H8111]] and all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] prophesied [[H5012]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 11
And Zedekiah [[H6667]] the son [[H1121]] of Chenaanah [[H3668]] made [[H6213]] him horns [[H7161]] of iron: [[H1270]] and he said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] With these [[H428]] shalt thou push [[H5055]] the Syrians, [[H758]] until [[H5704]] thou have consumed [[H3615]] them. [[H3615]]

### 12
And all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] prophesied [[H5012]] so, [[H3651]] saying, [[H559]] Go up [[H5927]] to Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]] and prosper: [[H6743]] for the Lord [[H3068]] shall deliver [[H5414]] into the king's [[H4428]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 13
And the messenger [[H4397]] that [[H834]] was gone [[H1980]] to call [[H7121]] Micaiah [[H4321]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] the words [[H1697]] of the prophets [[H5030]] good [[H2896]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] with one [[H259]] mouth: [[H6310]] let thy word, [[H1697]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] be [[H1961]] like the word [[H1697]] of one [[H259]] of them, and speak [[H1696]] good. [[H2896]]

### 14
And Micaiah [[H4321]] said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] what [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] saith [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, that will I speak. [[H1696]]

### 15
So he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]] And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Micaiah, [[H4321]] shall we go [[H1980]] against [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] to battle, [[H4421]] or [[H518]] shall we forbear? [[H2308]] And he answered [[H559]] him, Go, [[H5927]] and prosper: [[H6743]] for the Lord [[H3068]] shall deliver [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king. [[H4428]]

### 16
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, How [[H5704]] many [[H4100]] times [[H6471]] shall I [[H589]] adjure [[H7650]] thee that [[H834]] thou tell [[H1696]] me nothing [[H3808]] but [[H7535]] true [[H571]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 17
And he said, [[H559]] I saw [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] scattered [[H6327]] upon [[H413]] the hills, [[H2022]] as sheep [[H6629]] that [[H834]] have not [[H369]] a shepherd: [[H7462]] and the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] These [[H428]] have no [[H3808]] master: [[H113]] let them return [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] to his house [[H1004]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 18
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] Did I not [[H3808]] tell [[H559]] thee that he would prophesy [[H5012]] no [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] concerning [[H5921]] me, but [[H3588]] evil? [[H7451]]

### 19
And he said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] thou therefore [[H3651]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] I saw [[H7200]] the Lord [[H3068]] sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] standing [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] him on his right hand [[H3225]] and on his left. [[H8040]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall persuade [[H6601]] Ahab, [[H256]] that he may go up [[H5927]] and fall [[H5307]] at Ramoth-gilead? [[H7433]] And one [[H2088]] said [[H559]] on this manner, [[H3541]] and another [[H2088]] said [[H559]] on that manner. [[H3541]]

### 21
And there came forth [[H3318]] a spirit, [[H7307]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] will persuade [[H6601]] him. [[H6601]]

### 22
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Wherewith? [[H4100]] And he said, [[H559]] I will go forth, [[H3318]] and I will be [[H1961]] a lying [[H8267]] spirit [[H7307]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of all [[H3605]] his prophets. [[H5030]] And he said, [[H559]] Thou shalt persuade [[H6601]] and prevail [[H3201]] also: [[H1571]] go forth, [[H3318]] and do [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]]

### 23
Now [[H6258]] therefore, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath put [[H5414]] a lying [[H8267]] spirit [[H7307]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] thy prophets, [[H5030]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] evil [[H7451]] concerning thee. [[H5921]]

### 24
But Zedekiah [[H6667]] the son [[H1121]] of Chenaanah [[H3668]] went near, [[H5066]] and smote [[H5221]] Micaiah [[H4321]] on [[H5921]] the cheek, [[H3895]] and said, [[H559]] Which way [[H335]] went [[H5674]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] from me to speak [[H1696]] unto thee? [[H854]]

### 25
And Micaiah [[H4321]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] when [[H834]] thou shalt go into [[H935]] an inner [[H2315]] chamber [[H2315]] to hide thyself. [[H2247]]

### 26
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] Micaiah, [[H4321]] and carry him back [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] Amon [[H526]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city, [[H5892]] and to [[H413]] Joash [[H3101]] the king's [[H4428]] son; [[H1121]]

### 27
And say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] Put [[H7760]] this [[H2088]] in the prison, [[H1004]] and feed [[H398]] him with bread [[H3899]] of affliction [[H3906]] and with water [[H4325]] of affliction, [[H3906]] until [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 28
And Micaiah [[H4321]] said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou return [[H7725]] at all [[H7725]] in peace, [[H7965]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] by me. And he said, [[H559]] Hearken, [[H8085]] O people, [[H5971]] every [[H3605]] one of you. [[H3605]]

### 29
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went up [[H5927]] to Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]]

### 30
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] I will disguise myself, [[H2664]] and enter [[H935]] into the battle; [[H4421]] but put on [[H3847]] thou [[H859]] thy robes. [[H899]] And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] disguised himself, [[H2664]] and went [[H935]] into the battle. [[H4421]]

### 31
But the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] commanded [[H6680]] his thirty [[H7970]] and two [[H8147]] captains [[H8269]] that had rule over his [[H834]] chariots, [[H7393]] saying, [[H559]] Fight [[H3898]] neither [[H3808]] with [[H854]] small [[H6996]] nor great, [[H1419]] save [[H3588]] only [[H905]] with [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 32
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the captains [[H8269]] of the chariots [[H7393]] saw [[H7200]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] that they [[H1992]] said, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] it [[H1931]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And they turned aside [[H5493]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] him: and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] cried out. [[H2199]]

### 33
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the captains [[H8269]] of the chariots [[H7393]] perceived [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they turned back [[H7725]] from pursuing [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 34
And a man [[H376]] drew [[H4900]] a bow [[H7198]] at a venture, [[H8537]] and smote [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] between [[H996]] the joints [[H1694]] of the harness: [[H8302]] wherefore he said [[H559]] unto the driver of his chariot, [[H7395]] Turn [[H2015]] thine hand, [[H3027]] and carry me out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the host; [[H4264]] for [[H3588]] I am wounded. [[H2470]]

### 35
And the battle [[H4421]] increased [[H5927]] that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] and the king [[H4428]] was [[H1961]] stayed up [[H5975]] in his chariot [[H4818]] against [[H5227]] the Syrians, [[H758]] and died [[H4191]] at even: [[H6153]] and the blood [[H1818]] ran out [[H3332]] of the wound [[H4347]] into [[H413]] the midst [[H2436]] of the chariot. [[H7393]]

### 36
And there went [[H5674]] a proclamation [[H7440]] throughout the host [[H4264]] about the going down [[H935]] of the sun, [[H8121]] saying, [[H559]] Every man [[H376]] to [[H413]] his city, [[H5892]] and every man [[H376]] to [[H413]] his own country. [[H776]]

### 37
So the king [[H4428]] died, [[H4191]] and was brought [[H935]] to Samaria; [[H8111]] and they buried [[H6912]] the king [[H4428]] in Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 38
And washed [[H7857]] the chariot [[H7393]] in [[H5921]] the pool [[H1295]] of Samaria; [[H8111]] and the dogs [[H3611]] licked up [[H3952]] his blood; [[H1818]] and they washed [[H7364]] his armour; [[H2185]] according unto the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake. [[H1696]]

### 39
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Ahab, [[H256]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and the ivory [[H8127]] house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] he made, [[H1129]] and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] he built, [[H1129]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 40
So Ahab [[H256]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers; [[H1]] and Ahaziah [[H274]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 41
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the son [[H1121]] of Asa [[H609]] began to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] in the fourth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 42
Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] thirty [[H7970]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign; [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Azubah [[H5806]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Shilhi. [[H7977]]

### 43
And he walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] of Asa [[H609]] his father; [[H1]] he turned not aside [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] it, doing [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] nevertheless [[H389]] the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] taken away; [[H5493]] the people [[H5971]] offered [[H2076]] and burnt incense [[H6999]] yet [[H5750]] in the high places. [[H1116]]

### 44
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] made peace [[H7999]] with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 45
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] and his might [[H1369]] that [[H834]] he shewed, [[H6213]] and how [[H834]] he warred, [[H3898]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 46
And the remnant [[H3499]] of the sodomites, [[H6945]] which [[H834]] remained [[H7604]] in the days [[H3117]] of his father [[H1]] Asa, [[H609]] he took [[H1197]] out of [[H4480]] the land. [[H776]]

### 47
then no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Edom: [[H123]] a deputy [[H5324]] king. [[H4428]]

### 48
Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] made [[H6213]] ships [[H591]] of Tharshish [[H8659]] to go [[H1980]] to Ophir [[H211]] for gold: [[H2091]] but they went [[H1980]] not; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] the ships [[H591]] were broken [[H7665]] at Ezion-geber. [[H6100]]

### 49
Then [[H227]] said [[H559]] Ahaziah [[H274]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] unto [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] Let my servants [[H5650]] go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] thy servants [[H5650]] in the ships. [[H591]] But Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] would [[H14]] not. [[H3808]]

### 50
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] his father: [[H1]] and Jehoram [[H3088]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 51
Ahaziah [[H274]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] began to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Samaria [[H8111]] the seventeenth [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and reigned [[H4427]] two years [[H8141]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 52
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of his father, [[H1]] and in the way [[H1870]] of his mother, [[H517]] and in the way [[H1870]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] who [[H834]] made Israel [[H3478]] to sin: [[H2398]]

### 53
For he served [[H5647]] Baal, [[H1168]] and worshipped [[H7812]] him, and provoked to anger [[H3707]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]]
