### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] many [[H7227]] days, [[H3117]] that the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Elijah [[H452]] in the third [[H7992]] year, [[H8141]] saying, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] shew thyself [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] Ahab; [[H256]] and I will send [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] upon [[H6440]] the earth. [[H127]]

### 2
And Elijah [[H452]] went [[H1980]] to shew himself [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] Ahab. [[H256]] And a sore [[H2389]] famine [[H7458]] in Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 3
And Ahab [[H256]] called [[H7121]] Obadiah, [[H5662]] which [[H834]] the governor [[H5921]] of house. [[H1004]] (Now Obadiah [[H5662]] feared [[H3373]] the Lord [[H3068]] greatly: [[H3966]]

### 4
For it was [[H1961]] when Jezebel [[H348]] cut off [[H3772]] the prophets [[H5030]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that Obadiah [[H5662]] took [[H3947]] an hundred [[H3967]] prophets, [[H5030]] and hid [[H2244]] them by fifty [[H376]] in a cave, [[H4631]] and fed [[H3557]] them with bread [[H3899]] and water.) [[H4325]]

### 5
And Ahab [[H256]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Obadiah, [[H5662]] Go [[H1980]] into the land, [[H776]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] fountains [[H4599]] of water, [[H4325]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] brooks: [[H5158]] peradventure [[H194]] we may find [[H4672]] grass [[H2682]] to save [[H2421]] the horses [[H5483]] and mules [[H6505]] alive, that we lose [[H3772]] not [[H3808]] all the beasts. [[H929]]

### 6
So they divided [[H2505]] the land [[H776]] between them to pass throughout [[H5674]] it: Ahab [[H256]] went [[H1980]] one [[H259]] way [[H1870]] by himself, [[H905]] and Obadiah [[H5662]] went [[H1980]] another [[H259]] way [[H1870]] by himself. [[H905]]

### 7
And as Obadiah [[H5662]] was [[H1961]] in the way, [[H1870]] behold, [[H2009]] Elijah [[H452]] met [[H7125]] him: and he knew [[H5234]] him, and fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] his face, [[H6440]] and said, [[H559]] thou [[H859]] that [[H2088]] my lord [[H113]] Elijah? [[H452]]

### 8
And he answered [[H559]] him, I [[H589]] go, [[H1980]] tell [[H559]] thy lord, [[H113]] Behold, [[H2009]] Elijah [[H452]]

### 9
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have I sinned, [[H2398]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] wouldest deliver [[H5414]] thy servant [[H5650]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Ahab, [[H256]] to slay [[H4191]] me? [[H4191]]

### 10
the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] liveth, [[H2416]] there is no [[H3426]] nation [[H1471]] or kingdom, [[H4467]] whither [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] hath not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] to seek [[H1245]] thee: and when they said, [[H559]] not [[H369]] he took an oath [[H7650]]  of [[H853]] the kingdom [[H4467]] and nation, [[H1471]] that [[H3588]] they found [[H4672]] thee not. [[H3808]]

### 11
And now [[H6258]] thou [[H859]] sayest, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] tell [[H559]] thy lord, [[H113]] Behold, [[H2009]] Elijah [[H452]]

### 12
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] I [[H589]] am gone [[H1980]] from [[H853]] thee, that the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall carry [[H5375]] thee whither [[H5921]] I know [[H3045]] not; [[H3808]] and when I come [[H935]] and tell [[H5046]] Ahab, [[H256]] and he cannot [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] thee, he shall slay [[H2026]] me: but I thy servant [[H5650]] fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] from my youth. [[H5271]]

### 13
Was it not [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] my lord [[H113]] what [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] when Jezebel [[H348]] slew [[H2026]] the prophets [[H5030]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] how I hid [[H2244]] an hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] prophets [[H5030]] by fifty [[H2572]] in a cave, [[H4631]] and fed [[H3557]] them with bread [[H3899]] and water? [[H4325]]

### 14
And now [[H6258]] thou [[H859]] sayest, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] tell [[H559]] thy lord, [[H113]] Behold, [[H2009]] Elijah [[H452]] and he shall slay [[H2026]] me. [[H2026]]

### 15
And Elijah [[H452]] said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] liveth, [[H2416]] before [[H6440]] whom [[H834]] I stand, [[H5975]] I will surely [[H3588]] shew myself [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him to day. [[H3117]]

### 16
So Obadiah [[H5662]] went [[H1980]] to meet [[H7125]] Ahab, [[H256]] and told [[H5046]] him: and Ahab [[H256]] went [[H1980]] to meet [[H7125]] Elijah. [[H452]]

### 17
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Ahab [[H256]] saw [[H7200]] Elijah, [[H452]] that Ahab [[H256]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, thou [[H859]] he that [[H2088]] troubleth [[H5916]] Israel? [[H3478]]

### 18
And he answered, [[H559]] I have not [[H3808]] troubled [[H5916]] Israel; [[H3478]] but [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] and thy father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] in that ye have forsaken [[H5800]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and thou hast followed [[H1980]] Baalim. [[H1168]]

### 19
Now [[H6258]] therefore send, [[H7971]] gather [[H6908]] to [[H413]]  me [[H853]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] mount [[H2022]] Carmel, [[H3760]] and the prophets [[H5030]] of Baal [[H1168]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and fifty, [[H2572]] and the prophets [[H5030]] of the groves [[H842]] four [[H702]] hundred, [[H3967]] which eat [[H398]] at Jezebel's [[H348]] table. [[H7979]]

### 20
So Ahab [[H256]] sent [[H7971]] unto all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and gathered together [[H6908]] the prophets [[H5030]] unto [[H413]] mount [[H2022]] Carmel. [[H3760]]

### 21
And Elijah [[H452]] came [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] and said, [[H559]] How long [[H5704]] halt [[H6452]] ye [[H859]] between [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] opinions? [[H5587]] if [[H518]] the Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] follow [[H1980]] him: but if [[H518]] Baal, [[H1168]] follow [[H1980]] him. And the people [[H5971]] answered [[H6030]] him not [[H3808]] a word. [[H1697]]

### 22
Then said [[H559]] Elijah [[H452]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] I, [[H589]] I only, [[H905]] remain [[H3498]] a prophet [[H5030]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] but Baal's [[H1168]] prophets [[H5030]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] men. [[H376]]

### 23
Let them therefore give [[H5414]] us two [[H8147]] bullocks; [[H6499]] and let them choose [[H977]] one [[H259]] bullock [[H6499]] for themselves, and cut it in pieces, [[H5408]] and lay [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] wood, [[H6086]] and put [[H7760]] no [[H3808]] fire [[H784]] and I [[H589]] will dress [[H6213]] the other [[H259]] bullock, [[H6499]] and lay [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] wood, [[H6086]] and put [[H7760]] no [[H3808]] fire [[H784]]

### 24
And call [[H7121]] ye on the name [[H8034]] of your gods, [[H430]] and I [[H589]] will call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and the God [[H430]] that [[H834]] answereth [[H6030]] by fire, [[H784]] let him [[H1931]] be [[H1961]] God. [[H430]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] It is well [[H2896]] spoken. [[H1697]]

### 25
And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] unto the prophets [[H5030]] of Baal, [[H1168]] Choose [[H977]] you one [[H259]] bullock [[H6499]] for yourselves, and dress [[H6213]] first; [[H7223]] for [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] many; [[H7227]] and call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of your gods, [[H430]] but put [[H7760]] no [[H3808]] fire [[H784]]

### 26
And they took [[H3947]] the bullock [[H6499]] which [[H834]] was given [[H5414]] them, and they dressed [[H6213]] and called [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of Baal [[H1168]] from morning [[H1242]] even until [[H5704]] noon, [[H6672]] saying, [[H559]] O Baal, [[H1168]] hear [[H6030]] us. But no [[H369]] voice, [[H6963]] nor [[H369]] any that answered. [[H6030]] And they leaped [[H6452]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] which [[H834]] was made. [[H6213]]

### 27
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at noon, [[H6672]] that Elijah [[H452]] mocked [[H2048]] them, and said, [[H559]] Cry [[H7121]] aloud: [[H1419]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] a god; [[H430]] either [[H3588]] he is talking, [[H7879]] or [[H3588]] he is pursuing, [[H7873]] or [[H3588]] he is in a journey, [[H1870]] peradventure [[H194]] he [[H1931]] sleepeth, [[H3463]] and must be awaked. [[H3364]]

### 28
And they cried [[H7121]] aloud, [[H6963]] and cut themselves [[H1413]] after their manner [[H4941]] with knives [[H2719]] and lancets, [[H7420]] till [[H5704]] the blood [[H1818]] gushed out [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 29
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when midday [[H6672]] was past, [[H5674]] and they prophesied [[H5012]] until [[H5704]] the of the offering [[H5927]] of the sacrifice, [[H4503]] that neither [[H369]] voice, [[H6963]] nor [[H369]] any to answer, [[H6030]] nor [[H369]] any that regarded. [[H7182]]

### 30
And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] unto all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] Come near [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] me. And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] came near [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] him. And he repaired [[H7495]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] broken down. [[H2040]]

### 31
And Elijah [[H452]] took [[H3947]] twelve [[H8147]] stones, [[H68]] according to the number [[H4557]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] unto [[H413]] whom [[H834]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came, [[H1961]] saying, [[H559]] Israel [[H3478]] shall be [[H1961]] thy name: [[H8034]]

### 32
And with [[H854]] the stones [[H68]] he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and he made [[H6213]] a trench [[H8585]] about [[H5439]] the altar, [[H4196]] as great as would contain [[H1004]] two measures [[H5429]] of seed. [[H2233]]

### 33
And he put [[H6186]] the wood [[H6086]] in order, and cut [[H5408]] the bullock [[H6499]] in pieces, and laid [[H7760]] on the wood, [[H5921]] and said, [[H559]] Fill [[H4390]] four [[H702]] barrels [[H3537]] with water, [[H4325]] and pour [[H3332]] on [[H5921]] the burnt sacrifice, [[H5930]] and on [[H5921]] the wood. [[H6086]]

### 34
And he said, [[H559]] Do the second time. [[H8138]] And they did the second time. [[H8138]] And he said, [[H559]] Do the third time. [[H8027]] And they did the third time. [[H8027]]

### 35
And the water [[H4325]] ran [[H1980]] round about [[H5439]] the altar; [[H4196]] and he filled [[H4390]] the trench [[H8585]] also [[H1571]] with water. [[H4325]]

### 36
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the offering [[H5927]] of the sacrifice, [[H4503]] that Elijah [[H452]] the prophet [[H5030]] came near, [[H5066]] and said, [[H559]] Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and of Israel, [[H3478]] let it be known [[H3045]] this day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] God [[H430]] in Israel, [[H3478]] and I [[H589]] thy servant, [[H5650]] and I have done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] at thy word. [[H1697]]

### 37
Hear [[H6030]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] hear [[H6030]] me, that this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] the Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] and thou [[H859]] hast turned [[H5437]] their heart [[H3820]] back again. [[H322]]

### 38
Then the fire [[H784]] of the Lord [[H3068]] fell, [[H5307]] and consumed [[H398]] the burnt sacrifice, [[H5930]] and the wood, [[H6086]] and the stones, [[H68]] and the dust, [[H6083]] and licked up [[H3897]] the water [[H4325]] that [[H834]] in the trench. [[H8585]]

### 39
And when all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] they fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] their faces: [[H6440]] and they said, [[H559]] The Lord, [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] the God; [[H430]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] the God. [[H430]]

### 40
And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] unto them, Take [[H8610]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Baal; [[H1168]] let not [[H408]] one [[H376]] of them escape. [[H4422]] And they took [[H8610]] them: and Elijah [[H452]] brought them down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the brook [[H5158]] Kishon, [[H7028]] and slew [[H7819]] them there. [[H8033]]

### 41
And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] unto Ahab, [[H256]] Get thee up, [[H5927]] eat [[H398]] and drink; [[H8354]] for [[H3588]] a sound [[H6963]] of abundance [[H1995]] of rain. [[H1653]]

### 42
So Ahab [[H256]] went up [[H5927]] to eat [[H398]] and to drink. [[H8354]] And Elijah [[H452]] went up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of Carmel; [[H3760]] and he cast himself down [[H1457]] upon the earth, [[H776]] and put [[H7760]] his face [[H6440]] between [[H996]] his knees, [[H1290]]

### 43
And said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servant, [[H5288]] Go up [[H5927]] now, [[H4994]] look [[H5027]] toward [[H1870]] the sea. [[H3220]] And he went up, [[H5927]] and looked, [[H5027]] and said, [[H559]] nothing. [[H3972]] And he said, [[H559]] Go again [[H7725]] seven [[H7651]] times. [[H6471]]

### 44
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the seventh time, [[H7637]] that he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] there ariseth [[H5927]] a little [[H6996]] cloud [[H5645]] out of the sea, [[H3220]] like a man's [[H376]] hand. [[H3709]] And he said, [[H559]] Go up, [[H5927]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Ahab, [[H256]] Prepare [[H631]] and get thee down, [[H3381]] that the rain [[H1653]] stop [[H6113]] thee not. [[H3808]]

### 45
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the mean while, [[H3541]] that the heaven [[H8064]] was black [[H6937]] with clouds [[H5645]] and wind, [[H7307]] and there was [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] rain. [[H1653]] And Ahab [[H256]] rode, [[H7392]] and went [[H1980]] to Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 46
And the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] on [[H413]] Elijah; [[H452]] and he girded up [[H8151]] his loins, [[H4975]] and ran [[H7323]] before [[H6440]] Ahab [[H256]] to [[H5704]] the entrance [[H935]] of Jezreel. [[H3157]]
