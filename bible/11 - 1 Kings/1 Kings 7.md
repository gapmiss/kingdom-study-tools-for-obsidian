[[H5178]] And he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Solomon, [[H8010]] and wrought [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] his work. [[H4399]]

### 15
For he cast [[H6696]] two [[H8147]] pillars [[H5982]] of brass, [[H5178]] of eighteen [[H8083]] cubits [[H520]] high [[H6967]] apiece: [[H5982]] and a line [[H2339]] of twelve [[H8147]] cubits [[H520]] did compass [[H5437]] either [[H8145]]  of them about. [[H853]]

### 16
And he made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] chapiters [[H3805]] molten [[H3332]] brass, [[H5178]] to set [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] the tops [[H7218]] of the pillars: [[H5982]] the height [[H6967]] of the one [[H259]] chapiter [[H3805]] five [[H2568]] cubits, [[H520]] and the height [[H6967]] of the other [[H8145]] chapiter [[H3805]] five [[H2568]] cubits: [[H520]]

[[H3805]]

### 18
And he made [[H6213]] the pillars, [[H5982]] and two [[H8147]] rows [[H2905]] round about [[H5439]] upon [[H5921]] the one [[H259]] network, [[H7639]] to cover [[H3680]] the chapiters [[H3805]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the top, [[H7218]] with pomegranates: [[H7416]] and so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] he for the other [[H8145]] chapiter. [[H3805]]

### 19
And the chapiters [[H3805]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of the pillars [[H5982]] of lily [[H7799]] work [[H4639]] in the porch, [[H197]] four [[H702]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 20
And the chapiters [[H3805]] upon [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] pillars [[H5982]] also [[H1571]] above, [[H4605]] over against [[H5980]] the belly [[H990]] which [[H834]] by [[H5676]] the network: [[H7639]] and the pomegranates [[H7416]] two hundred [[H3967]] in rows [[H2905]] round about [[H5439]] upon [[H5921]] the other [[H8145]] chapiter. [[H3805]]

### 21
And he set up [[H6965]] the pillars [[H5982]] in the porch [[H197]] of the temple: [[H1964]] and he set up [[H6965]] the right [[H3233]] pillar, [[H5982]] and called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] thereof Jachin: [[H3199]] and he set up [[H6965]] the left [[H8042]] pillar, [[H5982]] and called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] thereof Boaz. [[H1162]]

### 22
And upon [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of the pillars [[H5982]] lily [[H7799]] work: [[H4639]] so was the work [[H4399]] of the pillars [[H5982]] finished. [[H8552]]

### 23
And he made [[H6213]] a molten [[H3332]] sea, [[H3220]] ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] from the one brim [[H8193]] to [[H5704]] the other: round [[H5696]] all about, [[H5439]] and his height [[H6967]] five [[H2568]] cubits: [[H520]] and a line [[H6957]] of thirty [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] did compass [[H5437]] it round about. [[H5439]]

### 24
And under [[H8478]] the brim [[H8193]] of it round about [[H5439]] knops [[H6497]] compassing [[H5437]] it, ten [[H6235]] in a cubit, [[H520]] compassing [[H5362]] the sea [[H3220]] round about: [[H5439]] the knops [[H6497]] cast [[H3333]] in two [[H8147]] rows, [[H2905]] when it was cast. [[H3332]]

### 25
It stood [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] twelve [[H8147]] oxen, [[H1241]] three [[H7969]] looking [[H6437]] toward the north, [[H6828]] and three [[H7969]] looking [[H6437]] toward the west, [[H3220]] and three [[H7969]] looking [[H6437]] toward the south, [[H5045]] and three [[H7969]] looking [[H6437]] toward the east: [[H4217]] and the sea [[H3220]] above [[H4605]] upon [[H5921]] them, and all [[H3605]] their hinder parts [[H268]] inward. [[H1004]]

### 26
And it an hand breadth [[H2947]] thick, [[H5672]] and the brim [[H8193]] thereof was wrought [[H4639]] like the brim [[H8193]] of a cup, [[H3563]] with flowers [[H6525]] of lilies: [[H7799]] it contained [[H3557]] two thousand [[H505]] baths. [[H1324]]

### 27
And he made [[H6213]] ten [[H6235]] bases [[H4350]] of brass; [[H5178]] four [[H702]] cubits [[H520]] the length [[H753]] of one [[H259]] base, [[H4350]] and four [[H702]] cubits [[H520]] the breadth [[H7341]] thereof, and three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] the height [[H6967]] of it. [[H6967]]

### 28
And the work [[H4639]] of the bases [[H4350]] on this [[H2088]] they had borders, [[H4526]] and the borders [[H4526]] between [[H996]] the ledges: [[H7948]]

### 29
And on [[H5921]] the borders [[H4526]] that [[H834]] between [[H996]] the ledges [[H7948]] lions, [[H738]] oxen, [[H1241]] and cherubims: [[H3742]] and upon [[H5921]] the ledges [[H7948]] a base [[H3653]] above: [[H4605]] and beneath [[H8478]] the lions [[H738]] and oxen [[H1241]] certain additions [[H3914]] made of thin [[H4174]] work. [[H4639]]

### 30
And every [[H259]] base [[H4350]] had four [[H702]] brasen [[H5178]] wheels, [[H212]] and plates [[H5633]] of brass: [[H5178]] and the four [[H702]] corners [[H6471]] thereof had undersetters: [[H3802]] under [[H8478]] the laver [[H3595]] undersetters [[H3802]] molten, [[H3332]] at the side [[H5676]] of every [[H376]] addition. [[H3914]]

### 31
And the mouth [[H6310]] of it within [[H1004]] the chapiter [[H3805]] and above [[H4605]] a cubit: [[H520]] but the mouth [[H6310]] thereof round [[H5696]] the work [[H4639]] of the base, [[H3653]] a cubit [[H520]] and an half: [[H2677]] and also [[H1571]] upon [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of it gravings [[H4734]] with their borders, [[H4526]] foursquare, [[H7251]] not [[H3808]] round. [[H5696]]

### 32
And under [[H8478]] the borders [[H4526]] four [[H702]] wheels; [[H212]] and the axletrees [[H3027]] of the wheels [[H212]] to the base: [[H4350]] and the height [[H6967]] of a [[H259]] wheel [[H212]] a cubit [[H520]] and half [[H2677]] a cubit. [[H520]]

### 33
And the work [[H4639]] of the wheels [[H212]] like the work [[H4639]] of a chariot [[H4818]] wheel: [[H212]] their axletrees, [[H3027]] and their naves, [[H1354]] and their felloes, [[H2839]] and their spokes, [[H2840]] all [[H3605]] molten. [[H3332]]

### 34
And four [[H702]] undersetters [[H3802]] to [[H413]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H6438]] of one [[H259]] base: [[H4350]] the undersetters [[H3802]] of [[H4480]] the very base [[H4350]] itself. [[H4350]]

### 35
And in the top [[H7218]] of the base [[H4350]] a round [[H5696]] compass [[H5439]] of half [[H2677]] a cubit [[H520]] high: [[H6967]] and on [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of the base [[H4350]] the ledges [[H3027]] thereof and the borders [[H4526]] thereof of [[H4480]] the same. [[H4480]]

### 36
For on [[H5921]] the plates [[H3871]] of the ledges [[H3027]] thereof, and on [[H5921]] the borders [[H4526]] thereof, he graved [[H6605]] cherubims, [[H3742]] lions, [[H738]] and palm trees, [[H8561]] according to the proportion [[H4626]] of every one, [[H376]] and additions [[H3914]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 37
After this [[H2063]] he made [[H6213]] the ten [[H6235]] bases: [[H4350]] all [[H3605]] of them had one [[H259]] casting, [[H4165]] one [[H259]] measure, [[H4060]] one [[H259]] size. [[H7095]]

### 38
Then made [[H6213]] he ten [[H6235]] lavers [[H3595]] of brass: [[H5178]] one [[H259]] laver [[H3595]] contained [[H3557]] forty [[H705]] baths: [[H1324]] every [[H259]] laver [[H3595]] was four [[H702]] cubits: [[H520]] upon [[H5921]] every one [[H259]] of the ten [[H6235]] bases [[H4350]] one [[H259]] laver. [[H3595]]

### 39
And he put [[H5414]] five [[H2568]] bases [[H4350]] on [[H5921]] the right [[H3225]] side [[H3802]] of the house, [[H1004]] and five [[H2568]] on [[H5921]] the left [[H8040]] side [[H3802]] of the house: [[H1004]] and he set [[H5414]] the sea [[H3220]] on the right [[H3233]] side [[H3802]] of the house [[H1004]] eastward [[H6924]] over against [[H4136]] the south. [[H5045]]

### 40
And Hiram [[H2438]] made [[H6213]] the lavers, [[H3595]] and the shovels, [[H3257]] and the basons. [[H4219]] So Hiram [[H2438]] made an end [[H3615]] of doing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] that [[H834]] he made [[H6213]] king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] for the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 43
And the ten [[H6235]] bases, [[H4350]] and ten [[H6235]] lavers [[H3595]] on [[H5921]] the bases; [[H4350]]

### 44
And one [[H259]] sea, [[H3220]] and twelve [[H8147]] oxen [[H1241]] under [[H8478]] the sea; [[H3220]]

### 45
And the pots, [[H5518]] and the shovels, [[H3257]] and the basons: [[H4219]] and all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] vessels, [[H3627]] which [[H834]] Hiram [[H2438]] made [[H6213]] to king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] for the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] bright [[H4803]] brass. [[H5178]]

### 46
In the plain [[H3603]] of Jordan [[H3383]] did the king [[H4428]] cast [[H3332]] them, in the clay [[H4568]] ground [[H127]] between [[H996]] Succoth [[H5523]] and Zarthan. [[H6891]]

### 47
And Solomon [[H8010]] left [[H3240]] all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] because they were exceeding [[H3966]] many: [[H7230]] neither [[H3808]] was the weight [[H4948]] of the brass [[H5178]] found out. [[H2713]]

### 48
And Solomon [[H8010]] made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] that [[H834]] unto the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] the altar [[H4196]] of gold, [[H2091]] and the table [[H7979]] of gold, [[H2091]] whereupon [[H834]] the shewbread [[H3899]]

[[H1964]]

### 51
So was ended [[H7999]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] that [[H834]] king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] made [[H6213]] for the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And Solomon [[H8010]] brought in [[H935]] the things which David [[H1732]] his father [[H1]] had dedicated; [[H6944]] the silver, [[H3701]] and the gold, [[H2091]] and the vessels, [[H3627]] did he put [[H5414]] among the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
