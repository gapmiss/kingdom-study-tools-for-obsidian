[[H8354]]

### 11
And as she was going [[H1980]] to fetch [[H3947]] he called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] her, and said, [[H559]] Bring [[H3947]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] a morsel [[H6595]] of bread [[H3899]] in thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 12
And she said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] liveth, [[H2416]] I have [[H3426]] not [[H518]] a cake, [[H4580]] but [[H3588]] an handful [[H4393]] of meal [[H7058]] in a barrel, [[H3537]] and a little [[H4592]] oil [[H8081]] in a cruse: [[H6835]] and, behold, [[H2005]] I gathering [[H7197]] two [[H8147]] sticks, [[H6086]] that I may go in [[H935]] and dress [[H6213]] it for me and my son, [[H1121]] that we may eat [[H398]] it, and die.

[[H1121]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] The barrel [[H3537]] of meal [[H7058]] shall not [[H3808]] waste, [[H3615]] neither [[H3808]] shall the cruse [[H6835]] of oil [[H8081]] fail, [[H2637]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] sendeth [[H5414]] rain [[H1653]] upon [[H6440]] the earth. [[H127]]
