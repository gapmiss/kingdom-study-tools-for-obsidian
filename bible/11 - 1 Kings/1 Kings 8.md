### 1
Then [[H227]] Solomon [[H8010]] assembled [[H6950]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]]  and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the heads [[H7218]] of the tribes, [[H4294]] the chief [[H5387]] of the fathers [[H1]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that they might bring up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] out of the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] which [[H1931]] Zion. [[H6726]]

### 2
And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] assembled themselves [[H6950]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] at the feast [[H2282]] in the month [[H3391]] Ethanim, [[H388]] which [[H1931]] the seventh [[H7637]] month. [[H2320]]

### 3
And all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] came, [[H935]] and the priests [[H3548]] took up [[H5375]] the ark. [[H727]]

### 4
And they brought up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and all [[H3605]] the holy [[H6944]] vessels [[H3627]] that [[H834]] in the tabernacle, [[H168]] even those did the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites [[H3881]] bring up. [[H5927]]

### 5
And king [[H4428]] Solomon, [[H8010]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that were assembled [[H3259]] unto [[H5921]] him, with [[H854]] him before [[H6440]] the ark, [[H727]] sacrificing [[H2076]] sheep [[H6629]] and oxen, [[H1241]] that [[H834]] could not [[H3808]] be told [[H5608]] nor [[H3808]] numbered [[H4487]] for multitude. [[H7230]]

### 6
And the priests [[H3548]] brought in [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] his place, [[H4725]] into [[H413]] the oracle [[H1687]] of the house, [[H1004]] to [[H413]] the most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] under [[H413]] the wings [[H3671]] of the cherubims. [[H3742]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the cherubims [[H3742]] spread forth [[H6566]] two wings [[H3671]] over [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of the ark, [[H727]] and the cherubims [[H3742]] covered [[H5526]] the ark [[H727]] and the staves [[H905]] thereof above. [[H4605]]

### 8
And they drew out [[H748]] the staves, [[H905]] that the ends [[H7218]] of the staves [[H905]] were seen out [[H7200]] in the holy [[H6944]] before [[H6440]] the oracle, [[H1687]] and they were not [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] without: [[H2351]] and there [[H8033]] they are [[H1961]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 9
nothing [[H369]] in the ark [[H727]] save [[H7535]] the two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone, [[H68]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] put [[H3240]] there [[H8033]] at Horeb, [[H2722]] when [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] when they came out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 10
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the priests [[H3548]] were come out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the holy [[H6944]] that the cloud [[H6051]] filled [[H4390]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 11
So that the priests [[H3548]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] stand [[H5975]] to minister [[H8334]] because [[H6440]] of the cloud: [[H6051]] for [[H3588]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] had filled [[H4390]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
Then [[H227]] spake [[H559]] Solomon, [[H8010]] The Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] that he would dwell [[H7931]] in the thick darkness. [[H6205]]

### 13
I have surely [[H1129]] built [[H1129]] thee an house [[H1004]] to dwell in, [[H2073]] a settled place [[H4349]] for thee to abide in [[H3427]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 14
And the king [[H4428]] turned [[H5437]] his face [[H6440]] about, and blessed [[H1288]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel: [[H3478]] (and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] stood;) [[H5975]]

### 15
And he said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] spake [[H1696]] with his mouth [[H6310]] unto [[H854]] David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] and hath with his hand [[H3027]] fulfilled [[H4390]] saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] I brought forth [[H3318]] my people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] I chose [[H977]] no [[H3808]] city [[H5892]] out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] to build [[H1129]] an house, [[H1004]] that my name [[H8034]] might be [[H1961]] therein; [[H8033]] but I chose [[H977]] David [[H1732]] to be [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
And it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] the heart [[H3824]] of David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 18
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] Whereas [[H3282]] it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] thine heart [[H3824]] to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] unto my name, [[H8034]] thou didst well [[H2895]] that [[H3588]] it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] thine heart. [[H3824]]

### 19
Nevertheless [[H7535]] thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] the house; [[H1004]] but [[H3588]] thy son [[H1121]] that shall come forth out [[H3318]] of thy loins, [[H2504]] he [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] unto my name. [[H8034]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] hath performed [[H6965]] his word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he spake, [[H1696]] and I am risen up [[H6965]] in the room [[H8478]] of David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] and sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] promised, [[H1696]] and have built [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 21
And I have set [[H7760]] there [[H8033]] a place [[H4725]] for the ark, [[H727]] wherein [[H834]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] our fathers, [[H1]] when he brought them out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 22
And Solomon [[H8010]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the presence of [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and spread forth [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] toward heaven: [[H8064]]

### 23
And he said, [[H559]] Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] no [[H369]] God [[H430]] like thee, [[H3644]] in heaven [[H8064]] above, [[H4605]] or on [[H5921]] earth [[H776]] beneath, [[H8478]] who keepest [[H8104]] covenant [[H1285]] and mercy [[H2617]] with thy servants [[H5650]] that walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee with all [[H3605]] their heart: [[H3820]]

### 24
Who [[H834]] hast kept [[H8104]] with thy servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] that [[H834]] thou promisedst [[H1696]] him: thou spakest [[H1696]] also with thy mouth, [[H6310]] and hast fulfilled [[H4390]] with thine hand, [[H3027]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 25
Therefore now, [[H6258]] Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] keep [[H8104]] with thy servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] that [[H834]] thou promisedst [[H1696]] him, saying, [[H559]] There shall not [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] thee a man [[H376]] in my sight [[H6440]] to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel; [[H3478]] so [[H7535]] that [[H518]] thy children [[H1121]] take heed to [[H8104]] their way, [[H1870]] that they walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] me as [[H834]] thou hast walked [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] me. [[H6440]]

### 26
And now, [[H6258]] O God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] let thy word, [[H1697]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] be verified, [[H539]] which [[H834]] thou spakest [[H1696]] unto thy servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] my father. [[H1]]

### 27
But [[H3588]] will God [[H430]] indeed [[H552]] dwell [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the earth? [[H776]] behold, [[H2009]] the heaven [[H8064]] and heaven [[H8064]] of heavens [[H8064]] cannot [[H3808]] contain [[H3557]] thee; how much less [[H637]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] I have builded? [[H1129]]

### 28
Yet have thou respect [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] the prayer [[H8605]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] and to [[H413]] his supplication, [[H8467]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] to hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] the cry [[H7440]] and to [[H413]] the prayer, [[H8605]] which [[H834]] thy servant [[H5650]] prayeth [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] thee to day: [[H3117]]

### 29
That thine eyes [[H5869]] may be [[H1961]] open [[H6605]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] night [[H3915]] and day, [[H3117]] toward [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of which [[H834]] thou hast said, [[H559]] My name [[H8034]] shall be [[H1961]] there: [[H8033]] that thou mayest hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] the prayer [[H8605]] which [[H834]] thy servant [[H5650]] shall make [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 30
And hearken [[H8085]] thou to [[H413]] the supplication [[H8467]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] and of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] when [[H834]] they shall pray [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place: [[H4725]] and hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] in [[H413]] heaven [[H8064]] thy dwelling [[H3427]] place: [[H4725]] and when thou hearest, [[H8085]] forgive. [[H5545]]

### 31
If [[H834]] any man [[H376]] trespass [[H2398]] against his neighbour, [[H7453]] and an oath [[H423]] be laid [[H5375]] upon him to cause him to swear, [[H422]] and the oath [[H423]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] thine altar [[H4196]] in this [[H2088]] house: [[H1004]]

### 32
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] in heaven, [[H8064]] and do, [[H6213]] and judge [[H8199]] thy servants, [[H5650]] condemning [[H7561]] the wicked, [[H7563]] to bring [[H5414]] his way [[H1870]] upon his head; [[H7218]] and justifying [[H6663]] the righteous, [[H6662]] to give [[H5414]] him according to his righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 33
When thy people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] be smitten down [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] the enemy, [[H341]] because [[H834]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against thee, and shall turn again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] thee, and confess [[H3034]] thy name, [[H8034]] and pray, [[H6419]] and make supplication [[H2603]] unto [[H413]] thee in this [[H2088]] house: [[H1004]]

### 34
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] in heaven, [[H8064]] and forgive [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and bring them again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] unto their fathers. [[H1]]

### 35
When heaven [[H8064]] is shut up, [[H6113]] and there is [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain, [[H4306]] because [[H3588]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against thee; if they pray [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and confess [[H3034]] thy name, [[H8034]] and turn [[H7725]] from their sin, [[H2403]] when [[H3588]] thou afflictest [[H6031]] them: [[H6031]]

### 36
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] in heaven, [[H8064]] and forgive [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] of thy servants, [[H5650]] and of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H3588]] thou teach [[H3384]]  them [[H853]] the [[H834]] good [[H2896]] way [[H1870]] wherein they should walk, [[H1980]] and give [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] upon [[H5921]] thy land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou hast given [[H5414]] to thy people [[H5971]] for an inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 37
If [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] in the land [[H776]] famine, [[H7458]] if [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] pestilence, [[H1698]] blasting, [[H7711]] mildew, [[H3420]] locust, [[H697]] if [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] caterpiller; [[H2625]] if [[H3588]] their enemy [[H341]] besiege [[H6887]] them in the land [[H776]] of their cities; [[H8179]] whatsoever [[H3605]] plague, [[H5061]] whatsoever [[H3605]] sickness [[H4245]]

### 38
What [[H3605]] prayer [[H8605]] and supplication [[H8467]] soever [[H3605]] be [[H1961]] by any [[H3605]] man, [[H120]] by all [[H3605]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] shall know [[H3045]] every man [[H376]] the plague [[H5061]] of his own heart, [[H3824]] and spread forth [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house: [[H1004]]

### 39
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] in heaven [[H8064]] thy dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] and forgive, [[H5545]] and do, [[H6213]] and give [[H5414]] to every man [[H376]] according to [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3824]] thou knowest; [[H3045]] (for [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] thou only, [[H905]] knowest [[H3045]] the hearts [[H3824]] of all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of men;) [[H120]]

### 40
That [[H4616]] they may fear [[H3372]] thee all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] they [[H1992]] live [[H2416]] in [[H6440]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] unto our fathers. [[H1]]

### 41
Moreover [[H1571]] concerning [[H413]] a stranger, [[H5237]] that [[H834]] not [[H3808]] of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] but cometh out [[H935]] of a far [[H7350]] country [[H776]] for thy name's [[H8034]] sake; [[H4616]]

### 42
(For [[H3588]] they shall hear of [[H8085]] thy great [[H1419]] name, [[H8034]] and of thy strong [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and of thy stretched out [[H5186]] arm;) [[H2220]] when he shall come [[H935]] and pray [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house; [[H1004]]

### 43
Hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] in heaven [[H8064]] thy dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] and do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the stranger [[H5237]] calleth [[H7121]] to [[H413]] thee for: that [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] people [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] may know [[H3045]] thy name, [[H8034]] to fear [[H3372]] thee, as thy people [[H5971]] Israel; [[H3478]] and that they may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] I have builded, [[H1129]] is called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] thy name. [[H8034]]

### 44
If [[H3588]] thy people [[H5971]] go out [[H3318]] to battle [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] their enemy, [[H341]] whithersoever [[H1870]] thou shalt send [[H7971]] them, and shall pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] toward [[H1870]] the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] thou hast chosen, [[H977]] and the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] I have built [[H1129]] for thy name: [[H8034]]

### 45
Then hear [[H8085]] thou in heaven [[H8064]] their prayer [[H8605]] and their supplication, [[H8467]] and maintain [[H6213]] their cause. [[H4941]]

### 46
If [[H3588]] they sin [[H2398]] against thee, (for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] man [[H120]] that [[H834]] sinneth [[H2398]] not,) [[H3808]] and thou be angry [[H599]] with them, and deliver [[H5414]] them to the enemy, [[H341]] so that they carry them away [[H7617]] captives [[H7617]] unto [[H6440]] the land [[H776]] of the enemy, [[H341]] far [[H7350]] or [[H176]] near; [[H7138]]

### 47
if they shall bethink themselves [[H7725]] in the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] they were carried captives, [[H7617]] and repent, [[H7725]] and make supplication [[H2603]] unto [[H413]] thee in the land [[H776]] of them that carried them captives, [[H7617]] saying, [[H559]] We have sinned, [[H2398]] and have done perversely, [[H5753]] we have committed wickedness; [[H7561]]

### 48
And return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] thee with all [[H3605]] their heart, [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] their soul, [[H5315]] in the land [[H776]] of their enemies, [[H341]] which [[H834]] led them away captive, [[H7617]] and pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] thee toward [[H1870]] their land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] unto their fathers, [[H1]] the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] thou hast chosen, [[H977]] and the house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] I have built [[H1129]] for thy name: [[H8034]]

### 49
Then hear [[H8085]]  thou [[H853]] their prayer [[H8605]] and their supplication [[H8467]] in heaven [[H8064]] thy dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] and maintain [[H6213]] their cause, [[H4941]]

### 50
And forgive [[H5545]] thy people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] have sinned [[H2398]] against thee, and all [[H3605]] their transgressions [[H6588]] wherein [[H834]] they have transgressed [[H6586]] against thee, and give [[H5414]] them compassion [[H7356]] before [[H6440]] them who carried them captive, [[H7617]] that they may have compassion on [[H7355]] them: [[H7355]]

### 51
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] thy people, [[H5971]] and thine inheritance, [[H5159]] which [[H834]] thou broughtest forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the midst [[H8432]] of the furnace [[H3564]] of iron: [[H1270]]

### 52
That thine eyes [[H5869]] may be [[H1961]] open [[H6605]] unto [[H413]] the supplication [[H8467]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] and unto [[H413]] the supplication [[H8467]] of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] to hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] them in all [[H3605]] that they call [[H7121]] for unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 53
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] didst separate [[H914]] them from among all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the earth, [[H776]] thine inheritance, [[H5159]] as [[H834]] thou spakest [[H1696]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses [[H4872]] thy servant, [[H5650]] when thou broughtest [[H3318]] our fathers [[H1]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] O Lord [[H136]] God. [[H3068]]

### 54
And it was [[H1961]] that when Solomon [[H8010]] had made an end [[H3615]] of praying [[H6419]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] prayer [[H8605]] and supplication [[H8467]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he arose [[H6965]] from before [[H6440]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] from kneeling [[H3766]] on [[H5921]] his knees [[H1290]] with his hands [[H3709]] spread up [[H6566]] to heaven. [[H8064]]

### 55
And he stood, [[H5975]] and blessed [[H1288]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] saying, [[H559]]

### 56
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] hath given [[H5414]] rest [[H4496]] unto his people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he promised: [[H1696]] there hath not [[H3808]] failed [[H5307]] one [[H259]] word [[H1697]] of all [[H3605]] his good [[H2896]] promise, [[H1697]] which [[H834]] he promised [[H1696]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses [[H4872]] his servant. [[H5650]]

### 57
The Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] us, as [[H834]] he was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] our fathers: [[H1]] let him not [[H408]] leave [[H5800]] us, nor [[H408]] forsake [[H5203]] us: [[H5203]]

### 58
That he may incline [[H5186]] our hearts [[H3824]] unto [[H413]] him, to walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] and to keep [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H4687]] and his statutes, [[H2706]] and his judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] our fathers. [[H1]]

### 59
And let these [[H428]] my words, [[H1697]] wherewith [[H834]] I have made supplication [[H2603]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] nigh [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] that he maintain [[H6213]] the cause [[H4941]] of his servant, [[H5650]] and the cause [[H4941]] of his people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] at all times, [[H3117]] as the matter [[H1697]] shall require: [[H3117]]

### 60
That [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] none [[H369]] else. [[H5750]]

### 61
Let your heart [[H3824]] therefore be [[H1961]] perfect [[H8003]] with [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in his statutes, [[H2706]] and to keep [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H4687]] as at this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 62
And the king, [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, offered [[H2076]] sacrifice [[H2077]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 63
And Solomon [[H8010]] offered [[H2076]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] of peace offerings, [[H8002]] which [[H834]] he offered [[H2076]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] two [[H8147]] and twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] oxen, [[H1241]] and an hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] sheep. [[H6629]] So the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] dedicated [[H2596]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 64
The same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] did the king [[H4428]] hallow [[H6942]] the middle [[H8432]] of the court [[H2691]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] he offered [[H6213]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and meat offerings, [[H4503]] and the fat [[H2459]] of the peace offerings: [[H8002]] because [[H3588]] the brasen [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] too little [[H6996]] to receive [[H3557]] the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and meat offerings, [[H4503]] and the fat [[H2459]] of the peace offerings. [[H8002]]

### 65
And at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Solomon [[H8010]] held [[H6213]] a feast, [[H2282]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, a great [[H1419]] congregation, [[H6951]] from the entering [[H935]] in of Hamath [[H2574]] unto [[H5704]] the river [[H5158]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] and seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] fourteen [[H702]] days. [[H3117]]

### 66
On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] he sent [[H7971]] the people [[H5971]] away: and they blessed [[H1288]] the king, [[H4428]] and went [[H1980]] unto their tents [[H168]] joyful [[H8056]] and glad [[H2896]] of heart [[H3820]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the goodness [[H2896]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] for David [[H1732]] his servant, [[H5650]] and for Israel [[H3478]] his people.
