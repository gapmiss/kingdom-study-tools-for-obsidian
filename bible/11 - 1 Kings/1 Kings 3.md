### 1
And Solomon [[H8010]] made affinity [[H2859]] with [[H854]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and took [[H3947]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] daughter, [[H1323]] and brought [[H935]] her into [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] until [[H5704]] he had made an end [[H3615]] of building [[H1129]] his own house, [[H1004]] and the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 2
Only [[H7535]] the people [[H5971]] sacrificed [[H2076]] in high places, [[H1116]] because [[H3588]] there was no [[H3808]] house [[H1004]] built [[H1129]] unto the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] those [[H1992]] days. [[H3117]]

### 3
And Solomon [[H8010]] loved [[H157]] the Lord, [[H3068]] walking [[H1980]] in the statutes [[H2708]] of David [[H1732]] his father: [[H1]] only [[H7535]] he [[H1931]] sacrificed [[H2076]] and burnt incense [[H6999]] in high places. [[H1116]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] went [[H1980]] to Gibeon [[H1391]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] there; [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] the great [[H1419]] high place: [[H1116]] a thousand [[H505]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] did Solomon [[H8010]] offer [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] altar. [[H4196]]

### 5
In Gibeon [[H1391]] the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Solomon [[H8010]] in a dream [[H2472]] by night: [[H3915]] and God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] Ask [[H7592]] what [[H4100]] I shall give [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 6
And Solomon [[H8010]] said, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] hast shewed [[H6213]] unto [[H5973]] thy servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] great [[H1419]] mercy, [[H2617]] according as [[H834]] he walked [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee in truth, [[H571]] and in righteousness, [[H6666]] and in uprightness [[H3483]] of heart [[H3824]] with [[H5973]] thee; and thou hast kept [[H8104]]  for him [[H853]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] kindness, [[H2617]] that thou hast given [[H5414]] him a son [[H1121]] to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 7
And now, [[H6258]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] thou [[H859]]  hast made [[H853]] thy servant [[H5650]] king [[H4427]] instead [[H8478]] of David [[H1732]] my father: [[H1]] and I [[H595]] a little [[H6996]] child: [[H5288]] I know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] to go out [[H3318]] or come in. [[H935]]

### 8
And thy servant [[H5650]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thy people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] thou hast chosen, [[H977]] a great [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be numbered [[H4487]] nor [[H3808]] counted [[H5608]] for multitude. [[H7230]]

### 9
Give [[H5414]] therefore thy servant [[H5650]] an understanding [[H8085]] heart [[H3820]] to judge [[H8199]] thy people, [[H5971]] that I may discern [[H995]] between [[H996]] good [[H2896]] and bad: [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] is able [[H3201]] to judge [[H8199]] this [[H2088]] thy so great [[H3515]] a people? [[H5971]]

### 10
And the speech [[H1697]] pleased [[H3190]] the Lord, [[H136]] that [[H3588]] Solomon [[H8010]] had asked [[H7592]] this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 11
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Because [[H3282]] thou hast asked [[H7592]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] and hast not [[H3808]] asked [[H7592]] for thyself long [[H7227]] life; [[H3117]] neither [[H3808]] hast asked [[H7592]] riches [[H6239]] for thyself, nor [[H3808]] hast asked [[H7592]] the life [[H5315]] of thine enemies; [[H341]] but hast asked [[H7592]] for thyself understanding [[H995]] to discern [[H8085]] judgment; [[H4941]]

### 12
Behold, [[H2009]] I have done [[H6213]] according to thy words: [[H1697]] lo, [[H2009]] I have given [[H5414]] thee a wise [[H2450]] and an understanding [[H995]] heart; [[H3820]] so that [[H834]] there was [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] like thee [[H3644]] before [[H6440]] thee, neither [[H3808]] after [[H310]] thee shall any arise [[H6965]] like unto thee. [[H3644]]

### 13
And I have also [[H1571]] given [[H5414]] thee that which [[H834]] thou hast not [[H3808]] asked, [[H7592]] both [[H1571]] riches, [[H6239]] and [[H1571]] honour: [[H3519]] so that [[H834]] there shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] any [[H376]] among the kings [[H4428]] like unto thee [[H3644]] all [[H3605]] thy days. [[H3117]]

### 14
And if [[H518]] thou wilt walk [[H1980]] in my ways, [[H1870]] to keep [[H8104]] my statutes [[H2706]] and my commandments, [[H4687]] as [[H834]] thy father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] did walk, [[H1980]] then I will lengthen [[H748]] thy days. [[H3117]]

### 15
And Solomon [[H8010]] awoke; [[H3364]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a dream. [[H2472]] And he came [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H136]] and offered up [[H5927]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and offered [[H6213]] peace offerings, [[H8002]] and made [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] to all [[H3605]] his servants. [[H5650]]

### 16
Then [[H227]] came [[H935]] there two [[H8147]] women, [[H802]] harlots, [[H2181]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 17
And the one [[H259]] woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] O [[H994]] my lord, [[H113]] I [[H589]] and this [[H2063]] woman [[H802]] dwell [[H3427]] in one [[H259]] house; [[H1004]] and I was delivered of a child [[H3205]] with [[H5973]] her in the house. [[H1004]]

### 18
And it came to pass [[H1961]] the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] after that I was delivered, [[H3205]] that this [[H2063]] woman [[H802]] was delivered [[H3205]] also: [[H1571]] and we [[H587]] together; [[H3162]] no [[H369]] stranger [[H2114]] with [[H854]] us in the house, [[H1004]] save [[H2108]] we [[H587]] two [[H8147]] in the house. [[H1004]]

### 19
And this [[H2063]] woman's [[H802]] child [[H1121]] died [[H4191]] in the night; [[H3915]] because [[H834]] she overlaid [[H7901]] it. [[H5921]]

### 20
And she arose [[H6965]] at midnight, [[H8432]] and took [[H3947]] my son [[H1121]] from beside [[H681]] me, while thine handmaid [[H519]] slept, [[H3463]] and laid [[H7901]] it in her bosom, [[H2436]] and laid [[H7901]] her dead [[H4191]] child [[H1121]] in my bosom. [[H2436]]

### 21
And when I rose [[H6965]] in the morning [[H1242]] to give my child [[H1121]] suck, [[H3243]] behold, [[H2009]] it was dead: [[H4191]] but when I had considered [[H995]] it in the morning, [[H1242]] behold, [[H2009]] it was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] my son, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] I did bear. [[H3205]]

### 22
And the other [[H312]] woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] the living [[H2416]] my son, [[H1121]] and the dead [[H4191]] thy son. [[H1121]] And this [[H2063]] said, [[H559]] No; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] the dead [[H4191]] thy son, [[H1121]] and the living [[H2416]] my son. [[H1121]] Thus they spake [[H1696]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 23
Then said [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] The one [[H2063]] saith, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] my son [[H1121]] that liveth, [[H2416]] and thy son [[H1121]] the dead: [[H4191]] and the other [[H2063]] saith, [[H559]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] thy son [[H1121]] the dead, [[H4191]] and my son [[H1121]] the living. [[H2416]]

### 24
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Bring [[H3947]] me a sword. [[H2719]] And they brought [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 25
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Divide [[H1504]] the living [[H2416]] child [[H3206]] in two, [[H8147]] and give [[H5414]] half [[H2677]] to the one, [[H259]] and half [[H2677]] to the other. [[H259]]

### 26
Then spake [[H559]] the woman [[H802]] whose [[H834]] the living [[H2416]] child [[H1121]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] her bowels [[H7356]] yearned [[H3648]] upon [[H5921]] her son, [[H1121]] and she said, [[H559]] O [[H994]] my lord, [[H113]] give [[H5414]]  her [[H853]] the living [[H2416]] child, [[H3205]] and in no [[H408]] wise [[H4191]] slay [[H4191]] it. But the other [[H2063]] said, [[H559]] Let it be [[H1961]] neither [[H1571]] mine nor [[H1571]] thine, divide [[H1504]]

### 27
Then the king [[H4428]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]]  her [[H853]] the living [[H2416]] child, [[H3205]] and in no [[H3808]] wise [[H4191]] slay [[H4191]] it: she [[H1931]] the mother [[H517]] thereof. [[H517]]

### 28
And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]]  of [[H853]] the judgment [[H4941]] which [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] had judged; [[H8199]] and they feared [[H3372]] the king: [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the wisdom [[H2451]] of God [[H430]] in him, [[H7130]] to do [[H6213]] judgment.
