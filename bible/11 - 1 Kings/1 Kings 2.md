### 1
Now the days [[H3117]] of David [[H1732]] drew nigh [[H7126]] that he should die; [[H4191]] and he charged [[H6680]] Solomon [[H8010]] his son, [[H1121]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
I [[H595]] go [[H1980]] the way [[H1870]] of all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] be thou strong [[H2388]] therefore, and shew [[H1961]] thyself a man; [[H376]]

### 3
And keep [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in his ways, [[H1870]] to keep [[H8104]] his statutes, [[H2708]] and his commandments, [[H4687]] and his judgments, [[H4941]] and his testimonies, [[H5715]] as it is written [[H3789]]  in [[H853]] the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest prosper [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou doest, [[H6213]] and whithersoever [[H3605]] thou turnest [[H6437]] thyself: [[H6437]]

### 4
That [[H4616]] the Lord [[H3068]] may continue [[H6965]] his word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] me, saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thy children [[H1121]] take heed [[H8104]]  to [[H853]] their way, [[H1870]] to walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] me in truth [[H571]] with all [[H3605]] their heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] their soul, [[H5315]] there shall not [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] thee (said [[H559]] he) a man [[H376]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Moreover [[H1571]] thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]]  also [[H853]] what [[H834]] Joab [[H3097]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] did [[H6213]] to me, what [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] to the two [[H8147]] captains [[H8269]] of the hosts [[H6635]] of Israel, [[H3478]] unto Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] and unto Amasa [[H6021]] the son [[H1121]] of Jether, [[H3500]] whom he slew, [[H2026]] and shed [[H7760]] the blood [[H1818]] of war [[H4421]] in peace, [[H7965]] and put [[H5414]] the blood [[H1818]] of war [[H4421]] upon his girdle [[H2290]] that [[H834]] about his loins, [[H4975]] and in his shoes [[H5275]] that [[H834]] on his feet. [[H7272]]

### 6
Do [[H6213]] therefore according to thy wisdom, [[H2451]] and let not [[H3808]] his hoar head [[H7872]] go down [[H3381]] to the grave [[H7585]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 7
But shew [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] unto the sons [[H1121]] of Barzillai [[H1271]] the Gileadite, [[H1569]] and let them be [[H1961]] of those that eat [[H398]] at thy table: [[H7979]] for [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] they came [[H7126]] to [[H413]] me when I fled [[H1272]] because [[H6440]] of Absalom [[H53]] thy brother. [[H251]]

### 8
And, behold, [[H2009]] with [[H5973]] thee Shimei [[H8096]] the son [[H1121]] of Gera, [[H1617]] a Benjamite [[H1145]] of Bahurim, [[H980]] which [[H1931]] cursed [[H7043]] me with a grievous [[H4834]] curse [[H7045]] in the day [[H3117]] when I went [[H1980]] to Mahanaim: [[H4266]] but he [[H1931]] came down [[H3381]] to meet [[H7125]] me at Jordan, [[H3383]] and I sware [[H7650]] to him by the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] I will not [[H518]] put thee to death [[H4191]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 9
Now [[H6258]] therefore hold him not guiltless: [[H5352]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a wise [[H2450]] man, [[H376]] and knowest [[H3045]] what [[H834]] thou oughtest to do [[H6213]]  unto him; but his [[H853]] hoar head [[H7872]] bring thou down [[H3381]] to the grave [[H7585]] with blood. [[H1818]]

### 10
So David [[H1732]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 11
And the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] forty [[H705]] years: [[H8141]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] reigned [[H4427]] he in Hebron, [[H2275]] and thirty [[H7970]] and three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] reigned [[H4427]] he in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 12
Then sat [[H3427]] Solomon [[H8010]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David [[H1732]] his father; [[H1]] and his kingdom [[H4438]] was established [[H3559]] greatly. [[H3966]]

### 13
And [[H935]] Adonijah [[H138]] the son of [[H1121]] Haggith [[H2294]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Bath-sheba [[H1339]] the mother [[H517]] of Solomon. [[H8010]] And she said, [[H559]] Comest [[H935]] thou peaceably? [[H7965]] And he said, [[H559]] Peaceably. [[H7965]]

### 14
He said [[H559]] moreover, I have somewhat to say [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] thee. And she said, [[H559]] Say on. [[H1696]]

### 15
And he said, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the kingdom [[H4410]] was [[H1961]] mine, and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] set [[H7760]] their faces [[H6440]] on [[H5921]] me, that I should reign: [[H4427]] howbeit the kingdom [[H4410]] is turned about, [[H5437]] and is become [[H1961]] my brother's: [[H251]] for [[H3588]] it was [[H1961]] his from the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
And now [[H6258]] I [[H595]] ask [[H7592]] one [[H259]] petition [[H7596]] of [[H853]] thee, deny [[H7725]] me [[H6440]] not. [[H408]] And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Say on. [[H1696]]

### 17
And he said, [[H559]] Speak, [[H559]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] unto Solomon [[H8010]] the king, [[H4428]] (for [[H3588]] he will not [[H3808]] say nay,) [[H7725]] thee [[H5414]] that he give [[H0]]  me [[H49]] Abishag [[H7767]] the Shunammite [[H802]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 18
And [[H559]] Bath-sheba [[H1339]] said, [[H559]] Well; [[H2896]] I [[H595]] will speak [[H1696]] for [[H5921]] thee [[H5921]] unto [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 19
Bath-sheba [[H1339]] therefore went [[H935]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Solomon, [[H8010]] to speak [[H1696]] unto him for [[H5921]] Adonijah. [[H138]] And the king [[H4428]] rose up [[H6965]] to meet [[H7125]] her, and bowed himself [[H7812]] unto her, and sat down [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] and caused a seat [[H3678]] to be set [[H7760]] for the king's [[H4428]] mother; [[H517]] and she sat [[H3427]] on his right hand. [[H3225]]

### 20
Then she said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] desire of thee; [[H7592]] one [[H259]] small [[H6996]] petition [[H7596]] say nay. [[H7725]] me [[H6440]] not [[H408]] And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto her, Ask on, [[H7592]] my mother: [[H517]] for [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] I will say nay. [[H7725]] thee [[H6440]]

### 21
And she said, [[H559]]  Let [[H853]] Abishag [[H49]] the Shunammite [[H7767]] be given [[H5414]] to Adonijah [[H138]] thy brother [[H251]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 22
And king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto his mother, [[H517]] And why [[H4100]] dost thou [[H859]] ask [[H7592]] Abishag [[H49]] the Shunammite [[H7767]] for Adonijah? [[H138]] ask [[H7592]]  for him [[H853]] the kingdom [[H4410]] also; for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] mine [[H4480]] elder [[H1419]] brother; [[H251]] even for him, and for Abiathar [[H54]] the priest, [[H3548]] and for Joab [[H3097]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah. [[H6870]]

### 23
Then king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] sware [[H7650]] by the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] God [[H430]] do [[H6213]] so [[H3541]] to me, and more also, [[H3254]] if [[H3588]] Adonijah [[H138]] have not spoken [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] against his own life. [[H5315]]

### 24
Now [[H6258]] therefore, the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] which [[H834]] hath established [[H3559]] me, and set [[H3427]] me on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] and who [[H834]] hath made [[H6213]] me an house, [[H1004]] as [[H834]] he promised, [[H1696]] Adonijah [[H138]] shall be put to death [[H4191]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 25
And king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] sent [[H7971]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada; [[H3077]] and he fell [[H6293]] upon him that he died. [[H4191]]

### 26
And unto Abiathar [[H54]] the priest [[H3548]] said [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] Get [[H1980]] thee to Anathoth, [[H6068]] unto [[H5921]] thine own fields; [[H7704]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] worthy [[H376]] of death: [[H4194]] but I will not [[H3808]] at this [[H2088]] time [[H3117]] put thee to death, [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] thou barest [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] before [[H6440]] David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] and because [[H3588]] thou hast been afflicted [[H6031]] in all [[H3605]] wherein [[H834]] my father [[H1]] was afflicted. [[H6031]]

### 27
So Solomon [[H8010]] thrust out [[H1644]] Abiathar [[H54]] from being [[H1961]] priest [[H3548]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] that he might fulfil [[H4390]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Eli [[H5941]] in Shiloh. [[H7887]]

### 28
Then tidings [[H8052]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Joab: [[H3097]] for [[H3588]] Joab [[H3097]] had turned [[H5186]] after [[H310]] Adonijah, [[H138]] though he turned [[H5186]] not [[H3808]] after [[H310]] Absalom. [[H53]] And Joab [[H3097]] fled [[H5127]] unto [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and caught hold [[H2388]] on the horns [[H7161]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

### 29
And it was told [[H5046]] king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] that [[H3588]] Joab [[H3097]] was fled [[H5127]] unto [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and, behold, [[H2009]] by [[H681]] the altar. [[H4196]] Then Solomon [[H8010]] sent [[H7971]] Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] saying, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] fall [[H6293]] upon him. [[H6293]]

### 30
And Benaiah [[H1141]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] Come forth. [[H3318]] And he said, [[H559]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] I will die [[H4191]] here. [[H6311]] And Benaiah [[H1141]] brought [[H7725]] the king [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] again, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] said [[H1696]] Joab, [[H3097]] and thus [[H3541]] he answered [[H6030]] me. [[H6030]]

### 31
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto him, Do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] he hath said, [[H1696]] and fall [[H6293]] upon him, and bury [[H6912]] him; that thou mayest take away [[H5493]] the innocent [[H2600]] blood, [[H1818]] which [[H834]] Joab [[H3097]] shed, [[H8210]] from [[H5921]] me, and from [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of my father. [[H1]]

### 32
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall return [[H7725]] his blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] his own head, [[H7218]] who [[H834]] fell [[H6293]] upon two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] more righteous [[H6662]] and better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] he, and slew [[H2026]] them with the sword, [[H2719]] my father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] not [[H3808]] knowing [[H3045]] Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and Amasa [[H6021]] the son [[H1121]] of Jether, [[H3500]] captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 33
Their blood [[H1818]] shall therefore return [[H7725]] upon the head [[H7218]] of Joab, [[H3097]] and upon the head [[H7218]] of his seed [[H2233]] for ever: [[H5769]] but upon David, [[H1732]] and upon his seed, [[H2233]] and upon his house, [[H1004]] and upon his throne, [[H3678]] shall there be [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] for [[H5704]] ever [[H5769]] from [[H5973]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 34
So Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] went up, [[H5927]] and fell [[H6293]] upon him, and slew [[H4191]] him: and he was buried [[H6912]] in his own house [[H1004]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 35
And the king [[H4428]] put [[H5414]] Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] in his room [[H8478]] over [[H5921]] the host: [[H6635]] and Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] did the king [[H4428]] put [[H5414]] in the room [[H8478]] of Abiathar. [[H54]]

### 36
And the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] for Shimei, [[H8096]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Build [[H1129]] thee an house [[H1004]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and dwell [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] and go not forth [[H3318]] thence [[H8033]] any [[H575]] whither. [[H575]]

### 37
For it shall be, [[H1961]] on the day [[H3117]] thou goest out, [[H3318]] and passest over [[H5674]] the brook [[H5158]] Kidron, [[H6939]] thou shalt know [[H3045]] for certain [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die: [[H4191]] thy blood [[H1818]] shall be [[H1961]] upon thine own head. [[H7218]]

### 38
And Shimei [[H8096]] said [[H559]] unto the king, [[H4428]] The saying [[H1697]] good: [[H2896]] as [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] hath said, [[H1696]] so [[H3651]] will thy servant [[H5650]] do. [[H6213]] And Shimei [[H8096]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] many [[H7227]] days. [[H3117]]

### 39
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7093]] of three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] that two [[H8147]] of the servants [[H5650]] of Shimei [[H8096]] ran away [[H1272]] unto [[H413]] Achish [[H397]] son [[H1121]] of Maachah [[H4601]] king [[H4428]] of Gath. [[H1661]] And they told [[H5046]] Shimei, [[H8096]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] thy servants [[H5650]] in Gath. [[H1661]]

### 40
And Shimei [[H8096]] arose, [[H6965]] and saddled [[H2280]] his ass, [[H2543]] and went [[H1980]] to Gath [[H1661]] to [[H413]] Achish [[H397]] to seek [[H1245]] his servants: [[H5650]] and Shimei [[H8096]] went, [[H1980]] and brought [[H935]] his servants [[H5650]] from Gath. [[H1661]]

### 41
And it was told [[H5046]] Solomon [[H8010]] that [[H3588]] Shimei [[H8096]] had gone [[H1980]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Gath, [[H1661]] and was come again. [[H7725]]

### 42
And the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] for Shimei, [[H8096]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Did I not [[H3808]] make thee to swear [[H7650]] by the Lord, [[H3068]] and protested [[H5749]] unto thee, saying, [[H559]] Know [[H3045]] for a certain, [[H3045]] on the day [[H3117]] thou goest out, [[H3318]] and walkest abroad [[H1980]] any [[H575]] whither, [[H575]] that [[H3588]] thou shalt surely [[H4191]] die? [[H4191]] and thou saidst [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, The word [[H1697]] I have heard [[H8085]] good. [[H2896]]

### 43
Why [[H4069]] then hast thou not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the oath [[H7621]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the commandment [[H4687]] that [[H834]] I have charged [[H6680]] thee [[H5921]] with? [[H5921]]

### 44
The king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] moreover to [[H413]] Shimei, [[H8096]] Thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] the wickedness [[H7451]] which [[H834]] thine heart [[H3824]] is privy to, [[H3045]] that [[H834]] thou didst [[H6213]] to David [[H1732]] my father: [[H1]] therefore the Lord [[H3068]] shall return [[H7725]] thy wickedness [[H7451]] upon thine own head; [[H7218]]

### 45
And king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] blessed, [[H1288]] and the throne [[H3678]] of David [[H1732]] shall be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 46
So the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada; [[H3077]] which went out, [[H3318]] and fell [[H6293]] upon him, that he died. [[H4191]] And the kingdom [[H4467]] was established [[H3559]] in the hand [[H3027]] of Solomon. [[H8010]]
