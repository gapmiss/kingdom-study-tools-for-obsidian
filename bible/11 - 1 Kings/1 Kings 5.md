And Hiram [[H2438]] king [[H4428]] of Tyre [[H6865]] sent [[H7971]] his servants [[H5650]] unto [[H413]] Solomon; [[H8010]] for [[H3588]] he had heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] they had anointed [[H4886]] him king [[H4428]] in the room [[H8478]] of his father: [[H1]] for [[H3588]] Hiram [[H2438]] was [[H1961]] ever [[H3117]] a lover [[H157]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 2
And Solomon [[H8010]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Hiram, [[H2438]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
Thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] how that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] unto the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] for [[H6440]] the wars [[H4421]] which [[H834]] were about him on every side, [[H5437]] until [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] put [[H5414]] them under [[H8478]] the soles [[H3709]] of his feet. [[H7272]]

### 4
But now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] hath given me rest [[H5117]] on every side, [[H5439]] neither [[H369]] adversary [[H7854]] nor [[H369]] evil [[H7451]] occurrent. [[H6294]]

### 5
And, behold, [[H2005]] I purpose [[H559]] to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] unto the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] Thy son, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] I will set [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] thy throne [[H3678]] in thy room, [[H8478]] he [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] unto my name. [[H8034]]

### 6
Now [[H6258]] therefore command [[H6680]] thou that they hew [[H3772]] me cedar trees [[H730]] out of [[H4480]] Lebanon; [[H3844]] and my servants [[H5650]] shall be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thy servants: [[H5650]] and unto thee will I give [[H5414]] hire [[H7939]] for thy servants [[H5650]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou shalt appoint: [[H559]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] not [[H369]] among us any [[H376]] that can skill [[H3045]] to hew [[H3772]] timber [[H6086]] like unto the Sidonians. [[H6722]]

### 7
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Hiram [[H2438]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] that he rejoiced [[H8055]] greatly, [[H3966]] and said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] this day, [[H3117]] which [[H834]] hath given [[H5414]] unto David [[H1732]] a wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] over [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] great [[H7227]] people. [[H5971]]

### 8
And Hiram [[H2438]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Solomon, [[H8010]] saying, [[H559]] I have considered [[H8085]] the things which [[H834]] thou sentest [[H7971]] to [[H413]] me for: I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] thy desire [[H2656]] concerning timber [[H6086]] of cedar, [[H730]] and concerning timber [[H6086]] of fir. [[H1265]]

### 9
My servants [[H5650]] shall bring down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] Lebanon [[H3844]] unto the sea: [[H3220]] and I [[H589]] will convey [[H7760]] them by sea [[H3220]] in floats [[H1702]] unto [[H5704]] the place [[H4725]] that [[H834]] thou shalt appoint [[H7971]] me, and will cause them to be discharged [[H5310]] there, [[H8033]] and thou [[H859]] shalt receive [[H5375]] and thou [[H859]] shalt accomplish [[H6213]] my desire, [[H2656]] in giving [[H5414]] food [[H3899]] for my household. [[H1004]]

### 10
So Hiram [[H2438]] gave [[H5414]] Solomon [[H8010]] cedar [[H730]] trees [[H6086]] and fir [[H1265]] trees [[H6086]] all [[H3605]] his desire. [[H2656]]

[[H8141]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] Solomon [[H8010]] wisdom, [[H2451]] as [[H834]] he promised [[H1696]] him: and there was [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] between [[H996]] Hiram [[H2438]] and Solomon; [[H8010]] and they two [[H8147]] made [[H3772]] a league [[H1285]] together. [[H1285]]

### 13
And king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] raised [[H5927]] a levy [[H4522]] out of all [[H3605]] Israel; [[H3478]] and the levy [[H4522]] was [[H1961]] thirty [[H7970]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]
