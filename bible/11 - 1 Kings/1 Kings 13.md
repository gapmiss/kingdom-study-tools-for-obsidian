### 1
And, behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H935]] a man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] out of Judah [[H3063]] by the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Beth-el: [[H1008]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] to burn incense. [[H6999]]

### 2
And he cried [[H7121]] against [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] in the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] O altar, [[H4196]] altar, [[H4196]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] a child [[H1121]] shall be born [[H3205]] unto the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] Josiah [[H2977]] by name; [[H8034]] and upon [[H5921]] thee shall he offer [[H2076]] the priests [[H3548]] of the high places [[H1116]] that burn incense [[H6999]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and men's [[H120]] bones [[H6106]] shall be burnt [[H8313]] upon [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 3
And he gave [[H5414]] a sign [[H4159]] the same [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] the sign [[H4159]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken; [[H1696]] Behold, [[H2009]] the altar [[H4196]] shall be rent, [[H7167]] and the ashes [[H1880]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] it shall be poured out. [[H8210]]

### 4
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when king [[H4428]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] heard [[H8085]] the saying [[H1697]] of the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] had cried [[H7121]] against [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] in Beth-el, [[H1008]] that he put forth [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] from [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] saying, [[H559]] Lay hold [[H8610]] on him. And his hand, [[H3027]] which [[H834]] he put forth [[H7971]] against [[H5921]] him, dried up, [[H3001]] so that he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] pull it in again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 5
The altar [[H4196]] also was rent, [[H7167]] and the ashes [[H1880]] poured out [[H8210]] from [[H4480]] the altar, [[H4196]] according to the sign [[H4159]] which [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had given [[H5414]] by the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And the king [[H4428]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] Intreat [[H2470]] now [[H4994]] the face [[H6440]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] me, that my hand [[H3027]] may be restored me again. [[H7725]] And the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] besought [[H2470]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and the king's [[H4428]] hand [[H3027]] was restored him again, [[H7725]] and became [[H1961]] as before. [[H7223]]

### 7
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] Come [[H935]] home [[H1004]] with [[H854]] me, and refresh [[H5582]] thyself, and I will give [[H5414]] thee a reward. [[H4991]]

### 8
And the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] If [[H518]] thou wilt give [[H5414]]  me [[H853]] half [[H2677]] thine house, [[H1004]] I will not [[H3808]] go in [[H935]] with [[H5973]] thee, neither [[H3808]] will I eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] in this [[H2088]] place: [[H4725]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] was it charged [[H6680]] me by the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Eat [[H398]] no [[H3808]] bread, [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water, [[H4325]] nor [[H3808]] turn again [[H7725]] by the same way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] thou camest. [[H1980]]

### 10
So he went [[H1980]] another [[H312]] way, [[H1870]] and returned [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] by the way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Beth-el. [[H1008]]

### 11
Now there dwelt [[H3427]] an [[H259]] old [[H2205]] prophet [[H5030]] in Beth-el; [[H1008]] and his sons [[H1121]] came [[H935]] and told [[H5608]]  him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] that [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had done [[H6213]] that day [[H3117]] in Beth-el: [[H1008]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] he had spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] them they told [[H5608]] also to their father. [[H1]]

### 12
And their father [[H1]] said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, What [[H335]] way [[H1870]] went [[H1980]] he? For his sons [[H1121]] had seen [[H7200]]  what [[H834]] way [[H1870]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] went, [[H1980]] which [[H834]] came [[H935]] from Judah. [[H3063]]

### 13
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] Saddle [[H2280]] me the ass. [[H2543]] So they saddled [[H2280]] him the ass: [[H2543]] and he rode [[H7392]] thereon, [[H5921]]

### 14
And went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and found [[H4672]] him sitting [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] an oak: [[H424]] and he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, thou [[H859]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] that [[H834]] camest [[H935]] from Judah? [[H3063]] And he said, [[H559]] I [[H589]]

### 15
Then he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Come [[H1980]] home [[H1004]] with [[H854]] me, and eat [[H398]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 16
And he said, [[H559]] I may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] with [[H854]] thee, nor go in [[H935]] with [[H854]] thee: neither [[H3808]] will I eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] with [[H854]] thee in this [[H2088]] place: [[H4725]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] it was said [[H1697]] to [[H413]] me by the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] Thou shalt eat [[H398]] no [[H3808]] bread [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] there, [[H8033]] nor [[H3808]] turn again [[H7725]] to go [[H1980]] by the way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] thou camest. [[H1980]]

### 18
He said [[H559]] unto him, I [[H589]] a prophet [[H5030]] also [[H1571]] as thou and an angel [[H4397]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me by the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Bring him back [[H7725]] with [[H854]] thee into [[H413]] thine house, [[H1004]] that he may eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] and drink [[H8354]] water. [[H4325]] he lied [[H3584]] unto him. [[H3584]]

### 19
So he went back [[H7725]] with [[H854]] him, and did eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] in his house, [[H1004]] and drank [[H8354]] water. [[H4325]]

### 20
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as they [[H1992]] sat [[H3427]] at [[H413]] the table, [[H7979]] that the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] that [[H834]] brought him back: [[H7725]]

### 21
And he cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] that [[H834]] came [[H935]] from Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Forasmuch [[H3282]] as thou hast disobeyed [[H4784]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and hast not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the commandment [[H4687]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] thee, [[H6680]]

### 22
But camest back, [[H7725]] and hast eaten [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] and drunk [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] in the place, [[H4725]] of the which [[H834]] did say [[H1696]] to [[H413]] thee, Eat [[H398]] no [[H408]] bread, [[H3899]] and drink [[H8354]] no [[H408]] water; [[H4325]] thy carcase [[H5038]] shall not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the sepulchre [[H6913]] of thy fathers. [[H1]]

### 23
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] after [[H310]] he had eaten [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] and after [[H310]] he had drunk, [[H8354]] that he saddled [[H2280]] for him the ass, [[H2543]] for the prophet [[H5030]] whom [[H834]] he had brought back. [[H7725]]

### 24
And when he was gone, [[H1980]] a lion [[H738]] met [[H4672]] him by the way, [[H1870]] and slew [[H4191]] him: and his carcase [[H5038]] was [[H1961]] cast [[H7993]] in the way, [[H1870]] and the ass [[H2543]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H681]] it, the lion [[H738]] also stood [[H5975]] by [[H681]] the carcase. [[H5038]]

### 25
And, behold, [[H2009]] men [[H376]] passed by, [[H5674]] and saw [[H7200]] the carcase [[H5038]] cast [[H7993]] in the way, [[H1870]] and the lion [[H738]] standing [[H5975]] by [[H681]] the carcase: [[H5038]] and they came [[H935]] and told [[H1696]] in the city [[H5892]] where [[H834]] the old [[H2205]] prophet [[H5030]] dwelt. [[H3427]]

### 26
And when the prophet [[H5030]] that [[H834]] brought him back [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] heard [[H8085]] he said, [[H559]] It [[H1931]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] was disobedient [[H4784]]  unto [[H853]] the word [[H6310]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] therefore the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] him unto the lion, [[H738]] which hath torn [[H7665]] him, and slain [[H4191]] him, according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] unto him. [[H1696]]

### 27
And he spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] saying, [[H559]] Saddle [[H2280]]  me [[H853]] the ass. [[H2543]] And they saddled [[H2280]]

### 28
And he went [[H1980]] and found [[H4672]] his carcase [[H5038]] cast [[H7993]] in the way, [[H1870]] and the ass [[H2543]] and the lion [[H738]] standing [[H5975]] by [[H681]] the carcase: [[H5038]] the lion [[H738]] had not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] the carcase, [[H5038]] nor [[H3808]] torn [[H7665]] the ass. [[H2543]]

### 29
And the prophet [[H5030]] took up [[H5375]] the carcase [[H5038]] of the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and laid [[H3240]] it upon [[H413]] the ass, [[H2543]] and brought it back: [[H7725]] and the old [[H2205]] prophet [[H5030]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the city, [[H5892]] to mourn [[H5594]] and to bury [[H6912]] him. [[H6912]]

### 30
And he laid [[H3240]] his carcase [[H5038]] in his own grave; [[H6913]] and they mourned [[H5594]] over [[H5921]] him, Alas, [[H1945]] my brother! [[H251]]

### 31
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] after [[H310]] he had buried [[H6912]] him, that he spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] saying, [[H559]] When I am dead, [[H4191]] then bury [[H6912]] me in the sepulchre [[H6913]] wherein [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] buried; [[H6912]] lay [[H3240]] my bones [[H6106]] beside [[H681]] his bones: [[H6106]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] the saying [[H1697]] which [[H834]] he cried [[H7121]] by the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] against [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] in Beth-el, [[H1008]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the houses [[H1004]] of the high places [[H1116]] which [[H834]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] shall surely come to pass. [[H1961]]

### 33
After [[H310]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] returned [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] from his evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] but made [[H6213]] again [[H7725]] of the lowest [[H7098]] of the people [[H5971]] priests [[H3548]] of the high places: [[H1116]] whosoever would, [[H2655]] he consecrated [[H4390]] him, and he became [[H1961]] of the priests [[H3548]] of the high places. [[H1116]]

### 34
And this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] became [[H1961]] sin [[H2403]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] even to cut off, [[H3582]] and to destroy [[H8045]] from off [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]
