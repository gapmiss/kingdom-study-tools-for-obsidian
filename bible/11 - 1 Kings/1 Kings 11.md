### 1
But king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] loved [[H157]] many [[H7227]] strange [[H5237]] women, [[H802]] together with [[H853]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] women of the Moabites, [[H4125]] Ammonites, [[H5984]] Edomites, [[H130]] Zidonians, [[H6722]] Hittites; [[H2850]]

### 2
Of [[H4480]] the nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] go in [[H935]] to them, neither [[H3808]] shall they [[H1992]] come in [[H935]] unto you: surely [[H403]] they will turn away [[H5186]] your heart [[H3824]] after [[H310]] their gods: [[H430]] Solomon [[H8010]] clave [[H1692]] unto these in love. [[H157]]

### 3
And he had [[H1961]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] wives, [[H802]] princesses, [[H8282]] and three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] concubines: [[H6370]] and his wives [[H802]] turned away [[H5186]] his heart. [[H3820]]

### 4
For it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H6256]] Solomon [[H8010]] was old, [[H2209]] his wives [[H802]] turned away [[H5186]] his heart [[H3824]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods: [[H430]] and his heart [[H3824]] was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] perfect [[H8003]] with [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] as the heart [[H3824]] of David [[H1732]] his father. [[H1]]

### 5
For Solomon [[H8010]] went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] Ashtoreth [[H6253]] the goddess [[H430]] of the Zidonians, [[H6722]] and after [[H310]] Milcom [[H4445]] the abomination [[H8251]] of the Ammonites. [[H5984]]

### 6
And Solomon [[H8010]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and went not fully [[H4390]] after [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as David [[H1732]] his father. [[H1]]

### 7
Then [[H227]] did Solomon [[H8010]] build [[H1129]] an high place [[H1116]] for Chemosh, [[H3645]] the abomination [[H8251]] of Moab, [[H4124]] in the hill [[H2022]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and for Molech, [[H4432]] the abomination [[H8251]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 8
And likewise [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] he for all [[H3605]] his strange [[H5237]] wives, [[H802]] which burnt incense [[H6999]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] unto their gods. [[H430]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] was angry [[H599]] with Solomon, [[H8010]] because [[H3588]] his heart [[H3824]] was turned [[H5186]] from [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which had appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him twice, [[H6471]]

### 10
And had commanded [[H6680]] him concerning [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] that he should not [[H1115]] go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods: [[H430]] but he kept [[H8104]] not [[H3808]] that which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded. [[H6680]]

### 11
Wherefore the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto Solomon, [[H8010]] Forasmuch [[H3282]] as [[H834]] this [[H2063]] is [[H1961]] done of [[H5973]] thee, and thou hast not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] my covenant [[H1285]] and my statutes, [[H2708]] which [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] thee, I will surely [[H7167]] rend [[H7167]] the kingdom [[H4467]] from [[H5921]] thee, and will give [[H5414]] it to thy servant. [[H5650]]

### 12
Notwithstanding [[H389]] in thy days [[H3117]] I will not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] it for David [[H1732]] thy father's [[H1]] sake: [[H4616]] I will rend [[H7167]] it out of the hand [[H3027]] of thy son. [[H1121]]

### 13
Howbeit [[H7535]] I will not [[H3808]] rend away [[H7167]] all [[H3605]] the kingdom; [[H4467]] will give [[H5414]] one [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] to thy son [[H1121]] for David [[H1732]] my servant's [[H5650]] sake, [[H4616]] and for Jerusalem's [[H3389]] sake [[H4616]] which [[H834]] I have chosen. [[H977]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] stirred up [[H6965]] an adversary [[H7854]] unto Solomon, [[H8010]] Hadad [[H1908]] the Edomite: [[H130]] he [[H1931]] of the king's [[H4428]] seed [[H2233]] in Edom. [[H123]]

### 15
For it came to pass, [[H1961]] when David [[H1732]] was [[H1961]] in [[H854]] Edom, [[H123]] and Joab [[H3097]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] was gone up [[H5927]] to bury [[H6912]] the slain, [[H2491]] after he had smitten [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] in Edom; [[H123]]

### 16
(For [[H3588]] six [[H8337]] months [[H2320]] did Joab [[H3097]] remain [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] with all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] until [[H5704]] he had cut off [[H3772]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] in Edom:) [[H123]]

### 17
That Hadad [[H111]] fled, [[H1272]] he [[H1931]] and certain [[H376]] Edomites [[H130]] of his father's [[H1]] servants [[H5650]] with [[H854]] him, to go [[H935]] into Egypt; [[H4714]] Hadad [[H1908]] yet a little [[H6996]] child. [[H5288]]

### 18
And they arose [[H6965]] out of Midian, [[H4080]] and came [[H935]] to Paran: [[H6290]] and they took [[H3947]] men [[H582]] with [[H5973]] them out of Paran, [[H6290]] and they came [[H935]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] unto [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] which gave [[H5414]] him an house, [[H1004]] and appointed [[H559]] him victuals, [[H3899]] and gave [[H5414]] him land. [[H776]]

### 19
And Hadad [[H1908]] found [[H4672]] great [[H3966]] favour [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] so that he gave [[H5414]] him to wife [[H802]] the sister [[H269]] of his own wife, [[H802]] the sister [[H269]] of Tahpenes [[H8472]] the queen. [[H1377]]

### 20
And the sister [[H269]] of Tahpenes [[H8472]] bare [[H3205]]  him [[H853]] Genubath [[H1592]] his son, [[H1121]] whom Tahpenes [[H8472]] weaned [[H1580]] in [[H8432]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] house: [[H1004]] and Genubath [[H1592]] was [[H1961]] in Pharaoh's [[H6547]] household [[H1004]] among [[H8432]] the sons [[H1121]] of Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 21
And when Hadad [[H1908]] heard [[H8085]] in Egypt [[H4714]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and that [[H3588]] Joab [[H3097]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] was dead, [[H4191]] Hadad [[H1908]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Let me depart, [[H7971]] that I may go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] mine own country. [[H776]]

### 22
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] unto him, But [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] hast thou [[H859]] lacked [[H2638]] with [[H5973]] me, that, behold, [[H2005]] thou seekest [[H1245]] to go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] thine own country? [[H776]] And he answered, [[H559]] Nothing: [[H3808]] howbeit [[H3588]] let me go [[H7971]] in any wise. [[H7971]]

### 23
And God [[H430]] stirred him up [[H6965]] adversary, [[H7854]] Rezon [[H7331]] the son [[H1121]] of Eliadah, [[H450]] which [[H834]] fled [[H1272]] from [[H853]] his lord [[H113]] Hadadezer [[H1909]] king [[H4428]] of Zobah: [[H6678]]

### 24
And he gathered [[H6908]] men [[H376]] unto [[H5921]] him, and became [[H1961]] captain [[H8269]] over a band, [[H1416]] when David [[H1732]] slew [[H2026]] them and they went [[H1980]] to Damascus, [[H1834]] and dwelt [[H3427]] therein, and reigned [[H4427]] in Damascus. [[H1834]]

### 25
And he was [[H1961]] an adversary [[H7854]] to Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] beside [[H854]] the mischief [[H7451]] that [[H834]] Hadad [[H1908]] and he abhorred [[H6973]] Israel, [[H3478]] and reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Syria. [[H758]]

### 26
And Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] an Ephrathite [[H673]] of [[H4480]] Zereda, [[H6868]] Solomon's [[H8010]] servant, [[H5650]] whose mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Zeruah, [[H6871]] a widow [[H490]] woman, [[H802]] even he lifted up [[H7311]] hand [[H3027]] against the king. [[H4428]]

### 27
And this [[H2088]] the cause [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he lifted up [[H7311]] hand [[H3027]] against the king: [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] built [[H1129]] Millo, [[H4407]] repaired [[H5462]] the breaches [[H6556]] of the city [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] his father. [[H1]]

### 28
And the man [[H376]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] a mighty man [[H1368]] of valour: [[H2428]] and Solomon [[H8010]] seeing [[H7200]] the young man [[H5288]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was industrious, [[H6213]] he made him ruler [[H6485]] over all [[H3605]] the charge [[H5447]] of the house [[H1004]] of Joseph. [[H3130]]

### 29
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] when Jeroboam [[H3379]] went out [[H3318]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that the prophet [[H5030]] Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite [[H7888]] found [[H4672]] him in the way; [[H1870]] and he [[H1931]] had clad himself [[H3680]] with a new [[H2319]] garment; [[H8008]] and they two [[H8147]] alone [[H905]] in the field: [[H7704]]

### 30
And Ahijah [[H281]] caught [[H8610]] the new [[H2319]] garment [[H8008]] that [[H834]] on [[H5921]] him, and rent [[H7167]] it twelve [[H8147]] pieces: [[H7168]]

### 31
And he said [[H559]] to Jeroboam, [[H3379]] Take [[H3947]] thee ten [[H6235]] pieces: [[H7168]] for [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will rend [[H7167]] the kingdom [[H4467]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] and will give [[H5414]] ten [[H6235]] tribes [[H7626]] to thee: [[H7626]]

### 32
(But he shall have [[H1961]] one [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] for my servant [[H5650]] David's [[H1732]] sake, [[H4616]] and for Jerusalem's [[H3389]] sake, [[H4616]] the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] I have chosen [[H977]] out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel:) [[H3478]]

### 33
Because [[H3282]] that [[H834]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and have worshipped [[H7812]] Ashtoreth [[H6253]] the goddess [[H430]] of the Zidonians, [[H6722]] Chemosh [[H3645]] the god [[H430]] of the Moabites, [[H4124]] and Milcom [[H4445]] the god [[H430]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and have not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in my ways, [[H1870]] to do [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in mine eyes, [[H5869]] and my statutes [[H2708]] and my judgments, [[H4941]] as David [[H1732]] his father. [[H1]]

### 34
Howbeit I will not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] the whole [[H3605]] kingdom [[H4467]] out of his hand: [[H3027]] but [[H3588]] I will make [[H7896]] him prince [[H5387]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life [[H2416]] for David [[H1732]] my servant's [[H5650]] sake, [[H4616]] whom [[H834]] I chose, [[H977]] because [[H834]] he kept [[H8104]] my commandments [[H4687]] and my statutes: [[H2708]]

### 35
But I will take [[H3947]] the kingdom [[H4410]] out of his son's [[H1121]] hand, [[H3027]] and will give [[H5414]]  it unto thee, [[H853]] ten [[H6235]] tribes. [[H7626]]

### 36
And unto his son [[H1121]] will I give [[H5414]] one [[H259]] tribe, [[H7626]] that [[H4616]] David [[H1732]] my servant [[H5650]] may have [[H1961]] a light [[H5216]] alway [[H3117]] before [[H6440]] me in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] I have chosen [[H977]] me to put [[H7760]] my name [[H8034]] there. [[H8033]]

### 37
And I will take [[H3947]] thee, and thou shalt reign [[H4427]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thy soul [[H5315]] desireth, [[H183]] and shalt be [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 38
And it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] thou wilt hearken unto [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I command [[H6680]] thee, and wilt walk [[H1980]] in my ways, [[H1870]] and do [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in my sight, [[H5869]] to keep [[H8104]] my statutes [[H2708]] and my commandments, [[H4687]] as [[H834]] David [[H1732]] my servant [[H5650]] did; [[H6213]] that I will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee, and build [[H1129]] thee a sure [[H539]] house, [[H1004]] as [[H834]] I built [[H1129]] for David, [[H1732]] and will give [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] unto thee. [[H3478]]

### 39
And I will for [[H4616]] this [[H2063]] afflict [[H6031]] the seed [[H2233]] of David, [[H1732]] but [[H389]] not [[H3808]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 40
Solomon [[H8010]] sought [[H1245]] therefore to kill [[H4191]] Jeroboam. [[H3379]] And Jeroboam [[H3379]] arose, [[H6965]] and fled [[H1272]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] unto [[H413]] Shishak [[H7895]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and was [[H1961]] in Egypt [[H4714]] until [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 41
And the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and his wisdom, [[H2451]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Solomon? [[H8010]]

### 42
And the time [[H3117]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

### 43
And Solomon [[H8010]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the city [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] his father: [[H1]] and Rehoboam [[H7346]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
