And Rehoboam [[H7346]] went [[H1980]] to Shechem: [[H7927]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] were come [[H935]] to Shechem [[H7927]] to make him king. [[H4427]]

### 2
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] who [[H1931]] was yet [[H5750]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] heard [[H8085]] (for [[H834]] he was fled [[H1272]] from the presence [[H6440]] of king [[H4428]] Solomon, [[H8010]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Egypt;) [[H4714]]

### 3
That they sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] him. And Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] came, [[H935]] and spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Rehoboam, [[H7346]] saying, [[H559]]

### 4
Thy father [[H1]]  made [[H853]] our yoke [[H5923]] grievous: [[H7185]] now [[H6258]] therefore make thou [[H859]] the grievous [[H7186]] service [[H5656]] of thy father, [[H1]] and his heavy [[H3515]] yoke [[H5923]] which [[H834]] he put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] us, lighter, [[H7043]] and we will serve [[H5647]] thee. [[H5647]]

### 5
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Depart [[H1980]] yet [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] then come again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] me. And the people [[H5971]] departed. [[H1980]]

### 6
And king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] consulted [[H3289]] with [[H854]] the old men, [[H2205]] that [[H834]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Solomon [[H8010]] his father [[H1]] while [[H1961]] he yet lived, [[H2416]] and said, [[H559]] How [[H349]] do ye [[H859]] advise [[H3289]] that I may [[H7725]] answer [[H1697]] this [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]]

### 7
And they spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou wilt be [[H1961]] a servant [[H5650]] unto this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] this day, [[H3117]] and wilt serve [[H5647]] them, and answer [[H6030]] them, and speak [[H1696]] good [[H2896]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] them, then they will be [[H1961]] thy servants [[H5650]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 8
But he forsook [[H5800]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the old men, [[H2205]] which [[H834]] they had given [[H3289]] him, and consulted [[H3289]] with the young men [[H3206]] that [[H834]] were grown up [[H1431]] with [[H854]] him, which [[H834]] stood [[H5975]] before him: [[H6440]]

### 9
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, What [[H4100]] counsel give [[H3289]] ye [[H859]] that we may [[H7725]] answer [[H1697]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] who [[H834]] have spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] Make the yoke [[H5923]] which [[H834]] thy father [[H1]] did put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] us lighter? [[H7043]]

### 10
And the young men [[H3206]] that [[H834]] were grown up [[H1431]] with [[H854]] him spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] shalt thou speak [[H559]] unto this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Thy father [[H1]]  made [[H853]] our yoke [[H5923]] heavy, [[H3513]] but make thou [[H859]] lighter [[H7043]] unto [[H5921]] us; thus [[H3541]] shalt thou say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them, My little [[H6995]] shall be thicker [[H5666]] than my father's [[H1]] loins. [[H4975]]

### 11
And now [[H6258]] whereas my father [[H1]] did lade [[H6006]] you with a heavy [[H3515]] yoke, [[H5923]] I [[H589]] will add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] your yoke: [[H5923]] my father [[H1]] hath chastised [[H3256]] you with whips, [[H7752]] but I [[H589]] will chastise [[H3256]] you with scorpions. [[H6137]]

### 12
So Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] as [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] had appointed, [[H1696]] saying, [[H559]] Come [[H7725]] to [[H413]] me again the third [[H7992]] day. [[H3117]]

### 13
And the king [[H4428]] answered [[H6030]] the people [[H5971]] roughly, [[H7186]] and forsook [[H5800]] the old men's [[H2205]] counsel [[H6098]] that [[H834]] they gave [[H3289]] him; [[H3289]]

### 14
And spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] them after the counsel [[H6098]] of the young men, [[H3206]] saying, [[H559]] My father [[H1]]  made [[H853]] your yoke [[H5923]] heavy, [[H3513]] and I [[H589]] will add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] your yoke: [[H5923]] my father [[H1]] chastised [[H3256]] you with whips, [[H7752]] but I [[H589]] will chastise [[H3256]] you with scorpions. [[H6137]]

### 15
Wherefore the king [[H4428]] hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] the people; [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] the cause [[H5438]] was [[H1961]] from [[H5973]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H4616]] he might perform [[H6965]] his saying, [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] by [[H3027]] Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite [[H7888]] unto [[H413]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat. [[H5028]]

### 16
So [[H7725]] when all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] them, the people [[H5971]] answered [[H1697]] the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] portion [[H2506]] have we in David? [[H1732]] neither [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] in the son [[H1121]] of Jesse: [[H3448]] to your tents, [[H168]] O Israel: [[H3478]] now [[H6258]] see [[H7200]] to thine own house, [[H1004]] David. [[H1732]] So Israel [[H3478]] departed [[H1980]] unto their tents. [[H168]]

### 17
But the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] which dwelt [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 18
Then king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] sent [[H7971]] Adoram, [[H151]] who [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the tribute; [[H4522]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] stoned [[H7275]] him with stones, [[H68]] that he died. [[H4191]] Therefore king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] made speed [[H553]] to get him up [[H5927]] to his chariot, [[H4818]] to flee [[H5127]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 19
So Israel [[H3478]] rebelled [[H6586]] against the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 20
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] was come again, [[H7725]] that they sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] him unto [[H413]] the congregation, [[H5712]] and made him king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]] there was [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] that followed [[H310]] the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] but [[H2108]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Judah [[H3063]] only. [[H905]]

### 21
And when Rehoboam [[H7346]] was come [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] he assembled [[H6950]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] with [[H853]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] an hundred [[H3967]] and fourscore [[H8084]] thousand [[H505]] chosen men, [[H977]] which were warriors, [[H6213]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to bring [[H7725]] the kingdom [[H4410]] again to Rehoboam [[H7346]] the son [[H1121]] of Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 22
But the word [[H1697]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]]

### 23
Speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Rehoboam, [[H7346]] the son [[H1121]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] and to the remnant [[H3499]] of the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]]

### 24
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Ye shall not [[H3808]] go up, [[H5927]] nor [[H3808]] fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] your brethren [[H251]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] return [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] to his house; [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] is [[H1961]] from [[H853]] me. They hearkened [[H8085]]  therefore [[H853]] to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and returned [[H7725]] to depart, [[H1980]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 25
Then Jeroboam [[H3379]] built [[H1129]] Shechem [[H7927]] in mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and dwelt [[H3427]] therein; and went out [[H3318]] from thence, [[H8033]] and built [[H1129]] Penuel. [[H6439]]

### 26
And Jeroboam [[H3379]] said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] Now [[H6258]] shall the kingdom [[H4467]] return [[H7725]] to the house [[H1004]] of David: [[H1732]]

### 27
If [[H518]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] go up [[H5927]] to do [[H6213]] sacrifice [[H2077]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] then shall the heart [[H3820]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] turn again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] their lord, [[H113]] unto [[H413]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and they shall kill [[H2026]] me, and go again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 28
Whereupon the king [[H4428]] took counsel, [[H3289]] and made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] calves [[H5695]] gold, [[H2091]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, It is too much [[H7227]] for you to go up [[H5927]] to Jerusalem: [[H3389]] behold [[H2009]] thy gods, [[H430]] O Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] brought thee up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 29
And he set [[H7760]] the one [[H259]] in Beth-el, [[H1008]] and the other [[H259]] put [[H5414]] he in Dan. [[H1835]]

### 30
And this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] became [[H1961]] a sin: [[H2403]] for the people [[H5971]] went [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] the one, [[H259]] unto [[H5704]] Dan. [[H1835]]

### 31
And he made [[H6213]] an house [[H1004]] of high places, [[H1116]] and made [[H6213]] priests [[H3548]] of the lowest [[H7098]] of the people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] were [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Levi. [[H3878]]

### 32
And Jeroboam [[H3379]] ordained [[H6213]] a feast [[H2282]] in the eighth [[H8066]] month, [[H2320]] on the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the month, [[H2320]] like unto the feast [[H2282]] that [[H834]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and he offered [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] So [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] he in Beth-el, [[H1008]] sacrificing [[H2076]] unto the calves [[H5695]] that [[H834]] he had made: [[H6213]] and he placed [[H5975]] in Beth-el [[H1008]] the priests [[H3548]] of the high places [[H1116]] which [[H834]] he had made. [[H6213]]

### 33
So he offered [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] which [[H834]] he had made [[H6213]] in Beth-el [[H1008]] the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the eighth [[H8066]] month, [[H2320]] in the month [[H2320]] which [[H834]] he had devised [[H908]] of his own heart; [[H3820]] and ordained [[H6213]] a feast [[H2282]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and he offered [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and burnt incense. [[H6999]]
