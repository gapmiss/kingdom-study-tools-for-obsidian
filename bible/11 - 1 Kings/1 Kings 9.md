### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Solomon [[H8010]] had finished [[H3615]] the building [[H1129]]  of [[H853]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] Solomon's [[H8010]] desire [[H2837]] which [[H834]] he was pleased [[H2654]] to do, [[H6213]]

### 2
That the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Solomon [[H8010]] the second time, [[H8145]] as [[H834]] he had appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him at Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 3
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I have heard [[H8085]] thy prayer [[H8605]] and thy supplication, [[H8467]] that [[H834]] thou hast made [[H2603]] before [[H6440]] me: I have hallowed [[H6942]] this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] thou hast built, [[H1129]] to put [[H7760]] my name [[H8034]] there [[H8033]] for [[H5704]] ever; [[H5769]] and mine eyes [[H5869]] and mine heart [[H3820]] shall be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] perpetually. [[H3117]]

### 4
And if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] wilt walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] me, as [[H834]] David [[H1732]] thy father [[H1]] walked, [[H1980]] in integrity [[H8537]] of heart, [[H3824]] and in uprightness, [[H3476]] to do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] thee, wilt keep [[H8104]] my statutes [[H2706]] and my judgments: [[H4941]]

### 5
Then I will establish [[H6965]] the throne [[H3678]] of thy kingdom [[H4467]] upon [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] for ever, [[H5769]] as [[H834]] I promised [[H1696]] to [[H5921]] David [[H1732]] thy father, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] There shall not [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] thee a man [[H376]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
if [[H518]] ye shall at all [[H7725]] turn [[H7725]] from following [[H310]] me, ye [[H859]] or your children, [[H1121]] and will not [[H3808]] keep [[H8104]] my commandments [[H4687]] my statutes [[H2708]] which [[H834]] I have set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you, but go [[H1980]] and serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and worship [[H7812]] them: [[H7812]]

### 7
Then will I cut off [[H3772]] Israel [[H3478]] out [[H6440]] of [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] them; and this house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] I have hallowed [[H6942]] for my name, [[H8034]] will I cast out [[H7971]] of [[H5921]] my sight; [[H6440]] and Israel [[H3478]] shall be [[H1961]] a proverb [[H4912]] and a byword [[H8148]] among all [[H3605]] people: [[H5971]]

### 8
And at this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] is [[H1961]] high, [[H5945]] every one [[H3605]] that passeth [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] it shall be astonished, [[H8074]] and shall hiss; [[H8319]] and they shall say, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] thus [[H3602]] unto this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and to this [[H2088]] house? [[H1004]]

### 9
And they shall answer, [[H559]] Because [[H5921]] they forsook [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought forth [[H3318]] their fathers [[H1]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and have taken hold [[H2388]] upon other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and have worshipped [[H7812]] them, and served [[H5647]] them: therefore [[H5921]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] brought [[H935]] upon [[H5921]]  them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 10
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7097]] of twenty [[H6242]] years, [[H8141]] when [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had built [[H1129]] the two [[H8147]] houses, [[H1004]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]]

### 11
Hiram [[H2438]] the king [[H4428]] of Tyre [[H6865]] had furnished [[H5375]] Solomon [[H8010]] with cedar [[H730]] trees [[H6086]] and fir [[H1265]] trees, [[H6086]] and with gold, [[H2091]] according to all [[H3605]] his desire,) [[H2656]] that then [[H227]] king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] gave [[H5414]] Hiram [[H2438]] twenty [[H6242]] cities [[H5892]] in the land [[H776]] of Galilee. [[H1551]]

### 12
And Hiram [[H2438]] came out [[H3318]] from Tyre [[H6865]] to see [[H7200]] the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had given [[H5414]] him; and they pleased [[H3474]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 13
And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] cities [[H5892]] these [[H428]] which [[H834]] thou hast given [[H5414]] me, my brother? [[H251]] And he called [[H7121]] them the land [[H776]] of Cabul [[H3521]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 14
And Hiram [[H2438]] sent [[H7971]] to the king [[H4428]] sixscore [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of gold. [[H2091]]

### 15
And this [[H2088]] the reason [[H1697]] of the levy [[H4522]] which [[H834]] king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] raised; [[H5927]] for to build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and his own house, [[H1004]] and Millo, [[H4407]] and the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and Hazor, [[H2674]] and Megiddo, [[H4023]] and Gezer. [[H1507]]

### 16
Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] had gone up, [[H5927]] and taken [[H3920]] Gezer, [[H1507]] and burnt [[H8313]] it with fire, [[H784]] and slain [[H2026]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in the city, [[H5892]] and given [[H5414]] it a present [[H7964]] unto his daughter, [[H1323]] Solomon's [[H8010]] wife.

And all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of store [[H4543]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had, [[H1961]] and cities [[H5892]] for his chariots, [[H7393]] and cities [[H5892]] for his horsemen, [[H6571]] and that [[H2837]] which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] desired [[H2836]] to build [[H1129]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and in Lebanon, [[H3844]] and in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of his dominion. [[H4475]]

### 20
all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] left [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] the Amorites, [[H567]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites, [[H2983]] which [[H834]] not [[H3808]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

[[H3117]]

### 22
But of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did Solomon [[H8010]] make [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] bondmen: [[H5650]] but [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] men [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] and his servants, [[H5650]] and his princes, [[H8269]] and his captains, [[H7991]] and rulers [[H8269]] of his chariots, [[H7393]] and his horsemen.
