### 1
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Abijah [[H29]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] fell sick. [[H2470]]

### 2
And Jeroboam [[H3379]] said [[H559]] to his wife, [[H802]] Arise, [[H6965]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and disguise thyself, [[H8138]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] be not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] to be the wife [[H802]] of Jeroboam; [[H3379]] and get [[H1980]] thee to Shiloh: [[H7887]] behold, [[H2009]] there [[H8033]] Ahijah [[H281]] the prophet, [[H5030]] which [[H1931]] told [[H1696]] me that king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]

### 3
And take [[H3947]] with thee [[H3027]] ten [[H6235]] loaves, [[H3899]] and cracknels, [[H5350]] and a cruse [[H1228]] of honey, [[H1706]] and go [[H935]] to [[H413]] him: he [[H1931]] shall tell [[H5046]] thee what [[H4100]] shall become [[H1961]] of the child. [[H5288]]

### 4
And Jeroboam's [[H3379]] wife [[H802]] did so, [[H6213]] and arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Shiloh, [[H7887]] and came [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of Ahijah. [[H281]] But Ahijah [[H281]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] see; [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] his eyes [[H5869]] were set [[H6965]] by reason of his age. [[H7869]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Ahijah, [[H281]] Behold, [[H2009]] the wife [[H802]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] cometh [[H935]] to ask [[H1875]] a thing [[H1697]] of [[H5973]] thee for [[H413]] her son; [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] sick: [[H2470]] thus [[H2090]] and thus [[H2088]] shalt thou say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] her: for it shall be, [[H1961]] when she cometh in, [[H935]] that she [[H1931]] shall feign herself another [[H5234]]

### 6
And it was [[H1961]] when Ahijah [[H281]] heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of her feet, [[H7272]] as she came in [[H935]] at the door, [[H6607]] that he said, [[H559]] Come in, [[H935]] thou wife [[H802]] of Jeroboam; [[H3379]] why [[H4100]] feignest thou thyself another? [[H5234]] for I [[H595]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] thee heavy [[H7186]]

### 7
Go, [[H1980]] tell [[H559]] Jeroboam, [[H3379]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Forasmuch [[H3282]] as I exalted [[H7311]] thee from among [[H8432]] the people, [[H5971]] and made [[H5414]] thee prince [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]]

### 8
And rent away [[H7167]] the kingdom [[H4467]] from the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] and gave [[H5414]] it thee: and thou hast not [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] as my servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] who [[H834]] kept [[H8104]] my commandments, [[H4687]] and who [[H834]] followed [[H1980]] me with all [[H3605]] his heart, [[H3824]] to do [[H6213]] only [[H7535]] right [[H3477]] in mine eyes; [[H5869]]

### 9
But hast done [[H6213]] evil [[H7489]] above all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] thee: for thou hast gone [[H1980]] and made [[H6213]] thee other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and molten images, [[H4541]] to provoke me to anger, [[H3707]] and hast cast [[H7993]] me behind [[H310]] thy back: [[H1458]]

### 10
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] and will cut off [[H3772]] from Jeroboam [[H3379]] him that pisseth [[H8366]] against the wall, [[H7023]] him that is shut up [[H6113]] and left [[H5800]] in Israel, [[H3478]] and will take away [[H1197]] the remnant [[H310]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] as [[H834]] a man taketh away [[H1197]] dung, [[H1557]] till [[H5704]] it be all gone. [[H8552]]

### 11
Him that dieth [[H4191]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] in the city [[H5892]] shall the dogs [[H3611]] eat; [[H398]] and him that dieth [[H4191]] in the field [[H7704]] shall the fowls [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] eat: [[H398]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]]

### 12
Arise [[H6965]] thou [[H859]] therefore, get [[H1980]] thee to thine own house: [[H1004]] when thy feet [[H7272]] enter [[H935]] into the city, [[H5892]] the child [[H3206]] shall die. [[H4191]]

### 13
And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] shall mourn [[H5594]] for him, and bury [[H6912]] him: for [[H3588]] he only [[H905]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] shall come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the grave, [[H6913]] because [[H3282]] in him there is found [[H4672]] good [[H2896]] thing [[H1697]] toward [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam. [[H3379]]

### 14
Moreover the Lord [[H3068]] shall raise him up [[H6965]] a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H834]] shall cut off [[H3772]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] that [[H2088]] day: [[H3117]] but what? [[H4100]] even [[H1571]] now. [[H6258]]

### 15
For the Lord [[H3068]] shall smite [[H5221]] Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] a reed [[H7070]] is shaken [[H5110]] in the water, [[H4325]] and he shall root up [[H5428]] Israel [[H3478]] out of [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land, [[H127]] which [[H834]] he gave [[H5414]] to their fathers, [[H1]] and shall scatter [[H2219]] them beyond [[H5676]] the river, [[H5104]] because [[H3282]] they have made [[H6213]] their groves, [[H842]] provoking the Lord [[H3068]] to anger. [[H3707]]

### 16
And he shall give up [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] because [[H1558]] of the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] who [[H834]] did sin, [[H2398]] and who [[H834]] made Israel [[H3478]] to sin. [[H2398]]

### 17
And Jeroboam's [[H3379]] wife [[H802]] arose, [[H6965]] and departed, [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] to Tirzah: [[H8656]] when she [[H1931]] came [[H935]] to the threshold [[H5592]] of the door, [[H1004]] the child [[H5288]] died; [[H4191]]

### 18
And they buried [[H6912]] him; and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] mourned [[H5594]] for him, according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by the hand [[H3027]] of his servant [[H5650]] Ahijah [[H281]] the prophet. [[H5030]]

### 19
And the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] how [[H834]] he warred, [[H3898]] and how [[H834]] he reigned, [[H4427]] behold, [[H2009]] they written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 20
And the days [[H3117]] which [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] reigned [[H4427]] two [[H8147]] and twenty [[H6242]] years: [[H8141]] and he slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and Nadab [[H5070]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 21
And Rehoboam [[H7346]] the son [[H1121]] of Solomon [[H8010]] reigned [[H4427]] in Judah. [[H3063]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] forty [[H705]] and one [[H259]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] seventeen [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] did choose [[H977]] out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to put [[H7760]] his name [[H8034]] there. [[H8033]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Naamah [[H5279]] an Ammonitess. [[H5985]]

### 22
And Judah [[H3063]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and they provoked him to jealousy [[H7065]] with their sins [[H2403]] which [[H834]] they had committed, [[H2398]] above all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]]

### 23
For they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] built [[H1129]] them high places, [[H1116]] and images, [[H4676]] and groves, [[H842]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] hill, [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree. [[H6086]]

### 24
And there were [[H1961]] also [[H1571]] sodomites [[H6945]] in the land: [[H776]] they did [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] of the nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] cast out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 25
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Rehoboam, [[H7346]] Shishak [[H7895]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] came up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]]

### 26
And he took away [[H3947]] the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the treasures [[H214]] of the king's [[H4428]] house; [[H1004]] he even took away [[H3947]] all: [[H3605]] and he took away [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the shields [[H4043]] of gold [[H2091]] which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made. [[H6213]]

### 27
And king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] made [[H6213]] in their stead [[H8478]] brasen [[H5178]] shields, [[H4043]] and committed [[H6485]] unto [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of the chief [[H8269]] of the guard, [[H7323]] which kept [[H8104]] the door [[H6607]] of the king's [[H4428]] house. [[H1004]]

### 28
And it was [[H1961]] when [[H1767]] the king [[H4428]] went [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that the guard [[H7323]] bare [[H5375]] them, and brought them back [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the guard [[H7323]] chamber. [[H8372]]

### 29
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Rehoboam, [[H7346]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the chronicles [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 30
And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] all [[H3605]] days. [[H3117]]

### 31
And Rehoboam [[H7346]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Naamah [[H5279]] an Ammonitess. [[H5985]] And Abijam [[H38]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
