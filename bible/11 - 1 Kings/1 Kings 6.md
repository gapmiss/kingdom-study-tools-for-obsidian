And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and eightieth [[H8084]] year [[H8141]] after the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were come out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Solomon's [[H8010]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] in the month [[H2320]] Zif, [[H2099]] which [[H1931]] the second [[H8145]] month, [[H2320]] that he began to build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord.

### 3
And the porch [[H197]] before [[H6440]] the temple [[H1964]] of the house, [[H1004]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] the length [[H753]] thereof, according [[H5921]] to the breadth [[H7341]] of the house; [[H1004]] ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] the breadth [[H7341]] thereof before [[H5921]] the house. [[H1004]]

### 4
And for the house [[H1004]] he made [[H6213]] windows [[H2474]] of narrow [[H331]] lights. [[H8261]]

### 5
And against [[H5921]] the wall [[H7023]] of the house [[H1004]] he built [[H1129]] chambers [[H3326]] round about, [[H5439]] the walls [[H7023]] of the house [[H1004]] round about, [[H5439]] of the temple [[H1964]] and of the oracle: [[H1687]] and he made [[H6213]] chambers [[H6763]] round about: [[H5439]]

### 6
The nethermost [[H8481]] chamber [[H3326]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] broad, [[H7341]] and the middle [[H8484]] six [[H8337]] cubits [[H520]] broad, [[H7341]] and the third [[H7992]] seven [[H7651]] cubits [[H520]] broad: [[H7341]] for [[H3588]] without [[H2351]] of the house [[H1004]] he made [[H5414]] narrowed rests [[H4052]] round about, [[H5439]] that should not [[H1115]] be fastened [[H270]] in the walls [[H7023]] of the house. [[H1004]]

### 7
And the house, [[H1004]] when it was in building, [[H1129]] was built [[H1129]] of stone [[H68]] made ready [[H8003]] before it was brought [[H4551]] thither: so that there was neither [[H3808]] hammer [[H4717]] nor axe [[H1631]] any [[H3605]] tool [[H3627]] of iron [[H1270]] heard [[H8085]] in the house, [[H1004]] while it was in building. [[H1129]]

### 8
The door [[H6607]] for the middle [[H8484]] chamber [[H6763]] in [[H413]] the right [[H3233]] side [[H3802]] of the house: [[H1004]] and they went up [[H5927]] with winding stairs [[H3883]] into [[H5921]] the middle [[H8484]] and out of [[H4480]] the middle [[H8484]] into [[H413]] the third. [[H7992]]

### 9
So he built [[H1129]] the house, [[H1004]] and finished [[H3615]] it; and covered [[H5603]] the house [[H1004]] with beams [[H1356]] and boards [[H7713]] of cedar. [[H730]]

### 10
And he built [[H1129]] chambers [[H3326]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the house, [[H1004]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] high: [[H6967]] and they rested on [[H270]] the house [[H1004]] with timber [[H6086]] of cedar. [[H730]]

### 11
And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Solomon, [[H8010]] saying, [[H559]]

### 12
this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] thou [[H859]] art in building, [[H1129]] if [[H518]] thou wilt walk [[H1980]] in my statutes, [[H2708]] and execute [[H6213]] my judgments, [[H4941]] and keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] my commandments [[H4687]] to walk [[H1980]] in them; then will I perform [[H6965]] my word [[H1697]] with thee, [[H854]] which [[H834]] I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] David [[H1732]] thy father: [[H1]]

### 13
And I will dwell [[H7931]] among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and will not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] my people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 14
So Solomon [[H8010]] built [[H1129]] the house, [[H1004]] and finished [[H3615]] it. [[H3615]]

### 15
And he built [[H1129]] the walls [[H7023]] of the house [[H1004]] within [[H1004]] with boards [[H6763]] of cedar, [[H730]] both the floor [[H7172]] of the house, [[H1004]] and the walls [[H7023]] of the cieling: [[H5604]] he covered [[H6823]] on the inside [[H1004]] with wood, [[H6086]] and covered [[H6823]] the floor [[H7172]] of the house [[H1004]] with planks [[H6763]] of fir. [[H1265]]

### 16
And he built [[H1129]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] on the sides [[H3411]] of the house, [[H1004]] both [[H4480]] the floor [[H7172]] and the walls [[H7023]] with boards [[H6763]] of cedar: [[H730]] he even built [[H1129]] for it within, [[H1004]] for the oracle, [[H1687]] for the most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]]

### 17
And the house, [[H1004]] that [[H1931]] the temple [[H1964]] before [[H3942]] it, was [[H1961]] forty [[H705]] cubits [[H520]]

### 18
And the cedar [[H730]] of [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] within [[H6441]] carved [[H4734]] with knops [[H6497]] and open [[H6358]] flowers: [[H6731]] all [[H3605]] cedar; [[H730]] there was no [[H369]] stone [[H68]] seen. [[H7200]]

### 19
And the oracle [[H1687]] he prepared [[H3559]] in [[H8432]] the house [[H1004]] within, [[H6441]] to set [[H5414]] there [[H8033]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
And the oracle [[H1687]] in the forepart [[H6440]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] in length, [[H753]] and twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] in breadth, [[H7341]] and twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] in the height [[H6967]] thereof: and he overlaid [[H6823]] it with pure [[H5462]] gold; [[H2091]] and covered [[H6823]] the altar [[H4196]] cedar. [[H730]]

### 21
So Solomon [[H8010]] overlaid [[H6823]] the house [[H1004]] within [[H6441]] with pure [[H5462]] gold: [[H2091]] and he made a partition [[H5674]] by the chains [[H7572]] of gold [[H2091]] before [[H6440]] the oracle; [[H1687]] and he overlaid [[H6823]] it with gold. [[H2091]]

### 22
And the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] he overlaid [[H6823]] with gold, [[H2091]] until [[H5704]] he had finished [[H8552]] all [[H3605]] the house: [[H1004]] also the whole [[H3605]] altar [[H4196]] that [[H834]] by the oracle [[H1687]] he overlaid [[H6823]] with gold. [[H2091]]

### 23
And within the oracle [[H1687]] he made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] cherubims [[H3742]] olive [[H8081]] tree, [[H6086]] ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]]

### 24
And five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] the one [[H259]] wing [[H3671]] of the cherub, [[H3742]] and five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] the other [[H8145]] wing [[H3671]] of the cherub: [[H3742]] from the uttermost part [[H7098]] of the one wing [[H3671]] unto [[H5704]] the uttermost part [[H7098]] of the other [[H3671]] ten [[H6235]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 25
And the other [[H8145]] cherub [[H3742]] ten [[H6235]] cubits: [[H520]] both [[H8147]] the cherubims [[H3742]] of one [[H259]] measure [[H4060]] and one [[H259]] size. [[H7095]]

### 27
And he set [[H5414]] the cherubims [[H3742]] within [[H8432]] the inner [[H6442]] house: [[H1004]] and they stretched forth [[H6566]] the wings [[H3671]] of the cherubims, [[H3742]] so that the wing [[H3671]] of the one [[H259]] touched [[H5060]] the wall, [[H7023]] and the wing [[H3671]] of the other [[H8145]] cherub [[H3742]] touched [[H5060]] the other [[H8145]] wall; [[H7023]] and their wings [[H3671]] touched [[H5060]] one [[H3671]] another [[H3671]] in [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the house. [[H1004]]

### 28
And he overlaid [[H6823]] the cherubims [[H3742]] with gold. [[H2091]]

### 29
And he carved [[H7049]] all [[H3605]] the walls [[H7023]] of the house [[H1004]] round about [[H4524]] with carved [[H6603]] figures [[H4734]] of cherubims [[H3742]] and palm trees [[H8561]] and open [[H6358]] flowers, [[H6731]] within [[H6441]] and without. [[H2435]]

### 30
And the floor [[H7172]] of the house [[H1004]] he overlaid [[H6823]] with gold, [[H2091]] within [[H6441]] and without. [[H2435]]

### 31
And for the entering [[H6607]] of the oracle [[H1687]] he made [[H6213]] doors [[H1817]] olive [[H8081]] tree: [[H6086]] the lintel [[H352]] side posts [[H4201]] a fifth part [[H2549]]

### 32
The two [[H8147]] doors [[H1817]] also olive [[H8081]] tree; [[H6086]] and he carved [[H7049]] upon [[H5921]] them carvings [[H4734]] of cherubims [[H3742]] and palm trees [[H8561]] and open [[H6358]] flowers, [[H6731]] and overlaid [[H6823]] with gold, [[H2091]] and spread [[H7286]] gold [[H2091]] upon [[H5921]] the cherubims, [[H3742]] and upon [[H5921]] the palm trees.
