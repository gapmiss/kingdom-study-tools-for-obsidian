### 1
And Ahab [[H256]] told [[H5046]] Jezebel [[H348]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Elijah [[H452]] had done, [[H6213]] and withal [[H3605]] how [[H834]] he had slain [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 2
Then Jezebel [[H348]] sent [[H7971]] a messenger [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] Elijah, [[H452]] saying, [[H559]] So [[H3541]] let the gods [[H430]] do [[H6213]] and more [[H3254]] also, [[H3541]] if [[H3588]] I make [[H7760]]  not [[H853]] thy life [[H5315]] as the life [[H5315]] of one [[H259]] of them by to morrow [[H4279]] about this time. [[H6256]]

### 3
And when he saw [[H7200]] he arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] for [[H413]] his life, [[H5315]] and came [[H935]] to Beer-sheba, [[H884]] which [[H834]] to Judah, [[H3063]] and left [[H3240]] his servant [[H5288]] there. [[H8033]]

### 4
But he himself [[H1931]] went [[H1980]] a day's [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] into the wilderness, [[H4057]] and came [[H935]] and sat down [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] a [[H259]] juniper tree: [[H7574]] and he requested [[H7592]] for himself [[H5315]] that he might die; [[H4191]] and said, [[H559]] It is enough; [[H7227]] now, [[H6258]] O Lord, [[H3068]] take away [[H3947]] my life; [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] better [[H2896]] than my fathers. [[H1]]

### 5
And as he lay [[H7901]] and slept [[H3462]] under [[H8478]] a [[H259]] juniper tree, [[H7574]] behold, [[H2009]] then [[H2088]] an angel [[H4397]] touched [[H5060]] him, and said [[H559]] unto him, Arise [[H6965]] eat. [[H398]]

### 6
And he looked, [[H5027]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a cake [[H5692]] baken on the coals, [[H7529]] and a cruse [[H6835]] of water [[H4325]] at his head. [[H4763]] And he did eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and laid him down [[H7901]] again. [[H7725]]

### 7
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came again [[H7725]] the second time, [[H8145]] and touched [[H5060]] him, and said, [[H559]] Arise [[H6965]] eat; [[H398]] because [[H3588]] the journey [[H1870]] too great [[H7227]] for [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 8
And he arose, [[H6965]] and did eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and went [[H1980]] in the strength [[H3581]] of that [[H1931]] meat [[H396]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights [[H3915]] unto [[H5704]] Horeb [[H2722]] the mount [[H2022]] of God. [[H430]]

### 9
And he came [[H935]] thither [[H8033]] unto [[H413]] a cave, [[H4631]] and lodged [[H3885]] there; [[H8033]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to [[H413]] him, and he said [[H559]] unto him, What [[H4100]] doest thou here, [[H6311]] Elijah? [[H452]]

### 10
And he said, [[H559]] I have been very [[H7065]] jealous [[H7065]] for the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts: [[H6635]] for [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] have forsaken [[H5800]] thy covenant, [[H1285]] thrown down [[H2040]] thine altars, [[H4196]] and slain [[H2026]] thy prophets [[H5030]] with the sword; [[H2719]] and I, [[H589]] I only, [[H905]] am left; [[H3498]] and they seek [[H1245]] my life, [[H5315]] to take it away. [[H3947]]

### 11
And he said, [[H559]] Go forth, [[H3318]] and stand [[H5975]] upon the mount [[H2022]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]] And, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] passed by, [[H5674]] and a great [[H1419]] and strong [[H2389]] wind [[H7307]] rent [[H6561]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and brake in pieces [[H7665]] the rocks [[H5553]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] the Lord [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] in the wind: [[H7307]] and after [[H310]] the wind [[H7307]] an earthquake; [[H7494]] the Lord [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] in the earthquake: [[H7494]]

### 12
And after [[H310]] the earthquake [[H7494]] a fire; [[H784]] the Lord [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] in the fire: [[H784]] and after [[H310]] the fire [[H784]] a still [[H1827]] small [[H1851]] voice. [[H6963]]

### 13
And it was [[H1961]] when Elijah [[H452]] heard [[H8085]] that he wrapped [[H3874]] his face [[H6440]] in his mantle, [[H155]] and went out, [[H3318]] and stood [[H5975]] in the entering in [[H6607]] of the cave. [[H4631]] And, behold, [[H2009]] a voice [[H6963]] unto [[H413]] him, and said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] doest thou here, [[H6311]] Elijah? [[H452]]

### 14
And he said, [[H559]] I have been very [[H7065]] jealous [[H7065]] for the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts: [[H6635]] because [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] have forsaken [[H5800]] thy covenant, [[H1285]] thrown down [[H2040]] thine altars, [[H4196]] and slain [[H2026]] thy prophets [[H5030]] with the sword; [[H2719]] and I, [[H589]] I only, [[H905]] am left; [[H3498]] and they seek [[H1245]] my life, [[H5315]] to take it away. [[H3947]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Go, [[H1980]] return [[H7725]] on thy way [[H1870]] to the wilderness [[H4057]] of Damascus: [[H1834]] and when thou comest, [[H935]] anoint [[H4886]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Syria: [[H758]]

### 16
And Jehu [[H3058]] the son [[H1121]] of Nimshi [[H5250]] shalt thou anoint [[H4886]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] and Elisha [[H477]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphat [[H8202]] of Abel-meholah [[H65]] shalt thou anoint [[H4886]] prophet [[H5030]] in thy room. [[H8478]]

### 17
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] him that escapeth [[H4422]] the sword [[H2719]] of Hazael [[H2371]] shall Jehu [[H3058]] slay: [[H4191]] and him that escapeth [[H4422]] from the sword [[H2719]] of Jehu [[H3058]] shall Elisha [[H477]] slay. [[H4191]]

### 18
Yet I have left [[H7604]] seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] in Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the knees [[H1290]] which [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] bowed [[H3766]] unto Baal, [[H1168]] and every [[H3605]] mouth [[H6310]] which [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] kissed [[H5401]] him. [[H5401]]

### 19
So he departed [[H1980]] thence, [[H8033]] and found [[H4672]] Elisha [[H477]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphat, [[H8202]] who [[H1931]] plowing [[H2790]] twelve [[H8147]] yoke [[H6776]] before [[H6440]] him, and he [[H1931]] with the twelfth: [[H8147]] and Elijah [[H452]] passed [[H5674]] by [[H413]] him, and cast [[H7993]] his mantle [[H155]] upon [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 20
And he left [[H5800]] the oxen, [[H1241]] and ran [[H7323]] after [[H310]] Elijah, [[H452]] and said, [[H559]] Let me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] kiss [[H5401]] my father [[H1]] and my mother, [[H517]] and I will follow [[H1980]] thee. And he said [[H559]] unto him, Go back [[H3212]] again: [[H7725]] for [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] have I done [[H6213]] to thee? [[H6213]]

### 21
And he returned back [[H7725]] from [[H310]] him, and took [[H3947]] a yoke [[H6776]] of oxen, [[H1241]] and slew [[H2076]] them, and boiled [[H1310]] their flesh [[H1320]] with the instruments [[H3627]] of the oxen, [[H1241]] and gave [[H5414]] unto the people, [[H5971]] and they did eat. [[H398]] Then he arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] Elijah, [[H452]] and ministered [[H8334]] unto him. [[H8334]]
