And when the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] heard [[H8085]]  of [[H853]] the fame [[H8088]] of Solomon [[H8010]] concerning the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] she came [[H935]] to prove [[H5254]] him with hard questions. [[H2420]]

### 2
And she came [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] with a very [[H3966]] great [[H3515]] train, [[H2428]] with camels [[H1581]] that bare [[H5375]] spices, [[H1314]] and very [[H3966]] much [[H7227]] gold, [[H2091]] and precious [[H3368]] stones: [[H68]] and when she was come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Solomon, [[H8010]] she communed [[H1696]] with [[H413]]  him of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] her heart. [[H3824]]

### 3
And Solomon [[H8010]] told [[H5046]]  her [[H853]] all [[H3605]] her questions: [[H1697]] there was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] thing [[H1697]] hid [[H5956]] from [[H4480]] the king, [[H4428]] which [[H834]] he told [[H5046]] her not. [[H3808]]

### 4
And when the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] had seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] Solomon's [[H8010]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] he had built, [[H1129]]

### 5
And the meat [[H3978]] of his table, [[H7979]] and the sitting [[H4186]] of his servants, [[H5650]] and the attendance [[H4612]] of his ministers, [[H8334]] and their apparel, [[H4403]] and his cupbearers, [[H4945]] and his ascent [[H5930]] by which [[H834]] he went up [[H5927]] unto the house [[H1004]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] spirit [[H7307]] in her. [[H7307]]

### 6
And she said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] It was [[H1961]] a true [[H571]] report [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I heard [[H8085]] in mine own land [[H776]] of [[H5921]] thy acts [[H1697]] and of [[H5921]] thy wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 7
Howbeit I believed [[H539]] not [[H3808]] the words, [[H1697]] until [[H5704]] I came, [[H935]] and mine eyes [[H5869]] had seen [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the half [[H2677]] was not [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] me: thy wisdom [[H2451]] and prosperity [[H2896]] exceedeth [[H3254]] the fame [[H8052]] which [[H834]] I heard. [[H8085]]

### 8
Happy [[H835]] thy men, [[H376]] happy [[H835]] these [[H428]] thy servants, [[H5650]] which stand [[H5975]] continually [[H8548]] before [[H6440]] thee, that hear [[H8085]] thy wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 9
Blessed [[H1288]] be [[H1961]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] delighted [[H2654]] in thee, to set [[H5414]] thee on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel: [[H3478]] because the Lord [[H3068]] loved [[H160]] Israel [[H3478]] for ever, [[H5769]] therefore made [[H7760]] he thee king, [[H4428]] to do [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] and justice. [[H6666]]

### 10
And she gave [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] an hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]] and of spices [[H1314]] very [[H3966]] great store, [[H7235]] and precious [[H3368]] stones: [[H68]] there came [[H935]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] such [[H1931]] abundance [[H7230]] of spices [[H1314]] as these which [[H834]] the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] gave [[H5414]] to king [[H4428]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 11
And the navy [[H590]] also [[H1571]] of Hiram, [[H2438]] that [[H834]] brought [[H5375]] gold [[H2091]] from Ophir, [[H211]] brought in [[H935]] from Ophir [[H211]] great [[H3966]] plenty [[H7235]] of almug [[H484]] trees, [[H6086]] and precious [[H3368]] stones. [[H68]]

### 12
And the king [[H4428]] made [[H6213]]  of [[H853]] the almug [[H484]] trees [[H6086]] pillars [[H4552]] for the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and for the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] harps [[H3658]] also and psalteries [[H5035]] for singers: [[H7891]] there came [[H935]] no [[H3808]] such [[H3651]] almug [[H484]] trees, [[H6086]] nor [[H3808]] were seen [[H7200]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 13
And king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] gave [[H5414]] unto the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] all [[H3605]] her desire, [[H2656]] whatsoever [[H834]] she asked, [[H7592]] beside [[H905]] which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] gave [[H5414]] her of his royal [[H4428]] bounty. [[H3027]] So she turned [[H6437]] and went [[H1980]] to her own country, [[H776]] she [[H1931]] and her servants. [[H5650]]

### 14
Now the weight [[H4948]] of gold [[H2091]] that [[H834]] came [[H935]] to Solomon [[H8010]] in one [[H259]] year [[H8141]] was [[H1961]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] threescore [[H8346]] and six [[H8337]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]]

### 16
And king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] made [[H6213]] two hundred [[H3967]] targets [[H6793]] beaten [[H7820]] gold: [[H2091]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] of gold [[H2091]] went [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] one [[H259]] target. [[H6793]]

### 17

[[H3844]]

### 18
Moreover the king [[H4428]] made [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] throne [[H3678]] of ivory, [[H8127]] and overlaid [[H6823]] it with the best [[H6338]] gold. [[H2091]]

### 19
The throne [[H3678]] had six [[H8337]] steps, [[H4609]] and the top [[H7218]] of the throne [[H3678]] round [[H5696]] behind: [[H310]] and stays [[H3027]] on either side [[H2088]] on [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of the seat, [[H7675]] and two [[H8147]] lions [[H738]] stood [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] the stays. [[H3027]]

### 20
And twelve [[H8147]] lions [[H738]] stood [[H5975]] there [[H8033]] on [[H5921]] the one side [[H2088]] and on the other [[H2088]] upon the six [[H8337]] steps: [[H4609]] there was not [[H3808]] the like [[H3651]] made [[H6213]] in any [[H3605]] kingdom. [[H4467]]

### 21
And all [[H3605]] king [[H4428]] Solomon's [[H8010]] drinking [[H4945]] vessels [[H3627]] gold, [[H2091]] and all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of the forest [[H3293]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] pure [[H5462]] gold; [[H2091]] none [[H369]] silver: [[H3701]] it was nothing [[H3972]] accounted [[H2803]] of in the days [[H3117]] of Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] had at sea [[H3220]] a navy [[H590]] of Tharshish [[H8659]] with [[H5973]] the navy [[H590]] of Hiram: [[H2438]] once [[H259]] in three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] came [[H935]] the navy [[H590]] of Tharshish, [[H8659]] bringing [[H5375]] gold, [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] ivory, [[H8143]] and apes, [[H6971]] and peacocks. [[H8500]]

### 23
So king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] exceeded all [[H1431]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] for riches [[H6239]] and for wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 24
And all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] sought [[H1245]] to [[H6440]] Solomon, [[H8010]] to hear [[H8085]] his wisdom, [[H2451]] which [[H834]] God [[H430]] had put [[H5414]] in his heart. [[H3820]]

### 25
And they [[H1992]] brought [[H935]] every man [[H376]] his present, [[H4503]] vessels [[H3627]] of silver, [[H3701]] and vessels [[H3627]] of gold, [[H2091]] and garments, [[H8008]] and armour, [[H5402]] and spices, [[H1314]] horses, [[H5483]] and mules, [[H6505]] a rate [[H1697]] year [[H8141]] by year. [[H8141]]

[[H3389]]

### 29
And a chariot [[H4818]] came up [[H5927]] and went out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] for six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] of silver, [[H3701]] and an horse [[H5483]] for an hundred [[H3967]] and fifty: [[H2572]] and so [[H3651]] for all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Hittites, [[H2850]] and for the kings [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] did they bring out [[H3318]] by their means.
