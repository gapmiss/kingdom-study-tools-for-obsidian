### 1
Now king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] was old [[H2204]] stricken [[H935]] in years; [[H3117]] and they covered [[H3680]] him with clothes, [[H899]] but he gat no heat. [[H3179]]

### 2
Wherefore his servants [[H5650]] said [[H559]] unto him, Let there be sought [[H1245]] for my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] a young [[H5291]] virgin: [[H1330]] and let her stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] and let her cherish [[H5532]] him, and let her lie [[H7901]] in thy bosom, [[H2436]] that my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] may get heat. [[H2552]]

### 3
So they sought [[H1245]] for a fair [[H3303]] damsel [[H5291]] throughout all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and found [[H4672]] Abishag [[H49]] a Shunammite, [[H7767]] and brought [[H935]] her to the king. [[H4428]]

### 4
And the damsel [[H5291]] very [[H3966]] fair, [[H3303]] and cherished [[H5532]] the king, [[H4428]] and ministered [[H8334]] to him: but the king [[H4428]] knew [[H3045]] her not. [[H3808]]

### 5
Then Adonijah [[H138]] the son [[H1121]] of Haggith [[H2294]] exalted himself, [[H5375]] saying, [[H559]] I [[H589]] will be king: [[H4427]] and he prepared [[H6213]] him chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen, [[H6571]] and fifty [[H2572]] men [[H376]] to run [[H7323]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 6
And his father [[H1]] had not [[H3808]] displeased [[H6087]] him at any time [[H3117]] in saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4069]] hast thou done so? [[H6213]] and he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] very [[H3966]] goodly [[H2896]] and bare [[H3205]] him after [[H310]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 7
And he conferred [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] Joab [[H3097]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] and with [[H5973]] Abiathar [[H54]] the priest: [[H3548]] and they following [[H310]] Adonijah [[H138]] helped [[H5826]]

### 8
But Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Shimei, [[H8096]] and Rei, [[H7472]] and the mighty men [[H1368]] which [[H834]] to David, [[H1732]] were [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] with [[H5973]] Adonijah. [[H138]]

### 9
And Adonijah [[H138]] slew [[H2076]] sheep [[H6629]] and oxen [[H1241]] and fat cattle [[H4806]] by [[H5973]] the stone [[H68]] of Zoheleth, [[H2120]] which [[H834]] by [[H681]] En-rogel, [[H5883]] and called [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] his brethren [[H251]] the king's [[H4428]] sons, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] the king's [[H4428]] servants: [[H5650]]

### 10
But Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Benaiah, [[H1141]] and the mighty men, [[H1368]] and Solomon [[H8010]] his brother, [[H251]] he called [[H7121]] not. [[H3808]]

### 11
Wherefore Nathan [[H5416]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Bath-sheba [[H1339]] the mother [[H517]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] saying, [[H559]] Hast thou not [[H3808]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Adonijah [[H138]] the son [[H1121]] of Haggith [[H2294]] doth reign, [[H4427]] and David [[H1732]] our lord [[H113]] knoweth [[H3045]] not? [[H3808]]

### 12
Now [[H6258]] therefore come, [[H1980]] let me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] give thee counsel, [[H3289]] that thou mayest save [[H4422]] thine own life, [[H5315]] and the life [[H5315]] of thy son [[H1121]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 13
Go [[H1980]] and get thee in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Didst not [[H3808]] thou, [[H859]] my lord, [[H113]] O king, [[H4428]] swear [[H7650]] unto thine handmaid, [[H519]] saying, [[H559]] Assuredly [[H3588]] Solomon [[H8010]] thy son [[H1121]] shall reign [[H4427]] after [[H310]] me, and he [[H1931]] shall sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] my throne? [[H3678]] why [[H4069]] then doth Adonijah [[H138]] reign? [[H4427]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2009]] while thou yet [[H5750]] talkest [[H1696]] there [[H8033]] with [[H5973]] the king, [[H4428]] I [[H589]] also will come in [[H935]] after [[H310]] thee, and confirm [[H4390]] thy words. [[H1697]]

### 15
And Bath-sheba [[H1339]] went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] into the chamber: [[H2315]] and the king [[H4428]] was very [[H3966]] old; [[H2204]] and Abishag [[H49]] the Shunammite [[H7767]] ministered unto [[H853]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 16
And [[H6915]] Bath-sheba [[H1339]] bowed, [[H6915]] and did obeisance [[H7812]] unto the king. [[H4428]] And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] wouldest [[H4100]] thou? [[H0]]

### 17
And she said [[H559]] unto him, My lord, [[H113]] thou [[H859]] swarest [[H7650]] by the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] unto thine handmaid, [[H519]] Assuredly [[H3588]] Solomon [[H8010]] thy son [[H1121]] shall reign [[H4427]] after [[H310]] me, and he [[H1931]] shall sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] my throne. [[H3678]]

### 18
And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] Adonijah [[H138]] reigneth; [[H4427]] and now, [[H6258]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not: [[H3808]]

### 19
And he hath slain [[H2076]] oxen [[H7794]] and fat cattle [[H4806]] and sheep [[H6629]] in abundance, [[H7230]] and hath called [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of the king, [[H4428]] and Abiathar [[H54]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Joab [[H3097]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host: [[H6635]] but Solomon [[H8010]] thy servant [[H5650]] hath he not [[H3808]] called. [[H7121]]

### 20
And thou, [[H859]] my lord, [[H113]] O king, [[H4428]] the eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] upon [[H5921]] thee, that thou shouldest tell [[H5046]] them who [[H4310]] shall sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 21
Otherwise it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] shall sleep [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] that I [[H589]] and my son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] shall be counted [[H1961]] offenders. [[H2400]]

### 22
And, lo, [[H2009]] while she yet [[H5750]] talked [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] the king, [[H4428]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] also came in. [[H935]]

### 23
And they told [[H5046]] the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet. [[H5030]] And when he was come in [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] he bowed himself [[H7812]] before the king [[H4428]] with [[H5921]] his face [[H639]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 24
And Nathan [[H5416]] said, [[H559]] My lord, [[H113]] O king, [[H4428]] hast thou [[H859]] said, [[H559]] Adonijah [[H138]] shall reign [[H4427]] after [[H310]] me, and he [[H1931]] shall sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] my throne? [[H3678]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] he is gone down [[H3381]] this day, [[H3117]] and hath slain [[H2076]] oxen [[H7794]] and fat cattle [[H4806]] and sheep [[H6629]] in abundance, [[H7230]] and hath called [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] sons, [[H1121]] and the captains [[H8269]] of the host, [[H6635]] and Abiathar [[H54]] the priest; [[H3548]] and, behold, [[H2009]] they eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] before [[H6440]] him, and say, [[H559]] God save [[H2421]] king [[H4428]] Adonijah. [[H138]]

### 26
But me, me [[H589]] thy servant, [[H5650]] and Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] and thy servant [[H5650]] Solomon, [[H8010]] hath he not [[H3808]] called. [[H7121]]

### 27
Is this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] done [[H1961]] by [[H853]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] and thou hast not [[H3808]] shewed unto [[H3045]] thy servant, [[H5650]] who [[H4310]] should sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] after [[H310]] him? [[H310]]

### 28
Then [[H6030]] king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Call [[H7121]] me [[H0]] Bath-sheba. [[H1339]] And she came into [[H935]] the king's [[H4428]] presence, [[H6440]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 29
And the king [[H4428]] sware, [[H7650]] and said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] that [[H834]] hath redeemed [[H6299]] my soul [[H5315]] out of all [[H3605]] distress, [[H6869]]

### 30
Even [[H3588]] as [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto thee by the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Assuredly [[H3588]] Solomon [[H8010]] thy son [[H1121]] shall reign [[H4427]] after [[H310]] me, and he [[H1931]] shall sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] my throne [[H3678]] in my stead; [[H8478]] even [[H3651]] so [[H6213]] will I certainly do [[H3117]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H2088]]

### 31
Then [[H6915]] Bath-sheba [[H1339]] bowed [[H6915]] with face [[H639]] to the earth, [[H776]] and did reverence [[H7812]] to the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] Let my lord [[H113]] king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] live [[H2421]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 32
And king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Call [[H7121]] me Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada. [[H3077]] And they came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 33
The king [[H4428]] also said [[H559]] unto them, Take [[H3947]] with [[H5973]]  you [[H853]] the servants [[H5650]] of your lord, [[H113]]  and cause [[H853]] Solomon [[H8010]] my son [[H1121]] to ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] mine own mule, [[H6506]] and bring him down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] Gihon: [[H1521]]

### 34
And let Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] anoint [[H4886]] him there [[H8033]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] and blow [[H8628]] ye with the trumpet, [[H7782]] and say, [[H559]] God save [[H2421]] king [[H4428]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 35
Then ye shall come up [[H5927]] after [[H310]] him, that he may come [[H935]] and sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] my throne; [[H3678]] for he [[H1931]] shall be king [[H4427]] in my stead: [[H8478]] and I have appointed [[H6680]] him to be [[H1961]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and over [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 36
And Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] answered [[H6030]] the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] Amen: [[H543]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] say [[H559]] so [[H3651]]

### 37
As [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath been [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] even so [[H3651]] be [[H1961]] he with [[H5973]] Solomon, [[H8010]] and make his throne [[H3678]] greater [[H1431]] than the throne [[H3678]] of my lord [[H113]] king [[H4428]] David. [[H1732]]

### 38
So Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] and the Cherethites, [[H3774]] and the Pelethites, [[H6432]] went down, [[H3381]]  and caused [[H853]] Solomon [[H8010]] to ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] king [[H4428]] David's [[H1732]] mule, [[H6506]] and brought [[H1980]] him to [[H5921]] Gihon. [[H1521]]

### 39
And Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] took [[H3947]] an horn [[H7161]] of oil [[H8081]] out of [[H4480]] the tabernacle, [[H168]] and anointed [[H4886]] Solomon. [[H8010]] And they blew [[H8628]] the trumpet; [[H7782]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] said, [[H559]] God save [[H2421]] king [[H4428]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 40
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] came up [[H5927]] after [[H310]] him, and the people [[H5971]] piped [[H2490]] with pipes, [[H2485]] and rejoiced [[H8056]] with great [[H1419]] joy, [[H8057]] so that the earth [[H776]] rent [[H1234]] with the sound [[H6963]] of them. [[H6963]]

### 41
And Adonijah [[H138]] and all [[H3605]] the guests [[H7121]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him heard [[H8085]] as they [[H1992]] had made an end [[H3615]] of eating. [[H398]] And when Joab [[H3097]] heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] he said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4069]] noise [[H6963]] of the city [[H7151]] being in an uproar? [[H1993]]

### 42
And while he yet [[H5750]] spake, [[H1696]] behold, [[H2009]] Jonathan [[H3129]] the son [[H1121]] of Abiathar [[H54]] the priest [[H3548]] came: [[H935]] and Adonijah [[H138]] said [[H559]] unto him, Come in; [[H935]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a valiant [[H2428]] man, [[H376]] and bringest [[H1319]] good [[H2896]] tidings. [[H2896]]

### 43
And Jonathan [[H3129]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] to Adonijah, [[H138]] Verily [[H61]] our lord [[H113]] king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] hath made Solomon [[H8010]] king. [[H4427]]

### 44
And the king [[H4428]] hath sent [[H7971]] with [[H854]]  him [[H853]] Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] and the Cherethites, [[H3774]] and the Pelethites, [[H6432]] and they have caused him to ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] the king's [[H4428]] mule: [[H6506]]

### 45
And Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] have anointed [[H4886]] him king [[H4428]] in Gihon: [[H1521]] and they are come up [[H5927]] from thence [[H8033]] rejoicing, [[H8056]] so that the city [[H7151]] rang again. [[H1949]] This [[H1931]] the noise [[H6963]] that [[H834]] ye have heard. [[H8085]]

### 46
And also [[H1571]] Solomon [[H8010]] sitteth [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of the kingdom. [[H4410]]

### 47
And moreover [[H1571]] the king's [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] came [[H935]] to bless [[H1288]] our lord [[H113]] king [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] God [[H430]]  make [[H853]] the name [[H8034]] of Solomon [[H8010]] better [[H3190]] than thy name, [[H8034]]  and make [[H853]] his throne [[H3678]] greater [[H1431]] than thy throne. [[H3678]] And the king [[H4428]] bowed himself [[H7812]] upon [[H5921]] the bed. [[H4904]]

### 48
And also [[H1571]] thus [[H3602]] said [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] hath given [[H5414]] to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] my throne [[H3678]] this day, [[H3117]] mine eyes [[H5869]] even seeing [[H7200]]

### 49
And all [[H3605]] the guests [[H7121]] that [[H834]] with Adonijah [[H138]] were afraid, [[H2729]] and rose up, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] every man [[H376]] his way. [[H1870]]

### 50
And Adonijah [[H138]] feared [[H3372]] because [[H6440]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] and arose, [[H6965]] and went, [[H1980]] and caught hold [[H2388]] on the horns [[H7161]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

### 51
And it was told [[H5046]] Solomon, [[H8010]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] Adonijah [[H138]] feareth [[H3372]] king [[H4428]] Solomon: [[H8010]] for, lo, [[H2009]] he hath caught hold [[H270]] on the horns [[H7161]] of the altar, [[H4196]] saying, [[H559]] Let king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] swear [[H7650]] unto me to day [[H3117]] that he will not [[H518]] slay [[H4191]] his servant [[H5650]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 52
And Solomon [[H8010]] said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] he will shew [[H1961]] himself a worthy [[H2428]] man, [[H1121]] there shall not [[H3808]] an hair of him [[H8185]] fall [[H5307]] to the earth: [[H776]] but if [[H518]] wickedness [[H7451]] shall be found [[H4672]] in him, he shall die. [[H4191]]

### 53
So king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] sent, [[H7971]] and they brought him down [[H3381]] from [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] And he came [[H935]] and bowed himself [[H7812]] to king [[H4428]] Solomon: [[H8010]] and Solomon [[H8010]] said [[H559]] unto him, Go [[H1980]] to thine house. [[H1004]]
