### 1
Do we begin [[G756]] again [[G3825]] to commend [[G4921]] ourselves? [[G1438]] or [[G1487]] need we, [[G5535]] as [[G5613]] some [[G5100]] epistles [[G1992]] of commendation [[G4956]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] or [[G2228]] of [[G1537]] commendation [[G4956]] from you? [[G5216]]

### 2
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] our [[G2257]] epistle [[G1992]] written [[G1449]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] hearts, [[G2588]] known [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] read [[G314]] of [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] men: [[G444]]

### 3
manifestly [[G5319]]  declared [[G3754]] to be [[G2075]] the epistle [[G1992]] of Christ [[G5547]] ministered [[G1247]] by [[G5259]] us, [[G2257]] written [[G1449]] not [[G3756]] with ink, [[G3188]] but [[G235]] with the Spirit [[G4151]] of the living [[G2198]] God; [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] tables [[G4109]] of stone, [[G3035]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] fleshy [[G4560]] tables [[G4109]] of the heart. [[G2588]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] such [[G5108]] trust [[G4006]] have we [[G2192]] through [[G1223]] Christ [[G5547]] to [[G4314]] God-ward: [[G2316]]

### 5
Not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] sufficient [[G2425]] of [[G575]] ourselves [[G1438]] to think [[G3049]] any thing [[G5100]] as [[G5613]] of [[G1537]] ourselves; [[G1438]] but [[G235]] our [[G2257]] sufficiency [[G2426]] of [[G1537]] God; [[G2316]]

### 6
Who [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] hath made [[G2427]] us [[G2248]] able ministers [[G1249]] of the new [[G2537]] testament; [[G1242]] not [[G3756]] of the letter, [[G1121]] but [[G235]] of the spirit: [[G4151]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] letter [[G1121]] killeth, [[G615]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] giveth life. [[G2227]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] ministration [[G1248]] of [[G2288]] death, [[G2288]] written [[G1121]] engraven [[G1795]] in [[G1722]] stones, [[G3037]] was [[G1096]] glorious, [[G1391]] so that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of Israel [[G2474]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] stedfastly behold [[G816]] the [[G3588]] face [[G4383]] of Moses [[G3475]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] glory of [[G1391]] his [[G846]] countenance; [[G4383]] which [[G3588]] was to be done away: [[G2673]]

### 8
How [[G4459]] not [[G3780]] of [[G4151]] shall [[G2071]] the [[G3588]] ministration [[G1248]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] be [[G2071]] rather [[G3123]] glorious? [[G1391]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] ministration [[G1248]] of [[G2633]] condemnation [[G2633]] glory, [[G1391]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] doth [[G4052]] the [[G3588]] ministration [[G1248]] of [[G1343]] righteousness [[G1343]] exceed [[G4052]] in [[G1722]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] that which [[G3588]] had [[G1392]] was made glorious [[G1392]] no [[G3761]] glory [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] respect, [[G3313]] by reason of [[G1752]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] that [[G3588]] excelleth. [[G5235]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] that which [[G3588]] is done away [[G2673]] glorious, [[G1391]] much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] that which [[G3588]] remaineth [[G3306]] glorious. [[G1391]]

### 12
Seeing then [[G3767]] that we have [[G2192]] such [[G5108]] hope, [[G1680]] we use [[G5530]] great [[G4183]] plainness of speech: [[G3954]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] as [[G2509]] Moses, [[G3475]] put [[G5087]] a veil [[G2571]] over [[G1909]] his [[G1438]] face, [[G4383]] that [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of Israel [[G2474]] could stedfastly [[G816]] not [[G3361]] look [[G816]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] of that which [[G3588]] is abolished: [[G2673]]

### 14
But [[G235]] their [[G846]] minds were [[G3540]] blinded: [[G4456]] for [[G1063]] until [[G891]] this day [[G4594]] remaineth [[G3306]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] veil [[G2571]] untaken away [[G343]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] reading of [[G320]] the [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] testament; [[G1242]] which [[G3739]] is done away [[G2673]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 15
But [[G235]] even unto [[G2193]] this day, [[G4594]] when [[G2259]] Moses [[G3475]] is read, [[G314]] the veil [[G2571]] is [[G2749]] upon [[G1909]] their [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]]

### 16
Nevertheless [[G1161]] when [[G2259]] it shall turn [[G1994]] to [[G4314]] the Lord, [[G2962]] the vail [[G3588]]  shall be taken [[G2571]] away. [[G4014]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G2076]]  that [[G3588]] Spirit: [[G4151]] and [[G1161]] where [[G3757]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of the Lord [[G2962]] there [[G1563]] liberty. [[G1657]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] all, [[G3956]] open [[G343]] with [[G4383]] face [[G4383]] beholding as in a glass [[G2734]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] are changed [[G3339]] the [[G3588]] into [[G846]] same [[G846]] image [[G1504]] from [[G575]] glory [[G1391]] to [[G1519]] glory, [[G1391]] as [[G2509]] by the Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G575]] the Lord.
