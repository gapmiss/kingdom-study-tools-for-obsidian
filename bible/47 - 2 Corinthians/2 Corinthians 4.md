### 1
Therefore [[G5124]]  seeing [[G1223]] we have [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] ministry, [[G1248]] as [[G2531]] we have received mercy, [[G1653]] we faint [[G1573]] not; [[G3756]]

### 2
But [[G235]] have renounced [[G550]] the [[G3588]] hidden things [[G2927]] of [[G152]] dishonesty, [[G152]] not [[G3361]] walking [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] craftiness, [[G3834]] nor [[G3366]] handling deceitfully; [[G1389]] the [[G3056]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]]  by [[G3588]] but [[G235]] manifestation [[G5321]] the [[G3588]] of [[G225]] truth [[G225]] commending [[G4921]] ourselves [[G1438]] to [[G4314]] every [[G3956]] man's [[G444]] conscience [[G4893]] in the sight of [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] our [[G2257]] gospel [[G2098]] be [[G2076]] hid, [[G2572]] it is [[G2076]] hid [[G2572]] to [[G1722]] them [[G3588]] that are lost: [[G622]]

### 4
In [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] god [[G2316]] of this [[G5127]] world [[G165]] hath blinded [[G5186]] the [[G3588]] minds of them which believe [[G3540]] not, [[G571]] lest [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5462]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1391]] glorious [[G1391]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the image [[G1504]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] should shine [[G826]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] we preach [[G2784]] not [[G3756]] ourselves, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] the Lord; [[G2962]] and [[G1161]] ourselves [[G1438]] your [[G5216]] servants [[G1401]] for [[G1223]] Jesus' sake. [[G2424]]

### 6
For [[G3754]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3739]] commanded [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] to shine [[G2989]] out of [[G1537]] darkness, [[G4655]] hath shined [[G2989]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] hearts, [[G2588]] to [[G4314]] the light [[G5462]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1108]] knowledge [[G1108]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] the face [[G4383]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] we have [[G2192]] this [[G5126]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] earthen [[G3749]] vessels, [[G4632]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] excellency [[G5236]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1411]] power [[G1411]] may be [[G5600]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] of [[G1537]] us. [[G2257]]

### 8
troubled [[G2346]] on [[G1722]] every side, [[G3956]] yet [[G235]] not [[G3756]] distressed; [[G4729]] perplexed, [[G639]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] in despair; [[G1820]]

### 9
Persecuted, [[G1377]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] forsaken; [[G1459]] cast down, [[G2598]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] destroyed; [[G622]]

### 10
Always [[G3842]] bearing about [[G4064]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] the [[G3588]] dying [[G3500]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] also [[G2532]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] might be made manifest [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] body. [[G4983]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] we [[G2249]] which live [[G2198]] are alway [[G104]] delivered [[G3860]] unto [[G1519]] death [[G2288]] for [[G1223]] Jesus' sake, [[G2424]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] also [[G2532]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] might be made manifest [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] mortal [[G2349]] flesh. [[G4561]]

### 12
So then [[G5620]] death [[G2288]] worketh [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] but [[G1161]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 13
We having [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] of [[G4102]] faith, [[G4102]] according as [[G2596]] it is written, [[G1125]] I believed, [[G4100]] and therefore [[G1352]] have I spoken; [[G2980]] we [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] believe, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] therefore [[G1352]] speak; [[G2980]]

### 14
Knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he which [[G3588]] raised up [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] shall raise up [[G1453]] us [[G2248]] also [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] shall present [[G3936]] with [[G4862]] you. [[G5213]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] all things [[G3956]] for [[G1223]] your sakes, [[G5209]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] abundant [[G4121]] grace [[G5485]] through [[G1223]] might [[G4052]] the [[G3588]] thanksgiving [[G2169]] of many [[G4119]] redound [[G4052]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 16
For which cause [[G1352]] we faint [[G1573]] not; [[G3756]] but [[G235]] though [[G1487]] our [[G2257]] outward [[G1854]] man [[G444]] perish, [[G1311]] yet [[G235]] the [[G3588]] inward [[G2081]] is renewed [[G341]] day [[G2250]] by [[G2532]] day. [[G2250]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] our [[G2257]] light [[G1645]] affliction, [[G2347]] which is but for a moment, [[G3910]] worketh [[G2716]] for us [[G2254]] a far [[G5236]] more exceeding [[G5236]] eternal [[G166]] weight [[G922]] of glory; [[G1391]]

### 18
While we [[G2257]] look [[G4648]] not [[G3361]] at the things [[G3588]] which are seen, [[G991]] but [[G235]] at the things [[G3588]] not [[G3361]] which are [[G991]] seen: [[G991]] for [[G1063]] the things [[G3588]] which are seen [[G991]] temporal; [[G4340]] but [[G1161]] the things [[G3588]] not [[G3361]] which are [[G991]] seen [[G991]] eternal.
