### 1
Having [[G2192]] therefore [[G3767]] these [[G3778]] promises, [[G1860]] dearly beloved, [[G27]] let us cleanse [[G2511]] ourselves [[G1438]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] filthiness [[G3436]] of the flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] spirit, [[G4151]] perfecting [[G2005]] holiness [[G42]] in [[G1722]] the fear [[G5401]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 2
Receive [[G5562]] us; [[G2248]] we have wronged [[G91]] no man, [[G3762]] we have corrupted [[G5351]] no man, [[G3762]] we have defrauded [[G4122]] no man. [[G3762]]

### 3
I speak [[G3004]] not [[G3756]] to [[G4314]] condemn [[G2633]] for [[G1063]] I have said before, [[G4280]] that [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] hearts [[G2588]] to [[G1519]] die [[G4880]] and [[G2532]] live with [[G4800]]

### 4
Great [[G4183]] my [[G3427]] boldness of speech [[G3954]] toward [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] great [[G4183]] my [[G3427]] glorying [[G2746]] of [[G5228]] you: [[G5216]] I am filled [[G4137]]  with [[G3588]] comfort, [[G3874]] I am exceeding [[G5248]] joyful [[G5479]] in [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] our [[G2257]] tribulation. [[G2347]]

### 5
For, [[G1063]] when [[G2532]] we [[G2257]] come [[G2064]] were [[G2257]] into [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] our [[G2257]] flesh [[G4561]] had [[G2192]] no [[G3762]] rest, [[G425]] but [[G235]] we were troubled [[G2346]] on [[G1722]] every side; [[G3956]] without [[G1855]] fightings, [[G3163]] within [[G2081]] fears. [[G5401]]

### 6
Nevertheless [[G235]] God, [[G2316]] that comforteth [[G3870]] those [[G3588]] that are cast down, [[G5011]] comforted [[G3870]] us [[G2248]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of Titus; [[G5103]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1722]] his [[G846]] coming [[G3952]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] by [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] consolation [[G3874]] wherewith [[G3739]] he was comforted [[G3870]] in [[G1909]] you, [[G5213]] when he told [[G312]] us [[G2254]] your [[G5216]] earnest desire, [[G1972]] your [[G5216]] mourning, [[G3602]] your [[G5216]] fervent mind [[G2205]] toward [[G5228]] me; [[G1700]] so that [[G5620]] I [[G3165]] rejoiced [[G5463]] the more. [[G3123]]

### 8
For [[G3754]] though [[G1487]] I made [[G3076]] you [[G5209]] sorry [[G3076]] with [[G1722]]  a [[G3588]] letter, [[G1992]] not [[G3756]] I do [[G3338]] repent, [[G3338]] though [[G1487]] I did repent: [[G3338]] for [[G1063]] I perceive [[G991]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] same [[G1565]] epistle hath made [[G1992]] you [[G5209]] sorry, [[G3076]] though [[G1487]] but [[G2532]] for [[G4314]] a season. [[G5610]]

### 9
Now [[G3568]] I rejoice, [[G5463]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] ye were made sorry, [[G3076]] but [[G235]] that [[G3754]] ye sorrowed [[G3076]] to [[G1519]] repentance: [[G3341]] for [[G1063]] ye were made sorry [[G3076]] after [[G2596]] a godly manner, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] ye might receive damage [[G2210]] by [[G1537]] us [[G2257]] in [[G1722]] nothing. [[G3367]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] godly [[G2596]] sorrow [[G3077]] worketh [[G2716]] repentance [[G3341]] to [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] not to be repented of: [[G278]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] sorrow [[G3077]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world [[G2889]] worketh [[G2716]] death. [[G2288]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] behold [[G2400]] this [[G5124]] selfsame thing, [[G846]] that [[G3076]] ye [[G5209]] sorrowed [[G3076]] after [[G2596]] a [[G3588]] godly sort, [[G2316]] what [[G4214]] carefulness [[G4710]] it wrought [[G2716]] in you, [[G5213]] yea, [[G235]] clearing of yourselves, [[G627]] yea, [[G235]] indignation, [[G24]] yea, [[G235]] fear, [[G5401]] yea, [[G235]] vehement desire, [[G1972]] yea, [[G235]] zeal, [[G2205]] yea, [[G235]] revenge! [[G1557]] In [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] ye have approved [[G4921]] yourselves [[G1438]] to be [[G1511]] clear [[G53]] in [[G1722]]  this [[G3588]] matter. [[G4229]]

### 12
Wherefore, [[G1752]] though [[G686]] I wrote [[G1125]] unto you, [[G5213]] not [[G3756]] for his cause [[G1752]] that [[G3588]] had done the wrong, [[G91]] nor [[G3761]] for his cause [[G1752]] that suffered wrong, [[G91]] but [[G235]] that our [[G5216]]  you [[G2257]] care [[G4710]] for [[G5228]] in the sight [[G1799]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] might appear [[G5319]] unto [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 13
Therefore [[G1223]] we were comforted [[G3870]] in [[G1909]] your [[G5216]] comfort: [[G3874]] yea, and [[G1161]] exceedingly [[G4056]] the more [[G3123]] joyed we [[G5463]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] of Titus, [[G5103]] because [[G3754]] his [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] was refreshed [[G373]] by [[G575]] you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]]

### 14
For [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] I have boasted [[G2744]] any thing [[G5100]] to him [[G846]] of [[G5228]] you, [[G5216]] not [[G3756]] I am [[G2617]] ashamed; [[G2617]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] we spake [[G2980]] all things [[G3956]] to you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]] truth, [[G225]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] our [[G2257]] boasting, [[G2746]] which [[G3588]] before [[G1909]] Titus, [[G5103]] is found [[G1096]] a truth. [[G225]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]]  inward [[G3588]] affection [[G4698]] is [[G2076]] more abundant [[G4056]] toward [[G1519]] you, [[G5209]] whilst he remembereth [[G363]] the [[G3588]] obedience [[G5218]] of you [[G5216]] all, [[G3956]] how [[G5613]] with [[G3326]] fear [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] trembling [[G5156]] ye received [[G1209]] him. [[G846]]

### 16
I rejoice [[G5463]] therefore I have confidence [[G3754]] that [[G1722]]  in all [[G2292]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]]
