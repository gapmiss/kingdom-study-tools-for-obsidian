### 1
Now [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] Paul [[G3972]] myself [[G846]] beseech [[G3870]] you [[G5209]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] meekness [[G4236]] and [[G2532]] gentleness [[G1932]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3739]] in [[G2596]] presence [[G4383]] base [[G5011]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] but [[G1161]] being absent [[G548]] am bold [[G2292]] toward [[G1519]] you: [[G5209]]

### 2
But [[G1161]] I beseech [[G1189]] that I may be [[G2292]] not [[G3361]] bold [[G2292]] when I am present [[G3918]]  with that [[G3588]] confidence, [[G4006]] wherewith [[G3739]] I think [[G3049]] to be bold [[G5111]] against [[G1909]] some, [[G5100]] which [[G3588]] think [[G3049]] of us [[G2248]] as if [[G5613]] we walked [[G4043]] according to [[G2596]] the flesh. [[G4561]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] though we walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the flesh, [[G4561]] not [[G3756]] we do [[G4754]] war [[G4754]] after [[G2596]] the flesh: [[G4561]]

### 4
(For [[G1063]] the through [[G3588]] weapons [[G3696]] of our [[G2257]] warfare [[G4752]] not [[G3756]] carnal, [[G4559]] but [[G235]] mighty [[G1415]] God [[G2316]] to [[G4314]] the pulling down [[G2506]] of strong holds;) [[G3794]]

### 5
Casting down [[G2507]] imaginations, [[G3053]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] high thing [[G5313]] that exalteth itself [[G1869]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1108]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] bringing into captivity [[G163]] every [[G3956]] thought [[G3540]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] obedience [[G5218]] of [[G5547]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] having [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] a readiness [[G2092]] to revenge [[G1556]] all [[G3956]] disobedience, [[G3876]] when [[G3752]] your [[G5216]] obedience is [[G5218]] fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 7
Do ye look [[G991]] things [[G3588]] on [[G2596]] after [[G2596]] the outward appearance? [[G4383]] If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] trust [[G3982]] to himself [[G1438]] that he is [[G1511]] Christ's, [[G5547]] let him [[G3049]] of [[G575]] himself [[G1438]] think [[G3049]] this [[G5124]] again, [[G3825]] that, [[G3754]] as [[G2531]] he [[G846]] Christ's, [[G5547]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] we [[G2249]] Christ's. [[G5547]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] though [[G1437]] I should boast [[G2744]] somewhat [[G5100]] more [[G4053]] of [[G4012]] our [[G2257]] authority, [[G1849]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath given [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] for [[G1519]] edification, [[G3619]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] for [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] destruction, [[G2506]] not [[G3756]] I should be [[G153]] ashamed: [[G153]]

### 9
That [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] I may [[G1380]] seem [[G1380]] as [[G5613]]  if [[G302]] I would terrify [[G1629]] you [[G5209]] by [[G1223]] letters. [[G1992]]

### 10
For [[G3754]] letters, [[G1992]] say they, [[G5346]] weighty [[G926]] and [[G2532]] powerful; [[G2478]] but [[G1161]] bodily [[G4983]] presence [[G3952]] weak, [[G772]] and [[G2532]] speech [[G3056]] contemptible. [[G1848]]

### 11
Let [[G3049]] such an one [[G5108]] think [[G3049]] this, [[G5124]] that, [[G3754]] such as [[G3634]] we are [[G2070]]  in [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] by [[G1223]] letters [[G1992]] when we are absent, [[G548]] such [[G5108]] also [[G2532]]  in [[G3588]] deed when we are [[G2041]] present. [[G3918]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] we dare [[G5111]] not [[G3756]] make ourselves of the number, [[G1469]] or [[G2228]] compare [[G4793]] ourselves [[G1438]] with some [[G5100]] that commend [[G4921]] themselves: [[G1438]] but [[G235]] they [[G846]] measuring [[G3354]] themselves [[G1438]] by [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] comparing [[G4793]] themselves [[G1438]] among themselves, [[G1438]] not [[G3756]] are [[G4920]] wise. [[G4920]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] not [[G3780]] will [[G2744]] boast [[G2744]] of [[G1519]] things [[G3588]] without measure, [[G280]] but [[G235]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] measure [[G3358]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2583]] rule [[G2583]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] hath distributed [[G3307]] to us, [[G2254]] a measure [[G3358]] to reach [[G2185]] even [[G2532]] unto [[G891]] you. [[G5216]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] we stretch [[G5239]] ourselves [[G1438]] beyond [[G5239]] as though [[G5613]] we reached [[G2185]] not [[G3361]] unto [[G1519]] you: [[G5209]] for [[G1063]] we are come [[G5348]] as far as [[G891]] to you [[G5216]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 15
Not [[G3756]] boasting [[G2744]] of [[G1519]] things [[G3588]] without measure, [[G280]] of [[G1722]] other men's [[G245]] labours; [[G2873]] but [[G1161]] having [[G2192]] hope, [[G1680]] when is [[G837]] your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] increased, [[G837]] that we shall be enlarged [[G3170]] by [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] according [[G2596]] to [[G1519]] our [[G2257]] rule [[G2583]] abundantly, [[G4050]]

### 16
To preach the gospel [[G2097]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] beyond [[G5238]] you, [[G5216]] not [[G3756]] to boast [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] another man's [[G245]] line of things [[G2583]] made ready our hand. [[G2092]] to [[G1519]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that glorieth, [[G2744]] let him glory [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] he that [[G1565]] commendeth [[G4921]] himself [[G1438]] is [[G2076]] approved, [[G1384]] but [[G235]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] commendeth. [[G4921]]
