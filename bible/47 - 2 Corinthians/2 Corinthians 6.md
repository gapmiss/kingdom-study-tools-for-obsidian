then, [[G1161]] We [[G3870]] workers together [[G4903]] beseech [[G3870]] also [[G2532]] that ye [[G5209]] receive [[G1209]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1519]] vain. [[G2756]]

Giving [[G1325]] no [[G3367]] offence [[G4349]] in [[G1722]] any thing, [[G3367]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] be [[G3469]] ministry [[G1248]] not [[G3361]] blamed: [[G3469]]

### 4
But [[G235]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] approving [[G4921]] ourselves [[G1438]] as [[G5613]] the ministers [[G1249]] of God, [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] much [[G4183]] patience, [[G5281]] in [[G1722]] afflictions, [[G2347]] in [[G1722]] necessities, [[G318]] in [[G1722]] distresses, [[G4730]]

In [[G1722]] stripes, [[G4127]] in [[G1722]] imprisonments, [[G5438]] in [[G1722]] tumults, [[G181]] in [[G1722]] labours, [[G2873]] in [[G1722]] watchings, [[G70]] in [[G1722]] fastings; [[G3521]]

### 6
By [[G1722]] pureness, [[G54]] by [[G1722]] knowledge, [[G1108]] by [[G1722]] longsuffering, [[G3115]] by [[G1722]] kindness, [[G5544]] by [[G1722]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] by [[G1722]] love [[G26]] unfeigned, [[G505]]

### 7
By [[G1722]] the word [[G3056]] of truth, [[G225]] by [[G1722]] the power [[G1411]] of God, [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] armour [[G3696]] of on right [[G1343]] righteousness [[G1343]] the [[G3588]] hand [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] on the left, [[G710]]

### 8
By [[G1223]] honour [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] dishonour, [[G819]] by [[G1223]] evil report [[G1426]] and [[G2532]] good report: [[G2162]] as [[G5613]] deceivers, [[G4108]] and [[G2532]] true; [[G227]]

### 9
As [[G5613]] unknown, [[G50]] and [[G2532]] well known; [[G1921]] as [[G5613]] dying, [[G599]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] we live; [[G2198]] as [[G5613]] chastened, [[G3811]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] killed; [[G2289]]

### 10
As [[G5613]] sorrowful, [[G3076]] yet [[G1161]] alway [[G104]] rejoicing; [[G5463]] as [[G5613]] poor, [[G4434]] yet [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] making [[G4148]] rich; [[G4148]] as [[G5613]] having [[G2192]] nothing, [[G3367]] and [[G2532]] possessing [[G2722]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 11
O Corinthians, [[G2881]] our [[G2257]] mouth is [[G4750]] open [[G455]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] our [[G2257]] heart is [[G2588]] enlarged. [[G4115]]

### 12
not [[G3756]] Ye are [[G4729]] straitened [[G4729]] in [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] but [[G1161]] ye are straitened [[G4729]] in [[G1722]] your own [[G5216]] bowels. [[G4698]]

### 13
Now [[G1161]] for a recompence [[G489]] the [[G3588]] in [[G846]] same, [[G846]] (I speak [[G3004]] as unto [[G5613]] children,) [[G5043]] be [[G4115]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] enlarged. [[G4115]]

### 14
Be ye [[G1096]] not [[G3361]] unequally yoked together [[G2086]] with unbelievers: [[G571]] for [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] fellowship [[G3352]] hath righteousness [[G1343]] with [[G2532]] unrighteousness? [[G458]] and [[G1161]] what [[G5101]] communion [[G2842]] hath light [[G5457]] with [[G4314]] darkness? [[G4655]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] what [[G5101]] concord [[G4857]] hath Christ [[G5547]] with [[G4314]] Belial? [[G955]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] part [[G3310]] hath he that believeth [[G4103]] with [[G3326]] an infidel? [[G571]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] what [[G5101]] agreement [[G4783]] hath the temple [[G3485]] of God [[G2316]] with [[G3326]] idols? [[G1497]] for [[G1063]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] the temple [[G3485]] of the living [[G2198]] God; [[G2316]] as [[G2531]] God hath [[G2316]] said, [[G2036]] I will dwell [[G1774]] in [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] walk in [[G1704]] and [[G2532]] I will be [[G2071]] their [[G846]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] shall be [[G2071]] my [[G3427]] people. [[G2992]]

### 17
Wherefore [[G1352]] come out [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] among [[G3319]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] be ye separate, [[G873]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] touch [[G680]] not [[G3361]] the unclean [[G169]] and I [[G2504]] will receive [[G1523]] you, [[G5209]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] will be [[G2071]] a Father [[G3962]] unto [[G1519]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] shall be [[G2071]] my [[G3427]] sons [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] daughters, [[G2364]] saith [[G3004]] the Lord [[G2962]] Almighty. [[G3841]]
