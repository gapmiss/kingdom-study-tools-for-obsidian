### 1
But [[G1161]] I determined [[G2919]] this [[G5124]] with myself, [[G1683]] that I would [[G2064]] not [[G3361]] come [[G2064]] again [[G3825]] to [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] heaviness. [[G3077]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] make [[G3076]] you [[G5209]] sorry, [[G3076]] who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] he [[G3588]] then [[G2532]] that maketh glad, [[G2165]] me [[G3165]] but [[G1487]] the same which [[G3588]] is made sorry [[G3076]] by [[G1537]] me? [[G1700]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] I wrote [[G1125]] this [[G5124]] same [[G846]] unto you, [[G5213]] lest, [[G2443]] when I came, [[G2064]] I should have [[G2192]] sorrow [[G3077]] from [[G575]] them of whom [[G3739]] I [[G3165]] ought [[G1163]] to rejoice; [[G5463]] having confidence [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] you [[G5209]] all, [[G3956]] that [[G3754]] my [[G1699]] joy [[G5479]] is [[G2076]] of you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] out of [[G1537]] much [[G4183]] affliction [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] anguish [[G4928]] of heart [[G2588]] I wrote [[G1125]] unto you [[G5213]] with [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] tears; [[G1144]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] ye should be grieved, [[G3076]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] ye might know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] which [[G3739]] I have [[G2192]] more abundantly [[G4056]] unto [[G1519]] you. [[G5209]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] have caused grief, [[G3076]] not [[G3756]] he hath [[G3076]] grieved [[G3076]] me, [[G1691]] but [[G235]] in [[G575]] part: [[G3313]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] I may [[G1912]] overcharge [[G1912]] you [[G5209]] all. [[G3956]]

### 6
Sufficient [[G2425]] to such a man [[G5108]] this [[G3778]] punishment, [[G2009]] which [[G3588]] of [[G5259]] many. [[G4119]]

### 7
So that [[G5620]] contrariwise [[G5121]] ye [[G5209]] rather [[G3123]] to forgive [[G5483]] and [[G2532]] comfort [[G3870]] lest perhaps [[G3381]] a [[G3588]] such [[G5108]] one [[G5108]] should be swallowed up [[G2666]] with [[G4053]] overmuch [[G4053]] sorrow. [[G3077]]

### 8
Wherefore [[G1352]] I beseech [[G3870]] you [[G5209]] that ye would confirm [[G2964]] love [[G26]] toward [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] to [[G1519]] this end [[G5124]] also [[G2532]] did I write, [[G1125]] that [[G2443]] I might know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] proof [[G1382]] of you, [[G5216]] whether [[G1487]] ye be [[G2075]] obedient [[G5255]] in [[G1519]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 10
To [[G1161]] whom [[G3739]] ye forgive [[G5483]] any thing, [[G5100]] I [[G1473]] also: [[G2532]] for [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] forgave [[G5483]] any thing, [[G1536]] to whom [[G3739]] I forgave [[G5483]] for [[G1223]] your sakes [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] the person [[G4383]] of Christ; [[G5547]]

### 11
Lest [[G2443]] Satan [[G4567]] should get an advantage us: [[G4122]] of [[G5259]] for [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] we are [[G50]] ignorant [[G50]] of his [[G846]] devices. [[G3540]]

### 12
Furthermore, [[G1161]] when I came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Troas [[G5174]] to [[G1519]] Christ's [[G5547]] gospel, [[G2098]] and [[G2532]] a door [[G2374]] was opened [[G455]] unto me [[G3427]] of [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]]

### 13
I had [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] rest [[G425]] in [[G4151]] my [[G3450]] spirit, [[G4151]] because I [[G3165]] found [[G2147]] not [[G3361]] Titus [[G5103]] my [[G3450]] brother: [[G80]] but [[G235]] taking my leave [[G657]] of them, [[G846]] I went from thence [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] Macedonia. [[G3109]]

### 14
Now [[G1161]] thanks [[G5485]] unto [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] always [[G3842]] causeth to triumph [[G2358]] us [[G2248]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] maketh manifest [[G5319]] the [[G3588]] savour [[G3744]] of his [[G846]] knowledge [[G1108]] by [[G1223]] us [[G2257]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] place. [[G5117]]

### 15
For [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]]  unto [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] a sweet savour [[G2175]] of Christ, [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] them that [[G3588]] are saved, [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] them that [[G3588]] perish: [[G622]]

### 16
To the one [[G3739]] the savour [[G3744]] of death [[G2288]] unto [[G1519]] death; [[G2288]] and [[G1161]] to the other [[G3739]] the savour [[G3744]] of life [[G2222]] unto [[G1519]] life. [[G2222]] And [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] sufficient [[G2425]] for [[G4314]] these things? [[G5023]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] we are [[G2070]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] many, [[G4183]] which corrupt [[G2585]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] of [[G1537]] sincerity, [[G1505]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] in the sight [[G2714]] of we [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] speak [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] Christ.
