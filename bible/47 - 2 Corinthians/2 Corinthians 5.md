### 1
For [[G1063]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] our [[G2257]] earthly [[G1919]] house [[G3614]] of [[G1537]] tabernacle [[G4636]] were dissolved, [[G2647]] we have [[G2192]] a building [[G3619]] of God, [[G2316]] an house [[G3614]] not made with hands, [[G886]] eternal [[G166]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavens. [[G3772]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] we groan, [[G4727]] earnestly desiring [[G1971]] to be clothed upon [[G1902]] with our [[G2257]] house [[G3613]] which is [[G3588]] from [[G1537]] heaven: [[G3772]]

### 3
If [[G1489]] so be that [[G2532]] being clothed [[G1746]] not [[G3756]] we shall be [[G2147]] found [[G2147]] naked. [[G1131]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] we that [[G3588]] are [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] tabernacle [[G4636]] do groan, [[G4727]] being burdened: [[G916]] not that [[G3756]] for [[G1894]] we would [[G2309]] be unclothed, [[G1562]] but [[G235]] clothed upon, [[G1902]] that [[G2443]] mortality [[G2349]] might be swallowed up [[G2666]] of [[G5259]] life. [[G2222]]

### 5
Now [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] hath wrought [[G2716]] us [[G2248]] for [[G1519]] the selfsame [[G846]] thing [[G5124]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] hath given [[G1325]] unto us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] earnest [[G728]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 6
Therefore [[G3767]] always [[G3842]] confident, [[G2292]] knowing [[G1492]] that, [[G3754]] whilst we are at home [[G1736]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] we are absent [[G1553]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Lord: [[G2962]]

### 7
(For [[G1063]] we walk [[G4043]] by [[G1223]] faith, [[G4102]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1223]] sight:) [[G1491]]

### 8
We are confident, [[G2292]] and [[G2532]] willing [[G2106]] rather [[G3123]] to be absent [[G1553]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] to be present [[G1736]] with [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 9
Wherefore [[G1352]] we labour, [[G5389]] that, whether [[G1535]] present [[G1736]] or [[G1535]] absent, [[G1553]] we may be [[G1511]] accepted [[G2101]] of him. [[G846]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] we [[G2248]] must [[G1163]] all [[G3956]] appear [[G5319]] before [[G1715]] the judgment [[G3588]] seat [[G968]] of [[G5547]] Christ; [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] every one [[G1538]] may receive [[G2865]] the things [[G3588]] in [[G1223]] body, [[G4983]] according [[G4314]] to that [[G3739]] he hath done, [[G4238]] whether [[G1535]] good [[G18]] or [[G1535]] bad. [[G2556]]

### 11
Knowing [[G1492]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] terror [[G5401]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] we persuade [[G3982]] men; [[G444]] but [[G1161]] we are made manifest [[G5319]] unto God; [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] I trust [[G1679]] also [[G2532]] are made manifest [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] consciences. [[G4893]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] we commend [[G4921]] not [[G3756]] ourselves [[G1438]] again [[G3825]] unto you, [[G5213]] but [[G235]] give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] occasion [[G874]] to glory [[G2745]] on our [[G2257]] behalf, [[G5228]] that [[G2443]] ye may have [[G2192]] somewhat to [[G4314]] them [[G3588]] which glory [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] appearance, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] in heart. [[G2588]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] whether [[G1535]] we be beside ourselves, [[G1839]] to God: [[G2316]] or whether [[G1535]] we be sober, [[G4993]] for your cause. [[G5213]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] constraineth [[G4912]] us; [[G2248]] because we thus [[G5124]] judge, [[G2919]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] one [[G1520]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] all, [[G3956]] then [[G686]] were [[G599]] all [[G3956]] dead: [[G599]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] all, [[G3956]] that [[G2443]] they [[G3588]] which live [[G2198]] should [[G2198]] not henceforth [[G3371]] live [[G2198]] unto themselves, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] him [[G3588]] unto which [[G599]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] rose again. [[G1453]]

### 16
Wherefore [[G5620]] henceforth [[G3568]] know [[G1492]] we [[G2249]] no man [[G3762]] after [[G2596]] the flesh: [[G4561]] yea, [[G1161]] though [[G1487]] we have known [[G1097]] Christ [[G5547]] after [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] yet [[G235]] now henceforth [[G3568]] know we [[G1097]] no more. [[G3765]]

### 17
Therefore [[G5620]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] a new [[G2537]] creature: [[G2937]] old things [[G744]] are passed away; [[G3928]] behold, [[G2400]] all things [[G3956]] are become [[G1096]] new. [[G2537]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] all things [[G3956]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] hath reconciled [[G2644]] us [[G2248]] to himself [[G1438]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] hath given [[G1325]] to us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] of [[G2643]] reconciliation; [[G2643]]

### 19
To wit, [[G5613]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] reconciling [[G2644]] the world [[G2889]] unto himself, [[G1438]] not [[G3361]] imputing [[G3049]] their [[G846]] trespasses unto [[G3900]] them; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] hath committed [[G5087]] unto [[G1722]] us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2643]] reconciliation. [[G2643]]

### 20
Now then [[G3767]] we are ambassadors [[G4243]] for [[G5228]] Christ, [[G5547]] as though [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] did beseech [[G3870]] by [[G1223]] us: [[G2257]] we pray [[G1189]] in [[G5228]] Christ's stead, [[G5547]] be ye reconciled [[G2644]] to [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] he hath made him [[G4160]] sin [[G266]] for [[G5228]] us, [[G2257]] who knew [[G1097]] no [[G3361]] sin; [[G266]] that [[G2443]] we [[G2249]] might be made [[G1096]] the righteousness [[G1343]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]
