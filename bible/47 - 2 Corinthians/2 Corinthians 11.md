### 1
Would to God [[G3785]] ye could bear [[G430]] with me [[G3450]] a little [[G3397]] in [[G877]] folly: [[G877]] and [[G235]] indeed [[G2532]] bear [[G430]] with me. [[G3450]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] I am jealous [[G2206]] over you [[G5209]] with godly [[G2316]] jealousy: [[G2205]] for [[G1063]] I have espoused [[G718]] you [[G5209]] to one [[G1520]] husband, [[G435]] that I may present [[G3936]] a chaste [[G53]] virgin [[G3933]] to [[G5547]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] I fear, [[G5399]] lest by any means, [[G3381]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] serpent [[G3789]] beguiled [[G1818]] Eve [[G2096]] through [[G1722]] his [[G846]] subtilty, [[G3834]] so [[G3779]] your [[G5216]] minds [[G3540]] should be corrupted [[G5351]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] simplicity [[G572]] that [[G3588]] is in [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] he [[G3588]] that cometh [[G2064]] preacheth [[G2784]] another [[G243]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] we have [[G2784]] preached, [[G2784]] or [[G2228]] ye receive [[G2983]] another [[G2087]] spirit, [[G4151]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G2983]] received, [[G2983]] or [[G2228]] another [[G2087]] gospel, [[G2098]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G1209]] accepted, [[G1209]] well [[G2573]] ye might with [[G430]] bear [[G430]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] I suppose [[G3049]] not [[G3367]] I was a whit behind [[G5302]] the [[G3588]] very [[G5228]] chiefest [[G3029]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] though [[G1487]] rude [[G2399]]  in [[G3588]] speech, [[G3056]] yet [[G235]] not [[G3756]]  in [[G3588]] knowledge; [[G1108]] but [[G235]] throughly [[G1722]] we have been [[G5319]]  made [[G3956]] manifest [[G5319]] among [[G1519]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 7
Have [[G2228]] I committed [[G4160]] an offence [[G266]] in abasing [[G5013]] myself [[G1683]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] might be exalted, [[G5312]] because [[G3754]] I have preached [[G2097]] to you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] freely? [[G1432]]

### 8
I robbed [[G4813]] other [[G243]] churches, [[G1577]] taking [[G2983]] wages [[G3800]] to do [[G4314]] you [[G5216]] service. [[G1248]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when I was present [[G3918]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] wanted, [[G5302]] I was chargeable to [[G2655]] no [[G3756]] man: [[G3762]] for [[G1063]] that which was lacking [[G5303]] to me [[G3450]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] which came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] Macedonia [[G3109]] supplied: [[G4322]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] I have kept [[G5083]] myself [[G1683]] from being burdensome [[G4]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] will I keep [[G5083]]

### 10
the truth [[G225]] As shall [[G3754]] of Christ [[G5547]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] no man [[G3756]] stop [[G4972]] me [[G1691]] of this [[G3778]] boasting [[G2746]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] regions [[G2824]] of [[G882]] Achaia. [[G882]]

### 11
Wherefore? [[G1302]] because [[G3754]] I love [[G25]] you [[G5209]] not? [[G3756]] God [[G2316]] knoweth. [[G1492]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] what [[G3739]] I do, [[G4160]] that I will do, [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] I may cut off [[G1581]] occasion [[G874]] from them [[G3588]] which desire [[G2309]] occasion; [[G874]] that [[G2443]] wherein [[G1722]]  they [[G3739]] glory, [[G2744]] they may be found [[G2147]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] we. [[G2249]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] such [[G5108]] false apostles, [[G5570]] deceitful [[G1386]] workers, [[G2040]] transforming themselves [[G3345]] into [[G1519]] the apostles [[G652]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] marvel; [[G2298]] for [[G1063]] Satan [[G4567]] himself [[G846]] is transformed [[G3345]] into [[G1519]] an angel [[G32]] of light. [[G5457]]

### 15
Therefore [[G3767]] no [[G3756]] great thing [[G3173]] if [[G1487]] his [[G846]] ministers [[G1249]] also [[G2532]] be transformed [[G3345]] as [[G5613]] the ministers [[G1249]] of righteousness; [[G1343]] whose [[G3739]] end [[G5056]] shall be [[G2071]] according to [[G2596]] their [[G846]] works. [[G2041]]

### 16
I say [[G3004]] again, [[G3825]] no [[G3361]] Let [[G1380]] man [[G5100]] think [[G1380]] me [[G3165]] a fool; [[G878]] if [[G1487]] otherwise, [[G1161]] yet [[G2579]] as [[G5613]] a fool [[G878]] receive [[G1209]] me, [[G3165]] that [[G2443]] I [[G2504]] may boast myself [[G2744]] a little. [[G3397]]

### 17
That which [[G3739]] I speak, [[G2980]] I speak [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] after [[G2596]] the Lord, [[G2962]] but [[G235]] as it were [[G5613]] foolishly, [[G1722]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] confidence [[G5287]] of [[G2746]] boasting. [[G2746]]

### 18
Seeing that [[G1893]] many [[G4183]] glory [[G2744]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] I [[G2504]] will glory [[G2744]] also. [[G2504]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] ye suffer [[G430]] fools [[G878]] gladly, [[G2234]] seeing ye [[G5607]] are wise. [[G5429]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] ye suffer, [[G430]] if [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] bring into bondage, [[G2615]] you [[G5209]] if [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] devour [[G2719]] if [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] take [[G2983]] if [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] exalt himself, [[G1869]] if [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] smite [[G1194]] you [[G5209]] on [[G1519]] the face. [[G4383]]

### 21
I speak [[G3004]] as concerning [[G2596]] reproach, [[G819]] as [[G5613]] though [[G3754]] we [[G2249]] had been weak. [[G770]] Howbeit [[G1161]] whereinsoever [[G1722]] any [[G5100]] is bold, [[G5111]] (I speak [[G3004]] foolishly,) [[G1722]]  I [[G877]] am bold [[G5111]] also. [[G2504]]

### 22
Are they [[G1526]] Hebrews? [[G1445]] so I. [[G2504]] Are they [[G1526]] Israelites? [[G2475]] so I. [[G2504]] Are they [[G1526]] the seed [[G4690]] of Abraham? [[G11]] so I. [[G2504]]

### 23
Are they [[G1526]] ministers [[G1249]] of Christ? [[G5547]] speak [[G2980]] (I [[G1473]] as a fool) [[G3912]] I [[G1473]] more; [[G5228]] in [[G1722]] labours [[G2873]] more abundant, [[G4056]] in [[G1722]] stripes [[G4127]] above measure, [[G5234]] in [[G1722]] prisons [[G5438]] more frequent, [[G4056]] in [[G1722]] deaths [[G2288]] oft. [[G4178]]

### 24
Of [[G5259]] the Jews [[G2453]] five times [[G3999]] received I [[G2983]] forty [[G5062]] save [[G3844]] one. [[G1520]]

### 25
Thrice [[G5151]] was I beaten with rods, [[G4463]] once [[G530]] was I stoned, [[G3034]] thrice [[G5151]] I suffered shipwreck, [[G3489]] a night and a day [[G3574]] I have been [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] deep; [[G1037]]

### 26
journeyings [[G3597]] often, [[G4178]] perils [[G2794]] of waters, [[G4215]] perils [[G2794]] of robbers, [[G3027]] perils [[G2794]] by [[G1537]] countrymen, [[G1085]] perils [[G2794]] by [[G1537]] the heathen, [[G1484]] perils [[G2794]] in [[G1722]] the city, [[G4172]] perils [[G2794]] in [[G1722]] the wilderness, [[G2047]] perils [[G2794]] in [[G1722]] the sea, [[G2281]] perils [[G2794]] among [[G1722]] false brethren; [[G5569]]

### 27
In [[G1722]] weariness [[G2873]] and [[G2532]] painfulness, [[G3449]] in [[G1722]] watchings [[G70]] often, [[G4178]] in [[G1722]] hunger [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] thirst, [[G1373]] in [[G1722]] fastings [[G3521]] often, [[G4178]] in [[G1722]] cold [[G5592]] and [[G2532]] nakedness. [[G1132]]

### 28
Beside [[G5565]] those things that are without, [[G3924]]  that which [[G3588]] cometh [[G1999]] upon [[G1999]] me [[G3450]] daily, [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] care [[G3308]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]]

### 29
Who [[G5101]] is weak, [[G770]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] I am [[G770]] weak? [[G770]] who [[G5101]] is offended, [[G4624]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] burn [[G4448]] not? [[G3756]]

### 30
If [[G1487]] I must needs [[G1163]] glory, [[G2744]] I will glory [[G2744]] of the things [[G3588]] which concern mine [[G3450]] infirmities. [[G769]]

### 31
The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] which [[G3588]] is [[G5607]] blessed [[G2128]] for [[G1519]] evermore, [[G165]] knoweth [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I lie [[G5574]] not. [[G3756]]

### 32
In [[G1722]] Damascus [[G1154]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G1481]] under Aretas [[G702]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] kept with a garrison, [[G5432]] the city [[G4172]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1153]] Damascenes [[G1153]] desirous [[G2309]] to apprehend [[G4084]] me: [[G3165]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] a window [[G2376]] in [[G1722]] a basket [[G4553]] was I let down [[G5465]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] wall, [[G5038]] and [[G2532]] escaped [[G1628]] his [[G846]] hands. [[G5495]]
