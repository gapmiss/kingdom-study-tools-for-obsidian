[[2 Corinthians 12|←]] • [[Galatians 1|→]]

### 1
This [[G5124]] the third [[G5154]] I am coming [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]] In [[G1909]] the mouth [[G4750]] of two [[G1417]] or [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] witnesses [[G3144]] shall be [[G2476]] every [[G3956]] word [[G4487]] established. [[G2476]]

### 2
I told you before, [[G4280]] and [[G2532]] foretell you, [[G4302]] as if [[G5613]] I were present, [[G3918]] the [[G3588]] second time; [[G1208]] and [[G2532]] being absent [[G548]] now [[G3568]] I write [[G1125]] them [[G3588]] to which heretofore have [[G4258]] sinned, [[G4258]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] other, [[G3062]] that, [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] I come [[G2064]] again, [[G3825]] not [[G3756]] I will [[G5339]] spare: [[G5339]]

### 3
Since [[G1893]] ye seek [[G2212]] a proof [[G1382]] of Christ [[G5547]] speaking [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] which [[G3739]] to [[G1519]] you-ward [[G5209]] not [[G3756]] is [[G770]] weak, [[G770]] but [[G235]] is mighty [[G1414]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G5213]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] though [[G1487]] he was crucified [[G4717]] through [[G1537]] weakness, [[G769]] yet [[G235]] he liveth [[G2198]] by [[G1537]] the power [[G1411]] of God. [[G2316]] For [[G1063]] we [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] are weak [[G770]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] but [[G235]] we shall live [[G2198]] with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] by [[G1537]] the power [[G1411]] God [[G2316]] of [[G1519]] toward [[G1519]] you. [[G5209]]

### 5
Examine [[G3985]] yourselves, [[G1438]] whether [[G1487]] ye be [[G2075]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] faith; [[G4102]] prove [[G1381]] your own selves. [[G1438]] Know ye [[G1921]] not [[G3756]] your own selves, [[G1438]] how that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] except [[G1487]] ye be [[G2075]] reprobates? [[G96]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] I trust [[G1679]] that [[G3754]] ye shall know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we [[G2249]] are [[G2070]] not [[G3756]] reprobates. [[G96]]

### 7
Now [[G1161]] I pray [[G2172]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] that [[G4160]] ye [[G5209]] do [[G4160]] no [[G3367]] evil; [[G2556]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] we [[G2249]] should appear [[G5316]] approved, [[G1384]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] ye [[G5210]] should do [[G4160]] that which [[G3588]] is honest, [[G2570]] though [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] be [[G5600]] as [[G5613]] reprobates. [[G96]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] we can do [[G1410]] nothing [[G3756]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] but [[G235]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] we are glad, [[G5463]] when [[G3752]] we [[G2249]] are weak, [[G770]] and [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G5600]] strong: [[G1415]] and [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] also [[G2532]] we wish, [[G2172]] your [[G5216]] perfection. [[G2676]]

### 10
Therefore [[G1223]] I write [[G1125]] these things [[G5023]] being absent, [[G548]] lest [[G2443]] being present [[G3918]] I should use [[G5530]] sharpness, [[G664]] according [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1849]] power [[G1849]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath given [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] to [[G1519]] edification, [[G3619]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] to [[G1519]] destruction. [[G2506]]

### 11
Finally, [[G3063]] brethren, [[G80]] farewell. [[G5463]] Be perfect, [[G2675]] be of good comfort, [[G3870]] be [[G5426]] of one [[G846]] mind, [[G5426]] live in peace; [[G1514]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G26]] love [[G26]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] shall be [[G2071]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G5216]]

### 12
Greet [[G782]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1722]] an holy [[G40]] kiss. [[G5370]]

### 13
All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] salute [[G782]] you. [[G5209]]

### 14
The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] communion [[G2842]] the [[G3588]] of [[G40]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 255
The second [[G1208]] to [[G4314]] the Corinthians [[G2881]] was written [[G1125]] from [[G575]] Philippi, [[G5375]] of [[G3109]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] by [[G1223]] Titus [[G5103]] and [[G2532]] Lucas. [[G3065]]
