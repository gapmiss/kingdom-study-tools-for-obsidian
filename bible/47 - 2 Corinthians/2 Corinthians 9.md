### 1
For [[G1063]] as touching [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] ministering [[G1248]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] it is [[G2076]] superfluous [[G4053]] for me [[G3427]] to write [[G1125]] to you: [[G5213]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] I know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] forwardness [[G4288]] of your mind, [[G5216]] for which [[G3739]] I boast [[G2744]] of [[G5228]] you [[G5216]] to them of Macedonia, [[G3110]] that [[G3754]] Achaia [[G882]] was ready [[G3903]] a year ago; [[G4070]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] zeal [[G2205]] hath provoked [[G2042]] very many. [[G4119]]

### 3
Yet [[G1161]] have I sent [[G3992]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] lest [[G2443]] our [[G2257]] boasting [[G2745]] of [[G5228]] you [[G5216]] should be in vain [[G2758]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] behalf; [[G3313]] that, [[G2443]] as [[G2531]] I said, [[G3004]] ye may [[G3903]] be [[G5600]] ready: [[G3903]]

### 4
Lest haply [[G3381]] if [[G1437]] they of Macedonia [[G3110]] come [[G2064]] with [[G4862]] me, [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] you [[G5209]] unprepared, [[G532]] we [[G2249]] (that [[G2443]] we say [[G3004]] not, [[G3361]] ye) [[G5210]] should be ashamed [[G2617]] in [[G1722]] this same [[G3778]] confident [[G5287]] boasting. [[G2746]]

### 5
Therefore [[G3767]] I thought it [[G2233]] necessary [[G316]] to exhort [[G3870]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G2443]] they would go before [[G4281]] unto [[G1519]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] make up beforehand [[G4294]] your [[G5216]] bounty, [[G2129]] whereof ye had notice before, [[G4293]] that the same [[G3778]] might be [[G1511]] ready, [[G2092]] as [[G5613]] bounty, [[G2129]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] as [[G5618]] covetousness. [[G4124]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] He [[G3588]] which soweth [[G4687]] sparingly [[G5340]] shall reap [[G2325]] also [[G2532]] sparingly; [[G5340]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] which soweth [[G4687]] bountifully [[G2129]] shall reap [[G2325]] also [[G2532]] bountifully. [[G2129]]

### 7
Every man [[G1538]] according as [[G2531]] he purposeth [[G4255]]  in his [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] not [[G3361]] grudgingly, [[G1537]] or [[G2228]] of [[G1537]] necessity: [[G318]] for [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] loveth [[G25]] a cheerful [[G2431]] giver. [[G1395]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] able [[G1415]] all [[G3956]] to make [[G4052]] grace [[G5485]] abound [[G4052]] toward [[G1519]] you; [[G5209]] that [[G2443]] ye, always [[G3842]] having [[G2192]] all [[G3956]] sufficiency [[G841]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] may abound [[G4052]] to [[G1519]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work: [[G2041]]

### 9
(As [[G2531]] it is written, [[G1125]] He hath dispersed abroad; [[G4650]] he hath given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3993]] poor: [[G3993]] his [[G846]] righteousness [[G1343]] remaineth [[G3306]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 10
Now [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] ministereth [[G2023]] seed [[G4690]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4687]] sower [[G4687]] both [[G2532]] minister [[G5524]] bread [[G740]] for [[G1519]] food, [[G1035]] and [[G2532]] multiply [[G4129]] seed [[G4703]] your [[G5216]] sown, [[G4703]] and [[G2532]] increase [[G837]] the [[G3588]] fruits [[G1081]] of your [[G5216]] righteousness;) [[G1343]]

### 11
Being enriched [[G4148]] in [[G1722]] every thing [[G3956]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] bountifulness, [[G572]] which [[G3748]] causeth [[G2716]] through [[G1223]] us [[G2257]] thanksgiving [[G2169]] to [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] administration [[G1248]] of this [[G3778]] service [[G3009]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] supplieth [[G4322]] the [[G3588]] want of [[G5303]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] but [[G235]] is [[G2076]] abundant [[G4052]] also [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] thanksgivings [[G2169]] unto [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]]

### 13
Whiles [[G1223]] by the [[G3588]] experiment [[G1382]] of this [[G3778]] ministration [[G1248]] they glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1909]] your [[G5216]] professed [[G3671]] subjection [[G5292]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] and for [[G2532]] liberal [[G572]] distribution [[G2842]] unto [[G1519]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] all [[G3956]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] by their [[G846]] prayer [[G1162]] for [[G5228]] you, [[G5216]] which long after [[G1971]] you [[G5209]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] exceeding [[G5235]] grace [[G5485]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1909]] you. [[G5213]]

### 15
Thanks [[G5485]] unto [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1909]] his [[G846]] unspeakable [[G411]] gift. [[G1431]]
