Paul, [[G3972]] an apostle [[G652]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] by [[G1223]] the will [[G2307]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Timothy [[G5095]] brother, [[G80]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1577]] church [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] is [[G5607]] at [[G1722]] Corinth, [[G2882]] with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] which [[G3588]] are [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] Achaia: [[G882]]

### 2
Grace [[G5485]] to you [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 3
Blessed [[G2128]] God, [[G2316]] even [[G2532]] the Father [[G3962]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] of [[G3628]] mercies, [[G3628]] and [[G2532]] the God [[G2316]] of all [[G3956]] comfort; [[G3874]]

### 4
Who [[G3588]] comforteth [[G3870]] us [[G2248]] in [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] our [[G2257]] tribulation, [[G2347]] that may be [[G1410]] we [[G2248]] able [[G1410]] to [[G1519]] comfort [[G3870]] them [[G3588]] which are [[G3739]] in [[G1722]] any [[G3956]] trouble, [[G2347]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] comfort [[G3874]] wherewith we ourselves [[G846]] are comforted [[G3870]] of [[G5259]] God. [[G2316]]

### 5
For [[G3754]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] sufferings [[G3804]] of [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] abound [[G4052]] in [[G1519]] us, [[G2248]] so [[G3779]] our [[G2257]] consolation [[G3874]] also [[G2532]] aboundeth [[G4052]] by [[G1223]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] whether [[G1535]] we be afflicted, [[G2346]] for [[G5228]] your [[G5216]] consolation [[G3874]] and [[G2532]] salvation, [[G4991]] which [[G3588]] is effectual [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] the enduring [[G5281]] the [[G3588]] of [[G846]] same [[G846]] sufferings [[G3804]] which [[G3739]] we [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] suffer: [[G3958]] or whether [[G1535]] we be comforted, [[G3870]] for [[G5228]] your [[G5216]] consolation [[G3874]] and [[G2532]] salvation. [[G4991]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] hope [[G1680]] of [[G5228]] you [[G5216]] stedfast, [[G949]] knowing, [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] as [[G5618]] ye are [[G2075]] partakers [[G2844]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3804]] sufferings, [[G3804]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3874]] consolation. [[G3874]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] we would [[G2309]] not, [[G3756]] brethren, [[G80]] you [[G5209]] have [[G50]] ignorant [[G50]] of [[G5228]] our [[G2257]] trouble [[G2347]] which [[G3588]] came [[G1096]] to us [[G2254]] in [[G1722]] Asia, [[G773]] that [[G3754]] we were pressed [[G916]] out [[G2596]] of measure, [[G5236]] above [[G5228]] strength, [[G1411]] insomuch that [[G5620]] we [[G2248]] despaired [[G1820]] even [[G2532]] of [[G2198]] life: [[G2198]]

### 9
But [[G235]] we [[G846]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] sentence [[G610]] of [[G2288]] death [[G2288]] in [[G1722]] ourselves, [[G1438]] that [[G2443]] we should [[G5600]] not [[G3361]] trust [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] ourselves, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] in [[G1909]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] raiseth [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] dead: [[G3498]]

### 10
Who [[G3739]] delivered [[G4506]] us [[G2248]] from [[G1537]] so great [[G5082]] a death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] doth deliver: [[G4506]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] we trust [[G1679]] that [[G3754]] he will [[G4506]] yet [[G2089]] deliver [[G4506]]

### 11
Ye [[G5216]] also [[G2532]] helping together [[G4943]]  by [[G3588]] prayer [[G1162]] for [[G5228]] us, [[G2257]] that [[G2443]] for the gift [[G5486]] upon [[G1519]] us [[G2248]] by the means of [[G1537]] many [[G4183]] persons [[G4383]] thanks may be given [[G2168]] by [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] on [[G5228]] our behalf. [[G2257]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] our [[G2257]] rejoicing [[G2746]] is [[G2076]] this, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3142]] of our [[G2257]] conscience, [[G4893]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] simplicity [[G572]] and [[G2532]] godly [[G2316]] sincerity, [[G1505]] not [[G3756]] with [[G1722]] fleshly [[G4559]] wisdom, [[G4678]] but [[G235]] by [[G1722]] the grace [[G5485]] of God, [[G2316]] we have had our conversation [[G390]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G1161]] more abundantly [[G4056]] to [[G4314]] you-ward. [[G5209]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] we write [[G1125]] none [[G3756]] other things [[G243]] unto you, [[G5213]] than [[G235]] what [[G3739]] ye read [[G314]] or [[G2228]] acknowledge; [[G1921]] and [[G1161]] I trust [[G1679]] ye shall acknowledge [[G1921]] even [[G2532]] to [[G2193]] the end; [[G5056]]

### 14
As [[G2531]] also [[G2532]] ye have acknowledged [[G1921]] us [[G2248]] in [[G575]] part, [[G3313]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] your [[G5216]] rejoicing, [[G2745]] even as [[G2509]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] ours [[G2257]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] in this [[G3778]] confidence [[G4006]] I was minded [[G1014]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] before, [[G4386]] that [[G2443]] ye might have [[G2192]] a second [[G1208]] benefit; [[G5485]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] to pass [[G1330]] by [[G1223]] you [[G5216]] into [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] and [[G2532]] to come [[G2064]] again [[G3825]] out of [[G575]] Macedonia [[G3109]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] of [[G5259]] you [[G5216]] to be brought on my way [[G4311]] toward [[G1519]] Judaea. [[G2449]]

### 17
When I therefore [[G3767]] thus [[G5124]] was [[G1011]] minded, [[G1011]] did I [[G5530]] use [[G5530]] lightness? [[G1644]] or [[G2228]] the things [[G3739]] that I purpose, [[G1011]] do I purpose [[G1011]] according to [[G2596]] the flesh, [[G4561]] that [[G2443]] with [[G3844]] me [[G1698]] there should be [[G5600]] yea [[G3483]] yea, [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] nay [[G3756]] nay? [[G3756]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] true, [[G4103]] our [[G2257]] word [[G3056]] toward [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] yea [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] nay. [[G3756]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3588]] was preached [[G2784]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1223]] us, [[G2257]] by [[G1223]] me [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] Silvanus [[G4610]] and [[G2532]] Timotheus, [[G5095]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] yea [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] nay, [[G3756]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] was [[G1096]] yea. [[G3483]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] all [[G3745]] the promises [[G1860]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] yea, [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] him [[G846]] Amen, [[G281]] unto [[G4314]] the glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] us. [[G2257]]

### 21
Now [[G1161]] he which [[G3588]] stablisheth [[G950]] us [[G2248]] with [[G4862]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1519]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] hath anointed [[G5548]] us, [[G2248]] God; [[G2316]]

### 22
Who [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] hath [[G4972]] sealed [[G4972]] us, [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] earnest [[G728]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 23
Moreover [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] call [[G1941]] God for a [[G2316]] record [[G3144]] upon [[G1909]] my [[G1699]] soul, [[G5590]] that [[G3754]] to spare [[G5339]] you [[G5216]] I came [[G2064]] not as yet [[G3765]] unto [[G1519]] Corinth. [[G2882]]

### 24
Not [[G3756]] for that [[G3754]] we have dominion [[G2961]] over [[G5216]] your [[G5216]] faith, [[G4102]] but [[G235]] are [[G2070]] helpers [[G4904]] of your [[G5216]] joy: [[G5479]] for [[G1063]] by faith [[G4102]] ye stand. [[G2476]]
