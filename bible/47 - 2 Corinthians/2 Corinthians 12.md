### 1
not [[G3756]] It is [[G4851]] expedient [[G4851]] for [[G1063]] me [[G3427]] doubtless [[G1211]] to glory. [[G2744]] I will come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] visions [[G3701]] and [[G2532]] revelations [[G602]] of the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 2
I knew [[G1492]] a man [[G444]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] above [[G4253]] fourteen [[G1180]] years ago, [[G2094]] (whether [[G1535]] in [[G1722]] the body, [[G4983]] cannot [[G3756]] I [[G1492]] tell; [[G1492]] or whether [[G1535]] out of [[G1622]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] cannot [[G3756]] I [[G1492]] tell: [[G1492]] God [[G2316]] knoweth;) [[G1492]] such an one [[G5108]] caught up [[G726]] to [[G2193]] the third [[G5154]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] I knew [[G1492]] such [[G5108]] a [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] (whether [[G1535]] in [[G1722]] the body, [[G4983]] or [[G1535]] out of [[G1622]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] cannot [[G3756]] I [[G1492]] tell: [[G1492]] God [[G2316]] knoweth;) [[G1492]]

### 4
How that [[G3754]] he was caught up [[G726]] into [[G1519]] paradise, [[G3857]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] unspeakable [[G731]] words, [[G4487]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] it is [[G1832]] lawful [[G1832]] for a man [[G444]] to utter. [[G2980]]

### 5
Of [[G5228]] such an one [[G5108]] will I glory: [[G2744]] yet [[G1161]] of [[G5228]] myself [[G1683]] not [[G3756]] I will [[G2744]] glory, [[G2744]] but [[G1487]] in [[G1722]] mine [[G3450]] infirmities. [[G769]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] though [[G1437]] I would desire [[G2309]] to glory, [[G2744]] not [[G3756]] I shall [[G2071]] be [[G2071]] a fool; [[G878]] for [[G1063]] I will say [[G2046]] the truth: [[G225]] but [[G1161]] I forbear, [[G5339]] lest [[G3361]] any man [[G5100]] should think [[G3049]] of [[G1519]] me [[G1691]] above [[G5228]] that which [[G3739]] he seeth [[G991]] me [[G3165]] or [[G2228]] he heareth [[G191]] of [[G1537]] me. [[G1700]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] lest [[G2443]] I should be exalted above measure [[G5229]] through the [[G3588]] abundance [[G5236]] the [[G3588]] of [[G602]] revelations, [[G602]] there was given [[G1325]] to me [[G3427]] a thorn [[G4647]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4561]] flesh, [[G4561]] the messenger [[G32]] of Satan [[G4566]] to [[G2443]] buffet [[G2852]] me, [[G3165]] lest [[G2443]] I should be exalted above measure. [[G5229]]

### 8
For [[G5228]] this thing [[G5127]] I besought [[G3870]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] thrice, [[G5151]] that [[G2443]] it might depart [[G868]] from [[G575]] me. [[G1700]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2046]] unto me, [[G3427]] My [[G3450]] grace is [[G5485]] sufficient [[G714]] for thee: [[G4671]] for [[G1063]] my [[G3450]] strength [[G1411]] is made perfect [[G5048]] in [[G1722]] weakness. [[G769]] Most gladly [[G2236]] therefore [[G3767]] rather [[G3123]] will I [[G2744]] glory [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] infirmities, [[G769]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of may [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] rest [[G1981]] upon [[G1909]] me. [[G1691]]

### 10
Therefore [[G1352]] I take pleasure [[G2106]] in [[G1722]] infirmities, [[G769]] in [[G1722]] reproaches, [[G5196]] in [[G1722]] necessities, [[G318]] in [[G1722]] persecutions, [[G1375]] in [[G1722]] distresses [[G4730]] for [[G5228]] Christ's sake: [[G5547]] for [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] I am weak, [[G770]] then [[G5119]] am I [[G1510]] strong. [[G1415]]

### 11
I am become [[G1096]] a fool [[G878]] in glorying; [[G2744]] ye [[G5210]] have compelled [[G315]] me: [[G3165]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] ought [[G3784]] to have been commended [[G4921]] of [[G5259]] you: [[G5216]] for [[G1063]] in nothing [[G3762]] am I behind [[G5302]] the [[G3588]] very [[G5228]] chiefest [[G3029]] apostles, [[G652]] though [[G1487]] I be [[G1510]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 12
Truly [[G3303]] the [[G3588]] signs [[G4592]] of an [[G652]] apostle [[G652]] were wrought [[G2716]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] patience, [[G5281]] in [[G1722]] signs, [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders, [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] mighty deeds. [[G1411]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] it wherein [[G3739]] ye were inferior [[G2274]] to [[G5228]] other [[G3062]] churches, [[G1577]] except [[G1487]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] myself [[G846]] not [[G3756]] was [[G2655]] burdensome [[G2655]] to you? [[G5216]] forgive [[G5483]] me [[G3427]] this [[G3778]] wrong. [[G93]]

### 14
Behold, [[G2400]] the third time [[G5154]] I am [[G2192]] ready [[G2093]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you; [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] I will be [[G2655]] burdensome [[G2655]] to you: [[G5216]] for [[G1063]] I seek [[G2212]] not [[G3756]] yours, [[G5216]] but [[G235]] you: [[G5209]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] ought [[G3784]] not [[G3756]] to lay up [[G2343]] the [[G3588]] for parents, [[G1118]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] parents [[G1118]] the [[G3588]] for [[G5043]] children. [[G5043]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] will very gladly [[G2236]] spend [[G1159]] and [[G2532]] be spent [[G1550]] for [[G5228]] you; [[G5216]] though [[G1487]] the more abundantly [[G4056]] I love [[G25]] you, [[G5209]] the less [[G2276]] I be loved. [[G25]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] be it so, [[G2077]] I [[G1473]] not [[G3756]] did [[G2599]] burden [[G2599]] you: [[G5209]] nevertheless, [[G235]] being [[G5225]] crafty, [[G3835]] I caught [[G2983]] you [[G5209]] with guile. [[G1388]]

### 17
Did I make a gain [[G4122]] of [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] by [[G1223]] any [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] whom [[G3739]] I sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] you? [[G5209]]

### 18
I desired [[G3870]] Titus, [[G5103]] and [[G2532]] with I sent [[G4882]]  a [[G3588]] brother. [[G80]] Did make a [[G4122]] Titus [[G5103]] gain [[G4122]] of you? [[G5209]] walked we [[G4043]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] in [[G846]] same [[G846]] spirit? [[G4151]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] in [[G846]] same [[G846]] steps? [[G2487]]

### 19
Again, [[G3825]] think ye [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] we excuse ourselves [[G626]] unto you? [[G5213]] we speak [[G2980]] before [[G2714]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Christ: [[G5547]] but [[G1161]] all things, [[G3956]] dearly beloved, [[G27]] for [[G5228]] your [[G5216]] edifying. [[G3619]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] I fear, [[G5399]] lest, [[G3381]] when I come, [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] I shall [[G2147]] find [[G2147]] you [[G5209]] such as [[G3634]] I would, [[G2309]] and I [[G2504]] shall be found [[G2147]] unto you [[G5213]] such as [[G3634]] ye would [[G2309]] not: [[G3756]] lest [[G3381]] debates, [[G2054]] envyings, [[G2205]] wraths, [[G2372]] strifes, [[G2052]] backbitings, [[G2636]] whisperings, [[G5587]] swellings, [[G5450]] tumults: [[G181]]

### 21
lest, [[G3361]] when I come [[G2064]] again, [[G3825]] my [[G3450]] God will [[G2316]] humble [[G5013]] me [[G3165]] among [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] I shall bewail [[G3996]] many [[G4183]] which [[G3588]] have sinned already, [[G4258]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] have [[G3340]] repented [[G3340]] of [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] uncleanness [[G167]] and [[G2532]] fornication [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] lasciviousness [[G766]] which [[G3739]] they have committed.
