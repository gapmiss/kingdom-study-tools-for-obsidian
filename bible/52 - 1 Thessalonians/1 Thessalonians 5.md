### 1
But [[G1161]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] times [[G5550]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seasons, [[G2540]] brethren, [[G80]] ye have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] that I write unto [[G1125]] you. [[G5213]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] yourselves [[G846]] know [[G1492]] perfectly [[G199]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of the Lord [[G2962]] so [[G3779]] cometh [[G2064]] as [[G5613]] a thief [[G2812]] in [[G1722]] the night. [[G3571]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] they shall say, [[G3004]] Peace [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] safety; [[G803]] then [[G5119]] sudden [[G160]] destruction [[G3639]] upon [[G846]] cometh [[G2186]] them, [[G846]] as [[G5618]] travail [[G5604]] a [[G3588]] upon woman [[G2192]] with [[G1722]] child; [[G1064]] and [[G2532]] they shall [[G1628]] not [[G3361]] escape. [[G1628]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] ye, [[G5210]] brethren, [[G80]] are [[G2075]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] darkness, [[G4655]] that [[G2443]] that [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] should overtake [[G2638]] you [[G5209]] as [[G5613]] a thief. [[G2812]]

### 5
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] all [[G3956]] the children [[G5207]] of light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] the children [[G5207]] of the day: [[G2250]] we are [[G2070]] not [[G3756]] of the night, [[G3571]] nor [[G3761]] of darkness. [[G4655]]

### 6
Therefore [[G686]] let us [[G2518]] not [[G3361]] sleep, [[G2518]] as [[G5613]] others; [[G3062]] but [[G235]] let us watch [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] be sober. [[G3525]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] that sleep [[G2518]] they [[G2518]] sleep [[G2518]] in the night; [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] they are [[G3184]] that be drunken [[G3182]] drunken [[G3184]] in the night. [[G3571]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] us, [[G2249]] let be [[G3525]] who are [[G5607]] of the day, [[G2250]] sober, [[G3525]] putting on [[G1746]] the breastplate [[G2382]] of faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] love; [[G26]] and [[G2532]] for an helmet, [[G4030]] the hope [[G1680]] of salvation. [[G4991]]

### 9
For [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G5087]] appointed [[G5087]] us [[G2248]] to [[G1519]] wrath, [[G3709]] but [[G235]] to [[G1519]] obtain [[G4047]] salvation [[G4991]] by [[G1223]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

### 10
Who died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] us, [[G2257]] that, [[G2443]] whether [[G1535]] we wake [[G1127]] or [[G1535]] sleep, [[G2518]] we should live [[G2198]] together [[G260]] with [[G4862]] him. [[G846]]

### 11
Wherefore [[G1352]] comfort [[G3870]] yourselves together, [[G240]] and [[G2532]] edify [[G3618]] one [[G1520]] another, [[G1520]] even as [[G2531]] also [[G2532]] ye do. [[G4160]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] we beseech [[G2065]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] to know [[G1492]] them which labour [[G2872]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] are over [[G4291]] you [[G5216]] in [[G1722]] the Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] admonish [[G3560]] you; [[G5209]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] to esteem [[G2233]] them [[G846]] very [[G5228]] highly [[G4057]] in [[G1722]] love [[G26]] for sake. [[G1223]] their [[G846]] work's [[G2041]] be at peace [[G1514]] among [[G1722]] yourselves. [[G1438]]

### 14
Now [[G1161]] we exhort [[G3870]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] warn [[G3560]]  them that [[G3588]] are [[G813]] unruly, [[G813]] comfort [[G3888]] the [[G3588]] feebleminded, [[G3642]] support [[G472]] the [[G3588]] weak, [[G772]] be patient [[G3114]] toward [[G4314]] all [[G3956]]

### 15
See [[G3708]] that none [[G3361]] render [[G591]] evil [[G2556]] for [[G473]] evil [[G2556]] unto any [[G5100]] but [[G235]] ever [[G3842]] follow [[G1377]] that which is good, [[G18]] both [[G2532]] among [[G1519]] yourselves, [[G240]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3956]]

### 16
Rejoice [[G5463]] evermore. [[G3842]]

### 17
Pray [[G4336]] without ceasing. [[G89]]

### 18
In [[G1722]] every thing [[G3956]] give thanks: [[G2168]] for [[G1063]] this is [[G5124]] the will [[G2307]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] concerning [[G1519]] you. [[G5209]]

### 19
Quench [[G4570]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 20
Despise [[G1848]] not [[G3361]] prophesyings. [[G4394]]

### 21
Prove [[G1381]] all things; [[G3956]] hold fast [[G2722]] that which is good. [[G2570]]

### 22
Abstain [[G567]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] appearance [[G1491]] of evil. [[G4190]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] very [[G846]] God [[G2316]] of [[G1515]] peace [[G1515]] sanctify [[G37]] you [[G5209]] wholly; [[G3651]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] whole [[G3648]] spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] soul [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] body [[G4983]] be preserved [[G5083]] blameless [[G274]] unto [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 24
Faithful [[G4103]] he [[G3588]] that calleth [[G2564]] you, [[G5209]] who [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] will do [[G4160]]
