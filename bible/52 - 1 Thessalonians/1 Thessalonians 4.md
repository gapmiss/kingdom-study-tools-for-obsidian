### 1
Furthermore [[G3063]] then [[G3767]] we beseech [[G2065]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] exhort [[G3870]] by [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] that as [[G2531]] ye have received [[G3880]] of [[G3844]] us [[G2257]] how [[G4459]] ye [[G5209]] ought [[G1163]] to walk [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] to please [[G700]] God, [[G2316]] so [[G2443]] ye would abound [[G4052]] more and more. [[G3123]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] ye know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] commandments [[G3852]] we gave [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] the will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] your [[G5216]] sanctification, [[G38]] that should [[G567]] ye [[G5209]] abstain [[G567]] from [[G575]] fornication: [[G4202]]

### 4
That should how [[G1492]] every one [[G1538]] of you [[G5216]] know [[G1492]] to possess [[G2932]] his [[G1438]] vessel [[G4632]] in [[G1722]] sanctification [[G38]] and [[G2532]] honour; [[G5092]]

### 5
Not [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] the lust [[G3806]] of concupiscence, [[G1939]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2509]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] which [[G3588]] know [[G1492]] not [[G3361]] God: [[G2316]]

### 6
That [[G3588]] no [[G3361]] go beyond [[G5233]] and [[G2532]] defraud [[G4122]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] in [[G1722]] matter: [[G4229]] because that [[G1360]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] the avenger [[G1558]] of [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] such, [[G5130]] as [[G2531]] also [[G2532]] we have [[G4277]] forewarned [[G4277]] you [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] testified. [[G1263]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G2564]] called [[G2564]] us [[G2248]] unto [[G1909]] uncleanness, [[G167]] but [[G235]] unto [[G1722]] holiness. [[G38]]

### 8
He [[G3588]] therefore [[G5105]] that despiseth, [[G114]] despiseth [[G114]] not [[G3756]] man, [[G444]] but [[G235]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] hath [[G1325]] given [[G1325]] unto [[G1519]] us [[G2248]] his [[G846]] holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] as touching [[G4012]] brotherly [[G5360]] love [[G5360]]  ye [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] not [[G3756]] that I write [[G1125]] unto you: [[G5213]] for [[G1063]] ye [[G5210]] yourselves [[G846]] are [[G2075]] taught of God [[G2312]] to [[G1519]] love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] indeed [[G1063]] ye do [[G4160]] it [[G846]] toward [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brethren [[G80]] which [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] Macedonia: [[G3109]] but [[G1161]] we beseech [[G3870]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] that ye increase [[G4052]] more and more; [[G3123]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] that ye study [[G5389]] to be quiet, [[G2270]] and [[G2532]] to do [[G4238]] your own business, [[G2398]] and [[G2532]] to work [[G2038]] with [[G2398]] your [[G5216]] own [[G2398]] hands, [[G5495]] as [[G2531]] we commanded [[G3853]] you; [[G5213]]

### 12
That [[G2443]] ye may walk [[G4043]] honestly [[G2156]] toward [[G4314]]  them that [[G3588]] are [[G1854]] without, [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] ye may have [[G2192]] lack [[G5532]] of nothing. [[G3367]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] I would have [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] you [[G5209]] to be ignorant, [[G50]] brethren, [[G80]] concerning [[G4012]] them which are asleep, [[G2837]] that [[G2443]] ye sorrow [[G3076]] not, [[G3361]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] others [[G3062]] which have [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] hope. [[G1680]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] we believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] died [[G599]] and [[G2532]] rose again, [[G450]] even so [[G3779]] them [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] which sleep [[G2837]] in [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] will [[G71]] God [[G2316]] bring [[G71]] with [[G4862]] him. [[G846]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] we say [[G3004]] unto you [[G5213]] by [[G1722]] the word [[G3056]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] that [[G3754]] we [[G2249]] which [[G3588]] are alive [[G2198]] remain [[G4035]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] shall [[G5348]] Lord [[G2962]] not [[G3361]] prevent [[G5348]] them which [[G3588]] are asleep. [[G2837]]

### 16
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] himself [[G846]] shall descend [[G2597]] from [[G575]] heaven [[G3772]] with [[G1722]] a shout, [[G2752]] with [[G1722]] the voice [[G5456]] of the archangel, [[G743]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] the trump [[G4536]] of God: [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] shall rise [[G450]] first: [[G4412]]

### 17
Then [[G1899]] we [[G2249]] which are alive [[G2198]] remain [[G4035]] shall be caught up [[G726]] together [[G260]] with [[G4862]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the clouds, [[G3507]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G529]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] in [[G1519]] the air: [[G109]] and [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] ever [[G3842]] shall we [[G2071]] be [[G2071]] with [[G4862]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 18
Wherefore [[G5620]] comfort [[G3870]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1722]] these [[G5125]] words. [[G3056]]
