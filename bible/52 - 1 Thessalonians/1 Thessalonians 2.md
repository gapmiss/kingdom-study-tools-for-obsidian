[[1 Thessalonians 1|←]] • [[1 Thessalonians 3|→]]

### 1
For [[G1063]] yourselves, [[G846]] brethren, [[G80]] know [[G1492]] our [[G2257]] entrance [[G1529]] in unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] in vain: [[G2756]]

### 2
But [[G235]] even [[G2532]] after that we had suffered before, [[G4310]] and [[G2532]] were shamefully entreated, [[G5195]] as [[G2531]] ye know, [[G1492]] at [[G1722]] Philippi, [[G5375]] we were bold [[G3955]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] God to [[G2316]] speak [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] with [[G1722]] much [[G4183]] contention. [[G73]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] our [[G2257]] exhortation [[G3874]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] deceit, [[G4106]] nor [[G3761]] of [[G1537]] uncleanness, [[G167]] nor [[G3777]] in [[G1722]] guile: [[G1388]]

### 4
But [[G235]] as [[G2531]] we were allowed [[G1381]] of [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] to be put in trust with [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] even so [[G3779]] we speak; [[G2980]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] pleasing [[G700]] men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] trieth [[G1381]] our [[G2257]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] neither [[G3777]] at any time [[G4218]] used we [[G1096]] flattering [[G2850]] words, [[G3056]] as [[G2531]] ye know, [[G1492]] nor [[G3777]] a cloke [[G4392]] of covetousness; [[G4124]] God [[G2316]] witness: [[G3144]]

### 6
Nor [[G3777]] of [[G1537]] men [[G444]] sought we [[G2212]] glory, [[G1391]] neither [[G3777]] of [[G575]] you, [[G5216]] nor [[G3777]] of [[G575]] others, [[G243]] when we might [[G1410]] have been [[G1511]] burdensome, [[G922]] as [[G5613]] the apostles [[G652]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

### 7
But [[G235]] we were [[G1096]] gentle [[G2261]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5216]] as [[G5613]] even a [[G302]] nurse [[G5162]] cherisheth [[G2282]] her [[G1438]] children: [[G5043]]

### 8
So [[G3779]] being affectionately desirous [[G2442]] of you, [[G5216]] we were willing [[G2106]] to have imparted [[G3330]] unto you, [[G5213]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] only, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] our own [[G1438]] souls, [[G5590]] because [[G1360]] ye were [[G1096]] dear [[G27]] unto us. [[G2254]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] ye remember, [[G3421]] brethren, [[G80]] our [[G2257]] labour [[G2873]] and [[G2532]] travail: [[G3449]] for [[G1063]] labouring [[G2038]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day, [[G2250]] because [[G4314]] we would be unto [[G1912]] not [[G3361]] chargeable [[G1912]] any [[G5100]] of you, [[G5216]] we preached [[G2784]] unto [[G1519]] you [[G5209]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 10
Ye [[G5210]] witnesses, [[G3144]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] how [[G5613]] holily [[G3743]] and [[G2532]] justly [[G1346]] and [[G2532]] unblameably [[G274]] we behaved ourselves [[G1096]] among you [[G5213]] that [[G3588]] believe: [[G4100]]

### 11
As [[G2509]] ye know [[G1492]] how [[G5613]] we exhorted [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] comforted [[G3888]] and [[G2532]] charged [[G3140]] every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of you, [[G5216]] as [[G5613]] a father [[G3962]] his [[G1438]] children, [[G5043]]

### 12
That [[G1519]] ye [[G5209]] would walk [[G4043]] worthy [[G516]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] hath called [[G2564]] you [[G5209]] unto [[G1519]] his [[G1438]] kingdom [[G932]] and [[G2532]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 13
For cause [[G1223]] this [[G5124]] also [[G2532]] thank [[G2168]] we [[G2249]] God [[G2316]] without ceasing, [[G89]] because, [[G3754]] when ye received [[G3880]] the word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which ye heard [[G189]] of [[G3844]] us, [[G2257]] ye received [[G1209]] not [[G3756]] the word [[G3056]] of men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] as [[G2531]] it is [[G2076]] in truth, [[G230]] the word [[G3056]] of God, [[G2316]] which [[G3739]] effectually worketh [[G1754]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] that [[G3588]] believe. [[G4100]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] ye, [[G5210]] brethren, [[G80]] became [[G1096]] followers [[G3402]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] churches [[G1577]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Judaea [[G2449]] are [[G5607]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus: [[G2424]] for [[G3754]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] have suffered [[G3958]] like things [[G5024]] of [[G5259]] your own [[G2398]] countrymen, [[G4853]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] they [[G846]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Jews: [[G2453]]

### 15
Who [[G3588]] both [[G2532]] killed [[G615]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] their own [[G2398]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] have persecuted [[G1559]] us; [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] they please [[G700]] not [[G3361]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] are contrary [[G1727]] to all [[G3956]] men: [[G444]]

### 16
Forbidding [[G2967]] us [[G2248]] to speak [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1484]] Gentiles [[G1484]] that [[G2443]] they might be saved, [[G4982]] to [[G1519]] fill up [[G378]] their [[G846]] sins [[G266]] alway: [[G3842]] for [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] is come [[G5348]] upon [[G1909]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the uttermost. [[G5056]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] we, [[G2249]] brethren, [[G80]] being taken [[G642]] from [[G575]] you [[G5216]] for [[G4314]] a short [[G5610]] time [[G2540]] in presence, [[G4383]] not [[G3756]] in heart, [[G2588]] endeavoured [[G4704]] the more abundantly [[G4056]] to see [[G1492]] your [[G5216]] face [[G4383]] with [[G1722]] great [[G4183]] desire. [[G1939]]

### 18
Wherefore [[G1352]] we would have [[G2309]] come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] even [[G3303]] I [[G1473]] Paul, [[G3972]] once [[G530]] and [[G2532]] again; [[G1364]] but [[G2532]] Satan [[G4567]] hindered [[G1465]] us. [[G2248]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] our [[G2257]] hope, [[G1680]] or [[G2228]] joy, [[G5479]] or [[G2228]] crown [[G4735]] of rejoicing? [[G2746]] not [[G3780]] even [[G2532]] ye [[G5210]] in the presence of [[G1715]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] at [[G1722]] his [[G846]] coming? [[G3952]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] our [[G2257]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] joy. [[G5479]]
