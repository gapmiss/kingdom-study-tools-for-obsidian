### 1
Wherefore [[G1352]] no longer [[G3371]] when we could [[G4722]] forbear, [[G4722]] we thought it good [[G2106]] to be left [[G2641]] at [[G1722]] Athens [[G116]] alone; [[G3441]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] sent [[G3992]] Timotheus, [[G5095]] our [[G2257]] brother, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] minister [[G1249]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] fellowlabourer [[G4904]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] to [[G1519]] establish [[G4741]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] to comfort [[G3870]] you [[G5209]] concerning [[G4012]] your [[G5216]] faith: [[G4102]]

### 3
That [[G3588]] no man [[G3367]] should be moved [[G4525]] by [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] afflictions: [[G2347]] for [[G1063]] yourselves [[G846]] know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we are appointed [[G2749]] thereunto. [[G1519]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] verily, [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] we were [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] we told before [[G4302]] you [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] we should [[G3195]] suffer tribulation; [[G2346]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] ye know. [[G1492]]

### 5
For cause, [[G1223]] this when [[G5124]] I [[G2504]] no longer [[G3371]] could [[G4722]] forbear, [[G4722]] I sent [[G3992]] to [[G1519]] know [[G1097]] your [[G5216]] faith, [[G4102]] lest by some means [[G3381]] the [[G3588]] tempter [[G3985]] have tempted [[G3985]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] labour [[G2873]] be [[G1096]] in [[G1519]] vain. [[G2756]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] now [[G737]] when [[G2064]] Timotheus [[G5095]] came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] you [[G5216]] unto [[G4314]] us, [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] brought good tidings [[G2097]] us [[G2254]] of your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] charity, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] ye have [[G2192]] good [[G18]] remembrance [[G3417]] of us [[G2257]] always, [[G3842]] desiring greatly [[G1971]] to see [[G1492]] us, [[G2248]] as [[G2509]] we [[G2249]] also [[G2532]] you: [[G5209]]

### 7
Therefore, [[G1223]] brethren, [[G80]] we were comforted [[G3870]] over [[G1909]] you [[G5213]] in [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] our [[G2257]] affliction [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] distress [[G318]] by [[G1223]] your [[G5216]] faith: [[G4102]]

### 8
For [[G3754]] now [[G3568]] we live, [[G2198]] if [[G1437]] ye [[G5210]] stand fast [[G4739]] in [[G1722]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] thanks [[G2169]] can we [[G1410]] render again [[G467]]  to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] for [[G4012]] you, [[G5216]] for [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] wherewith [[G3739]] we joy [[G5463]] for sakes [[G1223]] your [[G5209]] before [[G1715]] our [[G2257]] God; [[G2316]]

### 10
Night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] praying [[G1189]] exceedingly [[G5228]] that [[G1519]] we might see [[G1492]] your [[G5216]] face, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] might perfect [[G2675]]  that which is [[G3588]] lacking [[G5303]] in your [[G5216]] faith? [[G4102]]

### 11
Now [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] himself [[G846]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] direct [[G2720]] our [[G2257]] way [[G3598]] unto [[G4314]] you. [[G5209]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] you [[G5209]] make to [[G4121]] increase [[G4121]] and [[G2532]] abound [[G4052]] in [[G26]] love [[G26]] toward [[G1519]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] and [[G2532]] toward [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2509]] we [[G2249]] toward [[G1519]] you: [[G5209]]

### 13
To the end [[G1519]] he [[G3588]] may stablish [[G4741]] your [[G5216]] hearts [[G2588]] unblameable [[G273]] in [[G1722]] holiness [[G42]] before [[G1715]] God, [[G2316]] even [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Father, [[G3962]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] saints.
