While they behold [[G2029]] your [[G5216]] chaste [[G53]] conversation [[G391]] with [[G1722]] fear. [[G5401]]

### 3
Whose [[G3739]] adorning [[G2889]] let it [[G2077]] not [[G3756]] be [[G2077]] that [[G3588]] outward [[G1855]] of plaiting [[G1708]] the hair, [[G2359]] and [[G2532]] of wearing [[G4025]] of gold, [[G5553]] or [[G2228]] of putting on [[G1745]] of apparel; [[G2440]]

[[G4185]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] after this manner [[G3779]] in the old time [[G4218]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] women [[G1135]] also, [[G2532]] who trusted [[G1679]] in [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] adorned [[G2885]] themselves, [[G1438]] being in subjection [[G5293]] unto their own [[G2398]] husbands: [[G435]]

### 6
Even as [[G5613]] Sara [[G4564]] obeyed [[G5219]] Abraham, [[G11]] calling [[G2564]] him [[G846]] lord: [[G2962]] whose [[G3739]] daughters [[G5043]] ye are, [[G1096]] as long as ye do well, [[G15]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] are [[G5399]] afraid [[G5399]] with any [[G3367]] amazement. [[G4423]]

### 7
Likewise, [[G3668]]  ye [[G3588]] husbands, [[G435]] dwell with [[G4924]] according to [[G2596]] knowledge, [[G1108]] giving [[G632]] honour [[G5092]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1134]] wife, [[G1134]] as [[G5613]] unto the weaker [[G772]] vessel, [[G4632]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] being heirs together [[G4789]] of the grace [[G5485]] of life; [[G2222]] that [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] be [[G1581]] prayers [[G4335]] not [[G3361]] hindered. [[G1581]]

### 8
Finally, [[G5056]] all [[G3956]] of one mind, [[G3675]] having compassion one of another, [[G4835]] love as brethren, [[G5361]] pitiful, [[G2155]] courteous: [[G5391]]

Not [[G3361]] rendering [[G591]] evil [[G2556]] for [[G473]] evil, [[G2556]] or [[G2228]] railing [[G3059]] for [[G473]] railing: [[G3059]] but [[G1161]] contrariwise [[G5121]] blessing; [[G2127]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] thereunto [[G1519]] ye are [[G2564]] called, [[G2564]] that [[G2443]] ye should inherit [[G2816]] a blessing. [[G2129]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] he that will [[G2309]] love [[G25]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] see [[G1492]] good [[G18]] days, [[G2250]] let him refrain [[G3973]] his [[G846]] tongue [[G1100]] from [[G575]] evil, [[G2556]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] lips [[G5491]] that they speak [[G2980]] no [[G3361]] guile: [[G1388]]

### 11
Let him eschew [[G1578]] evil, [[G2556]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] good; [[G18]] let him seek [[G2212]] peace, [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] ensue [[G1377]] it. [[G846]]

### 12
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] of the Lord [[G2962]] over [[G1909]] the righteous, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] ears [[G3775]] unto [[G1519]] their [[G846]] prayers: [[G1162]] but [[G1161]] the face [[G4383]] of the Lord [[G2962]] against [[G1909]] them that do [[G4160]] evil. [[G2556]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] he [[G3588]] that will harm [[G2559]] you, [[G5209]] if [[G1437]] ye be [[G1096]] followers [[G3402]] of that which is good? [[G18]]

### 14
But [[G235]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] ye suffer [[G3958]] for [[G1223]] righteousness' sake, [[G1343]] happy [[G3107]] and [[G1161]] not [[G3361]] be [[G5399]] afraid [[G5399]] of their [[G846]] terror, [[G5401]] neither [[G3366]] be troubled; [[G5015]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] sanctify [[G37]] the Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] hearts: [[G2588]] and [[G1161]] ready [[G2092]] always [[G104]] to [[G4314]] an answer [[G627]] to every man [[G3956]] that asketh [[G154]] you [[G5209]] a reason [[G3056]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] that [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] with [[G3326]] meekness [[G4240]] and [[G2532]] fear: [[G5401]]

### 16
Having [[G2192]] a good [[G18]] conscience; [[G4893]] that, [[G2443]] whereas [[G1722]] they speak evil [[G2635]] of [[G5216]] you, [[G5216]] as [[G5613]] of evildoers, [[G2555]] they may be ashamed [[G2617]] that falsely accuse [[G1908]] your [[G5216]] good [[G18]] conversation [[G391]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] better, [[G2909]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] be so, [[G2309]] that ye suffer [[G3958]] for well doing, [[G15]] than [[G2228]] for evil doing. [[G2554]]

### 18
For [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] also [[G2532]] once [[G530]] hath [[G3958]] suffered [[G3958]] for [[G4012]] sins, [[G266]] the just [[G1342]] for [[G5228]] the unjust, [[G94]] that [[G2443]] he might bring [[G4317]] us [[G2248]] to [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] being put to death [[G2289]] in the flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G1161]] quickened [[G2227]] the [[G3588]] by [[G4151]] Spirit: [[G4151]]

### 19
By [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] he went [[G4198]] and preached [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G4151]] spirits [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] prison; [[G5438]]

### 20
Which sometime [[G4218]] were disobedient, [[G544]] when [[G3753]] once [[G530]] the [[G3588]] longsuffering [[G3115]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] waited [[G1551]] in [[G1722]] the days [[G2250]] of Noah, [[G3575]] while the ark [[G2787]] was a preparing, [[G2680]] wherein [[G1519]] few, [[G3641]] that [[G5124]] is, [[G2076]] eight [[G3638]] souls [[G5590]] were saved [[G1295]] by [[G1223]] water. [[G5204]]

### 21
The like figure [[G499]] whereunto [[G3739]] baptism [[G908]] also [[G2532]] doth [[G4982]] now [[G3568]] save [[G4982]] us [[G2248]] (not [[G3756]] the putting away [[G595]] of the filth [[G4509]] of the flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G235]] the answer [[G1906]] of a good [[G18]] conscience [[G4893]] toward [[G1519]] God,) [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] the resurrection [[G386]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

### 22
Who [[G3739]] is gone [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] and is [[G2076]] on [[G1722]] the right hand [[G1188]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] angels [[G32]] and [[G2532]] authorities [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] powers [[G1411]] being made subject [[G5293]] unto [[G846]] him. [[G846]]
