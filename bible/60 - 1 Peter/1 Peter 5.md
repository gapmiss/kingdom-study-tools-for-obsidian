### 1
The elders [[G4245]] which [[G3588]] are among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] I exhort, [[G3870]] who [[G3588]] am also an elder, [[G4850]] and [[G2532]] a witness [[G3144]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3804]] sufferings [[G3804]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] and also [[G2532]] a partaker [[G2844]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] that shall [[G3195]] be revealed: [[G601]]

### 2
Feed [[G4165]] the [[G3588]] flock [[G4168]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] which is among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] taking the oversight [[G1983]] not [[G3361]] by constraint, [[G317]] but [[G235]] willingly; [[G1596]] not [[G3366]] for filthy lucre, [[G147]] but [[G235]] of a ready mind; [[G4290]]

### 3
Neither [[G3366]] as [[G5613]] being lords over [[G2634]] heritage, [[G2819]] but [[G235]] being [[G1096]] ensamples [[G5179]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4168]] flock. [[G4168]]

### 4
And when [[G2532]] the chief [[G3588]] Shepherd [[G750]] shall appear, [[G5319]] ye shall receive [[G2865]] a crown [[G4735]] of [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] that fadeth not away. [[G262]]

### 5
Likewise, [[G3668]] ye younger, [[G3501]] submit [[G5293]] yourselves [[G240]] unto the elder. [[G4245]] Yea, [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] be subject one to another, [[G5293]] and be clothed with [[G1463]] humility: [[G5012]] for [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] resisteth [[G498]] the proud, [[G5244]] and [[G1161]] giveth [[G1325]] grace [[G5485]] to the humble. [[G5011]]

### 6
Humble yourselves [[G5013]] therefore [[G3767]] under [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] mighty [[G2900]] hand [[G5495]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] he may exalt [[G5312]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] due time: [[G2540]]

### 7
Casting [[G1977]] all [[G3956]] your [[G5216]] care [[G3308]] upon [[G1909]] him; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] he [[G846]] careth [[G3199]] for [[G4012]] you. [[G5216]]

### 8
Be sober, [[G3525]] be vigilant; [[G1127]] because [[G3754]] your [[G5216]] adversary [[G476]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] as [[G5613]] a roaring [[G5612]] lion, [[G3023]] walketh about, [[G4043]] seeking [[G2212]] whom [[G5101]] he may devour: [[G2666]]

### 9
Whom [[G3739]] resist [[G436]] stedfast [[G4731]] the [[G3588]] in [[G4102]] faith, [[G4102]] knowing that [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] afflictions are [[G3804]] accomplished [[G2005]] in your [[G5216]] brethren [[G81]] that are in [[G1722]] the world. [[G2889]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of all [[G3956]] grace, [[G5485]] who [[G3588]] hath called [[G2564]] us [[G2248]] unto [[G1519]] his [[G846]] eternal [[G166]] glory [[G1391]] by [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] after that ye have suffered [[G3958]] a while, [[G3641]] make perfect, [[G2675]] you [[G5209]] stablish, [[G4741]] strengthen, [[G4599]] settle [[G2311]]

### 11
To him [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] dominion [[G2904]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G3588]]  and ever. [[G3588]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 12
By [[G1223]] Silvanus, [[G4610]] a [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] brother [[G80]] unto you, [[G5213]] as [[G5613]] I suppose, [[G3049]] I have written [[G1125]] briefly, [[G1223]] exhorting, [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] testifying [[G1957]] that this [[G3778]] is [[G1511]] the true [[G227]] grace [[G5485]]  of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] wherein [[G1519]] ye stand. [[G2476]]

### 13
The [[G3588]] at [[G1722]] Babylon, [[G897]] elected together with [[G4899]] saluteth [[G782]] you; [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] Marcus [[G3138]] my [[G3450]] son. [[G5207]]

### 14
Greet ye [[G782]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1722]] a kiss [[G5370]] of charity. [[G26]] Peace [[G1515]] with you [[G5213]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] Amen. [[G281]]
