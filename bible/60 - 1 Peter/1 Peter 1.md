That [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] trial [[G1383]] of your [[G5216]] faith, [[G4102]] being much [[G4183]] more precious than [[G5093]] of gold [[G5553]] that [[G3588]] perisheth, [[G622]] though [[G1161]] it be tried [[G1381]] with [[G1223]] fire, [[G4442]] might be found [[G2147]] unto [[G1519]] praise [[G1868]] and [[G2532]] honour [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] at [[G1722]] the appearing [[G602]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]]

Receiving [[G2865]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] of your [[G5216]] faith, [[G4102]] the salvation [[G4991]] of souls. [[G5590]]

### 10
Of [[G4012]] which [[G3739]] salvation [[G4991]] the prophets [[G4396]] have inquired [[G1567]] and [[G2532]] searched diligently, [[G1830]] who [[G3588]] prophesied [[G4395]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] unto [[G1519]] you: [[G5209]]

### 11
Searching [[G2045]] what, [[G5101]] or [[G2228]] what manner of [[G4169]] time [[G2540]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of Christ [[G5547]] which was in [[G1722]] them [[G846]] did signify, [[G1213]] when it testified beforehand [[G4303]] the [[G3588]] sufferings [[G3804]] of [[G1519]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] should follow. [[G3326]] that [[G5023]]

### 12
Unto whom [[G3739]] it was revealed, [[G601]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] unto themselves, [[G1438]] but [[G1161]] unto us [[G2254]] they did minister [[G1247]] the things, [[G846]] which [[G3739]] now [[G3568]] are [[G312]] reported [[G312]] unto you [[G5213]] by [[G1223]] them [[G3588]] that have preached the gospel [[G2097]] unto you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] sent down [[G649]] from [[G575]] heaven; [[G3772]] which things [[G3739]] the angels [[G32]] desire [[G1937]] to look [[G3879]] into. [[G1519]]

### 13
Wherefore [[G1352]] gird up [[G328]] the [[G3588]] loins [[G3751]] of your [[G5216]] mind, [[G1271]] be sober, [[G3525]] and hope [[G1679]] to the end [[G5049]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] that is to be brought [[G5342]] unto you [[G5213]] at [[G1722]] the revelation [[G602]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ; [[G5547]]

### 14
As [[G5613]] obedient [[G5218]] children, [[G5043]] not [[G3361]] fashioning yourselves according to [[G4964]] the [[G3588]] former [[G4386]] lusts [[G1939]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] ignorance: [[G52]]

### 15
But [[G235]] as [[G2596]] he [[G3588]] which hath called [[G2564]] you [[G5209]] is holy, [[G40]] so [[G2532]] be [[G1096]] ye [[G846]] holy [[G40]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] manner of [[G391]] conversation; [[G391]]

### 16
Because [[G1360]] it is written, [[G1125]] Be ye [[G1096]] holy; [[G40]] for [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] holy. [[G40]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] ye call on [[G1941]] the Father, [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] without respect of persons [[G678]] judgeth [[G2919]] according to [[G2596]] every man's [[G1538]] work, [[G2041]] pass [[G390]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] of your [[G5216]] sojourning [[G3940]] in [[G1722]] fear: [[G5401]]

### 18
Forasmuch as ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] ye were [[G3084]] redeemed [[G3084]] with corruptible things, [[G5349]] silver [[G694]] and [[G2228]] gold, [[G5553]] from [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] vain [[G3152]] conversation [[G391]] by tradition from your fathers; [[G3970]]

### 19
But [[G235]] with the precious [[G5093]] blood [[G129]] of Christ, [[G5547]] as [[G5613]] of a lamb [[G286]] without blemish [[G299]] and [[G2532]] without spot: [[G784]]

### 20
Who verily [[G3303]] was foreordained [[G4267]] before [[G4253]] the foundation [[G2602]] of the world, [[G2889]] but [[G1161]] was manifest [[G5319]] in [[G1909]] these last [[G2078]] times [[G5550]] for [[G1223]] you, [[G5209]]

### 21
Who [[G3588]] by [[G1223]] him [[G846]] do believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G3588]] raised up [[G1453]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] the dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] glory; [[G1391]] that [[G5620]] your [[G5216]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] hope [[G1680]] might be [[G1511]] in [[G1519]] God. [[G2316]]

### 22
Seeing ye have purified [[G48]] your [[G5216]] souls [[G5590]] in [[G1722]] obeying [[G5218]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] through [[G1223]] the Spirit [[G4151]] unto [[G1519]] unfeigned [[G505]] love of the brethren, [[G5360]] love [[G25]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1537]] a pure [[G2513]] heart [[G2588]] fervently: [[G1619]]

### 23
Being born again, [[G313]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] corruptible [[G5349]] seed, [[G4701]] but [[G235]] of incorruptible, [[G862]] by [[G1223]] the word [[G3056]] of God, [[G2316]] which liveth [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] abideth [[G3306]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 24
For [[G1360]] all [[G3956]] flesh [[G4561]] as [[G5613]] grass, [[G5528]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the glory [[G1391]] of man [[G444]] as [[G5613]] the flower [[G438]] of grass. [[G5528]] The [[G3588]] grass [[G5528]] withereth, [[G3583]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] flower [[G438]] thereof [[G846]] falleth away: [[G1601]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] of the Lord [[G2962]] endureth [[G3306]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]] And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] which [[G3588]] by the gospel is preached [[G2097]] unto [[G1519]] you. [[G5209]]
