Wherefore [[G3767]] laying aside [[G659]] all [[G3956]] malice, [[G2549]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] guile, [[G1388]] and [[G2532]] hypocrisies, [[G5272]] and [[G2532]] envies, [[G5355]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] evil speakings, [[G2636]]

### 2
As [[G5613]] newborn [[G738]] babes, [[G1025]] desire [[G1971]] the sincere [[G97]] milk [[G1051]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3050]] word, [[G3050]] that [[G2443]] ye may grow [[G837]] thereby: [[G1722]]

### 3
If so be [[G1512]] ye have tasted [[G1089]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] gracious. [[G5543]]

### 4
To [[G4314]] whom [[G3739]] coming, [[G4334]] a living [[G2198]] stone, [[G3037]] disallowed [[G593]] indeed [[G3303]] of [[G5259]] men, [[G444]] but [[G1161]] chosen [[G1588]] of [[G3844]] God, [[G2316]] precious, [[G1784]]

### 5
Ye [[G846]] also, [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] lively [[G2198]] stones, [[G3037]] are built up [[G3618]] a spiritual [[G4152]] house, [[G3624]] an holy [[G40]] priesthood, [[G2406]] to offer up [[G399]] spiritual [[G4152]] sacrifices, [[G2378]] acceptable [[G2144]]  to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 6
Wherefore [[G1352]] also [[G2532]] it is contained [[G4023]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] scripture, [[G1124]] Behold, [[G2400]] I lay [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] Sion [[G4622]] a chief corner [[G204]] stone, [[G3037]] elect, [[G1588]] precious: [[G1784]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that believeth [[G4100]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G2617]] confounded. [[G2617]]

### 7
Unto you [[G5213]] therefore [[G3767]] which [[G3588]] believe [[G4100]] precious: [[G5092]] but [[G1161]] unto them which be disobedient, [[G544]] the stone [[G3037]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] builders [[G3618]] disallowed, [[G593]] the same [[G3778]] is made [[G1096]] the [[G1519]] head [[G2776]] of the corner, [[G1137]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] a stone [[G3037]] of stumbling, [[G4348]] and [[G2532]] a rock [[G4073]] of offence, [[G4625]] which [[G3739]] stumble at [[G4350]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] being disobedient: [[G544]] whereunto [[G1519]] also [[G2532]] they were appointed. [[G5087]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] a chosen [[G1588]] generation, [[G1085]] a royal [[G934]] priesthood, [[G2406]] an holy [[G40]] nation, [[G1484]] a peculiar [[G4047]] people; [[G2992]] that [[G3704]] ye should shew forth [[G1804]] the [[G3588]] praises of who hath [[G703]] him [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] you [[G5209]] out of [[G1537]] darkness [[G4655]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] marvellous [[G2298]] light: [[G5457]]

### 10
Which [[G3588]] in time past [[G4218]] not [[G3756]] a people, [[G2992]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] the people [[G2992]] of God: [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] not [[G3756]] had obtained [[G1653]] mercy, [[G1653]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] have obtained mercy. [[G1653]]

### 11
Dearly beloved, [[G27]] I beseech [[G3870]] as [[G5613]] strangers [[G3941]] and [[G2532]] pilgrims, [[G3927]] abstain [[G567]] from fleshly [[G4559]] lusts, [[G1939]] which [[G3748]] war [[G4754]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] soul; [[G5590]]

### 12
Having [[G2192]] your [[G5216]] conversation [[G391]] honest [[G2570]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles: [[G1484]] that, [[G2443]] whereas [[G1722]] they speak against [[G2635]] you [[G5216]] as [[G5613]] evildoers, [[G2555]] by [[G1537]] they may [[G1392]] good [[G2570]] works, [[G2041]] which they shall behold, [[G2029]] glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] the day [[G2250]] of visitation. [[G1984]]

### 13
Submit yourselves [[G5293]] to [[G3767]] every [[G3956]] ordinance [[G2937]] of man [[G442]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Lord's sake: [[G2962]] whether it be [[G1535]] to the king, [[G935]] as [[G5613]] supreme; [[G5242]]

### 14
Or [[G1535]] unto governors, [[G2232]] as [[G5613]] unto them that are sent [[G3992]] by [[G1223]] him [[G846]] for [[G1519]] the punishment [[G1557]] of [[G3303]] evildoers, [[G2555]] and [[G1161]] for the praise [[G1868]] of them that do well. [[G17]]

### 15
For [[G3754]] so [[G3779]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] that with well doing [[G15]] ye may put to silence [[G5392]] the [[G3588]] ignorance [[G56]] of foolish [[G878]] men: [[G444]]

### 16
As [[G5613]] free, [[G1658]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] using [[G2192]] liberty [[G1657]] for [[G5613]] a cloak [[G1942]] of [[G2549]] maliciousness, [[G2549]] but [[G235]] as [[G5613]] the servants [[G1401]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 17
Honour [[G5091]] all [[G3956]] Love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] brotherhood. [[G81]] Fear [[G5399]] God. [[G2316]] Honour [[G5091]] the [[G3588]] king. [[G935]]

### 18
Servants, [[G3610]] subject [[G5293]] to [[G1203]] masters [[G1203]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] fear; [[G5401]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] the [[G3588]] to [[G18]] good [[G18]] and [[G2532]] gentle, [[G1933]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4646]] froward. [[G4646]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] this [[G5124]] thankworthy, [[G5485]] if [[G1487]] a man [[G5100]] for [[G1223]] conscience [[G4893]] toward God [[G2316]] endure [[G5297]] grief, [[G3077]] suffering [[G3958]] wrongfully. [[G95]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] what [[G4169]] glory [[G2811]] if, [[G1487]] when [[G2532]] ye be buffeted [[G2852]] for your faults, [[G264]] ye shall take it patiently? [[G5278]] but [[G235]] if, [[G1487]] when ye do well, [[G15]] and [[G2532]] suffer [[G3958]] ye take it patiently, [[G5278]] this [[G5124]] acceptable [[G5485]] with [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] even were ye [[G1519]] hereunto [[G5124]] called: [[G2564]] because [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] also [[G2532]] suffered [[G3958]] for [[G5228]] us, [[G2257]] leaving [[G5277]] us [[G2254]] an example, [[G5261]] that [[G2443]] ye should follow [[G1872]] his [[G846]] steps: [[G2487]]

### 22
Who [[G3739]] did [[G4160]] no [[G3756]] sin, [[G266]] neither [[G3761]] was [[G2147]] guile [[G1388]] found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] mouth: [[G4750]]

### 23
Who, [[G3739]] when he was reviled, [[G3058]] reviled again; [[G486]] not [[G3756]] when he suffered, [[G3958]] he threatened [[G546]] not; [[G3756]] but [[G1161]] committed [[G3860]] him [[G3588]] to that [[G2919]] judgeth [[G2919]] righteously: [[G1346]]

### 24
Who [[G3739]] his own self [[G846]] bare [[G399]] our [[G2257]] sins [[G266]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] body [[G4983]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tree, [[G3586]] that [[G2443]] being dead [[G581]] we, should [[G2198]] to [[G266]] sins, [[G266]] live [[G2198]] unto [[G1343]] righteousness: [[G1343]] by whose [[G3739]] stripes [[G846]]  ye were [[G3468]] healed. [[G2390]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] ye were [[G2258]] as [[G5613]] sheep [[G4263]] going astray; [[G4105]] but [[G235]] are [[G1994]] now [[G3568]] returned [[G1994]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Shepherd [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] Bishop [[G1985]] of your [[G5216]] souls. [[G5590]]
