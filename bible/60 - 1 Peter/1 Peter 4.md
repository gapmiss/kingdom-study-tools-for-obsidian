### 1
Forasmuch then as [[G3767]] Christ [[G5547]] hath suffered [[G3958]] for [[G5228]] us [[G2257]] in the flesh, [[G4561]] arm [[G3695]] yourselves [[G5210]] likewise [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] with [[G846]] same [[G846]] mind: [[G1771]] for [[G3754]] he [[G3588]] that hath suffered [[G3958]] in [[G1722]] the flesh [[G4561]] hath ceased [[G3973]] from sin; [[G266]]

### 2
That [[G1519]] he [[G3588]] no longer [[G3371]] should live [[G980]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G1954]] of time [[G5550]] in [[G1722]] the flesh [[G4561]] to the lusts [[G1939]] of men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] to the will [[G2307]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] past [[G3928]] of [[G979]] life [[G979]] may suffice [[G713]] us [[G2254]] to have wrought [[G2716]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] when we walked [[G4198]] in [[G1722]] lasciviousness, [[G766]] lusts, [[G1939]] excess of wine, [[G3632]] revellings, [[G2970]] banquetings, [[G4224]] and [[G2532]] abominable [[G111]] idolatries: [[G1495]]

### 4
Wherein [[G1722]] they think it strange [[G3579]] that ye [[G5216]] run with [[G4936]] not [[G3361]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] excess [[G401]] of [[G810]] riot, [[G810]] speaking evil of [[G987]]

### 5
Who [[G3739]] shall give [[G591]] account [[G3056]] to him that is [[G2192]] ready [[G2093]] to judge [[G2919]] the quick [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] the dead. [[G3498]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] for [[G1519]] this cause [[G5124]] was the gospel preached [[G2097]] also [[G2532]] to them that are dead, [[G3498]] that [[G2443]] they might be judged [[G2919]] according to [[G2596]] men [[G444]] in the flesh, [[G4561]] but [[G1161]] live [[G2198]] according to [[G2596]] God [[G2316]] in the spirit. [[G4151]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] of all things [[G3956]] is at hand: [[G1448]] be ye [[G4993]] therefore [[G3767]] sober, [[G4993]] and [[G2532]] watch [[G3525]] unto [[G1519]] prayer. [[G4335]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] above [[G4253]] all things [[G3956]] have [[G2192]] fervent [[G1618]] charity [[G26]] among [[G1519]] yourselves: [[G1438]] for [[G3754]] charity [[G26]] shall cover [[G2572]] the multitude [[G4128]] of sins. [[G266]]

### 9
Use hospitality [[G5382]] to [[G1519]] one [[G240]] another [[G240]] without [[G427]] grudging. [[G1112]]

### 10
As [[G2531]] every man [[G1538]] hath received [[G2983]] the gift, [[G5486]] minister [[G1247]] the same [[G846]] one another, [[G1438]] to [[G1519]] as [[G5613]] good [[G2570]] stewards [[G3623]] of the manifold [[G4164]] grace [[G5485]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 11
If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] speak, [[G2980]] as [[G5613]] the oracles [[G3051]] of God; [[G2316]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] minister, [[G1247]] as [[G5613]] of [[G1537]] the ability [[G2479]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] giveth: [[G5524]] that [[G2443]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] all things [[G3956]] may be glorified [[G1392]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] to whom [[G3739]] be [[G2076]] praise [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] dominion [[G2904]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]]  and [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 12
Beloved, [[G27]] not [[G3361]] think it [[G3579]] strange [[G3579]] concerning [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] fiery trial [[G4451]] which is [[G1096]] to [[G4314]] try [[G3986]] you, [[G5213]] as though [[G5613]] some strange thing [[G3581]] happened [[G4819]] unto you: [[G5213]]

### 13
But [[G235]] rejoice, [[G5463]] inasmuch as [[G2526]] ye are partakers [[G2841]] of [[G5547]] Christ's [[G5547]] sufferings; [[G3804]] that, [[G2443]] when [[G1722]] his [[G846]] glory shall be [[G1391]] revealed, [[G602]] ye may be glad [[G5463]] also [[G2532]] with exceeding joy. [[G21]]

### 14
If [[G1487]] ye be reproached [[G3679]] for [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of Christ, [[G5547]] happy [[G3107]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of [[G1391]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] resteth [[G373]] upon [[G1909]] you: [[G5209]] on [[G2596]] their part [[G846]] he is evil spoken of, [[G987]] but [[G1161]] on [[G2596]] your part [[G5209]] he is glorified. [[G1392]]

### 15
But [[G1063]] none [[G3361]] let [[G3958]] of you [[G5216]] suffer [[G3958]] as [[G5613]] a murderer, [[G5406]] or [[G2228]] a thief, [[G2812]] or [[G2228]] an evildoer, [[G2555]] or [[G2228]] as [[G5613]] a busybody in other men's matters. [[G244]]

### 16
Yet [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] as [[G5613]] a Christian, [[G5546]] not [[G3361]] let him be [[G153]] ashamed; [[G153]] but [[G1161]] let him glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] on [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] behalf. [[G3313]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] that [[G2917]] judgment [[G2917]] must begin [[G756]] at [[G575]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] first [[G4412]] at [[G575]] us, [[G2257]] what [[G5101]] shall the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] them [[G3588]] of that obey [[G544]] not [[G544]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of God? [[G2316]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] scarcely [[G3433]] be saved, [[G4982]] where [[G4226]] the [[G3588]] shall [[G5316]] ungodly [[G765]] and [[G2532]] the sinner [[G268]] appear? [[G5316]]

### 19
Wherefore [[G5620]] let them that [[G2532]] suffer [[G3958]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] commit the keeping [[G3908]] of their [[G1438]] souls [[G5590]] in [[G1722]] well doing, [[G16]] as [[G5613]] unto a faithful [[G4103]] Creator. [[G2939]]
