### 1
The [[G3588]] elder [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G27]] wellbeloved [[G27]] Gaius, [[G1050]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] love [[G25]] in [[G1722]] the truth. [[G225]]

### 2
Beloved, [[G27]] I wish [[G2172]] above [[G4012]] all things [[G3956]] thou [[G4571]] that mayest [[G2137]] prosper [[G2137]] and [[G2532]] be in health, [[G5198]] even as [[G2531]] thy [[G4675]] soul [[G5590]] prospereth. [[G2137]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] I rejoiced [[G5463]] greatly, [[G3029]] when [[G2064]] the brethren [[G80]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] testified of [[G3140]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] that is in thee, [[G4675]] even as [[G2531]] thou [[G4771]] walkest [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the truth. [[G225]]

### 4
I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] greater [[G3186]] joy [[G5479]] than [[G5130]] to [[G2443]] that [[G191]] hear [[G191]] my [[G1699]] children [[G5043]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] truth. [[G225]]

### 5
Beloved, [[G27]] thou doest [[G4160]] faithfully [[G4103]] whatsoever [[G3739]] thou doest [[G2038]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] strangers; [[G3581]]

### 6
Which [[G3739]] have borne witness [[G3140]] of thy [[G4675]] charity [[G26]] before [[G1799]] the church: [[G1577]] whom [[G3739]] if thou bring forward on their journey [[G4311]] after [[G516]] a [[G3588]] godly sort, [[G2316]] thou shalt [[G2316]] do [[G4160]] well: [[G2573]]

### 7
Because that [[G1063]] for [[G5228]] his [[G3588]] name's sake [[G3686]] they went forth, [[G1831]] taking [[G2983]] nothing [[G3367]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 8
We [[G2249]] therefore [[G3767]] ought [[G3784]] to receive [[G618]] such, [[G5108]] that [[G2443]] we might be [[G1096]] fellowhelpers [[G4904]] the [[G3588]] to [[G225]] truth. [[G225]]

### 9
I wrote unto [[G1125]] the [[G3588]] church: [[G1577]] but [[G235]] Diotrephes, [[G1361]] the [[G3588]] who loveth to have [[G5383]] preeminence [[G5383]] among them, [[G846]] receiveth [[G1926]] us [[G2248]] not. [[G3756]]

### 10
Wherefore, [[G1223]] if [[G1437]] I come, [[G2064]] I will remember [[G5279]] his [[G846]] deeds [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] he doeth, [[G4160]] prating against [[G5396]] us [[G2248]] with [[G3056]] malicious [[G4190]] words: [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] content [[G714]] therewith, [[G1909]] neither [[G3777]] he himself [[G846]] doth [[G1926]] receive [[G1926]] the [[G3588]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] forbiddeth [[G2967]] them that would, [[G1014]] and [[G2532]] casteth [[G1544]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]]

### 11
Beloved, [[G27]] follow [[G3401]] not [[G3361]] that which is [[G3588]] evil, [[G2556]] but [[G235]] that which is [[G3588]] good. [[G18]] He [[G3588]] that doeth good [[G15]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] God: [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that doeth evil [[G2554]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
Demetrius [[G1216]] hath good report [[G3140]] of [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] itself: [[G846]] yea, [[G1161]] and [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] bear record; [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] ye know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] our [[G2257]] record [[G3141]] is [[G2076]] true. [[G227]]

### 13
I had [[G2192]] many things [[G4183]] to write, [[G1125]] but [[G235]] I will [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] with [[G1223]] ink [[G3188]] and [[G2532]] pen [[G2563]] write [[G1125]] unto thee: [[G4671]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] I trust [[G1679]] shortly [[G2112]] I shall [[G1492]] see [[G1492]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] we shall speak [[G2980]] face [[G4750]] to [[G4314]] face. [[G4750]] Peace [[G1515]] to thee. [[G4671]] friends [[G5384]] salute [[G782]] thee. [[G4571]] Greet [[G782]] the [[G3588]] friends [[G5384]] by [[G2596]] name. [[G3686]]
