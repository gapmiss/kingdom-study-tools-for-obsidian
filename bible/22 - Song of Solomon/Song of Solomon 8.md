[[Song of Solomon 7|←]] • [[Isaiah 1|→]]

### 1
O that [[H5414]] thou as my brother, [[H251]] that sucked [[H3243]] the breasts [[H7699]] of my mother! [[H517]] I should find [[H4672]] thee without, [[H2351]] I would kiss [[H5401]] thee; yea, [[H1571]] I should not [[H3808]] be despised. [[H936]]

### 2
I would lead [[H5090]] thee, bring [[H935]] thee into [[H413]] my mother's [[H517]] house, [[H1004]] would instruct [[H3925]] me: I would cause thee to drink [[H8248]] of spiced [[H7544]] wine [[H3196]] of the juice [[H6071]] of my pomegranate. [[H7416]]

### 3
His left hand [[H8040]] under [[H8478]] my head, [[H7218]] and his right hand [[H3225]] should embrace [[H2263]] me. [[H2263]]

### 4
I charge [[H7650]] you, O daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that [[H4100]] ye stir not up, [[H5782]] nor [[H4100]] awake [[H5782]] love, [[H160]] until [[H5704]] he please. [[H2654]]

### 5
Who [[H4310]] this [[H2063]] that cometh up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] leaning [[H7514]] upon [[H5921]] her beloved? [[H1730]] I raised thee up [[H5782]] under [[H8478]] the apple tree: [[H8598]] there [[H8033]] thy mother [[H517]] brought thee forth: [[H2254]] there [[H8033]] she brought thee forth [[H2254]] bare [[H3205]] thee. [[H3205]]

### 6
Set [[H7760]] me as a seal [[H2368]] upon [[H5921]] thine heart, [[H3820]] as a seal [[H2368]] upon [[H5921]] thine arm: [[H2220]] for [[H3588]] love [[H160]] strong [[H5794]] as death; [[H4194]] jealousy [[H7068]] cruel [[H7186]] as the grave: [[H7585]] the coals [[H7565]] thereof coals [[H7565]] of fire, [[H784]] a most vehement flame. [[H7957]]

### 7
Many [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] cannot [[H3201]] quench [[H3518]] love, [[H160]] neither [[H3808]] can the floods [[H5104]] drown [[H7857]] it: if [[H518]] a man [[H376]] would give [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the substance [[H1952]] of his house [[H1004]] for love, [[H160]] it would utterly [[H936]] be contemned. [[H936]]

### 8
We have a little [[H6996]] sister, [[H269]] and she hath no [[H369]] breasts: [[H7699]] what [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] for our sister [[H269]] in the day [[H3117]] when she shall be spoken for? [[H1696]]

### 9
If [[H518]] she [[H1931]] a wall, [[H2346]] we will build [[H1129]] upon [[H5921]] her a palace [[H2918]] of silver: [[H3701]] and if [[H518]] she [[H1931]] a door, [[H1817]] we will inclose [[H6696]] her with boards [[H3871]] of cedar. [[H730]]

### 10
I [[H589]] a wall, [[H2346]] and my breasts [[H7699]] like towers: [[H4026]] then [[H227]] was [[H1961]] I in his eyes [[H5869]] as one that found [[H4672]] favour. [[H7965]]

### 11
Solomon [[H8010]] had [[H1961]] a vineyard [[H3754]] at Baal-hamon; [[H1174]] he let out [[H5414]] the vineyard [[H3754]] unto keepers; [[H5201]] every one [[H376]] for the fruit [[H6529]] thereof was to bring [[H935]] a thousand [[H505]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 12
My vineyard, [[H3754]] which mine, [[H7945]] before [[H6440]] me: thou, O Solomon, [[H8010]] a thousand, [[H505]] and those that keep [[H5201]] the fruit [[H6529]] thereof two hundred. [[H3967]]

### 13
Thou that dwellest [[H3427]] in the gardens, [[H1588]] the companions [[H2270]] hearken [[H7181]] to thy voice: [[H6963]] cause me to hear [[H8085]]

### 14
Make haste, [[H1272]] my beloved, [[H1730]] and be thou like [[H1819]] to a roe [[H6643]] or [[H176]] to a young [[H6082]] hart [[H354]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of spices. [[H1314]]
