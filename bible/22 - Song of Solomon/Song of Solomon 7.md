### 1
How [[H4100]] beautiful [[H3302]] are thy feet [[H6471]] with shoes, [[H5275]] O prince's [[H5081]] daughter! [[H1323]] the joints [[H2542]] of thy thighs [[H3409]] like [[H3644]] jewels, [[H2481]] the work [[H4639]] of the hands [[H3027]] of a cunning workman. [[H542]]

### 2
Thy navel [[H8326]] a round [[H5469]] goblet, [[H101]] wanteth [[H2637]] not [[H408]] liquor: [[H4197]] thy belly [[H990]] an heap [[H6194]] of wheat [[H2406]] set about [[H5473]] with lilies. [[H7799]]

### 3
Thy two [[H8147]] breasts [[H7699]] like two [[H8147]] young [[H6082]] roes [[H6646]] twins. [[H8380]]

### 4
Thy neck [[H6677]] as a tower [[H4026]] of ivory; [[H8127]] thine eyes [[H5869]] the fishpools [[H1295]] in Heshbon, [[H2809]] by [[H5921]] the gate [[H8179]] of Bath-rabbim: [[H1337]] thy nose [[H639]] as the tower [[H4026]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] which looketh [[H6822]] toward [[H6440]] Damascus. [[H1834]]

### 5
Thine head [[H7218]] upon [[H5921]] thee like Carmel, [[H3760]] and the hair [[H1803]] of thine head [[H7218]] like purple; [[H713]] the king [[H4428]] held [[H631]] in the galleries. [[H7298]]

### 6
How [[H4100]] fair [[H3302]] and how [[H4100]] pleasant [[H5276]] art thou, O love, [[H160]] for delights! [[H8588]]

### 7
This [[H2063]] thy stature [[H6967]] is like [[H1819]] to a palm tree, [[H8558]] and thy breasts [[H7699]] to clusters [[H811]]

### 8
I said, [[H559]] I will go up [[H5927]] to the palm tree, [[H8558]] I will take hold [[H270]] of the boughs [[H5577]] thereof: now [[H4994]] also thy breasts [[H7699]] shall be [[H1961]] as clusters [[H811]] of the vine, [[H1612]] and the smell [[H7381]] of thy nose [[H639]] like apples; [[H8598]]

### 9
And the roof of thy mouth [[H2441]] like the best [[H2896]] wine [[H3196]] for my beloved, [[H1730]] that goeth [[H1980]] sweetly, [[H4339]] causing the lips [[H8193]] of those that are asleep [[H3463]] to speak. [[H1680]]

### 10
I [[H589]] my beloved's, [[H1730]] and his desire [[H8669]] toward [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 11
Come, [[H1980]] my beloved, [[H1730]] let us go forth [[H3318]] into the field; [[H7704]] let us lodge [[H3885]] in the villages. [[H3723]]

### 12
Let us get up early [[H7925]] to the vineyards; [[H3754]] let us see [[H7200]] if [[H518]] the vine [[H1612]] flourish, [[H6524]] the tender grape [[H5563]] appear, [[H6605]] the pomegranates [[H7416]] bud forth: [[H5132]] there [[H8033]] will I give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] my loves. [[H1730]]

### 13
The mandrakes [[H1736]] give [[H5414]] a smell, [[H7381]] and at [[H5921]] our gates [[H6607]] all manner [[H3605]] of pleasant [[H4022]] new [[H2319]] and [[H1571]] old, [[H3465]] I have laid up [[H6845]] for thee, O my beloved. [[H1730]]
