[[Ecclesiastes 12|←]] • [[Song of Solomon 2|→]]

---

### 1
The song [[H7892]] of songs, [[H7892]] which [[H834]] Solomon's. [[H8010]]

### 2
Let him kiss [[H5401]] me with the kisses [[H5390]] of his mouth: [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] thy love [[H1730]] better [[H2896]] than wine. [[H3196]]

### 3
Because of the savour [[H7381]] of thy good [[H2896]] ointments [[H8081]] thy name [[H8034]] ointment [[H8081]] poured forth, [[H7324]] therefore [[H5921]] do the virgins [[H5959]] love [[H157]] thee. [[H157]]

### 4
Draw [[H4900]] me, we will run [[H7323]] after [[H310]] thee: the king [[H4428]] hath brought [[H935]] me into his chambers: [[H2315]] we will be glad [[H1523]] and rejoice [[H8055]] in thee, we will remember [[H2142]] thy love [[H1730]] more than wine: [[H3196]] the upright [[H4339]] love [[H157]] thee. [[H157]]

### 5
I [[H589]] black, [[H7838]] but comely, [[H5000]] O ye daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] as the tents [[H168]] of Kedar, [[H6938]] as the curtains [[H3407]] of Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 6
Look [[H7200]] not [[H408]] upon me, because I [[H589]] black, [[H7840]] because the sun [[H8121]] hath looked [[H7805]] upon me: my mother's [[H517]] children [[H1121]] were angry [[H2787]] with me; they made [[H7760]] me the keeper [[H5201]]  of [[H853]] the vineyards; [[H3754]] mine own vineyard [[H3754]] have I not [[H3808]] kept. [[H5201]]

### 7
Tell [[H5046]] me, O thou whom my soul [[H5315]] loveth, [[H157]] where [[H349]] thou feedest, [[H7462]] where [[H349]] thou makest to rest [[H7257]] at noon: [[H6672]] for why [[H4100]] should I be [[H1961]] as one that turneth aside [[H5844]] by [[H5921]] the flocks [[H5739]] of thy companions? [[H2270]]

### 8
If [[H518]] thou know [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] O thou fairest [[H3303]] among women, [[H802]] go thy way forth [[H3318]] by the footsteps [[H6119]] of the flock, [[H6629]] and feed [[H7462]] thy kids [[H1429]] beside [[H5921]] the shepherds' [[H7462]] tents. [[H4908]]

### 9
I have compared [[H1819]] thee, O my love, [[H7474]] to a company of horses [[H5484]] in Pharaoh's [[H6547]] chariots. [[H7393]]

### 10
Thy cheeks [[H3895]] are comely [[H4998]] with rows [[H8447]] thy neck [[H6677]] with chains [[H2737]]

### 11
We will make [[H6213]] thee borders [[H8447]] of gold [[H2091]] with [[H5973]] studs [[H5351]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 12
While [[H5704]] the king [[H4428]] at his table, [[H4524]] my spikenard [[H5373]] sendeth forth [[H5414]] the smell [[H7381]] thereof. [[H7381]]

### 13
A bundle [[H6872]] of myrrh [[H4753]] my wellbeloved [[H1730]] unto me; he shall lie [[H3885]] all night betwixt [[H996]] my breasts. [[H7699]]

### 14
My beloved [[H1730]] unto me a cluster [[H811]] of camphire [[H3724]] in the vineyards [[H3754]] of En-gedi. [[H5872]]

### 15
Behold, [[H2005]] thou fair, [[H3303]] my love; [[H7474]] behold, [[H2005]] thou fair; [[H3303]] thou doves' [[H3123]] eyes. [[H5869]]

### 16
Behold, [[H2005]] thou fair, [[H3303]] my beloved, [[H1730]] yea, [[H637]] pleasant: [[H5273]] also [[H637]] our bed [[H6210]] green. [[H7488]]

### 17
The beams [[H6982]] of our house [[H1004]] cedar, [[H730]] our rafters [[H7351]] of fir. [[H1266]]
