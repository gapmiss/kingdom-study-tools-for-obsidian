### 1
Whither [[H575]] is thy beloved [[H1730]] gone, [[H1980]] O thou fairest [[H3303]] among women? [[H802]] whither [[H575]] is thy beloved [[H1730]] turned aside? [[H6437]] that we may seek [[H1245]] him with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 2
My beloved [[H1730]] is gone down [[H3381]] into his garden, [[H1588]] to the beds [[H6170]] of spices, [[H1314]] to feed [[H7462]] in the gardens, [[H1588]] and to gather [[H3950]] lilies. [[H7799]]

### 3
I [[H589]] my beloved's, [[H1730]] and my beloved [[H1730]] mine: he feedeth [[H7462]] among the lilies. [[H7799]]

### 4
Thou [[H859]] beautiful, [[H3303]] O my love, [[H7474]] as Tirzah, [[H8656]] comely [[H5000]] as Jerusalem, [[H3389]] terrible [[H366]] as with banners. [[H1713]]

### 5
Turn away [[H5437]] thine eyes [[H5869]] from [[H5048]] me, for they [[H1992]] have overcome [[H7292]] me: thy hair [[H8181]] as a flock [[H5739]] of goats [[H5795]] that appear [[H1570]] from [[H4480]] Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 6
Thy teeth [[H8127]] as a flock [[H5739]] of sheep [[H7353]] which go up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the washing, [[H7367]] whereof every one [[H3605]] beareth twins, [[H8382]] and not [[H369]] one barren [[H7909]] among them. [[H7909]]

### 7
As a piece [[H6400]] of a pomegranate [[H7416]] thy temples [[H7541]] within [[H1157]] thy locks. [[H6777]]

### 8
There [[H1992]] are threescore [[H8346]] queens, [[H4436]] and fourscore [[H8084]] concubines, [[H6370]] and virgins [[H5959]] without [[H369]] number. [[H4557]]

### 9
My dove, [[H3123]] my undefiled [[H8535]] is one; [[H259]] she [[H1931]] the one [[H259]] of her mother, [[H517]] she [[H1931]] the choice [[H1249]] of her that bare [[H3205]] her. The daughters [[H1323]] saw [[H7200]] her, and blessed [[H833]] her; the queens [[H4436]] and the concubines, [[H6370]] and they praised [[H1984]] her. [[H1984]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] she [[H2063]] looketh forth [[H8259]] as the morning, [[H7837]] fair [[H3303]] as the moon, [[H3842]] clear [[H1249]] as the sun, [[H2535]] terrible [[H366]] as with banners? [[H1713]]

### 11
I went down [[H3381]] into [[H413]] the garden [[H1594]] of nuts [[H93]] to see [[H7200]] the fruits [[H3]] of the valley, [[H5158]] to see [[H7200]] whether the vine [[H1612]] flourished, [[H6524]] the pomegranates [[H7416]] budded. [[H5132]]

### 12
Or ever [[H3808]] I was aware, [[H3045]] my soul [[H5315]] made [[H7760]] me the chariots [[H4818]] of Amminadib. [[H5971]]

### 13
Return, [[H7725]] return, [[H7725]] O Shulamite; [[H7759]] return, [[H7725]] return, [[H7725]] that we may look [[H2372]] upon thee. What [[H4100]] will ye see [[H2372]] in the Shulamite? [[H7759]] As it were the company [[H4246]] of two armies. [[H4264]]
