### 1
Behold, [[H2005]] thou fair, [[H3303]] my love; [[H7474]] behold, [[H2005]] thou fair; [[H3303]] thou doves' [[H3123]] eyes [[H5869]] within [[H1157]] thy locks: [[H6777]] thy hair [[H8181]] as a flock [[H5739]] of goats, [[H5795]] that appear [[H1570]] from mount [[H2022]] Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 2
Thy teeth [[H8127]] like a flock [[H5739]] shorn, [[H7094]] which came up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the washing; [[H7367]] whereof every one [[H3605]] bear twins, [[H8382]] and none [[H369]] barren [[H7909]] among them. [[H7909]]

### 3
Thy lips [[H8193]] like a thread [[H2339]] of scarlet, [[H8144]] and thy speech [[H4057]] comely: [[H5000]] thy temples [[H7541]] like a piece [[H6400]] of a pomegranate [[H7416]] within [[H1157]] thy locks. [[H6777]]

### 4
Thy neck [[H6677]] like the tower [[H4026]] of David [[H1732]] builded [[H1129]] for an armoury, [[H8530]] whereon [[H5921]] there hang [[H8518]] a thousand [[H505]] bucklers, [[H4043]] all [[H3605]] shields [[H7982]] of mighty men. [[H1368]]

### 5
Thy two [[H8147]] breasts [[H7699]] like two [[H8147]] young [[H6082]] roes [[H6646]] that are twins, [[H8380]] which feed [[H7462]] among the lilies. [[H7799]]

### 6
Until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] break, [[H6315]] and the shadows [[H6752]] flee away, [[H5127]] I will get [[H1980]] me to [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] of myrrh, [[H4753]] and to [[H413]] the hill [[H1389]] of frankincense. [[H3828]]

### 7
Thou all [[H3605]] fair, [[H3303]] my love; [[H7474]] no [[H369]] spot [[H3971]] in thee. [[H3971]]

### 8
Come [[H935]] with [[H854]] me from Lebanon, [[H3844]] spouse, [[H3618]] with [[H854]] me from Lebanon: [[H3844]] look [[H7789]] from the top [[H7218]] of Amana, [[H549]] from the top [[H7218]] of Shenir [[H8149]] and Hermon, [[H2768]] from the lions' [[H738]] dens, [[H4585]] from the mountains [[H2042]] of the leopards. [[H5246]]

### 9
Thou hast ravished my heart, [[H3823]] my sister, [[H269]] spouse; [[H3618]] thou hast ravished my heart [[H3823]] with one [[H259]] of thine eyes, [[H5869]] with one [[H259]] chain [[H6060]] of thy neck. [[H6677]]

### 10
How [[H4100]] fair [[H3302]] is thy love, [[H1730]] my sister, [[H269]] spouse! [[H3618]] how [[H4100]] much better [[H2895]] is thy love [[H1730]] than wine! [[H3196]] and the smell [[H7381]] of thine ointments [[H8081]] than all [[H3605]] spices! [[H1314]]

### 11
Thy lips, [[H8193]] O spouse, [[H3618]] drop [[H5197]] the honeycomb: [[H5317]] honey [[H1706]] and milk [[H2461]] under [[H8478]] thy tongue; [[H3956]] and the smell [[H7381]] of thy garments [[H8008]] like the smell [[H7381]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 12
A garden [[H1588]] inclosed [[H5274]] my sister, [[H269]] spouse; [[H3618]] a spring [[H1530]] shut up, [[H5274]] a fountain [[H4599]] sealed. [[H2856]]

### 13
Thy plants [[H7973]] an orchard [[H6508]] of pomegranates, [[H7416]] with [[H5973]] pleasant [[H4022]] fruits; [[H6529]] camphire, [[H3724]] with [[H5973]] spikenard, [[H5373]]

### 14
Spikenard [[H5373]] and saffron; [[H3750]] calamus [[H7070]] and cinnamon, [[H7076]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] trees [[H6086]] of frankincense; [[H3828]] myrrh [[H4753]] and aloes, [[H174]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] the chief [[H7218]] spices: [[H1314]]

### 15
A fountain [[H4599]] of gardens, [[H1588]] a well [[H875]] of living [[H2416]] waters, [[H4325]] and streams [[H5140]] from [[H4480]] Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 16
Awake, [[H5782]] O north wind; [[H6828]] and come, [[H935]] thou south; [[H8486]] blow upon [[H6315]] my garden, [[H1588]] the spices [[H1314]] thereof may flow out. [[H5140]] Let my beloved [[H1730]] come [[H935]] into his garden, [[H1588]] and eat [[H398]] his pleasant [[H4022]] fruits. [[H6529]]
