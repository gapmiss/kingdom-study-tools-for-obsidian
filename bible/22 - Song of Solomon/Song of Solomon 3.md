### 1
By night [[H3915]] on [[H5921]] my bed [[H4904]] I sought [[H1245]] him whom my soul [[H5315]] loveth: [[H157]] I sought [[H1245]] him, but I found [[H4672]] him not. [[H4672]]

### 2
I will rise [[H6965]] now, [[H4994]] and go about [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] in the streets, [[H7784]] and in the broad ways [[H7339]] I will seek [[H1245]] him whom my soul [[H5315]] loveth: [[H157]] I sought [[H1245]] him, but I found [[H4672]] him not. [[H4672]]

### 3
The watchmen [[H8104]] that go about [[H5437]] the city [[H5892]] found [[H4672]] me: Saw [[H7200]]  ye [[H853]] him whom my soul [[H5315]] loveth? [[H157]]

### 4
but a little [[H4592]] that I passed [[H5674]] from them, but [[H5704]] I found [[H4672]] him whom my soul [[H5315]] loveth: [[H157]] I held [[H270]] him, and would not [[H3808]] let him go, [[H7503]] until [[H5704]] I had brought [[H935]] him into [[H413]] my mother's [[H517]] house, [[H1004]] and into [[H413]] the chamber [[H2315]] of her that conceived [[H2029]] me. [[H2029]]

### 5
I charge [[H7650]] you, O ye daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] by the roes, [[H6643]] and [[H176]] by the hinds [[H355]] of the field, [[H7704]] that ye stir not up, [[H5782]] nor [[H518]] awake [[H5782]] love, [[H160]] till [[H5704]] he please. [[H2654]]

### 6
Who [[H4310]] this [[H2063]] that cometh [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the wilderness [[H4057]] like pillars [[H8490]] of smoke, [[H6227]] perfumed [[H6999]] with myrrh [[H4753]] and frankincense, [[H3828]] with all [[H3605]] powders [[H81]] of the merchant? [[H7402]]

### 7
Behold [[H2009]] his bed, [[H4296]] which Solomon's; [[H8010]] threescore [[H8346]] valiant men [[H1368]] about [[H5439]] it, of the valiant [[H1368]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
They all [[H3605]] hold [[H270]] swords, [[H2719]] expert [[H3925]] in war: [[H4421]] every man [[H376]] his sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] his thigh [[H3409]] because of fear [[H6343]] in the night. [[H3915]]

### 9
King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] made [[H6213]] himself a chariot [[H668]] of the wood [[H6086]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 10
He made [[H6213]] the pillars [[H5982]] thereof silver, [[H3701]] the bottom [[H7507]] thereof gold, [[H2091]] the covering [[H4817]] of it purple, [[H713]] the midst [[H8432]] thereof being paved [[H7528]] love, [[H160]] for the daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 11
Go forth, [[H3318]] O ye daughters [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] and behold [[H7200]] king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] with the crown [[H5850]] wherewith his mother [[H517]] crowned [[H5849]] him in the day [[H3117]] of his espousals, [[H2861]] and in the day [[H3117]] of the gladness [[H8057]] of his heart.
