### 1
I [[H589]] the rose [[H2261]] of Sharon, [[H8289]] the lily [[H7799]] of the valleys. [[H6010]]

### 2
As the lily [[H7799]] among [[H996]] thorns, [[H2336]] so [[H3651]] my love [[H7474]] among [[H996]] the daughters. [[H1323]]

### 3
As the apple tree [[H8598]] among the trees [[H6086]] of the wood, [[H3293]] so [[H3651]] my beloved [[H1730]] among [[H996]] the sons. [[H1121]] I sat down [[H3427]] under his shadow [[H6738]] with great delight, [[H2530]] and his fruit [[H6529]] sweet [[H4966]] to my taste. [[H2441]]

### 4
He brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the banqueting [[H3196]] house, [[H1004]] and his banner [[H1714]] over [[H5921]] me love. [[H160]]

### 5
Stay [[H5564]] me with flagons, [[H809]] comfort [[H7502]] me with apples: [[H8598]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] sick [[H2470]] of love. [[H160]]

### 6
His left hand [[H8040]] under [[H8478]] my head, [[H7218]] and his right hand [[H3225]] doth embrace [[H2263]] me. [[H2263]]

### 7
I charge [[H7650]] you, O ye daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] by the roes, [[H6643]] and [[H176]] by the hinds [[H355]] of the field, [[H7704]] that ye stir not up, [[H5782]] nor [[H518]] awake [[H5782]] love, [[H160]] till he please. [[H2654]]

### 8
The voice [[H6963]] of my beloved! [[H1730]] behold, [[H2009]] he [[H2088]] cometh [[H935]] leaping [[H1801]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] skipping [[H7092]] upon [[H5921]] the hills. [[H1389]]

### 9
My beloved [[H1730]] is like [[H1819]] a roe [[H6643]] or [[H176]] a young [[H6082]] hart: [[H354]] behold, [[H2009]] he [[H2088]] standeth [[H5975]] behind [[H310]] our wall, [[H3796]] he looketh forth [[H7688]] at [[H4480]] the windows, [[H2474]] shewing himself [[H6692]] through [[H4480]] the lattice. [[H2762]]

### 10
My beloved [[H1730]] spake, [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto me, Rise up, [[H6965]] my love, [[H7474]] my fair one, [[H3303]] and come away. [[H1980]]

### 11
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] the winter [[H5638]] is past, [[H5674]] the rain [[H1653]] is over [[H2498]] gone; [[H1980]]

### 12
The flowers [[H5339]] appear [[H7200]] on the earth; [[H776]] the time [[H6256]] of the singing [[H2158]] is come, [[H5060]] and the voice [[H6963]] of the turtle [[H8449]] is heard [[H8085]] in our land; [[H776]]

### 13
The fig tree [[H8384]] putteth forth [[H2590]] her green figs, [[H6291]] and the vines [[H1612]] the tender grape [[H5563]] give [[H5414]] a smell. [[H7381]] Arise, [[H6965]] my love, [[H7474]] my fair one, [[H3303]] and come away. [[H1980]]

### 14
O my dove, [[H3123]] in the clefts [[H2288]] of the rock, [[H5553]] in the secret [[H5643]] of the stairs, [[H4095]] let me see [[H7200]] thy countenance, [[H4758]] let me hear [[H8085]] thy voice; [[H6963]] for [[H3588]] sweet [[H6156]] thy voice, [[H6963]] and thy countenance [[H4758]] comely. [[H5000]]

### 15
Take [[H270]] us the foxes, [[H7776]] the little [[H6996]] foxes, [[H7776]] that spoil [[H2254]] the vines: [[H3754]] for our vines [[H3754]] tender grapes. [[H5563]]

### 16
My beloved [[H1730]] mine, and I [[H589]] his: he feedeth [[H7462]] among the lilies. [[H7799]]

### 17
Until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] break, [[H6315]] and the shadows [[H6752]] flee away, [[H5127]] turn, [[H5437]] my beloved, [[H1730]] and be thou like [[H1819]] a roe [[H6643]] or [[H176]] a young [[H6082]] hart [[H354]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Bether. [[H1336]]
