### 1
Then answered [[H6030]] Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite, [[H8489]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Should a wise man [[H2450]] utter [[H6030]] vain [[H7307]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and fill [[H4390]] his belly [[H990]] with the east wind? [[H6921]]

### 3
Should he reason [[H3198]] with unprofitable [[H5532]] talk? [[H1697]] or with speeches [[H4405]] wherewith he can do no [[H3808]] good? [[H3276]]

### 4
Yea, [[H637]] thou [[H859]] castest off [[H6565]] fear, [[H3374]] and restrainest [[H1639]] prayer [[H7881]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H410]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] thy mouth [[H6310]] uttereth [[H502]] thine iniquity, [[H5771]] and thou choosest [[H977]] the tongue [[H3956]] of the crafty. [[H6175]]

### 6
Thine own mouth [[H6310]] condemneth [[H7561]] thee, and not [[H3808]] I: [[H589]] yea, thine own lips [[H8193]] testify [[H6030]] against thee. [[H6030]]

### 7
thou the first [[H7223]] man [[H120]] was born? [[H3205]] or wast thou made [[H2342]] before [[H6440]] the hills? [[H1389]]

### 8
Hast thou heard [[H8085]] the secret [[H5475]] of God? [[H433]] and dost thou restrain [[H1639]] wisdom [[H2451]] to [[H413]] thyself? [[H413]]

### 9
What [[H4100]] knowest [[H3045]] thou, that we know [[H3045]] not? [[H3808]] understandest [[H995]] thou, which [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] in [[H5973]] us? [[H5973]]

### 10
With us both [[H1571]] the grayheaded [[H7867]] and [[H1571]] very aged men, [[H3453]] much [[H3524]] elder [[H3117]] than thy father. [[H1]]

### 11
the consolations [[H8575]] of God [[H410]] small [[H4592]] with [[H4480]] thee? is there any secret [[H328]] thing [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] thee? [[H5973]]

### 12
Why [[H4100]] doth thine heart [[H3820]] carry thee away? [[H3947]] and what [[H4100]] do thy eyes [[H5869]] wink at, [[H7335]]

### 13
That [[H3588]] thou turnest [[H7725]] thy spirit [[H7307]] against [[H413]] God, [[H410]] and lettest words [[H4405]] go out [[H3318]] of thy mouth? [[H6310]]

### 14
What [[H4100]] man, [[H582]] that [[H3588]] he should be clean? [[H2135]] and born [[H3205]] of a woman, [[H802]] that [[H3588]] he should be righteous? [[H6663]]

### 15
Behold, [[H2005]] he putteth no trust [[H539]] in his saints; [[H6918]] yea, the heavens [[H8064]] are not [[H3808]] clean [[H2141]] in his sight. [[H5869]]

### 16
How much more [[H637]] abominable [[H8581]] and filthy [[H444]] man, [[H376]] which drinketh [[H8354]] iniquity [[H5766]] like water? [[H4325]]

### 17
I will shew [[H2331]] thee, hear [[H8085]] me; and that [[H2088]] I have seen [[H2372]] I will declare; [[H5608]]

### 18
Which [[H834]] wise [[H2450]] men have told [[H5046]] from their fathers, [[H1]] and have not [[H3808]] hid [[H3582]]

### 19
Unto whom alone [[H905]] the earth [[H776]] was given, [[H5414]] and no [[H3808]] stranger [[H2114]] passed [[H5674]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 20
The wicked man [[H7563]] travaileth with [[H2342]] pain all [[H3605]] days, [[H3117]] and the number [[H4557]] of years [[H8141]] is hidden [[H6845]] to the oppressor. [[H6184]]

### 21
A dreadful [[H6343]] sound [[H6963]] in his ears: [[H241]] in prosperity [[H7965]] the destroyer [[H7703]] shall come upon [[H935]] him. [[H935]]

### 22
He believeth [[H539]] not [[H3808]] that he shall return [[H7725]] out of [[H4480]] darkness, [[H2822]] and he [[H1931]] is waited for [[H6822]] of [[H413]] the sword. [[H2719]]

### 23
He [[H1931]] wandereth abroad [[H5074]] for bread, [[H3899]] Where [[H346]] he knoweth [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of darkness [[H2822]] is ready [[H3559]] at his hand. [[H3027]]

### 24
Trouble [[H6862]] and anguish [[H4691]] shall make him afraid; [[H1204]] they shall prevail against [[H8630]] him, as a king [[H4428]] ready [[H6264]] to the battle. [[H3593]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] he stretcheth out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] against [[H413]] God, [[H410]] and strengtheneth himself [[H1396]] against [[H413]] the Almighty. [[H7706]]

### 26
He runneth [[H7323]] upon [[H413]] him, on neck, [[H6677]] upon the thick [[H5672]] bosses [[H1354]] of his bucklers: [[H4043]]

### 27
Because [[H3588]] he covereth [[H3680]] his face [[H6440]] with his fatness, [[H2459]] and maketh [[H6213]] collops of fat [[H6371]] on [[H5921]] flanks. [[H3689]]

### 28
And he dwelleth in [[H7931]] desolate [[H3582]] cities, [[H5892]] in houses which [[H1004]] no [[H3808]] man inhabiteth, [[H3427]] which [[H834]] are ready [[H6257]] to become heaps. [[H1530]]

### 29
He shall not [[H3808]] be rich, [[H6238]] neither [[H3808]] shall his substance [[H2428]] continue, [[H6965]] neither [[H3808]] shall he prolong [[H5186]] the perfection [[H4512]] thereof upon the earth. [[H776]]

### 30
He shall not [[H3808]] depart [[H5493]] out of [[H4480]] darkness; [[H2822]] the flame [[H7957]] shall dry up [[H3001]] his branches, [[H3127]] and by the breath [[H7307]] of his mouth [[H6310]] shall he go away. [[H5493]]

### 31
Let not [[H408]] him that is deceived [[H8582]] trust [[H539]] in vanity: [[H7723]] for [[H3588]] vanity [[H7723]] shall be [[H1961]] his recompence. [[H8545]]

### 32
It shall be accomplished [[H4390]] before [[H3808]] his time, [[H3117]] and his branch [[H3712]] shall not [[H3808]] be green. [[H7488]]

### 33
He shall shake off [[H2554]] his unripe grape [[H1154]] as the vine, [[H1612]] and shall cast off [[H7993]] his flower [[H5328]] as the olive. [[H2132]]

### 34
For [[H3588]] the congregation [[H5712]] of hypocrites [[H2611]] desolate, [[H1565]] and fire [[H784]] shall consume [[H398]] the tabernacles [[H168]] of bribery. [[H7810]]

### 35
They conceive [[H2029]] mischief, [[H5999]] and bring forth [[H3205]] vanity, [[H205]] and their belly [[H990]] prepareth [[H3559]] deceit. [[H4820]]
