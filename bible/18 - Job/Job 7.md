[[Job 6|←]] • [[Job 8|→]]

### 1
not [[H3808]] an appointed time [[H6635]] to man [[H582]] upon [[H5921]] earth? [[H776]] his days [[H3117]] also like the days [[H3117]] of an hireling? [[H7916]]

### 2
As a servant [[H5650]] earnestly desireth [[H7602]] the shadow, [[H6738]] and as an hireling [[H7916]] looketh for [[H6960]] his work: [[H6467]]

### 3
So [[H3651]] am I made to possess [[H5157]] months [[H3391]] of vanity, [[H7723]] and wearisome [[H5999]] nights [[H3915]] are appointed [[H4487]] to me. [[H4487]]

### 4
When [[H518]] I lie down, [[H7901]] I say, [[H559]] When [[H4970]] shall I arise, [[H6965]] and the night [[H6153]] be gone? [[H4059]] and I am full [[H7646]] of tossings to and fro [[H5076]] unto [[H5704]] the dawning of the day. [[H5399]]

### 5
My flesh [[H1320]] is clothed [[H3847]] with worms [[H7415]] and clods [[H1487]] of dust; [[H6083]] my skin [[H5785]] is broken, [[H7280]] and become loathsome. [[H3988]]

### 6
My days [[H3117]] are swifter [[H7043]] than [[H4480]] a weaver's shuttle, [[H708]] and are spent [[H3615]] without [[H657]] hope. [[H8615]]

### 7
O remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] my life [[H2416]] wind: [[H7307]] mine eye [[H5869]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H7725]] see [[H7200]] good. [[H2896]]

### 8
The eye [[H5869]] of him that hath seen [[H7210]] me shall see [[H7789]] me no [[H3808]] thine eyes [[H5869]] upon me, and I not. [[H369]]

### 9
the cloud [[H6051]] is consumed [[H3615]] and vanisheth away: [[H1980]] so [[H3651]] he that goeth down [[H3381]] to the grave [[H7585]] shall come up [[H5927]] no [[H3808]]

### 10
He shall return [[H7725]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] to his house, [[H1004]] neither [[H3808]] shall his place [[H4725]] know [[H5234]] him any more. [[H5750]]

### 11
Therefore [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will not [[H3808]] refrain [[H2820]] my mouth; [[H6310]] I will speak [[H1696]] in the anguish [[H6862]] of my spirit; [[H7307]] I will complain [[H7878]] in the bitterness [[H4751]] of my soul. [[H5315]]

### 12
I [[H589]] a sea, [[H3220]] or [[H518]] a whale, [[H8577]] that [[H3588]] thou settest [[H7760]] a watch [[H4929]] over [[H5921]] me? [[H5921]]

### 13
When [[H3588]] I say, [[H559]] My bed [[H6210]] shall comfort [[H5162]] me, my couch [[H4904]] shall ease [[H5375]] my complaint; [[H7879]]

### 14
Then thou scarest [[H2865]] me with dreams, [[H2472]] and terrifiest [[H1204]] me through visions: [[H2384]]

### 15
So that my soul [[H5315]] chooseth [[H977]] strangling, [[H4267]] death [[H4194]] rather than my life. [[H6106]]

### 16
I loathe [[H3988]] I would not [[H3808]] live [[H2421]] alway: [[H5769]] let me alone; [[H2308]] for [[H3588]] my days [[H3117]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 17
What [[H4100]] man, [[H582]] that [[H3588]] thou shouldest magnify [[H1431]] him? and that [[H3588]] thou shouldest set [[H7896]] thine heart [[H3820]] upon [[H413]] him? [[H413]]

### 18
And thou shouldest visit [[H6485]] him every morning, [[H1242]] try [[H974]] him every moment? [[H7281]]

### 19
How long [[H4100]] wilt thou not [[H3808]] depart [[H8159]] from [[H4480]] me, nor [[H3808]] let me alone [[H7503]] till [[H5704]] I swallow down [[H1104]] my spittle? [[H7536]]

### 20
I have sinned; [[H2398]] what [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6466]] unto thee, O thou preserver [[H5341]] of men? [[H120]] why [[H4100]] hast thou set [[H7760]] me as a mark [[H4645]] against thee, so that I am [[H1961]] a burden [[H4853]] to [[H5921]] myself? [[H5921]]

### 21
And why [[H4100]] dost thou not [[H3808]] pardon [[H5375]] my transgression, [[H6588]] and take away [[H5674]] mine iniquity? [[H5771]] for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] shall I sleep [[H7901]] in the dust; [[H6083]] and thou shalt seek me in the morning, [[H7836]] but I not [[H369]]
