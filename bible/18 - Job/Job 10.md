### 1
My soul [[H5315]] is weary [[H5354]] of my life; [[H2416]] I will leave [[H5800]] my complaint [[H7879]] upon [[H5921]] myself; I will speak [[H1696]] in the bitterness [[H4751]] of my soul. [[H5315]]

### 2
I will say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H433]] Do not [[H408]] condemn [[H7561]] me; shew [[H3045]] me wherefore [[H5921]] thou contendest [[H7378]] with me. [[H7378]]

### 3
good [[H2896]] unto thee that [[H3588]] thou shouldest oppress, [[H6231]] that [[H3588]] thou shouldest despise [[H3988]] the work [[H3018]] of thine hands, [[H3709]] and shine [[H3313]] upon [[H5921]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the wicked? [[H7563]]

### 4
Hast thou eyes [[H5869]] of flesh? [[H1320]] or [[H518]] seest [[H7200]] thou as man [[H582]] seeth? [[H7200]]

### 5
thy days [[H3117]] as the days [[H3117]] of man? [[H582]] thy years [[H8141]] as man's [[H1397]] days, [[H3117]]

### 6
That [[H3588]] thou inquirest [[H1245]] after mine iniquity, [[H5771]] and searchest [[H1875]] after my sin? [[H2403]]

### 7
Thou knowest [[H1847]] that [[H3588]] I am not [[H3808]] wicked; [[H7561]] and none [[H369]] that can deliver [[H5337]] out of thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 8
Thine hands [[H3027]] have made [[H6087]] me and fashioned [[H6213]] me together [[H3162]] round about; [[H5439]] yet thou dost destroy [[H1104]] me. [[H1104]]

### 9
Remember, [[H2142]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] that [[H3588]] thou hast made [[H6213]] me as the clay; [[H2563]] and wilt thou bring [[H7725]] me into dust [[H6083]]  again? [[H413]]

### 10
Hast thou not [[H3808]] poured me out [[H5413]] as milk, [[H2461]] and curdled [[H7087]] me like cheese? [[H1385]]

### 11
Thou hast clothed [[H3847]] me with skin [[H5785]] and flesh, [[H1320]] and hast fenced [[H7753]] me with bones [[H6106]] and sinews. [[H1517]]

### 12
Thou hast granted [[H6213]] me life [[H2416]] and favour, [[H2617]] and thy visitation [[H6486]] hath preserved [[H8104]] my spirit. [[H7307]]

### 13
And these [[H428]] hast thou hid [[H6845]] in thine heart: [[H3824]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 14
If [[H518]] I sin, [[H2398]] then thou markest [[H8104]] me, and thou wilt not [[H3808]] acquit [[H5352]] me from mine iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 15
If [[H518]] I be wicked, [[H7561]] woe [[H480]] unto me; and I be righteous, [[H6663]] will I not [[H3808]] lift up [[H5375]] my head. [[H7218]] full [[H7649]] of confusion; [[H7036]] therefore see [[H7200]] thou mine affliction; [[H6040]]

### 16
For it increaseth. [[H1342]] Thou huntest [[H6679]] me as a fierce lion: [[H7826]] and again [[H7725]] thou shewest thyself marvellous [[H6381]] upon me. [[H6381]]

### 17
Thou renewest [[H2318]] thy witnesses [[H5707]] against [[H5048]] me, and increasest [[H7235]] thine indignation [[H3708]] upon me; [[H5978]] changes [[H2487]] and war [[H6635]] against [[H5973]] me. [[H5973]]

### 18
Wherefore [[H4100]] then hast thou brought me forth [[H3318]] out of the womb? [[H7358]] Oh that I had given up the ghost, [[H1478]] and no [[H3808]] eye [[H5869]] had seen [[H7200]] me! [[H7200]]

### 19
I should have been [[H1961]] as though [[H834]] I had not [[H3808]] been; [[H1961]] I should have been carried [[H2986]] from the womb [[H990]] to the grave. [[H6913]]

### 20
not [[H3808]] my days [[H3117]] few? [[H4592]] cease [[H2308]] let me alone, [[H7896]] that I may take comfort [[H1082]] a little, [[H4592]]

### 21
Before [[H2962]] I go [[H1980]] I shall not [[H3808]] return, [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of darkness [[H2822]] and the shadow of death; [[H6757]]

### 22
A land [[H776]] of darkness, [[H5890]] as [[H3644]] darkness [[H652]] of the shadow of death, [[H6757]] without [[H3808]] any order, [[H5468]] and the light [[H3313]] as [[H3644]] darkness. [[H652]]
