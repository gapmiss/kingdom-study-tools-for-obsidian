---

### 1
Canst thou draw out [[H4900]] leviathan [[H3882]] with an hook? [[H2443]] or his tongue [[H3956]] with a cord [[H2256]] thou lettest down? [[H8257]]

### 2
Canst thou put [[H7760]] an hook [[H100]] into his nose? [[H639]] or bore [[H5344]] his jaw [[H3895]] through with a thorn? [[H2336]]

### 3
Will he make many [[H7235]] supplications [[H8469]] unto [[H413]] thee? will he speak [[H1696]] soft [[H7390]] unto [[H413]] thee? [[H413]]

### 4
Will he make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] thee? wilt thou take [[H3947]] him for a servant [[H5650]] for ever? [[H5769]]

### 5
Wilt thou play [[H7832]] with him as a bird? [[H6833]] or wilt thou bind [[H7194]] him for thy maidens? [[H5291]]

### 6
Shall the companions [[H2271]] make a banquet [[H3738]] of [[H5921]] him? shall they part [[H2673]] him among [[H996]] the merchants? [[H3669]]

### 7
Canst thou fill [[H4390]] his skin [[H5785]] with barbed irons? [[H7905]] or his head [[H7218]] with fish [[H1709]] spears? [[H6767]]

### 8
Lay [[H7760]] thine hand [[H3709]] upon [[H5921]] him, remember [[H2142]] the battle, [[H4421]] do no [[H408]] more. [[H3254]]

### 9
Behold, [[H2005]] the hope [[H8431]] of him is in vain: [[H3576]] shall not be cast down [[H2904]] even [[H1571]] at [[H413]] the sight [[H4758]] of him? [[H4758]]

### 10
None [[H3808]] fierce [[H393]] that [[H3588]] dare stir him up: [[H5782]] who [[H4310]] then is able to stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] me? [[H6440]]

### 11
Who [[H4310]] hath prevented [[H6923]] me, that I should repay [[H7999]] under [[H8478]] the whole [[H3605]] heaven [[H8064]] is mine. [[H8064]]

### 12
I will not [[H3808]] conceal [[H2790]] his parts, [[H905]] nor [[H1697]] his power, [[H1369]] nor his comely [[H2433]] proportion. [[H6187]]

### 13
Who [[H4310]] can discover [[H1540]] the face [[H6440]] of his garment? [[H3830]] who [[H4310]] can come [[H935]] with his double [[H3718]] bridle? [[H7448]]

### 14
Who [[H4310]] can open [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of his face? [[H6440]] his teeth [[H8127]] terrible [[H367]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 15
scales [[H4043]] pride, [[H1346]] shut up together [[H5462]] a close [[H6862]] seal. [[H2368]]

### 16
One [[H259]] is so near [[H5066]] to another, [[H259]] that no [[H3808]] air [[H7307]] can come [[H935]] between [[H996]] them. [[H996]]

### 17
They are joined [[H1692]] one [[H376]] to another, [[H251]] they stick together, [[H3920]] that they cannot [[H3808]] be sundered. [[H6504]]

### 18
By his neesings [[H5846]] a light [[H216]] doth shine, [[H1984]] and his eyes [[H5869]] like the eyelids [[H6079]] of the morning. [[H7837]]

### 19
Out of his mouth [[H6310]] go [[H1980]] burning lamps, [[H3940]] sparks [[H3590]] of fire [[H784]] leap out. [[H4422]]

### 20
Out of his nostrils [[H5156]] goeth [[H3318]] smoke, [[H6227]] as of a seething [[H5301]] pot [[H1731]] or caldron. [[H100]]

### 21
His breath [[H5315]] kindleth [[H3857]] coals, [[H1513]] and a flame [[H3851]] goeth out [[H3318]] of his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 22
In his neck [[H6677]] remaineth [[H3885]] strength, [[H5797]] and sorrow [[H1670]] is turned into joy [[H1750]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 23
The flakes [[H4651]] of his flesh [[H1320]] are joined together: [[H1692]] they are firm [[H3332]] in [[H5921]] themselves; they cannot [[H1077]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 24
His heart [[H3820]] is as firm [[H3332]] as [[H3644]] a stone; [[H68]] yea, as hard [[H3332]] as a piece [[H6400]] of the nether [[H8482]]

### 25
When he raiseth up [[H7613]] himself, the mighty [[H410]] are afraid: [[H1481]] by reason of breakings [[H7667]] they purify themselves. [[H2398]]

### 26
The sword [[H2719]] of him that layeth [[H5381]] at him cannot [[H1097]] hold: [[H6965]] the spear, [[H2595]] the dart, [[H4551]] nor the habergeon. [[H8302]]

### 27
He esteemeth [[H2803]] iron [[H1270]] as straw, [[H8401]] brass [[H5154]] as rotten [[H7539]] wood. [[H6086]]

### 28
The arrow [[H1121]] cannot [[H3808]] make him flee: [[H1272]] slingstones [[H68]] are turned [[H2015]] with him into stubble. [[H7179]]

### 29
Darts [[H8455]] are counted [[H2803]] as stubble: [[H7179]] he laugheth [[H7832]] at the shaking [[H7494]] of a spear. [[H3591]]

### 30
Sharp [[H2303]] stones [[H2789]] under [[H8478]] him: he spreadeth [[H7502]] sharp pointed things [[H2742]] upon [[H5921]] the mire. [[H2916]]

### 31
He maketh the deep [[H4688]] to boil [[H7570]] like a pot: [[H5518]] he maketh [[H7760]] the sea [[H3220]] like a pot of ointment. [[H4841]]

### 32
He maketh a path [[H5410]] to shine [[H215]] after [[H310]] him; would think [[H2803]] the deep [[H8415]] hoary. [[H7872]]

### 33
Upon [[H5921]] earth [[H6083]] there is not [[H369]] his like, [[H4915]] who is made [[H6213]] without [[H1097]] fear. [[H2844]]

### 34
He beholdeth [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] he [[H1931]] a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of pride. [[H7830]]
