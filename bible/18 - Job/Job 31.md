### 1
I made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with mine eyes; [[H5869]] why [[H4100]] then should I think [[H995]] upon [[H5921]] a maid? [[H1330]]

### 2
For what [[H4100]] portion [[H2506]] of God [[H433]] from above? [[H4605]] and inheritance [[H5159]] of the Almighty [[H7706]] from on high? [[H4791]]

### 3
not [[H3808]] destruction [[H343]] to the wicked? [[H5767]] and a strange [[H5235]] to the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity? [[H205]]

### 4
Doth not [[H3808]] he [[H1931]] see [[H7200]] my ways, [[H1870]] and count [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] my steps? [[H6806]]

### 5
If [[H518]] I have walked [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] vanity, [[H7723]] or if my foot [[H7272]] hath hasted [[H2363]] to [[H5921]] deceit; [[H4820]]

### 6
Let me be weighed [[H8254]] in an even [[H6664]] balance, [[H3976]] that God [[H433]] may know [[H3045]] mine integrity. [[H8538]]

### 7
If [[H518]] my step [[H838]] hath turned out [[H5186]] of [[H4480]] the way, [[H1870]] and mine heart [[H3820]] walked [[H1980]] after [[H310]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] and if any blot [[H3971]] hath cleaved [[H1692]] to mine hands; [[H3709]]

### 8
let me sow, [[H2232]] and let another [[H312]] eat; [[H398]] yea, let my offspring [[H6631]] be rooted out. [[H8327]]

### 9
If [[H518]] mine heart [[H3820]] have been deceived [[H6601]] by [[H5921]] a woman, [[H802]] or I have laid wait [[H693]] at [[H5921]] my neighbour's [[H7453]] door; [[H6607]]

### 10
let my wife [[H802]] grind [[H2912]] unto another, [[H312]] and let others [[H312]] bow down [[H3766]] upon [[H5921]] her. [[H5921]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] an heinous crime; [[H2154]] yea, it [[H1931]] an iniquity [[H5771]] the judges. [[H6414]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] a fire [[H784]] consumeth [[H398]] to [[H5704]] destruction, [[H11]] and would root out [[H8327]] all [[H3605]] mine increase. [[H8393]]

### 13
If [[H518]] I did despise [[H3988]] the cause [[H4941]] of my manservant [[H5650]] or of my maidservant, [[H519]] when they contended [[H7378]] with [[H5978]] me; [[H5978]]

### 14
What [[H4100]] then shall I do [[H6213]] when [[H3588]] God [[H410]] riseth up? [[H6965]] and when [[H3588]] he visiteth, [[H6485]] what [[H4100]] shall I answer [[H7725]] him? [[H7725]]

### 15
Did not [[H3808]] he that made [[H6213]] me in the womb [[H990]] make [[H6213]] him? and did not one [[H259]] fashion [[H3559]] us in the womb? [[H7358]]

### 16
If [[H518]] I have withheld [[H4513]] the poor [[H1800]] from desire, [[H2656]] or have caused the eyes [[H5869]] of the widow [[H490]] to fail; [[H3615]]

### 17
Or have eaten [[H398]] my morsel [[H6595]] myself alone, [[H905]] and the fatherless [[H3490]] hath not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] thereof; [[H4480]]

### 18
(For [[H3588]] from my youth [[H5271]] he was brought up [[H1431]] with me, as a father, [[H1]] and I have guided [[H5148]] her from my mother's [[H517]] womb;) [[H990]]

### 19
If [[H518]] I have seen [[H7200]] any perish [[H6]] for want [[H1097]] of clothing, [[H3830]] or any poor [[H34]] without [[H369]] covering; [[H3682]]

### 20
If [[H518]] his loins [[H2504]] have not [[H3808]] blessed [[H1288]] me, and he were warmed [[H2552]] with the fleece [[H1488]] of my sheep; [[H3532]]

### 21
If [[H518]] I have lifted up [[H5130]] my hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] when [[H3588]] I saw [[H7200]] my help [[H5833]] in the gate: [[H8179]]

### 22
let mine arm [[H3802]] fall [[H5307]] from my shoulder blade, [[H7929]] and mine arm [[H248]] be broken [[H7665]] from the bone. [[H7070]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] destruction [[H343]] God [[H410]] a terror [[H6343]] to [[H413]] me, and by reason of his highness [[H7613]] I could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] endure. [[H3808]]

### 24
If [[H518]] I have made [[H7760]] gold [[H2091]] my hope, [[H3689]] or have said [[H559]] to the fine gold, [[H3800]] my confidence; [[H4009]]

### 25
If [[H518]] I rejoiced [[H8055]] because [[H3588]] my wealth [[H2428]] great, [[H7227]] and because [[H3588]] mine hand [[H3027]] had gotten [[H4672]] much; [[H3524]]

### 26
If [[H518]] I beheld [[H7200]] the sun [[H216]] when [[H3588]] it shined, [[H1984]] or the moon [[H3394]] walking [[H1980]] brightness; [[H3368]]

### 27
And my heart [[H3820]] hath been secretly [[H5643]] enticed, [[H6601]] or my mouth [[H6310]] hath kissed [[H5401]] my hand: [[H3027]]

### 28
This [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] an iniquity [[H5771]] the judge: [[H6416]] for [[H3588]] I should have denied [[H3584]] the God [[H410]] above. [[H4605]]

### 29
If [[H518]] I rejoiced [[H8055]] at the destruction [[H6365]] of him that hated [[H8130]] me, or lifted up myself [[H5782]] when [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] found [[H4672]] him: [[H4672]]

### 30
Neither [[H3808]] have I suffered [[H5414]] my mouth [[H2441]] to sin [[H2398]] by wishing [[H7592]] a curse [[H423]] to his soul. [[H5315]]

### 31
If [[H518]] the men [[H4962]] of my tabernacle [[H168]] said [[H559]] not, [[H3808]] Oh that [[H4310]] we had [[H5414]] of his flesh! [[H1320]] we cannot [[H3808]] be satisfied. [[H7646]]

### 32
The stranger [[H1616]] did not [[H3808]] lodge [[H3885]] in the street: [[H2351]] I opened [[H6605]] my doors [[H1817]] to the traveller. [[H734]]

### 33
If [[H518]] I covered [[H3680]] my transgressions [[H6588]] as Adam, [[H121]] by hiding [[H2934]] mine iniquity [[H5771]] in my bosom: [[H2243]]

### 34
Did I fear [[H6206]] a great [[H7227]] multitude, [[H1995]] or did the contempt [[H937]] of families [[H4940]] terrify [[H2865]] me, that I kept silence, [[H1826]] went not out [[H3318]] of the door? [[H6607]]

### 35
Oh that [[H5414]] one [[H4310]] would hear [[H8085]] me! behold, [[H2005]] my desire [[H8420]] the Almighty [[H7706]] would answer [[H6030]] me, and mine adversary [[H376]] had written [[H3789]] a book. [[H5612]]

### 36
Surely [[H518]] I would take [[H5375]] it upon [[H5921]] my shoulder, [[H7926]] bind [[H6029]] it a crown [[H5850]] to me. [[H5850]]

### 37
I would declare [[H5046]] unto him the number [[H4557]] of my steps; [[H6806]] as [[H3644]] a prince [[H5057]] would I go near unto [[H7126]] him. [[H7126]]

### 38
If [[H518]] my land [[H127]] cry [[H2199]] against [[H5921]] me, or that the furrows [[H8525]] likewise [[H3162]] thereof complain; [[H1058]]

### 39
If [[H518]] I have eaten [[H398]] the fruits [[H3581]] thereof without [[H1097]] money, [[H3701]] or have caused the owners [[H1167]] thereof to lose [[H5301]] their life: [[H5315]]

### 40
Let thistles [[H2336]] grow [[H3318]] instead [[H8478]] of wheat, [[H2406]] and cockle [[H890]] instead [[H8478]] of barley. [[H8184]] The words [[H1697]] of Job [[H347]] are ended. [[H8552]]
