Then answered [[H6030]] Bildad [[H1085]] the Shuhite, [[H7747]] and said, [[H559]]

How long [[H5704]] ye make [[H7760]] an end [[H7078]] of words? [[H4405]] mark, [[H995]] and afterwards [[H310]] we will speak. [[H1696]]

He teareth [[H2963]] himself [[H5315]] in his anger: [[H639]] shall the earth [[H776]] be forsaken [[H5800]] for [[H4616]] thee? and shall the rock [[H6697]] be removed [[H6275]] out of his place? [[H4725]]

Yea, [[H1571]] the light [[H216]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be put out, [[H1846]] and the spark [[H7632]] of his fire [[H784]] shall not [[H3808]] shine. [[H5050]]

The light [[H216]] shall be dark [[H2821]] in his tabernacle, [[H168]] and his candle [[H5216]] shall be put out [[H1846]] with [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 7
The steps [[H6806]] of his strength [[H202]] shall be straitened, [[H3334]] and his own counsel [[H6098]] shall cast him down. [[H7993]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] he is cast [[H7971]] into a net [[H7568]] by his own feet, [[H7272]] and he walketh [[H1980]] upon [[H5921]] a snare. [[H7639]]

### 9
The gin [[H6341]] shall take [[H270]] by the heel, [[H6119]] the robber [[H6782]] shall prevail [[H2388]] against [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 10
The snare [[H2256]] laid [[H2934]] for him in the ground, [[H776]] and a trap [[H4434]] for him in [[H5921]] the way. [[H5410]]

Terrors [[H1091]] shall make him afraid [[H1204]] on every side, [[H5439]] and shall drive [[H6327]] him to his feet. [[H7272]]

### 12
His strength [[H202]] shall be [[H1961]] hungerbitten, [[H7457]] and destruction [[H343]] ready [[H3559]] at his side. [[H6763]]

### 13
It shall devour [[H398]] the strength [[H905]] of his skin: [[H5785]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of death [[H4194]] shall devour [[H398]] his strength. [[H905]]

### 14
His confidence [[H4009]] shall be rooted out [[H5423]] of his tabernacle, [[H168]] and it shall bring [[H6805]] him to the king [[H4428]] of terrors. [[H1091]]

### 15
It shall dwell [[H7931]] in his tabernacle, [[H168]] because none [[H1097]] of his: brimstone [[H1614]] shall be scattered [[H2219]] upon [[H5921]] his habitation. [[H5116]]

### 16
His roots [[H8328]] shall be dried up [[H3001]] beneath, [[H8478]] and above [[H4605]] shall his branch [[H7105]] be cut off. [[H5243]]

### 17
His remembrance [[H2143]] shall perish [[H6]] from [[H4480]] the earth, [[H776]] and he shall have no [[H3808]] name [[H8034]] in [[H5921]] the street. [[H6440]]

### 18
He shall be driven [[H1920]] from light [[H216]] into [[H413]] darkness, [[H2822]] and chased [[H5074]] out of the world. [[H8398]]

He shall neither [[H3808]] have son [[H5209]] nor [[H3808]] nephew [[H5220]] among his people, [[H5971]] nor [[H369]] any remaining [[H8300]] in his dwellings. [[H4033]]

### 20
They that come after [[H314]] shall be astonied [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] his day, [[H3117]] as they that went before [[H6931]] were affrighted. [[H270]]

### 21
Surely [[H389]] such [[H428]] the dwellings [[H4908]] of the wicked, [[H5767]] and this [[H2088]] the place [[H4725]] knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] God. [[H410]]
