### 1
But Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Oh that [[H3863]] my grief [[H3708]] were throughly [[H8254]] weighed, [[H8254]] and my calamity [[H1942]] laid [[H5375]] in the balances [[H3976]] together! [[H3162]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] it would be heavier [[H3513]] than the sand [[H2344]] of the sea: [[H3220]] therefore [[H5921]] my words [[H1697]] are swallowed up. [[H3886]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] the arrows [[H2671]] of the Almighty [[H7706]] within [[H5978]] me, the poison [[H2534]] whereof [[H834]] drinketh up [[H8354]] my spirit: [[H7307]] the terrors [[H1161]] of God [[H433]] do set themselves in array against [[H6186]] me. [[H6186]]

### 5
Doth the wild ass [[H6501]] bray [[H5101]] when he hath grass? [[H1877]] or [[H518]] loweth [[H1600]] the ox [[H7794]] over [[H5921]] his fodder? [[H1098]]

### 6
Can that which is unsavoury [[H8602]] be eaten [[H398]] without [[H1097]] salt? [[H4417]] or [[H518]] is there [[H3426]] taste [[H2940]] in the white [[H7388]] of an egg? [[H2495]]

### 7
The things [[H1992]] my soul [[H5315]] refused [[H3985]] to touch [[H5060]] as my sorrowful [[H1741]] meat. [[H3899]]

### 8
Oh that [[H4310]] I might [[H5414]] have [[H935]] my request; [[H7596]] and that God [[H433]] would grant [[H5414]] the thing that I long for! [[H8615]]

### 9
Even that it would please [[H2974]] God [[H433]] to destroy [[H1792]] me; that he would let loose [[H5425]] his hand, [[H3027]] and cut me off! [[H1214]]

### 10
Then should I yet [[H5750]] have [[H1961]] comfort; [[H5165]] yea, I would harden [[H5539]] myself in sorrow: [[H2427]] let him not [[H3808]] spare; [[H2550]] for [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] concealed [[H3582]] the words [[H561]] of the Holy One. [[H6918]]

### 11
What [[H4100]] my strength, [[H3581]] that [[H3588]] I should hope? [[H3176]] and what [[H4100]] mine end, [[H7093]] that [[H3588]] I should prolong [[H748]] my life? [[H5315]]

### 12
my strength [[H3581]] the strength [[H3581]] of stones? [[H68]] or my flesh [[H1320]] of brass? [[H5153]]

### 13
not [[H369]] my help [[H5833]] in me? and is wisdom [[H8454]] driven quite [[H5080]] from [[H4480]] me? [[H4480]]

### 14
To him that is afflicted [[H4523]] pity [[H2617]] from his friend; [[H7453]] but he forsaketh [[H5800]] the fear [[H3374]] of the Almighty. [[H7706]]

### 15
My brethren [[H251]] have dealt deceitfully [[H898]] as [[H3644]] a brook, [[H5158]] as the stream [[H650]] of brooks [[H5158]] they pass away; [[H5674]]

### 16
Which are blackish [[H6937]] by reason of [[H4480]] the ice, [[H7140]] wherein [[H5921]] the snow [[H7950]] is hid: [[H5956]]

### 17
What time [[H6256]] they wax warm, [[H2215]] they vanish: [[H6789]] when it is hot, [[H2527]] they are consumed out [[H1846]] of their place. [[H4725]]

### 18
The paths [[H734]] of their way [[H1870]] are turned aside; [[H3943]] they go [[H5927]] to nothing, [[H8414]] and perish. [[H6]]

### 19
The troops [[H734]] of Tema [[H8485]] looked, [[H5027]] the companies [[H1979]] of Sheba [[H7614]] waited [[H6960]] for them. [[H3926]]

### 20
They were confounded [[H954]] because [[H3588]] they had hoped; [[H982]] they came [[H935]] thither, [[H5704]] and were ashamed. [[H2659]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] ye are [[H1961]] nothing; [[H3808]] ye see [[H7200]] casting down, [[H2866]] and are afraid. [[H3372]]

### 22
Did [[H3588]] I say, [[H559]] Bring [[H3051]] unto me? or, Give a reward [[H7809]] for [[H1157]] me of your substance? [[H3581]]

### 23
Or, Deliver [[H4422]] me from the enemy's [[H6862]] hand? [[H3027]] or, Redeem [[H6299]] me from the hand [[H3027]] of the mighty? [[H6184]]

### 24
Teach [[H3384]] me, and I [[H589]] will hold my tongue: [[H2790]] and cause me to understand [[H995]] wherein [[H4100]] I have erred. [[H7686]]

### 25
How [[H4100]] forcible [[H4834]] are right [[H3476]] words! [[H561]] but what [[H4100]] doth your arguing [[H3198]] reprove? [[H3198]]

### 26
Do ye imagine [[H2803]] to reprove [[H3198]] words, [[H4405]] and the speeches [[H561]] of one that is desperate, [[H2976]] as wind? [[H7307]]

### 27
Yea, [[H637]] ye overwhelm [[H5307]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and ye dig [[H3738]] for [[H5921]] your friend. [[H7453]]

### 28
Now [[H6258]] therefore be content, [[H2974]] look [[H6437]] upon me; for evident [[H6440]] unto [[H5921]] you if [[H518]] I lie. [[H3576]]

### 29
Return, [[H7725]] I pray you, [[H4994]] let it not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] iniquity; [[H5766]] yea, return again, [[H7725]] my righteousness [[H6664]] in it. [[H6664]]

### 30
Is there [[H3426]] iniquity [[H5766]] in my tongue? [[H3956]] cannot [[H3808]] my taste [[H2441]] discern [[H995]] perverse things? [[H1942]]
