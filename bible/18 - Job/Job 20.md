### 1
Then answered [[H6030]] Zophar [[H6691]] the Naamathite, [[H5284]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Therefore [[H3651]] do my thoughts [[H5587]] cause me to answer, [[H7725]] and for [[H5668]] I make haste. [[H2363]]

### 3
I have heard [[H8085]] the check [[H4148]] of my reproach, [[H3639]] and the spirit [[H7307]] of my understanding [[H998]] causeth me to answer. [[H6030]]

### 4
Knowest [[H3045]] thou this [[H2063]] of [[H4480]] old, [[H5703]] since [[H4480]] man [[H120]] was placed [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] earth, [[H776]]

### 5
That [[H3588]] the triumphing [[H7445]] of the wicked [[H7563]] short, [[H7138]] and the joy [[H8057]] of the hypocrite [[H2611]] for [[H5704]] a moment? [[H7281]]

### 6
Though [[H518]] his excellency [[H7863]] mount up [[H5927]] to the heavens, [[H8064]] and his head [[H7218]] reach [[H5060]] unto the clouds; [[H5645]]

### 7
he shall perish [[H6]] for ever [[H5331]] like his own dung: [[H1561]] they which have seen [[H7200]] him shall say, [[H559]] Where [[H335]] he? [[H335]]

### 8
He shall fly away [[H5774]] as a dream, [[H2472]] and shall not [[H3808]] be found: [[H4672]] yea, he shall be chased away [[H5074]] as a vision [[H2384]] of the night. [[H3915]]

### 9
The eye [[H5869]] also saw [[H7805]] him shall no [[H3808]] more; [[H3254]] neither [[H3808]] shall his place [[H4725]] any more [[H5750]] behold [[H7789]] him. [[H7789]]

### 10
His children [[H1121]] shall seek to please [[H7521]] the poor, [[H1800]] and his hands [[H3027]] shall restore [[H7725]] their goods. [[H202]]

### 11
His bones [[H6106]] are full [[H4390]] of his youth, [[H5934]] which shall lie down [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] him in [[H5921]] the dust. [[H6083]]

### 12
Though [[H518]] wickedness [[H7451]] be sweet [[H4985]] in his mouth, [[H6310]] he hide [[H3582]] it under [[H8478]] his tongue; [[H3956]]

### 13
he spare [[H2550]] it, and forsake [[H5800]] it not; [[H3808]] but keep it still [[H4513]] within [[H8432]] his mouth: [[H2441]]

### 14
his meat [[H3899]] in his bowels [[H4578]] is turned, [[H2015]] the gall [[H4846]] of asps [[H6620]] within [[H7130]] him. [[H7130]]

### 15
He hath swallowed down [[H1104]] riches, [[H2428]] and he shall vomit them up again: [[H6958]] God [[H410]] shall cast them out [[H3423]] of his belly. [[H990]]

### 16
He shall suck [[H3243]] the poison [[H7219]] of asps: [[H6620]] the viper's [[H660]] tongue [[H3956]] shall slay [[H2026]] him. [[H2026]]

### 17
He shall not [[H408]] see [[H7200]] the rivers, [[H6390]] the floods, [[H5104]] the brooks [[H5158]] of honey [[H1706]] and butter. [[H2529]]

### 18
That which he laboured for [[H3022]] shall he restore, [[H7725]] and shall not [[H3808]] swallow down: [[H1104]] according to substance [[H2428]] the restitution [[H8545]] and he shall not [[H3808]] rejoice [[H5965]]

### 19
Because [[H3588]] he hath oppressed [[H7533]] hath forsaken [[H5800]] the poor; [[H1800]] he hath violently taken away [[H1497]] an house [[H1004]] which he builded [[H1129]] not; [[H3808]]

### 20
Surely [[H3588]] he shall not [[H3808]] feel [[H3045]] quietness [[H7961]] in his belly, [[H990]] he shall not [[H3808]] save [[H4422]] of that which he desired. [[H2530]]

### 21
There shall none [[H369]] of his meat [[H400]] be left; [[H8300]] therefore [[H3651]] shall no [[H3808]] man look [[H2342]] for his goods. [[H2898]]

### 22
In the fulness [[H4390]] of his sufficiency [[H5607]] he shall be in straits: [[H3334]] every [[H3605]] hand [[H3027]] of the wicked [[H6001]] shall come [[H935]] upon him. [[H935]]

### 23
he [[H1961]] is about to fill [[H4390]] his belly, [[H990]] shall cast [[H7971]] the fury [[H2740]] of his wrath [[H639]] upon him, and shall rain [[H4305]] upon [[H5921]] him while he is eating. [[H3894]]

### 24
He shall flee [[H1272]] from the iron [[H1270]] weapon, [[H5402]] the bow [[H7198]] of steel [[H5154]] shall strike him through. [[H2498]]

### 25
It is drawn, [[H8025]] and cometh out [[H3318]] of the body; [[H1465]] yea, the glittering sword [[H1300]] cometh out [[H1980]] of his gall: [[H4846]] terrors [[H367]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 26
All [[H3605]] darkness [[H2822]] hid [[H2934]] in his secret places: [[H6845]] a fire [[H784]] not [[H3808]] blown [[H5301]] shall consume [[H398]] him; it shall go ill [[H3415]] with him that is left [[H8300]] in his tabernacle. [[H168]]

### 27
The heaven [[H8064]] shall reveal [[H1540]] his iniquity; [[H5771]] and the earth [[H776]] shall rise up [[H6965]] against him. [[H6965]]

### 28
The increase [[H2981]] of his house [[H1004]] shall depart, [[H1540]] shall flow away [[H5064]] in the day [[H3117]] of his wrath. [[H639]]

### 29
This [[H2088]] the portion [[H2506]] of a wicked [[H7563]] man [[H120]] from God, [[H430]] and the heritage [[H5159]] appointed [[H561]] unto him by God. [[H410]]
