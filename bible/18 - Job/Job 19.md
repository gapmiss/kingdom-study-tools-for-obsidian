### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
How long [[H5704]] will ye vex [[H3013]] my soul, [[H5315]] and break [[H1792]] me in pieces with words? [[H4405]]

### 3
These [[H2088]] ten [[H6235]] times [[H6471]] have ye reproached [[H3637]] me: ye are not [[H3808]] ashamed [[H954]] ye make yourselves strange [[H1970]] to me. [[H1970]]

### 4
And [[H637]] be it indeed [[H551]] I have erred, [[H7686]] mine error [[H4879]] remaineth [[H3885]] with [[H854]] myself. [[H854]]

### 5
If [[H518]] indeed [[H551]] ye will magnify [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] me, and plead [[H3198]] against [[H5921]] me my reproach: [[H2781]]

### 6
Know [[H3045]] now [[H645]] that [[H3588]] God [[H433]] hath overthrown [[H5791]] me, and hath compassed [[H5362]] me with his net. [[H4686]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2005]] I cry out [[H6817]] of wrong, [[H2555]] but I am not [[H3808]] heard: [[H6030]] I cry aloud, [[H7768]] but no [[H369]] judgment. [[H4941]]

### 8
He hath fenced up [[H1443]] my way [[H734]] that I cannot [[H3808]] pass, [[H5674]] and he hath set [[H7760]] darkness [[H2822]] in [[H5921]] my paths. [[H5410]]

### 9
He hath stripped [[H6584]] me of my glory, [[H3519]] and taken [[H5493]] the crown [[H5850]] my head. [[H7218]]

### 10
He hath destroyed [[H5422]] me on every side, [[H5439]] and I am gone: [[H1980]] and mine hope [[H8615]] hath he removed [[H5265]] like a tree. [[H6086]]

### 11
He hath also kindled [[H2734]] his wrath [[H639]] against [[H5921]] me, and he counteth [[H2803]] me unto him as his enemies. [[H6862]]

### 12
His troops [[H1416]] come [[H935]] together, [[H3162]] and raise up [[H5549]] their way [[H1870]] against [[H5921]] me, and encamp [[H2583]] round about [[H5439]] my tabernacle. [[H168]]

### 13
He hath put [[H7368]] my brethren [[H251]] far from [[H5921]] me, and mine acquaintance [[H3045]] are verily [[H389]] estranged [[H2114]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 14
My kinsfolk [[H7138]] have failed, [[H2308]] and my familiar friends [[H3045]] have forgotten [[H7911]] me. [[H7911]]

### 15
They that dwell [[H1481]] in mine house, [[H1004]] and my maids, [[H519]] count [[H2803]] me for a stranger: [[H2114]] I am [[H1961]] an alien [[H5237]] in their sight. [[H5869]]

### 16
I called [[H7121]] my servant, [[H5650]] and he gave no [[H3808]] answer; [[H6030]] I intreated [[H2603]] him with [[H1119]] my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 17
My breath [[H7307]] is strange [[H2114]] to my wife, [[H802]] though I intreated [[H2603]] for the children's [[H1121]] of mine own body. [[H990]]

### 18
Yea, [[H1571]] young children [[H5759]] despised [[H3988]] me; I arose, [[H6965]] and they spake [[H1696]] against me. [[H1696]]

### 19
All [[H3605]] my inward [[H5475]] friends [[H4962]] abhorred [[H8581]] me: and they whom [[H2088]] I loved [[H157]] are turned [[H2015]] against me. [[H2015]]

### 20
My bone [[H6106]] cleaveth [[H1692]] to my skin [[H5785]] and to my flesh, [[H1320]] and I am escaped [[H4422]] with the skin [[H5785]] of my teeth. [[H8127]]

### 21
Have pity upon [[H2603]] me, have pity upon [[H2603]] me, O ye [[H859]] my friends; [[H7453]] for [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of God [[H433]] hath touched [[H5060]] me. [[H5060]]

### 22
Why [[H4100]] do ye persecute [[H7291]] me as [[H3644]] God, [[H410]] and are not [[H3808]] satisfied [[H7646]] with my flesh? [[H1320]]

### 23
Oh that [[H5414]] my words [[H4405]] were now [[H645]] written! [[H3789]] oh that [[H5414]] they were printed [[H2710]] in a book! [[H5612]]

### 24
That they were graven [[H2672]] with an iron [[H1270]] pen [[H5842]] and lead [[H5777]] in the rock [[H6697]] for ever! [[H5703]]

### 25
For I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] my redeemer [[H1350]] liveth, [[H2416]] and he shall stand [[H6965]] at the latter [[H314]] upon [[H5921]] the earth: [[H6083]]

### 26
And after [[H310]] my skin [[H5785]] destroy [[H5362]] this [[H2063]] yet in my flesh [[H1320]] shall I see [[H2372]] God: [[H433]]

### 27
Whom [[H834]] I [[H589]] shall see [[H2372]] for myself, and mine eyes [[H5869]] shall behold, [[H7200]] and not [[H3808]] another; [[H2114]] my reins [[H3629]] be consumed [[H3615]] within [[H2436]] me. [[H2436]]

### 28
But [[H3588]] ye should say, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] persecute [[H7291]] we him, seeing the root [[H8328]] of the matter [[H1697]] is found [[H4672]] in me? [[H4672]]

### 29
Be ye afraid [[H1481]] of [[H6440]] the sword: [[H2719]] for [[H3588]] wrath [[H2534]] the punishments [[H5771]] of the sword, [[H2719]] that [[H4616]] ye may know [[H3045]] a judgment. [[H1779]]
