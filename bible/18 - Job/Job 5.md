### 1
Call [[H7121]] now, [[H4994]] if there be [[H3426]] any that will answer [[H6030]] thee; and to [[H413]] which [[H4310]] of the saints [[H6918]] wilt thou turn? [[H6437]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] wrath [[H3708]] killeth [[H2026]] the foolish man, [[H191]] and envy [[H7068]] slayeth [[H4191]] the silly one. [[H6601]]

### 3
I [[H589]] have seen [[H7200]] the foolish [[H191]] taking root: [[H8327]] but suddenly [[H6597]] I cursed [[H5344]] his habitation. [[H5116]]

### 4
His children [[H1121]] are far [[H7368]] from safety, [[H3468]] and they are crushed [[H1792]] in the gate, [[H8179]] neither [[H369]] any to deliver [[H5337]]

### 5
Whose [[H834]] harvest [[H7105]] the hungry [[H7457]] eateth up, [[H398]] and taketh [[H3947]] it even out of [[H413]] the thorns, [[H6791]] and the robber [[H6782]] swalloweth up [[H7602]] their substance. [[H2428]]

### 6
Although [[H3588]] affliction [[H205]] cometh not forth [[H3318]] of the dust, [[H6083]] neither [[H3808]] doth trouble [[H5999]] spring out [[H6779]] of the ground; [[H127]]

### 7
Yet [[H3588]] man [[H120]] is born [[H3205]] unto trouble, [[H5999]] as the sparks [[H1121]] fly [[H5774]] upward. [[H1361]]

### 8
I [[H589]] would seek [[H199]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H410]] and unto [[H413]] God [[H430]] would I commit [[H7760]] my cause: [[H1700]]

### 9
Which doeth [[H6213]] great things [[H1419]] and unsearchable; [[H369]] marvellous things [[H6381]] without [[H5704]] number: [[H4557]]

### 10
Who giveth [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] upon [[H6440]] the earth, [[H776]] and sendeth [[H7971]] waters [[H4325]] upon [[H6440]] the fields: [[H2351]]

### 11
To set up [[H7760]] on high [[H4791]] those that be low; [[H8217]] that those which mourn [[H6937]] may be exalted [[H7682]] to safety. [[H3468]]

### 12
He disappointeth [[H6565]] the devices [[H4284]] of the crafty, [[H6175]] so that their hands [[H3027]] cannot [[H3808]] perform [[H6213]] enterprise. [[H8454]]

### 13
He taketh [[H3920]] the wise [[H2450]] in their own craftiness: [[H6193]] and the counsel [[H6098]] of the froward [[H6617]] is carried headlong. [[H4116]]

### 14
They meet [[H6298]] with darkness [[H2822]] in the daytime, [[H3119]] and grope [[H4959]] in the noonday [[H6672]] as in the night. [[H3915]]

### 15
But he saveth [[H3467]] the poor [[H34]] from the sword, [[H2719]] from their mouth, [[H6310]] and from the hand [[H3027]] of the mighty. [[H2389]]

### 16
So the poor [[H1800]] hath [[H1961]] hope, [[H8615]] and iniquity [[H5766]] stoppeth [[H7092]] her mouth. [[H6310]]

### 17
Behold, [[H2009]] happy [[H835]] the man [[H582]] whom God [[H433]] correcteth: [[H3198]] therefore despise [[H3988]] not [[H408]] thou the chastening [[H4148]] of the Almighty: [[H7706]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] maketh sore, [[H3510]] and bindeth up: [[H2280]] he woundeth, [[H4272]] and his hands [[H3027]] make whole. [[H7495]]

### 19
He shall deliver [[H5337]] thee in six [[H8337]] troubles: [[H6869]] yea, in seven [[H7651]] there shall no [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] touch [[H5060]] thee. [[H5060]]

### 20
In famine [[H7458]] he shall redeem [[H6299]] thee from death: [[H4194]] and in war [[H4421]] from the power [[H3027]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 21
Thou shalt be hid [[H2244]] from the scourge [[H7752]] of the tongue: [[H3956]] neither [[H3808]] shalt thou be afraid [[H3372]] of destruction [[H7701]] when [[H3588]] it cometh. [[H935]]

### 22
At destruction [[H7701]] and famine [[H3720]] thou shalt laugh: [[H7832]] neither [[H408]] shalt thou be afraid [[H3372]] of the beasts [[H2416]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] thou shalt be in league [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] the stones [[H68]] of the field: [[H7704]] and the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] shall be at peace [[H7999]] with thee. [[H7999]]

### 24
And thou shalt know [[H3045]] that thy tabernacle [[H168]] in peace; [[H7965]] and thou shalt visit [[H6485]] thy habitation, [[H5116]] and shalt not sin. [[H2398]]

### 25
Thou shalt know [[H3045]] also that [[H3588]] thy seed [[H2233]] great, [[H7227]] and thine offspring [[H6631]] as the grass [[H6212]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 26
Thou shalt come [[H935]] to [[H413]] grave [[H6913]] in a full age, [[H3624]] like as a shock of corn [[H1430]] cometh in [[H5927]] in his season. [[H6256]]

### 27
Lo [[H2009]] this, [[H2063]] we have searched [[H2713]] it, so [[H3651]] it [[H1931]] hear [[H8085]] it, and know [[H3045]] thou [[H859]] for thy good. [[H859]]
