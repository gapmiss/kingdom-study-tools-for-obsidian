### 1
But now [[H6258]] younger [[H6810]] than [[H4480]] I have me in derision, [[H7832]] whose [[H834]] fathers [[H1]] I would have disdained [[H3988]] to have set [[H7896]] with [[H5973]] the dogs [[H3611]] of my flock. [[H6629]]

### 2
Yea, [[H1571]] whereto [[H4100]] the strength [[H3581]] of their hands [[H3027]] me, in whom [[H5921]] old age [[H3624]] was perished? [[H6]]

### 3
For want [[H2639]] and famine [[H3720]] solitary; [[H1565]] fleeing [[H6207]] into the wilderness [[H6723]] in former time [[H570]] desolate [[H7722]] and waste. [[H4875]]

### 4
Who cut up [[H6998]] mallows [[H4408]] by [[H5921]] the bushes, [[H7880]] and juniper [[H7574]] roots [[H8328]] their meat. [[H3899]]

### 5
They were driven forth [[H1644]] from [[H4480]] among [[H1460]] (they cried [[H7321]] after [[H5921]] them as a thief;) [[H1590]]

### 6
To dwell [[H7931]] in the clifts [[H6178]] of the valleys, [[H5158]] caves [[H2356]] of the earth, [[H6083]] and the rocks. [[H3710]]

### 7
Among [[H996]] the bushes [[H7880]] they brayed; [[H5101]] under [[H8478]] the nettles [[H2738]] they were gathered together. [[H5596]]

### 8
children [[H1121]] of fools, [[H5036]] yea, [[H1571]] children [[H1121]] of base men: [[H8034]] they were viler [[H5217]] than [[H4480]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 9
And now [[H6258]] am [[H1961]] I their song, [[H5058]] yea, I am [[H1961]] their byword. [[H4405]]

### 10
They abhor [[H8581]] me, they flee far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me, and spare [[H2820]] not [[H3808]] to spit [[H7536]] in my face. [[H6440]]

### 11
Because [[H3588]] he hath loosed [[H6605]] my cord, [[H3499]] and afflicted [[H6031]] me, they have also let loose [[H7971]] the bridle [[H7448]] before [[H6440]] me. [[H6440]]

### 12
Upon [[H5921]] right [[H3225]] rise [[H6965]] the youth; [[H6526]] they push away [[H7971]] my feet, [[H7272]] and they raise up [[H5549]] against [[H5921]] me the ways [[H734]] of their destruction. [[H343]]

### 13
They mar [[H5420]] my path, [[H5410]] they set forward [[H3276]] my calamity, [[H1942]] they have no [[H3808]] helper. [[H5826]]

### 14
They came [[H857]] as a wide [[H7342]] breaking in [[H6556]] in [[H8478]] the desolation [[H7722]] they rolled themselves [[H1556]]

### 15
Terrors [[H1091]] are turned [[H2015]] upon [[H5921]] me: they pursue [[H7291]] my soul [[H5082]] as the wind: [[H7307]] and my welfare [[H3444]] passeth away [[H5674]] as a cloud. [[H5645]]

### 16
And now [[H6258]] my soul [[H5315]] is poured out [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] me; the days [[H3117]] of affliction [[H6040]] have taken hold upon [[H270]] me. [[H270]]

### 17
My bones [[H6106]] are pierced [[H5365]] in [[H5921]] me in the night season: [[H3915]] and my sinews [[H6207]] take no rest. [[H7901]]

### 18
By the great [[H7230]] force [[H3581]] is my garment [[H3830]] changed: [[H2664]] it bindeth me about [[H247]] as the collar [[H6310]] of my coat. [[H3801]]

### 19
He hath cast [[H3384]] me into the mire, [[H2563]] and I am become like [[H4911]] dust [[H6083]] and ashes. [[H665]]

### 20
I cry [[H7768]] unto [[H413]] thee, and thou dost not [[H3808]] hear [[H6030]] me: I stand up, [[H5975]] and thou regardest [[H995]] me [[H995]]

### 21
Thou art become [[H2015]] cruel [[H393]] to me: with thy strong [[H6108]] hand [[H3027]] thou opposest [[H7852]] thyself against me. [[H7852]]

### 22
Thou liftest me up [[H5375]] to [[H413]] the wind; [[H7307]] thou causest me to ride [[H7392]] and dissolvest [[H4127]] my substance. [[H8454]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] thou wilt bring [[H7725]] me death, [[H4194]] and the house [[H1004]] appointed [[H4150]] for all [[H3605]] living. [[H2416]]

### 24
Howbeit [[H389]] he will not [[H3808]] stretch out [[H7971]] hand [[H3027]] to the grave, [[H1164]] though [[H518]] they cry [[H7769]] in his destruction. [[H6365]]

### 25
Did not [[H3808]] I weep [[H1058]] for him that was in trouble? [[H7186]] was my soul [[H5315]] grieved [[H5701]] for the poor? [[H34]]

### 26
When [[H3588]] I looked for [[H6960]] good, [[H2896]] then evil [[H7451]] came [[H935]] and when I waited [[H3176]] for light, [[H216]] there came [[H935]] darkness. [[H652]]

### 27
My bowels [[H4578]] boiled, [[H7570]] and rested [[H1826]] not: [[H3808]] the days [[H3117]] of affliction [[H6040]] prevented [[H6923]] me. [[H6923]]

### 28
I went [[H1980]] mourning [[H6937]] without [[H3808]] the sun: [[H2535]] I stood up, [[H6965]] I cried [[H7768]] in the congregation. [[H6951]]

### 29
I am [[H1961]] a brother [[H251]] to dragons, [[H8577]] and a companion [[H7453]] to owls. [[H1323]]

### 30
My skin [[H5785]] is black [[H7835]] upon [[H5921]] me, and my bones [[H6106]] are burned [[H2787]] with [[H4480]] heat. [[H2721]]

### 31
My harp [[H3658]] also is [[H1961]] to mourning, [[H60]] and my organ [[H5748]] into the voice [[H6963]] of them that weep. [[H1058]]
