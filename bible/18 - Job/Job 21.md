### 1
But Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Hear [[H8085]] diligently [[H8085]] my speech, [[H4405]] and let this [[H2063]] be [[H1961]] your consolations. [[H8575]]

### 3
Suffer [[H5375]] me that I [[H595]] may speak; [[H1696]] and after that [[H310]] I have spoken, [[H1696]] mock on. [[H3932]]

### 4
As for me, [[H595]] my complaint [[H7879]] to man? [[H120]] and if [[H518]] why [[H4069]] should not [[H3808]] my spirit [[H7307]] be troubled? [[H7114]]

### 5
Mark [[H6437]] me, and be astonished, [[H8074]] and lay [[H7760]] hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] mouth. [[H6310]]

### 6
Even when [[H518]] I remember [[H2142]] I am afraid, [[H926]] and trembling [[H6427]] taketh hold on [[H270]] my flesh. [[H1320]]

### 7
Wherefore [[H4069]] do the wicked [[H7563]] live, [[H2421]] become old, [[H6275]] yea, [[H1571]] are mighty [[H1396]] in power? [[H2428]]

### 8
Their seed [[H2233]] is established [[H3559]] in their sight [[H6440]] with [[H5973]] them, and their offspring [[H6631]] before their eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
Their houses [[H1004]] safe [[H7965]] from fear, [[H6343]] neither [[H3808]] the rod [[H7626]] of God [[H433]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 10
Their bull [[H7794]] gendereth, [[H5674]] and faileth [[H1602]] not; [[H3808]] their cow [[H6510]] calveth, [[H6403]] and casteth not her calf. [[H7921]]

### 11
They send forth [[H7971]] their little ones [[H5759]] like a flock, [[H6629]] and their children [[H3206]] dance. [[H7540]]

### 12
They take [[H5375]] the timbrel [[H8596]] and harp, [[H3658]] and rejoice [[H8055]] at the sound [[H6963]] of the organ. [[H5748]]

### 13
They spend [[H1086]] their days [[H3117]] in wealth, [[H2896]] and in a moment [[H7281]] go down [[H5181]] to the grave. [[H7585]]

### 14
Therefore they say [[H559]] unto God, [[H410]] Depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] us; for we desire [[H2654]] not [[H3808]] the knowledge [[H1847]] of thy ways. [[H1870]]

### 15
What [[H4100]] the Almighty, [[H7706]] that [[H3588]] we should serve [[H5647]] him? and what [[H4100]] profit [[H3276]] should we have, if [[H3588]] we pray [[H6293]] unto him? [[H6293]]

### 16
Lo, [[H2005]] their good [[H2898]] not [[H3808]] in their hand: [[H3027]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 17
How oft [[H4100]] is the candle [[H5216]] of the wicked [[H7563]] put out! [[H1846]] and cometh [[H935]] their destruction [[H343]] upon [[H5921]] them! distributeth [[H2505]] sorrows [[H2256]] in his anger. [[H639]]

### 18
They are [[H1961]] as stubble [[H8401]] before [[H6440]] the wind, [[H7307]] and as chaff [[H4671]] that the storm [[H5492]] carrieth away. [[H1589]]

### 19
God [[H433]] layeth up [[H6845]] his iniquity [[H205]] for his children: [[H1121]] he rewardeth [[H7999]] him, and he shall know [[H3045]]

### 20
His eyes [[H5869]] shall see [[H7200]] his destruction, [[H3589]] and he shall drink [[H8354]] of the wrath [[H2534]] of the Almighty. [[H7706]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] pleasure [[H2656]] he in his house [[H1004]] after [[H310]] him, when the number [[H4557]] of his months [[H2320]] is cut off in the midst? [[H2686]]

### 22
Shall teach [[H3925]] God [[H410]] knowledge? [[H1847]] seeing he [[H1931]] judgeth [[H8199]] those that are high. [[H7311]]

### 23
One [[H2088]] dieth [[H4191]] in his full [[H8537]] strength, [[H6106]] being wholly [[H3605]] at ease [[H7946]] and quiet. [[H7961]]

### 24
His breasts [[H5845]] are full [[H4390]] of milk, [[H2461]] and his bones [[H6106]] are moistened [[H8248]] with marrow. [[H4221]]

### 25
And another [[H2088]] dieth [[H4191]] in the bitterness [[H4751]] of his soul, [[H5315]] and never [[H3808]] eateth [[H398]] with pleasure. [[H2896]]

### 26
They shall lie down [[H7901]] alike [[H3162]] in [[H5921]] the dust, [[H6083]] and the worms [[H7415]] shall cover [[H3680]] them. [[H5921]]

### 27
Behold, [[H2005]] I know [[H3045]] your thoughts, [[H4284]] and the devices [[H4209]] ye wrongfully imagine [[H2554]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] ye say, [[H559]] Where [[H346]] the house [[H1004]] of the prince? [[H5081]] and where [[H346]] the dwelling [[H4908]] places [[H168]] of the wicked? [[H7563]]

### 29
Have ye not [[H3808]] asked [[H7592]] them that go [[H5674]] by the way? [[H1870]] and do ye not [[H3808]] know [[H5234]] their tokens, [[H226]]

### 30
That [[H3588]] the wicked [[H7451]] is reserved [[H2820]] to the day [[H3117]] of destruction? [[H343]] they shall be brought forth [[H2986]] to the day [[H3117]] of wrath. [[H5678]]

### 31
Who [[H4310]] shall declare [[H5046]] his way [[H1870]] to [[H5921]] his face? [[H6440]] and who [[H4310]] shall repay [[H7999]] him he [[H1931]] hath done? [[H6213]]

### 32
Yet shall he [[H1931]] be brought [[H2986]] to the grave, [[H6913]] and shall remain [[H8245]] in [[H5921]] the tomb. [[H1430]]

### 33
The clods [[H7263]] of the valley [[H5158]] shall be sweet [[H4985]] unto him, and every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] shall draw [[H4900]] after [[H310]] him, as innumerable [[H4557]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 34
How [[H349]] then comfort [[H5162]] ye me in vain, [[H1892]] seeing in your answers [[H8666]] there remaineth [[H7604]] falsehood? [[H4604]]
