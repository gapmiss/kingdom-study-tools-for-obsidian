### 1
Moreover the Lord [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] Job, [[H347]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Shall he that contendeth [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] the Almighty [[H7706]] instruct [[H3250]] he that reproveth [[H3198]] God, [[H433]] let him answer [[H6030]] it. [[H6030]]

### 3
Then Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2005]] I am vile; [[H7043]] what [[H4100]] shall I answer [[H7725]] thee? I will lay [[H7760]] mine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H3926]] my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 5
Once [[H259]] have I spoken; [[H1696]] but I will not [[H3808]] answer: [[H6030]] yea, twice; [[H8147]] but I will proceed no further. [[H3254]]

### 6
Then answered [[H6030]] the Lord [[H3068]]  unto [[H853]] Job [[H347]] out of the whirlwind, [[H4480]] and said, [[H559]]

### 7
Gird up [[H247]] thy loins [[H2504]] now [[H4994]] like a man: [[H1397]] I will demand [[H7592]] of thee, and declare [[H3045]] thou unto me. [[H3045]]

### 8
Wilt thou also [[H637]] disannul [[H6565]] my judgment? [[H4941]] wilt thou condemn [[H7561]] me, that [[H4616]] thou mayest be righteous? [[H6663]]

### 9
Hast thou an arm [[H2220]] like God? [[H410]] or canst thou thunder [[H7481]] with a voice [[H6963]] like him? [[H3644]]

### 10
Deck [[H5710]] thyself now [[H4994]] majesty [[H1347]] and excellency; [[H1363]] and array [[H3847]] thyself with glory [[H1935]] and beauty. [[H1926]]

### 11
Cast abroad [[H6327]] the rage [[H5678]] of thy wrath: [[H639]] and behold [[H7200]] every one [[H3605]] proud, [[H1343]] and abase [[H8213]] him. [[H8213]]

### 12
Look on [[H7200]] every one [[H3605]] proud, [[H1343]] bring him low; [[H3665]] and tread down [[H1915]] the wicked [[H7563]] in their place. [[H8478]]

### 13
Hide [[H2934]] them in the dust [[H6083]] together; [[H3162]] bind [[H2280]] their faces [[H6440]] in secret. [[H2934]]

### 14
Then will I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] confess [[H3034]] unto thee that [[H3588]] thine own right hand [[H3225]] can save [[H3467]] thee. [[H3467]]

### 15
Behold [[H2009]] now [[H4994]] behemoth, [[H930]] which [[H834]] I made [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] thee; he eateth [[H398]] grass [[H2682]] as an ox. [[H1241]]

### 16
Lo [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] his strength [[H3581]] in his loins, [[H4975]] and his force [[H202]] in the navel [[H8306]] of his belly. [[H990]]

### 17
He moveth [[H2654]] his tail [[H2180]] like [[H3644]] a cedar: [[H730]] the sinews [[H1517]] of his stones [[H6344]] are wrapped together. [[H8276]]

### 18
His bones [[H6106]] strong pieces [[H650]] of brass; [[H5154]] his bones [[H1634]] like bars [[H4300]] of iron. [[H1270]]

### 19
He [[H1931]] the chief [[H7225]] of the ways [[H1870]] of God: [[H410]] he that made [[H6213]] him can make his sword [[H2719]] to approach [[H5066]]

### 20
Surely [[H3588]] the mountains [[H2022]] bring him forth [[H5375]] food, [[H944]] where [[H8033]] all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] play. [[H7832]]

### 21
He lieth [[H7901]] under [[H8478]] the shady trees, [[H6628]] in the covert [[H5643]] of the reed, [[H7070]] and fens. [[H1207]]

### 22
The shady trees [[H6628]] cover [[H5526]] him their shadow; [[H6752]] the willows [[H6155]] of the brook [[H5158]] compass him about. [[H5437]]

### 23
Behold, [[H2005]] he drinketh up [[H6231]] a river, [[H5104]] hasteth [[H2648]] not: [[H3808]] he trusteth [[H982]] that [[H3588]] he can draw up [[H1518]] Jordan [[H3383]] into [[H413]] his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 24
He taketh [[H3947]] it with his eyes: [[H5869]] nose [[H639]] pierceth through [[H5344]] snares. [[H4170]]
