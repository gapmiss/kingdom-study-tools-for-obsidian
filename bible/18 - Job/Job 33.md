### 1
Wherefore, [[H199]] Job, [[H347]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] hear [[H8085]] my speeches, [[H4405]] and hearken [[H238]] to all [[H3605]] my words. [[H1697]]

### 2
Behold, [[H2009]] now [[H4994]] I have opened [[H6605]] my mouth, [[H6310]] my tongue [[H3956]] hath spoken [[H1696]] in my mouth. [[H2441]]

### 3
My words [[H561]] the uprightness [[H3476]] of my heart: [[H3820]] and my lips [[H8193]] shall utter [[H4448]] knowledge [[H1847]] clearly. [[H1305]]

### 4
The Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H410]] hath made [[H6213]] me, and the breath [[H5397]] of the Almighty [[H7706]] hath given me life. [[H2421]]

### 5
If [[H518]] thou canst [[H3201]] answer [[H7725]] me, set in order [[H6186]] before [[H6440]] me, stand up. [[H3320]]

### 6
Behold, [[H2005]] I [[H589]] according to thy wish [[H6310]] in God's [[H410]] stead: I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] am formed [[H7169]] out of the clay. [[H2563]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2009]] my terror [[H367]] shall not [[H3808]] make thee afraid, [[H1204]] neither [[H3808]] shall my hand [[H405]] be heavy [[H3513]] upon [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 8
Surely [[H389]] thou hast spoken [[H559]] in mine hearing, [[H241]] and I have heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of words, [[H4405]]

### 9
I [[H589]] am clean [[H2134]] without [[H1097]] transgression, [[H6588]] I [[H595]] innocent; [[H2643]] neither [[H3808]] iniquity [[H5771]] in me. [[H5771]]

### 10
Behold, [[H2005]] he findeth [[H4672]] occasions [[H8569]] against [[H5921]] me, he counteth [[H2803]] me for his enemy, [[H341]]

### 11
He putteth [[H7760]] my feet [[H7272]] in the stocks, [[H5465]] he marketh [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] my paths. [[H734]]

### 12
Behold, [[H2005]] this [[H2063]] thou art not [[H3808]] just: [[H6663]] I will answer [[H6030]] thee, that [[H3588]] God [[H433]] is greater [[H7235]] than man. [[H582]]

### 13
Why [[H4069]] dost thou strive [[H7378]] against [[H413]] him? for [[H3588]] he giveth not [[H3808]] account [[H6030]] of any [[H3605]] of his matters. [[H1697]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] God [[H410]] speaketh [[H1696]] once, [[H259]] yea twice, [[H8147]] perceiveth [[H7789]] it not. [[H3808]]

### 15
In a dream, [[H2472]] in a vision [[H2384]] of the night, [[H3915]] when deep sleep [[H8639]] falleth [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] men, [[H376]] in slumberings [[H8572]] upon [[H5921]] the bed; [[H4904]]

### 16
Then [[H227]] he openeth [[H1540]] the ears [[H241]] of men, [[H582]] and sealeth [[H2856]] their instruction, [[H4561]]

### 17
That he may withdraw [[H5493]] man [[H120]] purpose, [[H4639]] and hide [[H3680]] pride [[H1466]] from man. [[H1397]]

### 18
He keepeth back [[H2820]] his soul [[H5315]] from [[H4480]] the pit, [[H7845]] and his life [[H2416]] from perishing [[H5674]] by the sword. [[H7973]]

### 19
He is chastened [[H3198]] also with pain [[H4341]] upon [[H5921]] his bed, [[H4904]] and the multitude [[H7230]] of his bones [[H6106]] with strong [[H386]]

### 20
So that his life [[H2416]] abhorreth [[H2092]] bread, [[H3899]] and his soul [[H5315]] dainty [[H8378]] meat. [[H3978]]

### 21
His flesh [[H1320]] is consumed away, [[H3615]] that it cannot be seen; [[H7210]] and his bones [[H6106]] were not [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] stick out. [[H8192]]

### 22
Yea, his soul [[H5315]] draweth near [[H7126]] unto the grave, [[H7845]] and his life [[H2416]] to the destroyers. [[H4191]]

### 23
If [[H518]] there be [[H3426]] a messenger [[H4397]] with [[H5921]] him, an interpreter, [[H3887]] one [[H259]] among [[H4480]] a thousand, [[H505]] to shew [[H5046]] unto man [[H120]] his uprightness: [[H3476]]

### 24
Then he is gracious [[H2603]] unto him, and saith, [[H559]] Deliver [[H6308]] him from going down [[H3381]] to the pit: [[H7845]] I have found [[H4672]] a ransom. [[H3724]]

### 25
His flesh [[H1320]] shall be fresher [[H7375]] than a child's: [[H5290]] he shall return [[H7725]] to the days [[H3117]] of his youth: [[H5934]]

### 26
He shall pray [[H6279]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H433]] and he will be favourable [[H7521]] unto him: and he shall see [[H7200]] his face [[H6440]] with joy: [[H8643]] for he will render [[H7725]] unto man [[H582]] his righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 27
He looketh [[H7789]] upon [[H5921]] men, [[H582]] and say, [[H559]] I have sinned, [[H2398]] and perverted [[H5753]] right, [[H3477]] and it profited [[H7737]] me not; [[H3808]]

### 28
He will deliver [[H6299]] his soul [[H5315]] from going [[H5674]] into the pit, [[H7845]] and his life [[H2416]] shall see [[H7200]] the light. [[H216]]

### 29
Lo, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] worketh [[H6466]] God [[H410]] oftentimes [[H6471]] with [[H5973]] man, [[H1397]]

### 30
To bring back [[H7725]] his soul [[H5315]] from [[H4480]] the pit, [[H7845]] to be enlightened [[H215]] with the light [[H216]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 31
Mark well, [[H7181]] O Job, [[H347]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me: hold thy peace, [[H2790]] and I [[H595]] will speak. [[H1696]]

### 32
If [[H518]] thou hast [[H3426]] any thing to say, [[H4405]] answer [[H7725]] me: speak, [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] I desire [[H2654]] to justify [[H6663]] thee. [[H6663]]

### 33
If [[H518]] not, [[H369]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me: hold thy peace, [[H2790]] and I shall teach [[H502]] thee wisdom. [[H2451]]
