### 1
Furthermore Elihu [[H453]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Hear [[H8085]] my words, [[H4405]] O ye wise [[H2450]] and give ear [[H238]] unto me, ye that have knowledge. [[H3045]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the ear [[H241]] trieth [[H974]] words, [[H4405]] as the mouth [[H2441]] tasteth [[H2938]] meat. [[H398]]

### 4
Let us choose [[H977]] to us judgment: [[H4941]] let us know [[H3045]] among [[H996]] ourselves what [[H4100]] good. [[H2896]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] Job [[H347]] hath said, [[H559]] I am righteous: [[H6663]] and God [[H410]] hath taken away [[H5493]] my judgment. [[H4941]]

### 6
Should I lie [[H3576]] against [[H5921]] my right? [[H4941]] my wound [[H2671]] incurable [[H605]] without [[H1097]] transgression. [[H6588]]

### 7
What [[H4310]] man [[H1397]] like Job, [[H347]] drinketh up [[H8354]] scorning [[H3933]] like water? [[H4325]]

### 8
Which goeth [[H732]] in company [[H2274]] with [[H5973]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity, [[H205]] and walketh [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] wicked [[H7562]] men. [[H376]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] he hath said, [[H559]] It profiteth [[H5532]] a man [[H1397]] nothing [[H3808]] that he should delight [[H7521]] himself with [[H5973]] God. [[H430]]

### 10
Therefore [[H3651]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me, ye men [[H376]] of understanding: [[H3824]] far be it [[H2486]] from God, [[H410]] wickedness; [[H7562]] and the Almighty, [[H7706]] iniquity. [[H5766]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the work [[H6467]] of a man [[H120]] shall he render [[H7999]] unto him, and cause every man [[H376]] to find [[H4672]] according to ways. [[H734]]

### 12
Yea, [[H637]] surely [[H551]] God [[H410]] will not [[H3808]] do wickedly, [[H7561]] neither [[H3808]] will the Almighty [[H7706]] pervert [[H5791]] judgment. [[H4941]]

### 13
Who [[H4310]] hath given him a charge [[H6485]] over the earth? [[H776]] or who [[H4310]] hath disposed [[H7760]] the whole [[H3605]] world? [[H8398]]

### 14
If [[H518]] he set [[H7760]] his heart [[H3820]] upon [[H413]] man, he gather [[H622]] unto [[H413]] himself his spirit [[H7307]] and his breath; [[H5397]]

### 15
All [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] shall perish [[H1478]] together, [[H3162]] and man [[H120]] shall turn again [[H7725]] unto [[H5921]] dust. [[H6083]]

### 16
If [[H518]] now understanding, [[H998]] hear [[H8085]] this: [[H2063]] hearken [[H238]] to the voice [[H6963]] of my words. [[H4405]]

### 17
Shall even [[H637]] he that hateth [[H8130]] right [[H4941]] govern? [[H2280]] and wilt thou condemn [[H7561]] him that is most [[H3524]] just? [[H6662]]

### 18
to say [[H559]] to a king, [[H4428]] wicked? [[H1100]] to [[H413]] princes, [[H5081]] ungodly? [[H7563]]

### 19
that [[H834]] accepteth [[H5375]] not [[H3808]] the persons [[H6440]] of princes, [[H8269]] nor [[H3808]] regardeth [[H5234]] the rich [[H7771]] more than [[H6440]] the poor? [[H1800]] for [[H3588]] they all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of his hands. [[H3027]]

### 20
In a moment [[H7281]] shall they die, [[H4191]] and the people [[H5971]] shall be troubled [[H1607]] at midnight, [[H2676]] and pass away: [[H5674]] and the mighty [[H47]] shall be taken away [[H5493]] without [[H3808]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] his eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] the ways [[H1870]] of man, [[H376]] and he seeth [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] his goings. [[H6806]]

### 22
no [[H369]] darkness, [[H2822]] nor [[H369]] shadow of death, [[H6757]] where [[H8033]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] may hide themselves. [[H5641]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] he will not [[H3808]] lay [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] man [[H376]] more [[H5750]] that he should enter [[H1980]] into judgment [[H4941]] with [[H413]] God. [[H410]]

### 24
He shall break in pieces [[H7489]] mighty men [[H3524]] without [[H3808]] number, [[H2714]] and set [[H5975]] others [[H312]] in their stead. [[H8478]]

### 25
Therefore [[H3651]] he knoweth [[H5234]] their works, [[H4566]] and he overturneth [[H2015]] in the night, [[H3915]] so that they are destroyed. [[H1792]]

### 26
He striketh [[H5606]] them as [[H8478]] wicked men [[H7563]] in the open [[H4725]] sight [[H7200]] of others; [[H7200]]

### 27
Because [[H834]] they turned back [[H5493]] from [[H310]] him, and would not [[H3808]] consider [[H7919]] any [[H3605]] of his ways: [[H1870]]

### 28
So that they cause the cry [[H6818]] of the poor [[H1800]] to come [[H935]] unto [[H5921]] him, and he heareth [[H8085]] the cry [[H6818]] of the afflicted. [[H6041]]

### 29
When he [[H1931]] giveth quietness, [[H8252]] who [[H4310]] then can make trouble? [[H7561]] and when he hideth [[H5641]] face, [[H6440]] who [[H4310]] then can behold [[H7789]] him? whether against [[H5921]] a nation, [[H1471]] or against [[H5921]] a man [[H120]] only: [[H3162]]

### 30
That the hypocrite [[H120]] reign [[H4427]] not, lest the people [[H5971]] be ensnared. [[H4170]]

### 31
Surely it is meet [[H3588]] to be said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H410]] I have borne [[H5375]] I will not [[H3808]] offend [[H2254]]

### 32
I see [[H2372]] not [[H1107]] teach [[H3384]] thou [[H859]] me: if [[H518]] I have done [[H6466]] iniquity, [[H5766]] I will do [[H3254]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H3808]]

### 33
according to thy mind? [[H5973]] he will recompense [[H7999]] it, whether [[H3588]] thou refuse, [[H3988]] or whether [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] choose; [[H977]] and not [[H3808]] I: [[H589]] therefore speak [[H1696]] what [[H4100]] thou knowest. [[H3045]]

### 34
Let men [[H582]] of understanding [[H3824]] tell [[H559]] me, and let a wise [[H2450]] man [[H1397]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me. [[H8085]]

### 35
Job [[H347]] hath spoken [[H1696]] without [[H3808]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and his words [[H1697]] without [[H3808]] wisdom. [[H7919]]

### 36
My desire [[H15]] Job [[H347]] may be tried [[H974]] unto [[H5704]] the end [[H5331]] because [[H5921]] of answers [[H8666]] for wicked [[H205]] men. [[H376]]

### 37
For [[H3588]] he addeth [[H3254]] rebellion [[H6588]] unto [[H5921]] his sin, [[H2403]] he clappeth [[H5606]] among [[H996]] us, and multiplieth [[H7235]] his words [[H561]] against God. [[H410]]
