[[Job 2|←]] • [[Job 4|→]]

### 1
After [[H310]] this [[H3651]] opened [[H6605]] Job [[H347]] his mouth, [[H6310]] and cursed [[H7043]] his day. [[H3117]]

### 2
And Job [[H347]] spake, [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 3
Let the day [[H3117]] perish [[H6]] wherein I was born, [[H3205]] and the night [[H3915]] it was said, [[H559]] There is a man child [[H1397]] conceived. [[H2030]]

### 4
Let that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] be [[H1961]] darkness; [[H2822]] let not [[H408]] God [[H433]] regard [[H1875]] it from above, [[H4605]] neither [[H408]] let the light [[H5105]] shine [[H3313]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 5
Let darkness [[H2822]] and the shadow of death [[H6757]] stain [[H1350]] it; let a cloud [[H6053]] dwell [[H7931]] upon [[H5921]] it; let the blackness [[H3650]] of the day [[H3117]] terrify [[H1204]] it. [[H1204]]

### 6
that [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] let darkness [[H652]] seize upon [[H3947]] it; let it not [[H408]] be joined [[H2302]] unto the days [[H3117]] of the year, [[H8141]] let it not [[H408]] come [[H935]] into the number [[H4557]] of the months. [[H3391]]

### 7
Lo, [[H2009]] let that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] be [[H1961]] solitary, [[H1565]] let no [[H408]] joyful voice [[H7445]] come [[H935]] therein. [[H935]]

### 8
Let them curse [[H5344]] it that curse [[H779]] the day, [[H3117]] who are ready [[H6264]] to raise up [[H5782]] their mourning. [[H3882]]

### 9
Let the stars [[H3556]] of the twilight [[H5399]] thereof be dark; [[H2821]] let it look [[H6960]] for light, [[H216]] but none; [[H369]] neither [[H408]] let it see [[H7200]] the dawning [[H6079]] of the day: [[H7837]]

### 10
Because [[H3588]] it shut not up [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] of my womb, [[H990]] nor hid [[H5641]] sorrow [[H5999]] from mine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 11
Why [[H4100]] died [[H4191]] I not [[H3808]] from the womb? [[H7358]] did I give up the ghost [[H1478]] when I came out [[H3318]] of the belly? [[H990]]

### 12
Why [[H4069]] did the knees [[H1290]] prevent [[H6923]] me? or why [[H4100]] the breasts [[H7699]] that [[H3588]] I should suck? [[H3243]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] should I have lain still [[H7901]] and been quiet, [[H8252]] I should have slept: [[H3462]] then [[H227]] had I been at rest, [[H5117]]

### 14
With [[H5973]] kings [[H4428]] and counsellers [[H3289]] of the earth, [[H776]] which built [[H1129]] desolate places [[H2723]] for themselves; [[H2723]]

### 15
Or [[H176]] with [[H5973]] princes [[H8269]] that had gold, [[H2091]] who filled [[H4390]] their houses [[H1004]] with silver: [[H3701]]

### 16
Or [[H176]] as an hidden [[H2934]] untimely birth [[H5309]] I had not [[H3808]] been; [[H1961]] as infants [[H5768]] never [[H3808]] saw [[H7200]] light. [[H216]]

### 17
There [[H8033]] the wicked [[H7563]] cease [[H2308]] troubling; [[H7267]] and there [[H8033]] the weary [[H3019]] be at rest. [[H5117]]

### 18
the prisoners [[H615]] rest [[H7599]] together; [[H3162]] they hear [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] the voice [[H6963]] of the oppressor. [[H5065]]

### 19
The small [[H6996]] and great [[H1419]] are there; [[H8033]] and the servant [[H5650]] free [[H2670]] from his master. [[H113]]

### 20
Wherefore [[H4100]] is light [[H216]] given [[H5414]] to him that is in misery, [[H6001]] and life [[H2416]] unto the bitter [[H4751]] soul; [[H5315]]

### 21
Which long [[H2442]] for death, [[H4194]] but it not; [[H369]] and dig [[H2658]] for it more than for hid treasures; [[H4301]]

### 22
Which rejoice [[H8056]] exceedingly, [[H1524]] are glad, [[H7797]] when [[H3588]] they can find [[H4672]] the grave? [[H6913]]

### 23
to a man [[H1397]] whose [[H834]] way [[H1870]] is hid, [[H5641]] and whom [[H1157]] God [[H433]] hath hedged in? [[H5526]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] my sighing [[H585]] cometh [[H935]] before [[H6440]] I eat, [[H3899]] and my roarings [[H7581]] are poured out [[H5413]] like the waters. [[H4325]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] the thing which I greatly [[H6343]] feared [[H6342]] is come upon [[H857]] me, and that which [[H834]] I was afraid of [[H3025]] is come [[H935]] unto me. [[H935]]

### 26
I was not [[H3808]] in safety, [[H7951]] neither [[H3808]] had I rest, [[H8252]] neither [[H3808]] was I quiet; [[H5117]] yet trouble [[H7267]] came. [[H935]]
