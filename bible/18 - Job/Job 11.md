### 1
Then answered [[H6030]] Zophar [[H6691]] the Naamathite, [[H5284]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Should not [[H3808]] the multitude [[H7230]] of words [[H1697]] be answered? [[H6030]] and should [[H518]] a man [[H376]] full of talk [[H8193]] be justified? [[H6663]]

### 3
Should thy lies [[H907]] make men [[H4962]] hold their peace? [[H2790]] and when thou mockest, [[H3932]] shall no [[H369]] man make thee ashamed? [[H3637]]

### 4
For thou hast said, [[H559]] My doctrine [[H3948]] pure, [[H2134]] and I am [[H1961]] clean [[H1249]] in thine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 5
But [[H199]]  oh [[H4310]] God [[H433]] that would [[H5414]] speak, [[H1696]] and open [[H6605]] his lips [[H8193]] against [[H5973]] thee; [[H5973]]

### 6
And that he would shew [[H5046]] thee the secrets [[H8587]] of wisdom, [[H2451]] that [[H3588]] double [[H3718]] to that which is! [[H8454]] Know [[H3045]] therefore that [[H3588]] God [[H433]] exacteth [[H5382]] of thee than thine iniquity [[H5771]]

### 7
Canst thou by searching [[H2714]] find out [[H4672]] God? [[H433]] canst thou find out [[H4672]] the Almighty [[H7706]] unto [[H5704]] perfection? [[H8503]]

### 8
as high [[H1363]] as heaven; [[H8064]] what [[H4100]] canst thou do? [[H6466]] deeper [[H6013]] than hell; [[H7585]] what [[H4100]] canst thou know? [[H3045]]

### 9
The measure [[H4055]] thereof longer [[H752]] than the earth, [[H776]] and broader [[H7342]] than [[H4480]] the sea. [[H3220]]

### 10
If [[H518]] he cut off, [[H2498]] and shut up, [[H5462]] or gather together, [[H6950]] then who [[H4310]] can hinder [[H7725]] him? [[H7725]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] knoweth [[H3045]] vain [[H7723]] men: [[H4962]] he seeth [[H7200]] wickedness [[H205]] also; will he not [[H3808]] then consider [[H995]]

### 12
For vain [[H5014]] man [[H376]] would be wise, [[H3823]] though man [[H120]] be born [[H3205]] a wild ass's [[H6501]] colt. [[H5895]]

### 13
If [[H518]] thou [[H859]] prepare [[H3559]] thine heart, [[H3820]] and stretch out [[H6566]] thine hands [[H3709]] toward [[H413]] him; [[H413]]

### 14
If [[H518]] iniquity [[H205]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] put it far away, [[H7368]] and let not [[H408]] wickedness [[H5766]] dwell [[H7931]] in thy tabernacles. [[H168]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] then [[H227]] shalt thou lift up [[H5375]] thy face [[H6440]] without spot; [[H3971]] yea, thou shalt be [[H1961]] stedfast, [[H3332]] and shalt not [[H3808]] fear: [[H3372]]

### 16
Because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] shalt forget [[H7911]] misery, [[H5999]] remember [[H2142]] as waters [[H4325]] pass away: [[H5674]]

### 17
And age [[H2465]] shall be clearer [[H6965]] than the noonday; [[H6672]] thou shalt shine forth, [[H5774]] thou shalt be [[H1961]] as the morning. [[H1242]]

### 18
And thou shalt be secure, [[H982]] because [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] hope; [[H8615]] yea, thou shalt dig [[H2658]] thou shalt take thy rest [[H7901]] in safety. [[H983]]

### 19
Also thou shalt lie down, [[H7257]] and none [[H369]] shall make afraid; [[H2729]] yea, many [[H7227]] shall make suit [[H2470]] unto thee. [[H6440]]

### 20
But the eyes [[H5869]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall fail, [[H3615]] and they shall not escape, [[H6]] and their hope [[H8615]] the giving up [[H4646]] of the ghost. [[H5315]]
