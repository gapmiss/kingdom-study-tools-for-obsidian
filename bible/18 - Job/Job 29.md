### 1
Moreover [[H3254]] Job [[H347]] continued [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Oh that [[H5414]] I were as months [[H3391]] past, [[H6924]] as the days [[H3117]] God [[H433]] preserved [[H8104]] me; [[H8104]]

### 3
When his candle [[H5216]] shined [[H1984]] upon [[H5921]] my head, [[H7218]] by his light [[H216]] I walked [[H1980]] darkness; [[H2822]]

### 4
As [[H834]] I was [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] of my youth, [[H2779]] when the secret [[H5475]] of God [[H433]] upon [[H5921]] my tabernacle; [[H168]]

### 5
When the Almighty [[H7706]] yet [[H5750]] with [[H5978]] me, my children [[H5288]] about [[H5439]] me; [[H5439]]

### 6
When I washed [[H7364]] my steps [[H1978]] with butter, [[H2529]] and the rock [[H6697]] poured me out [[H6694]] rivers [[H6388]] of oil; [[H8081]]

### 7
When I went out [[H3318]] to the gate [[H8179]] through [[H5921]] the city, [[H7176]] I prepared [[H3559]] my seat [[H4186]] in the street! [[H7339]]

### 8
The young men [[H5288]] saw [[H7200]] me, and hid themselves: [[H2244]] and the aged [[H3453]] arose, [[H6965]] stood up. [[H5975]]

### 9
The princes [[H8269]] refrained [[H6113]] talking, [[H4405]] and laid [[H7760]] hand [[H3709]] on their mouth. [[H6310]]

### 10
The nobles [[H5057]] held [[H2244]] their peace, [[H6963]] and their tongue [[H3956]] cleaved [[H1692]] to the roof of their mouth. [[H2441]]

### 11
When [[H3588]] the ear [[H241]] heard [[H8085]] then it blessed [[H833]] me; and when the eye [[H5869]] saw [[H7200]] it gave witness [[H5749]] to me: [[H5749]]

### 12
Because [[H3588]] I delivered [[H4422]] the poor [[H6041]] that cried, [[H7768]] and the fatherless, [[H3490]] and none [[H3808]] to help [[H5826]] him. [[H5826]]

### 13
The blessing [[H1293]] of him that was ready to perish [[H6]] came [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] me: and I caused the widow's [[H490]] heart [[H3820]] to sing for joy. [[H7442]]

### 14
I put on [[H3847]] righteousness, [[H6664]] and it clothed [[H3847]] me: my judgment [[H4941]] as a robe [[H4598]] and a diadem. [[H6797]]

### 15
I was [[H1961]] eyes [[H5869]] to the blind, [[H5787]] and feet [[H7272]] I [[H589]] to the lame. [[H6455]]

### 16
I [[H595]] a father [[H1]] to the poor: [[H34]] and the cause [[H7379]] I knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] I searched out. [[H2713]]

### 17
And I brake [[H7665]] the jaws [[H4973]] of the wicked, [[H5767]] and plucked [[H7993]] the spoil [[H2964]] out of his teeth. [[H8127]]

### 18
Then I said, [[H559]] I shall die [[H1478]] in [[H5973]] my nest, [[H7064]] and I shall multiply [[H7235]] days [[H3117]] as the sand. [[H2344]]

### 19
My root [[H8328]] spread out [[H6605]] by [[H413]] the waters, [[H4325]] and the dew [[H2919]] lay all night [[H3885]] upon my branch. [[H7105]]

### 20
My glory [[H3519]] fresh [[H2319]] in me, [[H5978]] and my bow [[H7198]] was renewed [[H2498]] in my hand. [[H3027]]

### 21
Unto me gave ear, [[H8085]] and waited, [[H3176]] and kept silence [[H1826]] at [[H3926]] my counsel. [[H6098]]

### 22
After [[H310]] my words [[H1697]] they spake not again; [[H8138]] and my speech [[H4405]] dropped [[H5197]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 23
And they waited [[H3176]] for me as for the rain; [[H4306]] and they opened [[H6473]] their mouth [[H6310]] wide for the latter rain. [[H4456]]

### 24
I laughed [[H7832]] on [[H413]] them, they believed [[H539]] not; [[H3808]] and the light [[H216]] of my countenance [[H6440]] they cast not down. [[H5307]]

### 25
I chose out [[H977]] their way, [[H1870]] and sat [[H3427]] chief, [[H7218]] and dwelt [[H7931]] as a king [[H4428]] in the army, [[H1416]] as [[H834]] one comforteth [[H5162]] the mourners. [[H57]]
