### 1
Elihu [[H453]] also proceeded, [[H3254]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Suffer [[H3803]] me a little, [[H2191]] and I will shew [[H2331]] thee that [[H3588]] yet [[H5750]] to speak [[H4405]] on God's [[H433]] behalf. [[H433]]

### 3
I will fetch [[H5375]] my knowledge [[H1843]] from afar, [[H7350]] and will ascribe [[H5414]] righteousness [[H6664]] to my Maker. [[H6466]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] truly [[H551]] my words [[H4405]] not [[H3808]] false: [[H8267]] he that is perfect [[H8549]] in knowledge [[H1844]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2005]] God [[H410]] mighty, [[H3524]] and despiseth [[H3988]] not [[H3808]] mighty [[H3524]] in strength [[H3581]] wisdom. [[H3820]]

### 6
He preserveth not the life [[H2421]] of the wicked: [[H7563]] but giveth [[H5414]] right [[H4941]] to the poor. [[H6041]]

### 7
He withdraweth [[H1639]] not [[H3808]] his eyes [[H5869]] from the righteous: [[H6662]] but with [[H854]] kings [[H4428]] on the throne; [[H3678]] yea, he doth establish [[H3427]] them for ever, [[H5331]] and they are exalted. [[H1361]]

### 8
And if [[H518]] bound [[H631]] in fetters, [[H2131]] be holden [[H3920]] in cords [[H2256]] of affliction; [[H6040]]

### 9
Then he sheweth [[H5046]] them their work, [[H6467]] and their transgressions [[H6588]] that [[H3588]] they have exceeded. [[H1396]]

### 10
He openeth [[H1540]] also their ear [[H241]] to discipline, [[H4148]] and commandeth [[H559]] that [[H3588]] they return [[H7725]] from iniquity. [[H205]]

### 11
If [[H518]] they obey [[H8085]] and serve [[H5647]] they shall spend [[H3615]] their days [[H3117]] in prosperity, [[H2896]] and their years [[H8141]] in pleasures. [[H5273]]

### 12
But if [[H518]] they obey [[H8085]] not, [[H3808]] they shall perish [[H5674]] by the sword, [[H7973]] and they shall die [[H1478]] without [[H1097]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 13
But the hypocrites [[H2611]] in heart [[H3820]] heap up [[H7760]] wrath: [[H639]] they cry [[H7768]] not [[H3808]] when [[H3588]] he bindeth [[H631]] them. [[H631]]

### 14
They [[H5315]] die [[H4191]] in youth, [[H5290]] and their life [[H2416]] among the unclean. [[H6945]]

### 15
He delivereth [[H2502]] the poor [[H6041]] in his affliction, [[H6040]] and openeth [[H1540]] their ears [[H241]] in oppression. [[H3906]]

### 16
Even so [[H637]] would he have removed [[H5496]] thee out of the strait [[H6310]] a broad place, [[H7338]] where [[H8478]] no [[H3808]] straitness; [[H4164]] and that which should be set [[H5183]] on thy table [[H7979]] full [[H4390]] of fatness. [[H1880]]

### 17
But thou hast fulfilled [[H4390]] the judgment [[H1779]] of the wicked: [[H7563]] judgment [[H1779]] and justice [[H4941]] take hold [[H8551]]

### 18
Because [[H3588]] wrath, [[H2534]] lest [[H6435]] he take thee away [[H5496]] with stroke: [[H5607]] then a great [[H7227]] ransom [[H3724]] cannot [[H408]] deliver [[H5186]] thee. [[H5186]]

### 19
Will he esteem [[H6186]] thy riches? [[H7769]] not [[H3808]] gold, [[H1222]] nor all [[H3605]] the forces [[H3981]] of strength. [[H3581]]

### 20
Desire [[H7602]] not [[H408]] the night, [[H3915]] when people [[H5971]] are cut off [[H5927]] in their place. [[H8478]]

### 21
Take heed, [[H8104]] regard not [[H6437]] iniquity: [[H205]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] hast thou chosen [[H977]] rather than affliction. [[H6040]]

### 22
Behold, [[H2005]] God [[H410]] exalteth [[H7682]] by his power: [[H3581]] who [[H4310]] teacheth [[H3384]] like him? [[H3644]]

### 23
Who [[H4310]] hath enjoined [[H6485]] him his way? [[H1870]] or who [[H4310]] can say, [[H559]] Thou hast wrought [[H6466]] iniquity? [[H5766]]

### 24
Remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] thou magnify [[H7679]] his work, [[H6467]] which [[H834]] men [[H376]] behold. [[H7891]]

### 25
Every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] may see [[H2372]] it; man [[H582]] may behold [[H5027]] afar off. [[H7350]]

### 26
Behold, [[H2005]] God [[H410]] great, [[H7689]] and we know [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] can the number [[H4557]] of his years [[H8141]] be searched out. [[H2714]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] he maketh small [[H1639]] the drops [[H5198]] of water: [[H4325]] they pour down [[H2212]] rain [[H4306]] according to the vapour [[H108]] thereof: [[H108]]

### 28
Which [[H834]] the clouds [[H7834]] do drop [[H5140]] distil [[H7491]] upon [[H5921]] man [[H120]] abundantly. [[H7227]]

### 29
Also [[H637]] can understand [[H995]] the spreadings [[H4666]] of the clouds, [[H5645]] the noise [[H8663]] of his tabernacle? [[H5521]]

### 30
Behold, [[H2005]] he spreadeth [[H6566]] his light [[H216]] upon [[H5921]] it, and covereth [[H3680]] the bottom [[H8328]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] by them judgeth [[H1777]] he the people; [[H5971]] he giveth [[H5414]] meat [[H400]] in abundance. [[H4342]]

### 32
With [[H5921]] clouds [[H3709]] he covereth [[H3680]] the light; [[H216]] and commandeth [[H6680]] it by [[H5921]] that cometh betwixt. [[H6293]]

### 33
The noise [[H7452]] thereof sheweth [[H5046]] concerning [[H5921]] it, the cattle [[H4735]] also [[H637]] concerning [[H5921]] the vapour. [[H5927]]
