### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou canst do [[H3201]] every [[H3605]] and no [[H3808]] thought [[H4209]] can be withholden [[H1219]] from [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 3
Who [[H4310]] he [[H2088]] that hideth [[H5956]] counsel [[H6098]] without [[H1097]] knowledge? [[H1847]] therefore [[H3651]] have I uttered [[H5046]] that I understood [[H995]] not; [[H3808]] things too wonderful [[H6381]] for [[H4480]] me, which I knew [[H3045]] not. [[H3808]]

### 4
Hear, [[H8085]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] and I [[H595]] will speak: [[H1696]] I will demand [[H7592]] of thee, and declare [[H3045]] thou unto me. [[H3045]]

### 5
I have heard [[H8085]] of thee by the hearing [[H8088]] of the ear: [[H241]] but now [[H6258]] mine eye [[H5869]] seeth [[H7200]] thee. [[H7200]]

### 6
Wherefore [[H5921]] I abhor [[H3988]] and repent [[H5162]] in [[H5921]] dust [[H6083]] and ashes. [[H665]]

### 7
And it was [[H1961]] that after [[H310]] the Lord [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] Job, [[H347]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite, [[H8489]] My wrath [[H639]] is kindled [[H2734]] against thee, and against thy two [[H8147]] friends: [[H7453]] for [[H3588]] ye have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] of [[H413]] me right, [[H3559]] as my servant [[H5650]] Job [[H347]]

### 8
Therefore take [[H3947]] unto you now [[H6258]] seven [[H7651]] bullocks [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams, [[H352]] and go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] my servant [[H5650]] Job, [[H347]] and offer up [[H5927]] for [[H1157]] yourselves a burnt offering; [[H5930]] and my servant [[H5650]] Job [[H347]] shall pray [[H6419]] for [[H5921]] you: for [[H3588]] him [[H6440]] will I accept: [[H5375]] lest [[H1115]] I deal [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] you folly, [[H5039]] in that [[H3588]] ye have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] of [[H413]] me right, [[H3559]] like my servant [[H5650]] Job. [[H347]]

### 9
So Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite [[H8489]] and Bildad [[H1085]] the Shuhite [[H7747]] Zophar [[H6691]] the Naamathite [[H5284]] went, [[H1980]] and did [[H6213]] according as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H1696]] them: the Lord [[H3068]] also accepted [[H5375]] Job. [[H347]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] turned [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Job, [[H347]] when he prayed [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] his friends: [[H7453]] also the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H3254]] Job [[H347]] twice [[H4932]] as much as he had before. [[H3605]]

### 11
Then came [[H935]] there unto [[H413]] him all [[H3605]] his brethren, [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] his sisters, [[H269]] and all [[H3605]] they that had been of his acquaintance [[H3045]] before, [[H6440]] and did eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] with [[H5973]] him in his house: [[H1004]] and they bemoaned [[H5110]] him, and comforted [[H5162]] him over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had brought [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] him: every man [[H376]] also gave [[H5414]] him a [[H259]] piece of money, [[H7192]] and every one [[H376]] an [[H259]] earring [[H5141]] of gold. [[H2091]]

### 12
So the Lord [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] the latter end [[H319]] of Job [[H347]] more than his beginning: [[H7225]] for he had [[H1961]] fourteen [[H702]] thousand [[H505]] sheep, [[H6629]] and six [[H8337]] thousand [[H505]] camels, [[H1581]] and a thousand [[H505]] yoke [[H6776]] of oxen, [[H1241]] and a thousand [[H505]] she asses. [[H860]]

### 13
He had [[H1961]] also seven [[H7658]] sons [[H1121]] and three [[H7969]] daughters. [[H1323]]

### 14
And he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the first, [[H259]] Jemima; [[H3224]] and the name [[H8034]] of the second, [[H8145]] Kezia; [[H7103]] and the name [[H8034]] of the third, [[H7992]] Keren-happuch. [[H7163]]

### 15
And in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] were no [[H3808]] women [[H802]] found [[H4672]] fair [[H3303]] as the daughters [[H1323]] of Job: [[H347]] and their father [[H1]] gave [[H5414]] them inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] their brethren. [[H251]]

### 16
After [[H310]] this [[H2063]] lived [[H2421]] Job [[H347]] an hundred [[H3967]] and forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] and saw [[H7200]] his sons, [[H1121]] and [[H853]] his sons' [[H1121]] sons, [[H1121]] four [[H702]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 17
So Job [[H347]] died, [[H4191]] old [[H2205]] and full [[H7649]] of days. [[H3117]]
