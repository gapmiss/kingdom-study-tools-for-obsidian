### 1
But Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
How [[H4100]] hast thou helped [[H5826]] without [[H3808]] power? [[H3581]] savest [[H3467]] thou the arm [[H2220]] no [[H3808]] strength? [[H5797]]

### 3
How [[H4100]] hast thou counselled [[H3289]] no [[H3808]] wisdom? [[H2451]] and hast thou plentifully [[H7230]] declared [[H3045]] the thing [[H8454]] as it is? [[H8454]]

### 4
To [[H854]] whom [[H4310]] hast thou uttered [[H5046]] words? [[H4405]] and whose [[H4310]] spirit [[H5397]] came [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] thee? [[H4480]]

### 5
Dead [[H7496]] are formed [[H2342]] from under [[H8478]] the waters, [[H4325]] and the inhabitants [[H7931]] thereof. [[H7931]]

### 6
Hell [[H7585]] naked [[H6174]] before [[H5048]] him, and destruction [[H11]] hath no [[H369]] covering. [[H3682]]

### 7
He stretcheth out [[H5186]] the north [[H6828]] over [[H5921]] the empty place, [[H8414]] hangeth [[H8518]] the earth [[H776]] upon [[H5921]] nothing. [[H1099]]

### 8
He bindeth up [[H6887]] the waters [[H4325]] in his thick clouds; [[H5645]] and the cloud [[H6051]] is not rent [[H1234]] under [[H8478]] them. [[H8478]]

### 9
He holdeth back [[H270]] the face [[H6440]] of his throne, [[H3678]] spreadeth [[H6576]] his cloud [[H6051]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 10
He hath compassed [[H2328]] the waters [[H6440]] with bounds, [[H2706]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H216]] and night [[H2822]] come to an end. [[H8503]]

### 11
The pillars [[H5982]] of heaven [[H8064]] tremble [[H7322]] and are astonished [[H8539]] at his reproof. [[H1606]]

### 12
He divideth [[H7280]] the sea [[H3220]] with his power, [[H3581]] and by his understanding [[H8394]] he smiteth through [[H4272]] the proud. [[H7293]]

### 13
By his spirit [[H7307]] he hath garnished [[H8235]] the heavens; [[H8064]] his hand [[H3027]] hath formed [[H2490]] the crooked [[H1281]] serpent. [[H5175]]

### 14
Lo, [[H2005]] these [[H428]] parts [[H7098]] of his ways: [[H1870]] but how [[H4100]] little [[H8102]] a portion [[H1697]] is heard [[H8085]] of him? but the thunder [[H7482]] of his power [[H1369]] who [[H4310]] can understand? [[H995]]
