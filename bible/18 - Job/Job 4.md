### 1
Then Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite [[H8489]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
we assay [[H5254]] to commune [[H1697]] with [[H413]] thee, wilt thou be grieved? [[H3811]] but who [[H4310]] can [[H3201]] withhold [[H6113]] himself from speaking? [[H4405]]

### 3
Behold, [[H2009]] thou hast instructed [[H3256]] many, [[H7227]] and thou hast strengthened [[H2388]] the weak [[H7504]] hands. [[H3027]]

### 4
Thy words [[H4405]] have upholden [[H6965]] him that was falling, [[H3782]] and thou hast strengthened [[H553]] the feeble [[H3766]] knees. [[H1290]]

### 5
But [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] it is come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] thee, and thou faintest; [[H3811]] it toucheth [[H5060]] thee, and thou art troubled. [[H926]]

### 6
not [[H3808]] thy fear, [[H3374]] thy confidence, [[H3690]] thy hope, [[H8615]] and the uprightness [[H8537]] of thy ways? [[H1870]]

### 7
Remember, [[H2142]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] who [[H4310]] perished, [[H6]] being innocent? [[H5355]] or where [[H375]] were the righteous [[H3477]] cut off? [[H3582]]

### 8
Even as [[H834]] I have seen, [[H7200]] they that plow [[H2790]] iniquity, [[H205]] and sow [[H2232]] wickedness, [[H5999]] reap [[H7114]] the same. [[H7114]]

### 9
By the blast [[H5397]] of God [[H433]] they perish, [[H6]] and by the breath [[H7307]] of his nostrils [[H639]] are they consumed. [[H3615]]

### 10
The roaring [[H7581]] of the lion, [[H738]] and the voice [[H6963]] of the fierce lion, [[H7826]] and the teeth [[H8127]] of the young lions, [[H3715]] are broken. [[H5421]]

### 11
The old lion [[H3918]] perisheth [[H6]] for lack [[H1097]] of prey, [[H2964]] and the stout lion's [[H3833]] whelps [[H1121]] are scattered abroad. [[H6504]]

### 12
Now a thing [[H1697]] was secretly brought [[H1589]] to [[H413]] me, and mine ear [[H241]] received [[H3947]] a little [[H8102]] thereof. [[H4480]]

### 13
In thoughts [[H5587]] from the visions [[H2384]] of the night, [[H3915]] when deep sleep [[H8639]] falleth [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] men, [[H376]]

### 14
Fear [[H6343]] came upon [[H7122]] me, and trembling, [[H7460]] which made all [[H7230]] my bones [[H6106]] to shake. [[H6342]]

### 15
Then a spirit [[H7307]] passed [[H2498]] before [[H5921]] my face; [[H6440]] the hair [[H8185]] of my flesh [[H1320]] stood up: [[H5568]]

### 16
It stood still, [[H5975]] but I could not [[H3808]] discern [[H5234]] the form [[H4758]] thereof: an image [[H8544]] before [[H5048]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] silence, [[H1827]] and I heard [[H8085]] a voice, [[H6963]]

### 17
Shall mortal man [[H376]] be more just [[H6663]] than God? [[H433]] shall a man [[H1397]] be more pure [[H2891]] than his maker? [[H6213]]

### 18
Behold, [[H2005]] he put no trust [[H539]] in his servants; [[H5650]] and his angels [[H4397]] he charged [[H7760]] with folly: [[H8417]]

### 19
How much less [[H637]] them that dwell in [[H7931]] houses [[H1004]] of clay, [[H2563]] whose [[H834]] foundation [[H3247]] in the dust, [[H6083]] are crushed [[H1792]] before [[H6440]] the moth? [[H6211]]

### 20
They are destroyed [[H3807]] from morning [[H1242]] to evening: [[H6153]] they perish [[H6]] for ever [[H5331]] without any [[H1097]] regarding [[H7760]]

### 21
Doth not [[H3808]] their excellency [[H3499]] in them go away? [[H5265]] they die, [[H4191]] even without [[H3808]] wisdom. [[H2451]]
