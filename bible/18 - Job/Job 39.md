### 1
Knowest [[H3045]] thou the time [[H6256]] when the wild goats [[H3277]] of the rock [[H5553]] bring forth? [[H3205]] canst thou mark [[H8104]] when the hinds [[H355]] do calve? [[H2342]]

### 2
Canst thou number [[H5608]] the months [[H3391]] they fulfil? [[H4390]] or knowest [[H3045]] thou the time [[H6256]] when they bring forth? [[H3205]]

### 3
They bow [[H3766]] themselves, they bring forth [[H6398]] their young ones, [[H3206]] they cast out [[H7971]] their sorrows. [[H2256]]

### 4
Their young ones [[H1121]] are in good liking, [[H2492]] they grow up [[H7235]] with corn; [[H1250]] they go forth, [[H3318]] and return [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] unto them. [[H3808]]

### 5
Who [[H4310]] hath sent out [[H7971]] the wild ass [[H6501]] free? [[H2670]] or who [[H4310]] hath loosed [[H6605]] the bands [[H4147]] of the wild ass? [[H6171]]

### 6
Whose [[H834]] house [[H1004]] I have made [[H7760]] the wilderness, [[H6160]] and the barren land [[H4420]] his dwellings. [[H4908]]

### 7
He scorneth [[H7832]] the multitude [[H1995]] of the city, [[H7151]] neither [[H3808]] regardeth [[H8085]] he the crying [[H8663]] of the driver. [[H5065]]

### 8
The range [[H3491]] of the mountains [[H2022]] his pasture, [[H4829]] and he searcheth [[H1875]] after [[H310]] every [[H3605]] green thing. [[H3387]]

### 9
Will the unicorn [[H7214]] be willing [[H14]] to serve [[H5647]] thee, or [[H518]] abide [[H3885]] by [[H5921]] thy crib? [[H18]]

### 10
Canst thou bind [[H7194]] the unicorn [[H7214]] with his band [[H5688]] in the furrow? [[H8525]] or [[H518]] will he harrow [[H7702]] the valleys [[H6010]] after [[H310]] thee? [[H310]]

### 11
Wilt thou trust [[H982]] him, because [[H3588]] his strength [[H3581]] great? [[H7227]] or wilt thou leave [[H5800]] thy labour [[H3018]] to [[H413]] him? [[H413]]

### 12
Wilt thou believe [[H539]] him, that [[H3588]] he will bring home [[H7725]] thy seed, [[H2233]] and gather [[H622]] thy barn? [[H1637]]

### 13
the goodly [[H7443]] wings [[H3671]] unto the peacocks? [[H5965]] or [[H518]] wings [[H84]] and feathers [[H2624]] unto the ostrich? [[H5133]]

### 14
Which [[H3588]] leaveth [[H5800]] her eggs [[H1000]] in the earth, [[H776]] and warmeth [[H2552]] them in [[H5921]] dust, [[H6083]]

### 15
And forgetteth [[H7911]] that [[H3588]] the foot [[H7272]] may crush [[H2115]] them, or that the wild [[H7704]] beast [[H2416]] may break [[H1758]] them. [[H1758]]

### 16
She is hardened [[H7188]] against her young ones, [[H1121]] as though not [[H3808]] hers: her labour [[H3018]] is in vain [[H7385]] without [[H1097]] fear; [[H6343]]

### 17
Because [[H3588]] God [[H433]] hath deprived [[H5382]] her of wisdom, [[H2451]] neither [[H3808]] hath he imparted [[H2505]] to her understanding. [[H998]]

### 18
What time [[H6256]] she lifteth up herself [[H4754]] on high, [[H4791]] she scorneth [[H7832]] the horse [[H5483]] and his rider. [[H7392]]

### 19
Hast thou given [[H5414]] the horse [[H5483]] strength? [[H1369]] hast thou clothed [[H3847]] his neck [[H6677]] with thunder? [[H7483]]

### 20
Canst thou make him afraid [[H7493]] as a grasshopper? [[H697]] the glory [[H1935]] of his nostrils [[H5170]] terrible. [[H367]]

### 21
He paweth [[H2658]] in the valley, [[H6010]] and rejoiceth [[H7797]] in strength: [[H3581]] he goeth on [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] the armed men. [[H5402]]

### 22
He mocketh [[H7832]] at fear, [[H6343]] and is not [[H3808]] affrighted; [[H2865]] neither [[H3808]] turneth he back [[H7725]] from [[H6440]] the sword. [[H2719]]

### 23
The quiver [[H827]] rattleth [[H7439]] against [[H5921]] him, the glittering [[H3851]] spear [[H2595]] and the shield. [[H3591]]

### 24
He swalloweth [[H1572]] the ground [[H776]] with fierceness [[H7494]] and rage: [[H7267]] neither [[H3808]] believeth [[H539]] he that [[H3588]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet. [[H7782]]

### 25
He saith [[H559]] among [[H1767]] the trumpets, [[H7782]] Ha, ha; [[H1889]] and he smelleth [[H7306]] the battle [[H4421]] afar off, [[H7350]] the thunder [[H7482]] of the captains, [[H8269]] and the shouting. [[H8643]]

### 26
Doth the hawk [[H5322]] fly [[H82]] by thy wisdom, [[H998]] stretch [[H6566]] her wings [[H3671]] toward the south? [[H8486]]

### 27
Doth the eagle [[H5404]] mount up [[H1361]] at [[H5921]] thy command, [[H6310]] and make her nest [[H7064]] on high? [[H7311]]

### 28
She dwelleth [[H7931]] and abideth [[H3885]] on the rock, [[H5553]] upon [[H5921]] the crag [[H8127]] of the rock, [[H5553]] and the strong place. [[H4686]]

### 29
From thence [[H8033]] she seeketh [[H2658]] the prey, [[H400]] her eyes [[H5869]] behold [[H5027]] afar off. [[H7350]]

### 30
Her young ones [[H667]] also suck up [[H5966]] blood: [[H1818]] and where [[H834]] the slain [[H2491]] there [[H8033]] she. [[H1931]]
