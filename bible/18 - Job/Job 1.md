### 1
There was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] in the land [[H776]] of Uz, [[H5780]] whose name [[H8034]] Job; [[H347]] and that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] was [[H1961]] perfect [[H8535]] and upright, [[H3477]] and one that feared [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] and eschewed [[H5493]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 2
And there were born [[H3205]] unto him seven [[H7651]] sons [[H1121]] and three [[H7969]] daughters. [[H1323]]

### 3
His substance [[H4735]] also was [[H1961]] seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] sheep, [[H6629]] and three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] camels, [[H1581]] and five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] yoke [[H6776]] of oxen, [[H1241]] and five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] she asses, [[H860]] and a very [[H3966]] great [[H7227]] household; [[H5657]] so that this [[H1931]] man [[H376]] was [[H1961]] the greatest [[H1419]] of all [[H3605]] the men [[H1121]] of the east. [[H6924]]

### 4
And his sons [[H1121]] went [[H1980]] and feasted [[H4960]] houses, [[H1004]] every one [[H376]] his day; [[H3117]] and sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] for their three [[H7969]] sisters [[H269]] to eat [[H398]] and to drink [[H8354]] with [[H5973]] them. [[H5973]]

### 5
And it was [[H1961]] so, when [[H3588]] the days [[H3117]] of feasting [[H4960]] were gone about, [[H5362]] that Job [[H347]] sent [[H7971]] and sanctified [[H6942]] them, and rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the number [[H4557]] of them all: [[H3605]] for [[H3588]] Job [[H347]] said, [[H559]] It may be [[H194]] that my sons [[H1121]] have sinned, [[H2398]] and cursed [[H1288]] God [[H430]] in their hearts. [[H3824]] Thus [[H3602]] did [[H6213]] Job [[H347]] continually. [[H3117]]

### 6
Now there was [[H1961]] a day [[H3117]] when the sons [[H1121]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to present themselves [[H3320]] before [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and Satan [[H7854]] came [[H935]] also [[H1571]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] Whence [[H370]] comest [[H935]] thou? Then Satan [[H7854]] answered [[H6030]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] From going to and fro [[H7751]] in the earth, [[H776]] and from walking up and down [[H1980]] in it. [[H1980]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] Hast thou considered [[H7760]] my servant [[H5650]] Job, [[H347]] that [[H3588]] none [[H369]] like him [[H3644]] in the earth, [[H776]] a perfect [[H8535]] and an upright [[H3477]] man, [[H376]] one that feareth [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] and escheweth [[H5493]] evil? [[H7451]]

### 9
Then Satan [[H7854]] answered [[H6030]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] Doth Job [[H347]] fear [[H3372]] God [[H430]] for nought? [[H2600]]

### 10
Hast not [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] made an hedge [[H7753]] about [[H1157]] him, and about [[H1157]] his house, [[H1004]] and about [[H1157]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath on every side? [[H5439]] thou hast blessed [[H1288]] the work [[H4639]] of his hands, [[H3027]] and his substance [[H4735]] is increased [[H6555]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 11
But [[H199]] put forth [[H7971]] thine hand [[H3027]] now, [[H4994]] and touch [[H5060]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath, and [[H518]] he will curse [[H1288]] thee to [[H5921]] thy face. [[H6440]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] Behold, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath in thy power; [[H3027]] only [[H7535]] upon [[H413]] himself put not forth [[H7971]] thine hand. [[H3027]] So Satan [[H7854]] went forth [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And there was [[H1961]] a day [[H3117]] when his sons [[H1121]] and his daughters [[H1323]] eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] in their eldest [[H1060]] brother's [[H251]] house: [[H1004]]

### 14
And there came [[H935]] a messenger [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] Job, [[H347]] and said, [[H559]] The oxen [[H1241]] were [[H1961]] plowing, [[H2790]] and the asses [[H860]] feeding [[H7462]] beside [[H3027]] them: [[H5921]]

### 15
And the Sabeans [[H7614]] fell [[H5307]] and took them away; [[H3947]] yea, they have slain [[H5221]] the servants [[H5288]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword; [[H2719]] and I [[H589]] only [[H7535]] am escaped [[H4422]] alone [[H905]] to tell [[H5046]] thee. [[H5046]]

### 16
While he [[H2088]] yet [[H5750]] speaking, [[H1696]] there came [[H935]] also another, [[H2088]] and said, [[H559]] The fire [[H784]] of God [[H430]] is fallen [[H5307]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and hath burned up [[H1197]] the sheep, [[H6629]] and the servants, [[H5288]] and consumed [[H398]] them; and I [[H589]] only [[H7535]] am escaped [[H4422]] alone [[H905]] to tell [[H5046]] thee. [[H5046]]

### 17
While he [[H2088]] yet [[H5750]] speaking, [[H1696]] there came [[H935]] also another, [[H2088]] and said, [[H559]] The Chaldeans [[H3778]] made out [[H7760]] three [[H7969]] bands, [[H7218]] and fell [[H6584]] upon [[H5921]] the camels, [[H1581]] and have carried them away, [[H3947]] yea, and slain [[H5221]] the servants [[H5288]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword; [[H2719]] and I [[H589]] only [[H7535]] am escaped [[H4422]] alone [[H905]] to tell [[H5046]] thee. [[H5046]]

### 18
While he [[H2088]] yet [[H5750]] speaking, [[H1696]] there came [[H935]] also another, [[H2088]] and said, [[H559]] Thy sons [[H1121]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] in their eldest [[H1060]] brother's [[H251]] house: [[H1004]]

### 19
And, behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H935]] a great [[H1419]] wind [[H7307]] from [[H5676]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] and smote [[H5060]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H6438]] of the house, [[H1004]] and it fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] the young men, [[H5288]] and they are dead; [[H4191]] and I [[H589]] only [[H7535]] am escaped [[H4422]] alone [[H905]] to tell [[H5046]] thee. [[H5046]]

### 20
Then Job [[H347]] arose, [[H6965]] and rent [[H7167]] his mantle, [[H4598]] and shaved [[H1494]] his head, [[H7218]] and fell down [[H5307]] upon the ground, [[H776]] and worshipped, [[H7812]]

### 21
And said, [[H559]] Naked [[H6174]] came I out [[H3318]] of my mother's [[H517]] womb, [[H990]] and naked [[H6174]] shall I return [[H7725]] thither: [[H8033]] the Lord [[H3068]] gave, [[H5414]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath taken away; [[H3947]] blessed [[H1288]] be [[H1961]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
In all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] Job [[H347]] sinned [[H2398]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] charged [[H5414]] God [[H430]] foolishly. [[H8604]]
