### 1
Again there was [[H1961]] a day [[H3117]] when the sons [[H1121]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to present themselves [[H3320]] before [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and Satan [[H7854]] came [[H935]] also [[H1571]] among [[H8432]] them to present himself [[H3320]] before [[H5921]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] From whence [[H335]] comest [[H935]] thou? And Satan [[H7854]] answered [[H6030]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] From going to and fro [[H7751]] in the earth, [[H776]] and from walking up and down [[H1980]] in it. [[H1980]]

### 3
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] Hast thou [[H7760]] considered [[H3820]] my servant [[H5650]] Job, [[H347]] that [[H3588]] none [[H369]] like him [[H3644]] in the earth, [[H776]] a perfect [[H8535]] and an upright [[H3477]] man, [[H376]] one that feareth [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] and escheweth [[H5493]] evil? [[H7451]] and still [[H5750]] he holdeth fast [[H2388]] his integrity, [[H8538]] although thou movedst [[H5496]] me against him, to destroy [[H1104]] him without cause. [[H2600]]

### 4
And Satan [[H7854]] answered [[H6030]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] Skin [[H5785]] for skin, [[H5785]] yea, all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] a man [[H376]] hath will he give [[H5414]] for [[H1157]] his life. [[H5315]]

### 5
But [[H199]] put forth [[H7971]] thine hand [[H3027]] now, [[H4994]] and touch [[H5060]] his bone [[H6106]] and his flesh, [[H1320]] and [[H518]] he will curse [[H1288]] thee to [[H413]] thy face. [[H6440]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] Behold, [[H2005]] he in thine hand; [[H3027]] but [[H389]] save [[H8104]] his life. [[H5315]]

### 7
So went [[H3318]] Satan [[H7854]] forth from [[H853]] the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and smote [[H5221]] Job [[H347]] with sore [[H7451]] boils [[H7822]] from the sole [[H3709]] of his foot [[H7272]] unto [[H5704]] his crown. [[H6936]]

### 8
And he took [[H3947]] him a potsherd [[H2789]] to scrape himself [[H1623]] withal; and he [[H1931]] sat down [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] the ashes. [[H665]]

### 9
Then said [[H559]] his wife [[H802]] unto him, Dost thou still [[H5750]] retain [[H2388]] thine integrity? [[H8538]] curse [[H1288]] God, [[H430]] and die. [[H4191]]

### 10
But he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Thou speakest [[H1696]] as one [[H259]] of the foolish women [[H5036]] speaketh. [[H1696]] What? [[H1571]] shall we receive [[H6901]] good [[H2896]] at the hand [[H853]] of God, [[H430]] and shall we not [[H3808]] receive [[H6901]] evil? [[H7451]] In all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] did not [[H3808]] Job [[H347]] sin [[H2398]] with his lips. [[H8193]]

### 11
Now when Job's [[H347]] three [[H7969]] friends [[H7453]] heard [[H8085]] of all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] that was come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] him, they came [[H935]] every one [[H376]] from his own place; [[H4725]] Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite, [[H8489]] and Bildad [[H1085]] the Shuhite, [[H7747]] and Zophar [[H6691]] the Naamathite: [[H5284]] for they had made an appointment [[H3259]] together [[H3162]] to come [[H935]] to mourn [[H5110]] with him and to comfort [[H5162]] him. [[H5162]]

### 12
And when they lifted up [[H5375]] their eyes [[H5869]] afar off, [[H7350]] and knew [[H5234]] him not, [[H3808]] they lifted up [[H5375]] their voice, [[H6963]] and wept; [[H1058]] and they rent [[H7167]] every one [[H376]] his mantle, [[H4598]] and sprinkled [[H2236]] dust [[H6083]] upon [[H5921]] their heads [[H7218]] toward heaven. [[H8064]]

### 13
So they sat down [[H3427]] with [[H854]] him upon the ground [[H776]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] and seven [[H7651]] nights, [[H3915]] and none [[H369]] spake [[H1696]] a word [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] him: for [[H3588]] they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] grief [[H3511]] was very [[H3966]] great.
