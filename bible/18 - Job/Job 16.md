### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
I have heard [[H8085]] many [[H7227]]  such things: [[H428]] miserable [[H5999]] comforters [[H5162]] ye all. [[H3605]]

### 3
Shall vain [[H7307]] words [[H1697]] have an end? [[H7093]] or [[H176]] what [[H4100]] emboldeneth [[H4834]] thee that [[H3588]] thou answerest? [[H6030]]

### 4
I [[H595]] also [[H1571]] could speak [[H1696]] as ye if [[H3863]] your soul [[H5315]] were [[H3426]] in my soul's [[H5315]] stead, [[H8478]] I could heap up [[H2266]] words [[H4405]] against [[H5921]] you, and shake [[H5128]] mine head [[H7218]] at [[H1119]] you. [[H1119]]

### 5
I would strengthen [[H553]] you with [[H1119]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and the moving [[H5205]] of my lips [[H8193]] should asswage [[H2820]]

### 6
Though [[H518]] I speak, [[H1696]] my grief [[H3511]] is not [[H3808]] asswaged: [[H2820]] and I forbear, [[H2308]] what [[H4100]] am I eased? [[H1980]]

### 7
But [[H389]] now [[H6258]] he hath made me weary: [[H3811]] thou hast made desolate [[H8074]] all [[H3605]] my company. [[H5712]]

### 8
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, [[H7059]] is [[H1961]] a witness [[H5707]] and my leanness [[H3585]] rising up [[H6965]] in me beareth witness [[H6030]] to my face. [[H6440]]

### 9
He teareth [[H2963]] in his wrath, [[H639]] who hateth [[H7852]] me: he gnasheth [[H2786]] upon [[H5921]] me with his teeth; [[H8127]] mine enemy [[H6862]] sharpeneth [[H3913]] his eyes [[H5869]] upon me. [[H5869]]

### 10
They have gaped [[H6473]] upon [[H5921]] me with their mouth; [[H6310]] they have smitten [[H5221]] me upon the cheek [[H3895]] reproachfully; [[H2781]] they have gathered themselves [[H4390]] together [[H3162]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 11
God [[H410]] hath delivered [[H5462]] me to [[H413]] the ungodly, [[H5760]] and turned me over [[H3399]] into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 12
I was [[H1961]] at ease, [[H7961]] but he hath broken me asunder: [[H6565]] he hath also taken [[H270]] by my neck, [[H6203]] and shaken me to pieces, [[H6327]] and set me up [[H6965]] for his mark. [[H4307]]

### 13
His archers [[H7228]] compass me round about, [[H5437]] he cleaveth asunder, [[H6398]] my reins [[H3629]] and doth not [[H3808]] spare; [[H2550]] he poureth out [[H8210]] my gall [[H4845]] upon the ground. [[H776]]

### 14
He breaketh [[H6555]] me with breach [[H6556]] upon [[H6440]] breach, [[H6556]] he runneth [[H7323]] upon [[H5921]] me like a giant. [[H1368]]

### 15
I have sewed [[H8609]] sackcloth [[H8242]] upon [[H5921]] my skin, [[H1539]] and defiled [[H5953]] my horn [[H7161]] in the dust. [[H6083]]

### 16
My face [[H6440]] is foul [[H2560]] with [[H4480]] weeping, [[H1065]] and on [[H5921]] my eyelids [[H6079]] the shadow of death; [[H6757]]

### 17
Not [[H3808]] for [[H5921]] injustice [[H2555]] in mine hands: [[H3709]] also my prayer [[H8605]] pure. [[H2134]]

### 18
O earth, [[H776]] cover [[H3680]] not [[H408]] thou my blood, [[H1818]] and let my cry [[H2201]] have [[H1961]] no [[H408]] place. [[H4725]]

### 19
Also [[H1571]] now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] my witness [[H5707]] in heaven, [[H8064]] and my record [[H7717]] on high. [[H4791]]

### 20
My friends [[H7453]] scorn [[H3887]] me: mine eye [[H5869]] poureth out [[H1811]] unto [[H413]] God. [[H433]]

### 21
O that one might plead [[H3198]] for a man [[H1397]] with [[H5973]] God, [[H433]] as a man [[H120]] for his neighbour! [[H1121]]

### 22
When [[H3588]] a few [[H4557]] years [[H8141]] are come, [[H857]] then I shall go [[H1980]] the way [[H734]] I shall not [[H3808]] return. [[H7725]]
