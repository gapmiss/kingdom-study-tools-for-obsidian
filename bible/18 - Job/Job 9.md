### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
I know [[H3045]] so [[H3588]] of a truth: [[H551]] but how [[H4100]] should man [[H582]] be just [[H6663]] with [[H5973]] God? [[H410]]

### 3
If [[H518]] he will [[H2654]] contend [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] him, he cannot [[H3808]] answer [[H6030]] him one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] a thousand. [[H505]]

### 4
wise [[H2450]] in heart, [[H3824]] and mighty [[H533]] in strength: [[H3581]] who [[H4310]] hath hardened [[H7185]] against [[H413]] him, and hath prospered? [[H7999]]

### 5
Which removeth [[H6275]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and they know [[H3045]] not: [[H3808]] which [[H834]] overturneth [[H2015]] them in his anger. [[H639]]

### 6
Which shaketh [[H7264]] the earth [[H776]] out of her place, [[H4725]] and the pillars [[H5982]] thereof tremble. [[H6426]]

### 7
Which commandeth [[H559]] the sun, [[H2775]] and it riseth [[H2224]] not; [[H3808]] and sealeth up [[H2856]] the stars. [[H3556]]

### 8
Which alone [[H905]] spreadeth out [[H5186]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and treadeth [[H1869]] upon [[H5921]] the waves [[H1116]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 9
Which maketh [[H6213]] Arcturus, [[H5906]] Orion, [[H3685]] and Pleiades, [[H3598]] and the chambers [[H2315]] of the south. [[H8486]]

### 10
Which doeth [[H6213]] great things [[H1419]] past [[H369]] finding out; [[H2714]] yea, and wonders [[H6381]] without [[H5704]] number. [[H4557]]

### 11
Lo, [[H2005]] he goeth [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] me, and I see [[H7200]] not: [[H3808]] he passeth on [[H2498]] also, but I perceive [[H995]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 12
Behold, [[H2005]] he taketh away, [[H2862]] who [[H4310]] can hinder [[H7725]] him? who [[H4310]] will say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] doest [[H6213]] thou? [[H6213]]

### 13
God [[H433]] will not [[H3808]] withdraw [[H7725]] his anger, [[H639]] the proud [[H7293]] helpers [[H5826]] do stoop [[H7817]] under [[H8478]] him. [[H8478]]

### 14
How much less [[H637]] shall I [[H595]] answer [[H6030]] him, choose out [[H977]] my words [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] him? [[H5973]]

### 15
Whom, [[H834]] though [[H518]] I were righteous, [[H6663]] would I not [[H3808]] answer, [[H6030]] I would make supplication [[H2603]] to my judge. [[H8199]]

### 16
If [[H518]] I had called, [[H7121]] and he had answered [[H6030]] me; would I not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] that [[H3588]] he had hearkened [[H238]] unto my voice. [[H6963]]

### 17
For [[H834]] he breaketh [[H7779]] me with a tempest, [[H8183]] and multiplieth [[H7235]] my wounds [[H6482]] without cause. [[H2600]]

### 18
He will not [[H3808]] suffer [[H5414]] me to take [[H7725]] my breath, [[H7307]] but [[H3588]] filleth [[H7646]] me with bitterness. [[H4472]]

### 19
If [[H518]] of strength, [[H3581]] lo, [[H2009]] strong: [[H533]] and if [[H518]] of judgment, [[H4941]] who [[H4310]] shall set [[H3259]] me a time [[H3259]]

### 20
If [[H518]] I justify [[H6663]] myself, mine own mouth [[H6310]] shall condemn [[H7561]] me: I [[H589]] perfect, [[H8535]] it shall also prove me perverse. [[H6140]]

### 21
I [[H589]] perfect, [[H8535]] would I not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] my soul: [[H5315]] I would despise [[H3988]] my life. [[H2416]]

### 22
This [[H1931]] one [[H259]] therefore [[H5921]] I said [[H559]] He [[H1931]] destroyeth [[H3615]] the perfect [[H8535]] and the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 23
If [[H518]] the scourge [[H7752]] slay [[H4191]] suddenly, [[H6597]] he will laugh [[H3932]] at the trial [[H4531]] of the innocent. [[H5355]]

### 24
The earth [[H776]] is given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked: [[H7563]] he covereth [[H3680]] the faces [[H6440]] of the judges [[H8199]] thereof; if [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] where, [[H645]] who [[H4310]] he? [[H1931]]

### 25
Now my days [[H3117]] are swifter [[H7043]] than [[H4480]] a post: [[H7323]] they flee away, [[H1272]] they see [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] good. [[H2896]]

### 26
They are passed away [[H2498]] as [[H5973]] the swift [[H16]] ships: [[H591]] as the eagle [[H5404]] hasteth [[H2907]] to [[H5921]] the prey. [[H400]]

### 27
If [[H518]] I say, [[H559]] I will forget [[H7911]] my complaint, [[H7879]] I will leave off [[H5800]] my heaviness, [[H6440]] and comfort [[H1082]]

### 28
I am afraid [[H3025]] of all [[H3605]] my sorrows, [[H6094]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] hold me innocent. [[H5352]]

### 29
I [[H595]] be wicked, [[H7561]] why [[H4100]] then [[H2088]] labour [[H3021]] I in vain? [[H1892]]

### 30
If [[H518]] I wash myself [[H7364]] with [[H1119]] snow water, [[H7950]] and make my hands [[H3709]] never [[H1253]] so clean; [[H2141]]

### 31
Yet [[H227]] shalt thou plunge [[H2881]] me in the ditch, [[H7845]] and mine own clothes [[H8008]] shall abhor [[H8581]] me. [[H8581]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] a man, [[H376]] as I [[H3644]] I should answer [[H6030]] him, we should come [[H935]] together [[H3162]] in judgment. [[H4941]]

### 33
Neither [[H3808]] is there [[H3426]] any daysman [[H3198]] betwixt [[H996]] us, might lay [[H7896]] his hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] us both. [[H8147]]

### 34
Let him take [[H5493]] his rod [[H7626]] away from [[H5921]] me, and let not [[H408]] his fear [[H367]] terrify [[H1204]] me: [[H1204]]

### 35
would I speak, [[H1696]] and not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] him; but [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] so [[H3651]] with [[H5978]] me. [[H5978]]
