### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Even [[H1571]] to day [[H3117]] my complaint [[H7879]] bitter: [[H4805]] my stroke [[H3027]] is heavier [[H3513]] than [[H5921]] my groaning. [[H585]]

### 3
Oh that [[H5414]] I knew [[H3045]] where I might find [[H4672]] him! I might come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] his seat! [[H8499]]

### 4
I would order [[H6186]] cause [[H4941]] before [[H6440]] him, and fill [[H4390]] my mouth [[H6310]] with arguments. [[H8433]]

### 5
I would know [[H3045]] the words [[H4405]] he would answer [[H6030]] me, and understand [[H995]] what [[H4100]] he would say [[H559]] unto me. [[H559]]

### 6
Will he plead [[H7378]] against [[H5978]] me with great [[H7230]] power? [[H3581]] No; [[H3808]] but [[H389]] he [[H1931]] would put [[H7760]] in me. [[H7760]]

### 7
There [[H8033]] the righteous [[H3477]] might dispute [[H3198]] with [[H5973]] him; so should I be delivered [[H6403]] for ever [[H5331]] from my judge. [[H8199]]

### 8
Behold, [[H2005]] I go [[H1980]] forward, [[H6924]] but he not [[H369]] and backward, [[H268]] but I cannot [[H3808]] perceive [[H995]] him: [[H995]]

### 9
On the left hand, [[H8040]] where he doth work, [[H6213]] but I cannot [[H3808]] behold [[H2372]] he hideth [[H5848]] himself on the right hand, [[H3225]] that I cannot [[H3808]] see [[H7200]]

### 10
But [[H3588]] he knoweth [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] that I take: [[H5978]] he hath tried [[H974]] me, I shall come forth [[H3318]] as gold. [[H2091]]

### 11
My foot [[H7272]] hath held [[H270]] his steps, [[H838]] his way [[H1870]] have I kept, [[H8104]] and not [[H3808]] declined. [[H5186]]

### 12
Neither [[H3808]] have I gone back [[H4185]] from the commandment [[H4687]] of his lips; [[H8193]] I have esteemed [[H6845]] the words [[H561]] of his mouth [[H6310]] more than my necessary [[H2706]]

### 13
But he [[H1931]] in one [[H259]] and who [[H4310]] can turn [[H7725]] him? and his soul [[H5315]] desireth, [[H183]] even he doeth. [[H6213]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] he performeth [[H7999]] appointed [[H2706]] for me: and many [[H7227]] such [[H2007]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 15
Therefore [[H5921]] am I troubled [[H926]] at his presence: [[H6440]] when I consider, [[H995]] I am afraid [[H6342]] of [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 16
For God [[H410]] maketh my heart [[H3820]] soft, [[H7401]] and the Almighty [[H7706]] troubleth [[H926]] me: [[H926]]

### 17
Because [[H3588]] I was not [[H3808]] cut off [[H6789]] before [[H6440]] the darkness, [[H2822]] hath he covered [[H3680]] the darkness [[H652]] from my face. [[H6440]]
