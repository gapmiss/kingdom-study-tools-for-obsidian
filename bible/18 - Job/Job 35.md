### 1
Elihu [[H453]] spake [[H6030]] moreover, and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Thinkest [[H2803]] thou this [[H2063]] to be right, [[H4941]] thou saidst, [[H559]] My righteousness [[H6664]] more than God's? [[H410]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thou saidst, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] advantage [[H5532]] will it be unto thee? What [[H4100]] profit [[H3276]] shall I have, from my sin? [[H2403]]

### 4
I [[H589]] will answer [[H7725]] thee, and thy companions [[H7453]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 5
Look [[H5027]] unto the heavens, [[H8064]] and see; [[H7200]] and behold [[H7789]] the clouds [[H7834]] are higher [[H1361]] than [[H4480]] thou. [[H4480]]

### 6
If [[H518]] thou sinnest, [[H2398]] what [[H4100]] doest [[H6466]] thou against him? or thy transgressions [[H6588]] be multiplied, [[H7231]] what [[H4100]] doest [[H6213]] thou unto him? [[H6213]]

### 7
If [[H518]] thou be righteous, [[H6663]] what [[H4100]] givest [[H5414]] thou him? or [[H176]] what [[H4100]] receiveth [[H3947]] he of thine hand? [[H3027]]

### 8
Thy wickedness [[H7562]] a man [[H376]] as thou [[H3644]] and thy righteousness [[H6666]] the son [[H1121]] of man. [[H120]]

### 9
By reason of the multitude [[H7230]] of oppressions [[H6217]] they make to cry: [[H2199]] they cry out [[H7768]] by reason of the arm [[H2220]] of the mighty. [[H7227]]

### 10
But none [[H3808]] saith, [[H559]] Where [[H346]] God [[H433]] my maker, [[H6213]] who giveth [[H5414]] songs [[H2158]] in the night; [[H3915]]

### 11
Who teacheth [[H502]] us more than the beasts [[H929]] of the earth, [[H776]] and maketh us wiser [[H2449]] than the fowls [[H5775]] of heaven? [[H8064]]

### 12
There [[H8033]] they cry, [[H6817]] but none [[H3808]] giveth answer, [[H6030]] because [[H6440]] of the pride [[H1347]] of evil men. [[H7451]]

### 13
Surely [[H389]] God [[H410]] will not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] vanity, [[H7723]] neither [[H3808]] will the Almighty [[H7706]] regard [[H7789]] it. [[H7789]]

### 14
Although [[H637]] thou sayest [[H559]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] see [[H7789]] him, judgment [[H1779]] before [[H6440]] him; therefore trust [[H2342]] thou in him. [[H2342]]

### 15
But now, [[H6258]] because [[H3588]] not [[H369]] he hath visited [[H6485]] in his anger; [[H639]] yet he knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] in great [[H3966]] extremity: [[H6580]]

### 16
Therefore doth Job [[H347]] open [[H6475]] his mouth [[H6310]] in vain; [[H1892]] he multiplieth [[H3527]] words [[H4405]] without [[H1097]] knowledge. [[H1847]]
