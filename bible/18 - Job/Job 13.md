### 1
Lo, [[H2005]] mine eye [[H5869]] hath seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] mine ear [[H241]] hath heard [[H8085]] and understood [[H995]] it. [[H995]]

### 2
What ye know, [[H1847]] do I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] also: [[H1571]] I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] inferior [[H5307]] unto [[H4480]] you. [[H4480]]

### 3
Surely [[H199]] I [[H589]] would speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Almighty, [[H7706]] and I desire [[H2654]] to reason [[H3198]] with [[H413]] God. [[H410]]

### 4
But [[H199]] ye [[H859]] forgers [[H2950]] of lies, [[H8267]] ye all [[H3605]] physicians [[H7495]] of no value. [[H457]]

### 5
O that ye would [[H5414]] altogether [[H2790]] hold your peace! [[H2790]] and it should be [[H1961]] your wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 6
Hear [[H8085]] now [[H4994]] my reasoning, [[H8433]] and hearken [[H7181]] to the pleadings [[H7379]] of my lips. [[H8193]]

### 7
Will ye speak [[H1696]] wickedly [[H5766]] for God? [[H410]] and talk [[H1696]] deceitfully [[H7423]] for him? [[H7423]]

### 8
Will ye accept [[H5375]] his person? [[H6440]] will ye contend [[H7378]] for God? [[H410]]

### 9
Is it good [[H2896]] that [[H3588]] he should search you out? [[H2713]] or [[H518]] as one man [[H376]] mocketh [[H2048]] another, do ye mock [[H2048]] him? [[H2048]]

### 10
He will surely [[H3198]] reprove [[H3198]] you, if [[H518]] ye do secretly [[H5643]] accept [[H5375]] persons. [[H6440]]

### 11
Shall not [[H3808]] his excellency [[H7613]] make you afraid? [[H1204]] and his dread [[H6343]] fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] you? [[H5921]]

### 12
Your remembrances [[H2146]] like [[H4912]] unto ashes, [[H665]] your bodies [[H1354]] to bodies [[H1354]] of clay. [[H2563]]

### 13
Hold your peace, [[H2790]] let me alone, [[H4480]] that I [[H589]] may speak, [[H1696]] and let come [[H5674]] on [[H5921]] me what [[H4100]]

### 14
Wherefore [[H5921]] do I take [[H5375]] my flesh [[H1320]] in my teeth, [[H8127]] and put [[H7760]] my life [[H5315]] in mine hand? [[H3709]]

### 15
Though [[H2005]] he slay [[H6991]] me, yet will I trust [[H3176]] in him: but [[H389]] I will maintain [[H3198]] mine own ways [[H1870]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H413]]

### 16
He [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] my salvation: [[H3444]] for [[H3588]] an hypocrite [[H2611]] shall not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 17
Hear [[H8085]] diligently [[H8085]] my speech, [[H4405]] and my declaration [[H262]] with your ears. [[H241]]

### 18
Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I have ordered [[H6186]] cause; [[H4941]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] shall be justified. [[H6663]]

### 19
Who [[H4310]] he [[H1931]] will plead [[H7378]] with [[H5978]] me? for [[H3588]] now, [[H6258]] if I hold my tongue, [[H2790]] I shall give up the ghost. [[H1478]]

### 20
Only [[H389]] do [[H6213]] not [[H408]] two [[H8147]] unto [[H5978]] me: then [[H227]] will I not [[H3808]] hide myself [[H5641]] from [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 21
Withdraw [[H7368]] thine hand [[H3709]] far from [[H5921]] me: and let not [[H408]] thy dread [[H367]] make me afraid. [[H1204]]

### 22
Then call [[H7121]] thou, and I [[H595]] will answer: [[H6030]] or [[H176]] let me speak, [[H1696]] and answer [[H7725]] thou me. [[H7725]]

### 23
How [[H4100]] many mine iniquities [[H5771]] and sins? [[H2403]] make me to know [[H3045]] my transgression [[H6588]] and my sin. [[H2403]]

### 24
Wherefore [[H4100]] hidest [[H5641]] thou thy face, [[H6440]] and holdest [[H2803]] me for thine enemy? [[H341]]

### 25
Wilt thou break [[H6206]] a leaf [[H5929]] driven to and fro? [[H5086]] and wilt thou pursue [[H7291]] the dry [[H3002]] stubble? [[H7179]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] thou writest [[H3789]] bitter things [[H4846]] against [[H5921]] me, and makest me to possess [[H3423]] the iniquities [[H5771]] of my youth. [[H5271]]

### 27
Thou puttest [[H7760]] my feet [[H7272]] also in the stocks, [[H5465]] and lookest narrowly [[H8104]] unto all [[H3605]] my paths; [[H734]] thou settest a print [[H2707]] upon [[H5921]] the heels [[H8328]] of my feet. [[H7272]]

### 28
And he, [[H1931]] as a rotten thing, [[H7538]] consumeth, [[H1086]] as a garment [[H899]] that is moth [[H6211]] eaten. [[H398]]
