### 1
Then Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite [[H8489]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
Can a man [[H1397]] be profitable [[H5532]] unto God, [[H410]] as he that [[H3588]] is wise [[H7919]] may be profitable [[H5532]] unto himself? [[H5921]]

### 3
any pleasure [[H2656]] to the Almighty, [[H7706]] that [[H3588]] thou art righteous? [[H6663]] or [[H518]] gain [[H1215]] that [[H3588]] thou makest thy ways [[H1870]] perfect? [[H8552]]

### 4
Will he reprove [[H3198]] thee for fear [[H3374]] of thee? will he enter [[H935]] with [[H5973]] thee into judgment? [[H4941]]

### 5
not [[H3808]] thy wickedness [[H7451]] great? [[H7227]] and thine iniquities [[H5771]] infinite? [[H7093]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] thou hast taken a pledge [[H2254]] from thy brother [[H251]] for nought, [[H2600]] and stripped [[H6584]] the naked [[H6174]] of their clothing. [[H899]]

### 7
Thou hast not [[H3808]] given water [[H4325]] to the weary [[H5889]] to drink, [[H8248]] and thou hast withholden [[H4513]] bread [[H3899]] from the hungry. [[H7457]]

### 8
But the mighty [[H2220]] man, [[H376]] he had the earth; [[H776]] and the honourable man [[H5375]] dwelt [[H3427]] in it. [[H3427]]

### 9
Thou hast sent [[H7971]] widows [[H490]] away empty, [[H7387]] and the arms [[H2220]] of the fatherless [[H3490]] have been broken. [[H1792]]

### 10
Therefore [[H5921]] snares [[H6341]] round about [[H5439]] thee, and sudden [[H6597]] fear [[H6343]] troubleth [[H926]] thee; [[H926]]

### 11
Or [[H176]] darkness, [[H2822]] thou canst not [[H3808]] see; [[H7200]] and abundance [[H8229]] of waters [[H4325]] cover [[H3680]] thee. [[H3680]]

### 12
not [[H3808]] God [[H433]] in the height [[H1363]] of heaven? [[H8064]] and behold [[H7200]] the height [[H7218]] of the stars, [[H3556]] how [[H3588]] high [[H7311]] they are! [[H7311]]

### 13
And thou sayest, [[H559]] How [[H4100]] doth God [[H410]] know? [[H3045]] can he judge [[H8199]] through [[H1157]] the dark cloud? [[H6205]]

### 14
Thick clouds [[H5645]] a covering [[H5643]] to him, that he seeth [[H7200]] not; [[H3808]] and he walketh [[H1980]] in the circuit [[H2329]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 15
Hast thou marked [[H8104]] the old [[H5769]] way [[H734]] which [[H834]] wicked [[H205]] men [[H4962]] have trodden? [[H1869]]

### 16
Which [[H834]] were cut down [[H7059]] out of [[H3808]] time, [[H6256]] whose foundation [[H3247]] was overflown [[H3332]] with a flood: [[H5104]]

### 17
Which said [[H559]] unto God, [[H410]] Depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] us: and what [[H4100]] can the Almighty [[H7706]] do [[H6466]] for them? [[H6466]]

### 18
Yet he [[H1931]] filled [[H4390]] their houses [[H1004]] with good [[H2896]] but the counsel [[H6098]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 19
The righteous [[H6662]] see [[H7200]] and are glad: [[H8055]] and the innocent [[H5355]] laugh them to scorn. [[H3932]]

### 20
Whereas [[H518]] our substance [[H7009]] is not [[H3808]] cut down, [[H3582]] but the remnant [[H3499]] of them the fire [[H784]] consumeth. [[H398]]

### 21
Acquaint [[H5532]] now [[H4994]] thyself with [[H5973]] him, and be at peace: [[H7999]] thereby good [[H2896]] shall come [[H935]] unto thee. [[H935]]

### 22
Receive, [[H3947]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] the law [[H8451]] from his mouth, [[H6310]] and lay up [[H7760]] his words [[H561]] in thine heart. [[H3824]]

### 23
If [[H518]] thou return [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the Almighty, [[H7706]] thou shalt be built up, [[H1129]] thou shalt put away [[H7368]] iniquity [[H5766]] far from thy tabernacles. [[H168]]

### 24
Then shalt thou lay up [[H7896]] gold [[H1220]] as [[H5921]] dust, [[H6083]] and the of Ophir [[H211]] as the stones [[H6697]] of the brooks. [[H5158]]

### 25
Yea, the Almighty [[H7706]] shall be [[H1961]] thy defence, [[H1220]] and thou shalt have plenty [[H8443]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] then [[H227]] shalt thou have thy delight [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] the Almighty, [[H7706]] and shalt lift up [[H5375]] thy face [[H6440]] unto [[H413]] God. [[H433]]

### 27
Thou shalt make thy prayer [[H6279]] unto [[H413]] him, and he shall hear [[H8085]] thee, and thou shalt pay [[H7999]] thy vows. [[H5088]]

### 28
Thou shalt also decree [[H1504]] a thing, [[H562]] and it shall be established [[H6965]] unto thee: and the light [[H216]] shall shine [[H5050]] upon [[H5921]] thy ways. [[H1870]]

### 29
When [[H3588]] are cast down, [[H8213]] then thou shalt say, [[H559]] lifting up; [[H1466]] and he shall save [[H3467]] the humble [[H7807]] person. [[H5869]]

### 30
He shall deliver [[H4422]] the island [[H336]] of the innocent: [[H5355]] and it is delivered [[H4422]] by the pureness [[H1252]] of thine hands. [[H3709]]
