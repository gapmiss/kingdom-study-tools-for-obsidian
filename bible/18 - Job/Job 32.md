### 1
So these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] men [[H582]] ceased [[H7673]] to answer [[H6030]] Job, [[H347]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] righteous [[H6662]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]]

### 2
Then was kindled [[H2734]] the wrath [[H639]] of Elihu [[H453]] the son [[H1121]] of Barachel [[H1292]] the Buzite, [[H940]] of the kindred [[H4940]] of Ram: [[H7410]] against Job [[H347]] was his wrath [[H639]] kindled, [[H2734]] because [[H5921]] he justified [[H6663]] himself [[H5315]] rather than God. [[H430]]

### 3
Also against his three [[H7969]] friends [[H7453]] was his wrath [[H639]] kindled, [[H2734]] because [[H5921]] they had found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] answer, [[H4617]] and had condemned [[H7561]] Job. [[H347]]

### 4
Now Elihu [[H453]] had waited [[H2442]]  till [[H853]] Job [[H347]] had spoken, [[H1697]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] elder [[H2205]] than [[H4480]] he. [[H4480]]

### 5
When Elihu [[H453]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] no [[H369]] answer [[H4617]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of three [[H7969]] men, [[H376]] then his wrath [[H639]] was kindled. [[H2734]]

### 6
And Elihu [[H453]] the son [[H1121]] of Barachel [[H1292]] the Buzite [[H940]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] young, [[H6810]] and ye [[H859]] very old; [[H3453]] wherefore [[H5921]] I was afraid, [[H2119]] and durst [[H3372]] not shew [[H2331]] you mine opinion. [[H1843]]

### 7
I said, [[H559]] Days [[H3117]] should speak, [[H1696]] and multitude [[H7230]] of years [[H8141]] should teach [[H3045]] wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 8
But [[H403]] a spirit [[H7307]] in man: [[H582]] and the inspiration [[H5397]] of the Almighty [[H7706]] giveth them understanding. [[H995]]

### 9
Great men [[H7227]] are not [[H3808]] wise: [[H2449]] neither do the aged [[H2205]] understand [[H995]] judgment. [[H4941]]

### 10
Therefore [[H3651]] I said, [[H559]] Hearken [[H8085]] to me; I [[H589]] also [[H637]] will shew [[H2331]] mine opinion. [[H1843]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2005]] I waited [[H3176]] for your words; [[H1697]] I gave ear [[H238]] to [[H5704]] your reasons, [[H8394]] whilst [[H5704]] ye searched out [[H2713]] what to say. [[H4405]]

### 12
Yea, I attended [[H995]] unto [[H5704]] you, and, behold, [[H2009]] none [[H369]] of [[H4480]] you that convinced [[H3198]] Job, [[H347]] that answered [[H6030]] his words: [[H561]]

### 13
Lest [[H6435]] ye should say, [[H559]] We have found out [[H4672]] wisdom: [[H2451]] God [[H410]] thrusteth him down, [[H5086]] not [[H3808]] man. [[H376]]

### 14
Now he hath not [[H3808]] directed [[H6186]] words [[H4405]] against [[H413]] me: neither [[H3808]] will I answer [[H7725]] him with your speeches. [[H561]]

### 15
They were amazed, [[H2865]] they answered [[H6030]] no [[H3808]] more: [[H5750]] they left off [[H6275]] speaking. [[H4405]]

### 16
When I had waited, [[H3176]] (for [[H3588]] they spake [[H1696]] not, [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] stood still, [[H5975]] answered [[H6030]] no [[H3808]] more;) [[H5750]]

### 17
I [[H589]] will answer [[H6030]] also [[H637]] my part, [[H2506]] I [[H589]] also [[H637]] will shew [[H2331]] mine opinion. [[H1843]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] I am full [[H4390]] of matter, [[H4405]] the spirit [[H7307]] within [[H990]] me constraineth [[H6693]] me. [[H6693]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2009]] my belly [[H990]] as wine [[H3196]] hath no [[H3808]] vent; [[H6605]] it is ready to burst [[H1234]] like new [[H2319]] bottles. [[H178]]

### 20
I will speak, [[H1696]] that I may be refreshed: [[H7304]] I will open [[H6605]] my lips [[H8193]] and answer. [[H6030]]

### 21
Let me not, [[H408]] I pray you, [[H4994]] accept [[H5375]] any man's [[H376]] person, [[H6440]] neither [[H3808]] let me give flattering titles [[H3655]] unto [[H413]] man. [[H120]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] to give flattering titles; [[H3655]] my maker [[H6213]] would soon [[H4592]] take me away. [[H5375]]
