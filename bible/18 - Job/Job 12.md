### 1
And Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
No doubt [[H551]] but [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] the people, [[H5971]] and wisdom [[H2451]] shall die [[H4191]] with [[H5973]] you. [[H5973]]

### 3
But [[H1571]] I have understanding [[H3824]] as well as you; [[H3644]] I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] inferior [[H5307]] to [[H4480]] you: yea, [[H854]] who [[H4310]] knoweth not [[H369]] such things [[H3644]] as these? [[H428]]

### 4
I am [[H1961]] one mocked [[H7814]] of his neighbour, [[H7453]] who calleth [[H7121]] upon God, [[H433]] and he answereth [[H6030]] him: the just [[H6662]] upright [[H8549]] laughed to scorn. [[H7814]]

### 5
He that is ready [[H3559]] to slip [[H4571]] with feet [[H7272]] a lamp [[H3940]] despised [[H937]] in the thought [[H6248]] of him that is at ease. [[H7600]]

### 6
The tabernacles [[H168]] of robbers [[H7703]] prosper, [[H7951]] and they that provoke [[H7264]] God [[H410]] are secure; [[H987]] into whose [[H834]] hand [[H3027]] God [[H433]] bringeth [[H935]]

### 7
But [[H199]] ask [[H7592]] now [[H4994]] the beasts, [[H929]] and they shall teach [[H3384]] thee; and the fowls [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and they shall tell [[H5046]] thee: [[H5046]]

### 8
Or [[H176]] speak [[H7878]] to the earth, [[H776]] and it shall teach [[H3384]] thee: and the fishes [[H1709]] of the sea [[H3220]] shall declare [[H5608]] unto thee. [[H5608]]

### 9
Who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] in all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] that [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath wrought [[H6213]] this? [[H2063]]

### 10
In whose [[H834]] hand [[H3027]] the soul [[H5315]] of every [[H3605]] living thing, [[H2416]] and the breath [[H7307]] of all [[H3605]] mankind. [[H376]]

### 11
Doth not [[H3808]] the ear [[H241]] try [[H974]] words? [[H4405]] and the mouth [[H2441]] taste [[H2938]] his meat? [[H400]]

### 12
With the ancient [[H3453]] wisdom; [[H2451]] and in length [[H753]] of days [[H3117]] understanding. [[H8394]]

### 13
With [[H5973]] him wisdom [[H2451]] and strength, [[H1369]] he hath counsel [[H6098]] and understanding. [[H8394]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2005]] he breaketh down, [[H2040]] and it cannot [[H3808]] be built again: [[H1129]] he shutteth up [[H5462]] a man, [[H376]] and there can be no opening. [[H6605]]

### 15
Behold, [[H2005]] he withholdeth [[H6113]] the waters, [[H4325]] and they dry up: [[H3001]] also he sendeth them out, [[H7971]] and they overturn [[H2015]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 16
With [[H5973]] him strength [[H5797]] and wisdom: [[H8454]] the deceived [[H7683]] and the deceiver [[H7686]] his. [[H7686]]

### 17
He leadeth [[H1980]] counsellers [[H3289]] away spoiled, [[H7758]] and maketh the judges [[H8199]] fools. [[H1984]]

### 18
He looseth [[H6605]] the bond [[H4148]] of kings, [[H4428]] and girdeth [[H631]] their loins [[H4975]] with a girdle. [[H232]]

### 19
He leadeth [[H1980]] princes [[H3548]] away spoiled, [[H7758]] and overthroweth [[H5557]] the mighty. [[H386]]

### 20
He removeth away [[H5493]] the speech [[H8193]] of the trusty, [[H539]] and taketh away [[H3947]] the understanding [[H2940]] of the aged. [[H2205]]

### 21
He poureth [[H8210]] contempt [[H937]] upon [[H5921]] princes, [[H5081]] and weakeneth [[H7503]] the strength [[H4206]] of the mighty. [[H650]]

### 22
He discovereth [[H1540]] deep things [[H6013]] out of [[H4480]] darkness, [[H2822]] and bringeth out [[H3318]] to light [[H216]] the shadow of death. [[H6757]]

### 23
He increaseth [[H7679]] the nations, [[H1471]] and destroyeth [[H6]] them: he enlargeth [[H7849]] the nations, [[H1471]] and straiteneth [[H5148]] them [[H5148]]

### 24
He taketh away [[H5493]] the heart [[H3820]] of the chief [[H7218]] of the people [[H5971]] of the earth, [[H776]] and causeth them to wander [[H8582]] in a wilderness [[H8414]] no [[H3808]] way. [[H1870]]

### 25
They grope [[H4959]] in the dark [[H2822]] without [[H3808]] light, [[H216]] and he maketh them to stagger [[H8582]] like drunken [[H7910]]
