### 1
At this [[H2063]] also [[H637]] my heart [[H3820]] trembleth, [[H2729]] and is moved out [[H5425]] of his place. [[H4725]]

### 2
Hear [[H8085]] attentively [[H8085]] the noise [[H7267]] of his voice, [[H6963]] and the sound [[H1899]] goeth out [[H3318]] of his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 3
He directeth it [[H3474]] under [[H8478]] the whole [[H3605]] heaven, [[H8064]] and his lightning [[H216]] unto [[H5921]] the ends [[H3671]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 4
After [[H310]] it a voice [[H6963]] roareth: [[H7580]] he thundereth [[H7481]] with the voice [[H6963]] of his excellency; [[H1347]] and he will not [[H3808]] stay [[H6117]] them when [[H3588]] his voice [[H6963]] is heard. [[H8085]]

### 5
God [[H410]] thundereth [[H7481]] marvellously [[H6381]] with his voice; [[H6963]] great things [[H1419]] doeth [[H6213]] he, which we cannot [[H3808]] comprehend. [[H3045]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] he saith [[H559]] to the snow, [[H7950]] Be thou [[H1933]] the earth; [[H776]] likewise to the small [[H4306]] rain, [[H1653]] and to the great [[H4306]] rain [[H1653]] of his strength. [[H5797]]

### 7
He sealeth up [[H2856]] the hand [[H3027]] of every [[H3605]] man; [[H120]] that all [[H3605]] men [[H376]] may know [[H3045]] his work. [[H4639]]

### 8
Then the beasts [[H2416]] go [[H935]] into [[H1119]] dens, [[H695]] and remain [[H7931]] in their places. [[H4585]]

### 9
Out of [[H4480]] the south [[H2315]] cometh [[H935]] the whirlwind: [[H5492]] and cold [[H7135]] out of the north. [[H4215]]

### 10
By the breath [[H5397]] of God [[H410]] frost [[H7140]] is given: [[H5414]] and the breadth [[H7341]] of the waters [[H4325]] is straitened. [[H4164]]

### 11
Also [[H637]] by watering [[H7377]] he wearieth [[H2959]] the thick cloud: [[H5645]] he scattereth [[H6327]] his bright [[H216]] cloud: [[H6051]]

### 12
And it [[H1931]] is turned [[H2015]] round about [[H4524]] by his counsels: [[H8458]] that they may do [[H6467]] whatsoever [[H3605]] he commandeth [[H6680]] them upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the world [[H8398]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 13
He causeth it to come, [[H4672]] whether [[H518]] for correction, [[H7626]] or [[H518]] for his land, [[H776]] or [[H518]] for mercy. [[H2617]]

### 14
Hearken [[H238]] unto this, [[H2063]] O Job: [[H347]] stand still, [[H5975]] and consider [[H995]] the wondrous [[H6381]] works of God. [[H410]]

### 15
Dost thou know [[H3045]] when God [[H433]] disposed [[H7760]] them, and caused the light [[H216]] of his cloud [[H6051]] to shine? [[H3313]]

### 16
Dost thou know [[H3045]] the balancings [[H4657]] of the clouds, [[H5645]] the wondrous works [[H4652]] of him which is perfect [[H8549]] in knowledge? [[H1843]]

### 17
How [[H834]] thy garments [[H899]] warm, [[H2525]] when he quieteth [[H8252]] the earth [[H776]] by the south [[H1864]]

### 18
Hast thou with [[H5973]] him spread out [[H7554]] the sky, [[H7834]] strong, [[H2389]] as a molten [[H3332]] looking glass? [[H7209]]

### 19
Teach [[H3045]] us what [[H4100]] we shall say [[H559]] unto him; we cannot [[H3808]] order [[H6186]] by reason [[H6440]] of darkness. [[H2822]]

### 20
Shall it be told [[H5608]] him that [[H3588]] I speak? [[H1696]] if [[H518]] a man [[H376]] speak, [[H559]] surely [[H3588]] he shall be swallowed up. [[H1104]]

### 21
And now [[H6258]] see [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] the bright [[H925]] light [[H216]] which [[H1931]] in the clouds: [[H7834]] but the wind [[H7307]] passeth, [[H5674]] and cleanseth [[H2891]] them. [[H2891]]

### 22
Fair weather [[H2091]] cometh [[H857]] out of the north: [[H6828]] with [[H5921]] God [[H433]] terrible [[H3372]] majesty. [[H1935]]

### 23
the Almighty, [[H7706]] we cannot [[H3808]] find him out: [[H4672]] excellent [[H7689]] in power, [[H3581]] and in judgment, [[H4941]] and in plenty [[H7230]] of justice: [[H6666]] he will not [[H3808]] afflict. [[H6031]]

### 24
Men [[H582]] do therefore [[H3651]] fear [[H3372]] him: he respecteth [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] wise [[H2450]] of heart. [[H3820]]
