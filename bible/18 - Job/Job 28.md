### 1
Surely [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a vein [[H4161]] for the silver, [[H3701]] and a place [[H4725]] for gold [[H2091]] they fine [[H2212]]

### 2
Iron [[H1270]] is taken [[H3947]] out of the earth, [[H6083]] and brass [[H5154]] molten [[H6694]] the stone. [[H68]]

### 3
He setteth [[H7760]] an end [[H7093]] to darkness, [[H2822]] and searcheth out [[H2713]] all [[H3605]] perfection: [[H8503]] the stones [[H68]] of darkness, [[H652]] and the shadow of death. [[H6757]]

### 4
The flood [[H5158]] breaketh out [[H6555]] from [[H5973]] the inhabitant; [[H1481]] forgotten [[H7911]] of [[H4480]] the foot: [[H7272]] they are dried up, [[H1809]] they are gone away [[H5128]] from men. [[H582]]

### 5
the earth, [[H776]] out of [[H4480]] it cometh [[H3318]] bread: [[H3899]] and under [[H8478]] it is turned up [[H2015]] as it were [[H3644]] fire. [[H784]]

### 6
The stones [[H68]] of it the place [[H4725]] of sapphires: [[H5601]] and it hath dust [[H6083]] of gold. [[H2091]]

### 7
a path [[H5410]] which no [[H3808]] fowl [[H5861]] knoweth, [[H3045]] and which the vulture's [[H344]] eye [[H5869]] hath not [[H3808]] seen: [[H7805]]

### 8
The lion's [[H7830]] whelps [[H1121]] have not [[H3808]] trodden [[H1869]] it, nor [[H3808]] the fierce lion [[H7826]] passed [[H5710]] by [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 9
He putteth forth [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] upon the rock; [[H2496]] he overturneth [[H2015]] the mountains [[H2022]] by the roots. [[H8328]]

### 10
He cutteth out [[H1234]] rivers [[H2975]] among the rocks; [[H6697]] and his eye [[H5869]] seeth [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] precious thing. [[H3366]]

### 11
He bindeth [[H2280]] the floods [[H5104]] from overflowing; [[H1065]] and hid [[H8587]] bringeth he forth [[H3318]] to light. [[H216]]

### 12
But where [[H370]] shall wisdom [[H2451]] be found? [[H4672]] and where [[H335]] the place [[H4725]] of understanding? [[H998]]

### 13
Man [[H582]] knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the price [[H6187]] thereof; neither [[H3808]] is it found [[H4672]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 14
The depth [[H8415]] saith, [[H559]] It [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] in me: and the sea [[H3220]] saith, [[H559]] not [[H369]] with [[H5978]] me. [[H5978]]

### 15
It cannot [[H3808]] be gotten [[H5414]] for gold, [[H5458]] neither [[H3808]] shall silver [[H3701]] be weighed [[H8254]] the price [[H4242]] thereof. [[H4242]]

### 16
It cannot [[H3808]] be valued [[H5541]] with the gold [[H3800]] of Ophir, [[H211]] with the precious [[H3368]] onyx, [[H7718]] or the sapphire. [[H5601]]

### 17
The gold [[H2091]] and the crystal [[H2137]] cannot [[H3808]] equal [[H6186]] it: and the exchange [[H8545]] of it jewels [[H3627]] of fine gold. [[H6337]]

### 18
No [[H3808]] mention [[H2142]] shall be made of coral, [[H7215]] or of pearls: [[H1378]] for the price [[H4901]] of wisdom [[H2451]] above rubies. [[H6443]]

### 19
The topaz [[H6357]] of Ethiopia [[H3568]] shall not [[H3808]] equal [[H6186]] it, neither [[H3808]] shall it be valued [[H5541]] with pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H3800]]

### 20
Whence [[H370]] then cometh [[H935]] wisdom? [[H2451]] and where [[H335]] the place [[H4725]] of understanding? [[H998]]

### 21
Seeing it is hid [[H5956]] from the eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] living, [[H2416]] and kept close [[H5641]] from the fowls [[H5775]] of the air. [[H8064]]

### 22
Destruction [[H11]] and death [[H4194]] say, [[H559]] We have heard [[H8085]] the fame [[H8088]] thereof with our ears. [[H241]]

### 23
God [[H430]] understandeth [[H995]] the way [[H1870]] thereof, and he [[H1931]] knoweth [[H3045]] the place [[H4725]] thereof. [[H4725]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] looketh [[H5027]] to the ends [[H7098]] of the earth, [[H776]] seeth [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the whole [[H3605]] heaven; [[H8064]]

### 25
To make [[H6213]] the weight [[H4948]] for the winds; [[H7307]] and he weigheth [[H8505]] the waters [[H4325]] by measure. [[H4060]]

### 26
When he made [[H6213]] a decree [[H2706]] for the rain, [[H4306]] and a way [[H1870]] for the lightning [[H2385]] of the thunder: [[H6963]]

### 27
Then [[H227]] did he see [[H7200]] it, and declare [[H5608]] it; he prepared [[H3559]] it, yea, [[H1571]] and searched it out. [[H2713]]

### 28
And unto man [[H120]] he said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord, [[H136]] that [[H1931]] wisdom; [[H2451]] and to depart [[H5493]] from evil [[H7451]] understanding. [[H998]]
