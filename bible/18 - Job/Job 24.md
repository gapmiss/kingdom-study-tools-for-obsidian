[[Job 23|←]] • [[Job 25|→]]

---

### 1
Why, [[H4069]] seeing times [[H6256]] are not [[H3808]] hidden [[H6845]] from the Almighty, [[H7706]] do they that know [[H3045]] him not [[H3808]] see [[H2372]] his days? [[H3117]]

### 2
remove [[H5381]] the landmarks; [[H1367]] they violently take away [[H1497]] flocks, [[H5739]] and feed [[H7462]]

### 3
They drive away [[H5090]] the ass [[H2543]] of the fatherless, [[H3490]] they take [[H2254]] the widow's [[H490]] ox [[H7794]] for a pledge. [[H7794]]

### 4
They turn [[H5186]] the needy [[H34]] out of the way: [[H1870]] the poor [[H6035]] of the earth [[H776]] hide [[H2244]] themselves together. [[H3162]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2005]] wild asses [[H6501]] in the desert, [[H4057]] go they forth [[H3318]] to their work; [[H6467]] rising betimes [[H7836]] for a prey: [[H2964]] the wilderness [[H6160]] food [[H3899]] for them for children. [[H5288]]

### 6
They reap [[H7114]] his corn [[H1098]] in the field: [[H7704]] and they gather [[H3953]] the vintage [[H3754]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 7
They cause the naked [[H6174]] to lodge [[H3885]] without [[H1097]] clothing, [[H3830]] that no [[H369]] covering [[H3682]] in the cold. [[H7135]]

### 8
They are wet [[H7372]] with the showers [[H2230]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] and embrace [[H2263]] the rock [[H6697]] for want [[H1097]] of a shelter. [[H4268]]

### 9
They pluck [[H1497]] the fatherless [[H3490]] from the breast, [[H7699]] and take a pledge [[H2254]] of [[H5921]] the poor. [[H6041]]

### 10
They cause to go [[H1980]] naked [[H6174]] without [[H1097]] clothing, [[H3830]] and they take away [[H5375]] the sheaf [[H6016]] the hungry; [[H7457]]

### 11
make oil [[H6671]] within [[H996]] their walls, [[H7791]] tread [[H1869]] winepresses, [[H3342]] and suffer thirst. [[H6770]]

### 12
Men [[H4962]] groan [[H5008]] from out of the city, [[H5892]] and the soul [[H5315]] of the wounded [[H2491]] crieth out: [[H7768]] yet God [[H433]] layeth [[H7760]] not [[H3808]] folly [[H8604]]

### 13
They [[H1992]] are [[H1961]] of those that rebel [[H4775]] against the light; [[H216]] they know [[H5234]] not [[H3808]] the ways [[H1870]] thereof, nor [[H3808]] abide [[H3427]] in the paths [[H5410]] thereof. [[H5410]]

### 14
The murderer [[H7523]] rising [[H6965]] with the light [[H216]] killeth [[H6991]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] and in the night [[H3915]] is [[H1961]] as a thief. [[H1590]]

### 15
The eye [[H5869]] also of the adulterer [[H5003]] waiteth [[H8104]] for the twilight, [[H5399]] saying, [[H559]] No [[H3808]] eye [[H5869]] shall see [[H7789]] me: and disguiseth [[H5643]] face. [[H6440]]

### 16
In the dark [[H2822]] they dig through [[H2864]] houses, [[H1004]] they had marked [[H2856]] for themselves in the daytime: [[H3119]] they know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the light. [[H216]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] the morning [[H1242]] to them even as [[H3162]] the shadow of death: [[H6757]] if [[H3588]] know [[H5234]] the terrors [[H1091]] of the shadow of death. [[H6757]]

### 18
He [[H1931]] swift [[H7031]] as [[H5921]] the waters; [[H6440]] their portion [[H2513]] is cursed [[H7043]] in the earth: [[H776]] he beholdeth [[H6437]] not [[H3808]] the way [[H1870]] of the vineyards. [[H3754]]

### 19
Drought [[H6723]] and [[H1571]] heat [[H2527]] consume [[H1497]] the snow [[H7950]] waters: [[H4325]] the grave [[H7585]] have sinned. [[H2398]]

### 20
The womb [[H7358]] shall forget [[H7911]] him; the worm [[H7415]] shall feed sweetly [[H4988]] on him; he shall be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] remembered; [[H2142]] and wickedness [[H5766]] shall be broken [[H7665]] as a tree. [[H6086]]

### 21
He evil entreateth [[H7462]] the barren [[H6135]] beareth [[H3205]] not: [[H3808]] and doeth not [[H3808]] good [[H3190]] to the widow. [[H490]]

### 22
He draweth [[H4900]] also the mighty [[H47]] with his power: [[H3581]] he riseth up, [[H6965]] and no [[H3808]] is sure [[H539]] of life. [[H2416]]

### 23
it be given [[H5414]] him in safety, [[H983]] whereon he resteth; [[H8172]] yet his eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] their ways. [[H1870]]

### 24
They are exalted [[H7426]] for a little while, [[H4592]] but are gone [[H369]] and brought low; [[H4355]] they are taken out of the way [[H7092]] as all [[H3605]] and cut off [[H5243]] as the tops [[H7218]] of the ears of corn. [[H7641]]

### 25
And if [[H518]] not [[H3808]] now, [[H645]] who [[H4310]] will make me a liar, [[H3576]] and make [[H7760]] my speech [[H4405]] nothing worth? [[H408]]
