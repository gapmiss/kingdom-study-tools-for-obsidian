### 1
Then answered [[H6030]] Bildad [[H1085]] the Shuhite, [[H7747]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
How [[H575]] long [[H5704]] wilt thou speak [[H4448]] these [[H428]] and the words [[H561]] of thy mouth [[H6310]] a strong [[H3524]] wind? [[H7307]]

### 3
Doth God [[H410]] pervert [[H5791]] judgment? [[H4941]] or [[H518]] doth the Almighty [[H7706]] pervert [[H5791]] justice? [[H6664]]

### 4
If [[H518]] thy children [[H1121]] have sinned [[H2398]] against him, and he have cast them away [[H7971]] for [[H3027]] their transgression; [[H6588]]

### 5
If [[H518]] thou [[H859]] wouldest seek [[H7836]] unto [[H413]] God [[H410]] betimes, and make thy supplication [[H2603]] to [[H413]] the Almighty; [[H7706]]

### 6
If [[H518]] thou [[H859]] pure [[H2134]] and upright; [[H3477]] surely [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] he would awake [[H5782]] for [[H5921]] thee, and make the habitation [[H5116]] of thy righteousness [[H6664]] prosperous. [[H7999]]

### 7
Though thy beginning [[H7225]] was [[H1961]] small, [[H4705]] yet thy latter end [[H319]] should greatly [[H3966]] increase. [[H7685]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] inquire, [[H7592]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] of the former [[H7223]] age, [[H1755]] and prepare [[H3559]] thyself to the search [[H2714]] of their fathers: [[H1]]

### 9
(For [[H3588]] we [[H587]] yesterday, [[H8543]] and know [[H3045]] nothing, [[H3808]] because [[H3588]] our days [[H3117]] upon [[H5921]] earth [[H776]] a shadow:) [[H6738]]

### 10
Shall not [[H3808]] they [[H1992]] teach [[H3384]] thee, tell [[H559]] thee, and utter [[H3318]] words [[H4405]] out of their heart? [[H3820]]

### 11
Can the rush [[H1573]] grow up [[H1342]] without [[H3808]] mire? [[H1207]] can the flag [[H260]] grow [[H7685]] without [[H1097]] water? [[H4325]]

### 12
Whilst it yet [[H5750]] in his greenness, [[H3]] not [[H3808]] cut down, [[H6998]] it withereth [[H3001]] before [[H6440]] any [[H3605]] herb. [[H2682]]

### 13
So [[H3651]] the paths [[H734]] of all [[H3605]] that forget [[H7911]] God; [[H410]] and the hypocrite's [[H2611]] hope [[H8615]] shall perish: [[H6]]

### 14
Whose [[H834]] hope [[H3689]] shall be cut off, [[H6990]] and whose trust [[H4009]] a spider's [[H5908]] web. [[H1004]]

### 15
He shall lean [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] his house, [[H1004]] but it shall not [[H3808]] stand: [[H5975]] he shall hold [[H2388]] it fast, but it shall not [[H3808]] endure. [[H6965]]

### 16
He [[H1931]] green [[H7373]] before [[H6440]] the sun, [[H8121]] and his branch [[H3127]] shooteth forth [[H3318]] in [[H5921]] his garden. [[H1593]]

### 17
His roots [[H8328]] are wrapped about [[H5440]] the heap, [[H1530]] seeth [[H2372]] the place [[H1004]] of stones. [[H68]]

### 18
If [[H518]] he destroy [[H1104]] him from his place, [[H4725]] then shall deny [[H3584]] him, I have not [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] thee. [[H7200]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2005]] this [[H1931]] the joy [[H4885]] of his way, [[H1870]] and out of the earth [[H6083]] shall others [[H312]] grow. [[H6779]]

### 20
Behold, [[H2005]] God [[H410]] will not [[H3808]] cast away [[H3988]] a perfect [[H8535]] neither [[H3808]] will he help [[H2388]] the evil doers: [[H7489]]

### 21
Till [[H5704]] he fill [[H4390]] thy mouth [[H6310]] with laughing, [[H7814]] and thy lips [[H8193]] with rejoicing. [[H8643]]

### 22
They that hate [[H8130]] thee shall be clothed [[H3847]] with shame; [[H1322]] and the dwelling place [[H168]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall come to nought. [[H369]]
