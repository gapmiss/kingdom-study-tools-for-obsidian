[[Job 16|←]] • [[Job 18|→]]

### 1
My breath [[H7307]] is corrupt, [[H2254]] my days [[H3117]] are extinct, [[H2193]] the graves [[H6913]] for me. [[H6913]]

### 2
not [[H3808]] mockers [[H2049]] with [[H5978]] me? and doth not mine eye [[H5869]] continue [[H3885]] in their provocation? [[H4784]]

### 3
Lay down [[H7760]] now, [[H4994]] put me in a surety [[H6148]] with [[H5973]] thee; who [[H4310]] he [[H1931]] will strike [[H8628]] hands [[H3027]] with me? [[H3027]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thou hast hid [[H6845]] their heart [[H3820]] from understanding: [[H7922]] therefore [[H3651]] shalt thou not [[H3808]] exalt [[H7311]]

### 5
He that speaketh [[H5046]] flattery [[H2506]] to friends, [[H7453]] even the eyes [[H5869]] of his children [[H1121]] shall fail. [[H3615]]

### 6
He hath made [[H3322]] me also a byword [[H4914]] of the people; [[H5971]] and aforetime [[H6440]] I was [[H1961]] as a tabret. [[H8611]]

### 7
Mine eye [[H5869]] also is dim [[H3543]] by reason of sorrow, [[H3708]] and all [[H3605]] my members [[H3338]] as a shadow. [[H6738]]

### 8
Upright [[H3477]] shall be astonied [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] and the innocent [[H5355]] shall stir up himself [[H5782]] against [[H5921]] the hypocrite. [[H2611]]

### 9
The righteous [[H6662]] also shall hold [[H270]] on his way, [[H1870]] and he that hath clean [[H2891]] hands [[H3027]] shall be [[H3254]] stronger and stronger. [[H555]]

### 10
But [[H199]] as for you all, [[H3605]] do ye return, [[H7725]] and come now: [[H935]] for I cannot [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] wise [[H2450]] among you. [[H2450]]

### 11
My days [[H3117]] are past, [[H5674]] my purposes [[H2154]] are broken off, [[H5423]] the thoughts [[H4180]] of my heart. [[H3824]]

### 12
They change [[H7760]] the night [[H3915]] into day: [[H3117]] the light [[H216]] short [[H7138]] because [[H6440]] of darkness. [[H2822]]

### 13
If [[H518]] I wait, [[H6960]] the grave [[H7585]] mine house: [[H1004]] I have made [[H7502]] my bed [[H3326]] in the darkness. [[H2822]]

### 14
I have said [[H7121]] to corruption, [[H7845]] Thou [[H859]] my father: [[H1]] to the worm, [[H7415]] my mother, [[H517]] and my sister. [[H269]]

### 15
And where [[H346]] now [[H645]] my hope? [[H8615]] as for my hope, [[H8615]] who [[H4310]] shall see [[H7789]] it? [[H7789]]

### 16
They shall go down [[H3381]] to the bars [[H905]] of the pit, [[H7585]] when [[H518]] rest [[H5183]] together [[H3162]] in [[H5921]] the dust. [[H6083]]
