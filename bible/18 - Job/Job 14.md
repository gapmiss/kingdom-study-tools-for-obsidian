### 1
Man [[H120]] born [[H3205]] of a woman [[H802]] of few [[H7116]] days, [[H3117]] and full [[H7649]] of trouble. [[H7267]]

### 2
He cometh forth [[H3318]] like a flower, [[H6731]] and is cut down: [[H5243]] he fleeth [[H1272]] also as a shadow, [[H6738]] and continueth [[H5975]] not. [[H3808]]

### 3
And [[H637]] dost thou open [[H6491]] thine eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] such an one, [[H2088]] and bringest [[H935]] me into judgment [[H4941]] with [[H5973]] thee? [[H5973]]

### 4
Who [[H4310]] can bring [[H5414]] a clean [[H2889]] out of an unclean? [[H2931]] not [[H3808]] one. [[H259]]

### 5
Seeing [[H518]] his days [[H3117]] determined, [[H2782]] the number [[H4557]] of his months [[H2320]] with [[H854]] thee, thou hast appointed [[H6213]] his bounds [[H2706]] that he cannot [[H3808]] pass; [[H5674]]

### 6
Turn [[H8159]] from [[H5921]] him, that he may rest, [[H2308]] till [[H5704]] he shall accomplish, [[H7521]] as an hireling, [[H7916]] his day. [[H3117]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] hope [[H8615]] of a tree, [[H6086]] if [[H518]] it be cut down, [[H3772]] that it will sprout again, [[H2498]] and that the tender branch [[H3127]] thereof will not [[H3808]] cease. [[H2308]]

### 8
Though [[H518]] the root [[H8328]] thereof wax old [[H2204]] in the earth, [[H776]] and the stock [[H1503]] thereof die [[H4191]] in the ground; [[H6083]]

### 9
through the scent [[H7381]] of water [[H4325]] it will bud, [[H6524]] and bring forth [[H6213]] boughs [[H7105]] like [[H3644]] a plant. [[H5194]]

### 10
But man [[H1397]] dieth, [[H4191]] and wasteth away: [[H2522]] yea, man [[H120]] giveth up the ghost, [[H1478]] and where [[H346]] he? [[H346]]

### 11
the waters [[H4325]] fail [[H235]] from [[H4480]] the sea, [[H3220]] and the flood [[H5104]] decayeth [[H2717]] and drieth up: [[H3001]]

### 12
So man [[H376]] lieth down, [[H7901]] and riseth [[H6965]] not: [[H3808]] till [[H5704]] the heavens [[H8064]] no more, [[H1115]] they shall not [[H3808]] awake, [[H6974]] nor [[H3808]] be raised out [[H5782]] of their sleep. [[H8142]]

### 13
O [[H4310]] that thou wouldest [[H5414]] hide [[H6845]] me in the grave, [[H7585]] that thou wouldest keep me secret, [[H5641]] until [[H5704]] thy wrath [[H639]] be past, [[H7725]] that thou wouldest appoint [[H7896]] me a set time, [[H2706]] and remember [[H2142]] me! [[H2142]]

### 14
If [[H518]] a man [[H1397]] die, [[H4191]] shall he live [[H2421]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of my appointed time [[H6635]] will I wait, [[H3176]] till [[H5704]] my change [[H2487]] come. [[H935]]

### 15
Thou shalt call, [[H7121]] and I [[H595]] will answer [[H6030]] thee: thou wilt have a desire [[H3700]] to the work [[H4639]] of thine hands. [[H3027]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] thou numberest [[H5608]] my steps: [[H6806]] dost thou not [[H3808]] watch [[H8104]] over [[H5921]] my sin? [[H2403]]

### 17
My transgression [[H6588]] sealed up [[H2856]] in a bag, [[H6872]] and thou sewest up [[H2950]] mine iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 18
And surely [[H199]] the mountain [[H2022]] falling [[H5307]] cometh to nought, [[H5034]] and the rock [[H6697]] is removed [[H6275]] out of his place. [[H4725]]

### 19
The waters [[H4325]] wear [[H7833]] the stones: [[H68]] thou washest away [[H7857]] the things which grow [[H5599]] of the dust [[H6083]] of the earth; [[H776]] and thou destroyest [[H6]] the hope [[H8615]] of man. [[H582]]

### 20
Thou prevailest [[H8630]] for ever [[H5331]] against him, and he passeth: [[H1980]] thou changest [[H8138]] his countenance, [[H6440]] and sendest him away. [[H7971]]

### 21
His sons [[H1121]] come to honour, [[H3513]] and he knoweth [[H3045]] not; [[H3808]] and they are brought low, [[H6819]] but he perceiveth [[H995]] not [[H3808]] of them. [[H3926]]

### 22
But [[H389]] his flesh [[H1320]] upon [[H5921]] him shall have pain, [[H3510]] and his soul [[H5315]] within [[H5921]] him shall mourn. [[H56]]
