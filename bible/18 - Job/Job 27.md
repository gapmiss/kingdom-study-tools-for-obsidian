### 1
Moreover [[H3254]] Job [[H347]] continued [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]]

### 2
God [[H410]] liveth, [[H2416]] hath taken away [[H5493]] my judgment; [[H4941]] and the Almighty, [[H7706]] hath vexed [[H4843]] my soul; [[H5315]]

### 3
All [[H3605]] the while [[H5750]] my breath [[H5397]] in me, and the spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H433]] in my nostrils; [[H639]]

### 4
My lips [[H8193]] shall not [[H518]] speak [[H1696]] wickedness, [[H5766]] nor [[H518]] my tongue [[H3956]] utter [[H1897]] deceit. [[H7423]]

### 5
God forbid [[H2486]] that [[H518]] I should justify [[H6663]] you: till [[H5704]] I die [[H1478]] I will not [[H3808]] remove [[H5493]] mine integrity [[H8538]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 6
My righteousness [[H6666]] I hold fast, [[H2388]] and will not [[H3808]] let it go: [[H7503]] my heart [[H3824]] shall not [[H3808]] reproach [[H2778]] so long as I live. [[H3117]]

### 7
Let mine enemy [[H341]] be [[H1961]] as the wicked, [[H7563]] and he that riseth up against [[H6965]] me as the unrighteous. [[H5767]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] the hope [[H8615]] of the hypocrite, [[H2611]] though [[H3588]] he hath gained, [[H1214]] when [[H3588]] God [[H433]] taketh away [[H7953]] his soul? [[H5315]]

### 9
Will God [[H410]] hear [[H8085]] his cry [[H6818]] when [[H3588]] trouble [[H6869]] cometh [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] him? [[H5921]]

### 10
Will he delight himself [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] the Almighty? [[H7706]] will he always [[H6256]] call upon [[H7121]] God? [[H433]]

### 11
I will teach [[H3384]] you by the hand [[H3027]] of God: [[H410]] which [[H834]] with [[H5973]] the Almighty [[H7706]] will I not [[H3808]] conceal. [[H3582]]

### 12
Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] ye yourselves [[H859]] have seen [[H2372]] why [[H4100]] then are ye thus [[H2088]] altogether [[H1892]] vain? [[H1891]]

### 13
This [[H2088]] the portion [[H2506]] of a wicked [[H7563]] man [[H120]] with [[H5973]] God, [[H410]] and the heritage [[H5159]] of oppressors, [[H6184]] they shall receive [[H3947]] of the Almighty. [[H7706]]

### 14
If [[H518]] his children [[H1121]] be multiplied, [[H7235]] for [[H3926]] the sword: [[H2719]] and his offspring [[H6631]] shall not [[H3808]] be satisfied [[H7646]] with bread. [[H3899]]

### 15
Those that remain [[H8300]] of him shall be buried [[H6912]] in death: [[H4194]] and his widows [[H490]] shall not [[H3808]] weep. [[H1058]]

### 16
Though [[H518]] he heap up [[H6651]] silver [[H3701]] as the dust, [[H6083]] and prepare [[H3559]] raiment [[H4403]] as the clay; [[H2563]]

### 17
He may prepare [[H3559]] but the just [[H6662]] shall put on, [[H3847]] and the innocent [[H5355]] shall divide [[H2505]] the silver. [[H3701]]

### 18
He buildeth [[H1129]] his house [[H1004]] as a moth, [[H6211]] and as a booth [[H5521]] the keeper [[H5341]] maketh. [[H6213]]

### 19
The rich man [[H6223]] shall lie down, [[H7901]] but he shall not [[H3808]] be gathered: [[H622]] he openeth [[H6491]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and he not. [[H369]]

### 20
Terrors [[H1091]] take hold [[H5381]] on him as waters, [[H4325]] a tempest [[H5492]] stealeth him away [[H1589]] in the night. [[H3915]]

### 21
The east wind [[H6921]] carrieth him away, [[H5375]] and he departeth: [[H1980]] and as a storm hurleth [[H8175]] him out of his place. [[H4725]]

### 22
For shall cast [[H7993]] upon [[H5921]] him, and not [[H3808]] spare: [[H2550]] he would fain [[H1272]] flee [[H1272]] out of his hand. [[H3027]]

### 23
shall clap [[H5606]] their hands [[H3709]] at [[H5921]] him, and shall hiss [[H8319]] him out of his place. [[H4725]]
