And Rehoboam [[H7346]] went [[H1980]] to Shechem: [[H7927]] for [[H3588]] to Shechem [[H7927]] were all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] come [[H935]] to make him king. [[H4427]]

### 2
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] who [[H1931]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] whither [[H834]] he had fled [[H1272]] from the presence [[H6440]] of Solomon [[H8010]] the king, [[H4428]] heard [[H8085]] that Jeroboam [[H3379]] returned [[H7725]] out of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 3
And they sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] him. So Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] and spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam, [[H7346]] saying, [[H559]]

### 4
Thy father [[H1]]  made [[H853]] our yoke [[H5923]] grievous: [[H7185]] now [[H6258]] therefore ease [[H7043]] thou somewhat the grievous [[H7186]] servitude [[H5656]] of thy father, [[H1]] and his heavy [[H3515]] yoke [[H5923]] that [[H834]] he put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] us, and we will serve [[H5647]] thee. [[H5647]]

### 5
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Come again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] me after [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]] And the people [[H5971]] departed. [[H1980]]

### 6
And king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] took counsel [[H3289]] with [[H854]] the old men [[H2205]] that [[H834]] had [[H1961]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Solomon [[H8010]] his father [[H1]] while he yet lived, [[H2416]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H349]] counsel give [[H3289]] ye [[H859]] to return [[H7725]] answer [[H1697]] to this [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]]

### 7
And they spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou be [[H1961]] kind [[H2896]] to this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and please [[H7521]] them, and speak [[H1696]] good [[H2896]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] them, they will be [[H1961]] thy servants [[H5650]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 8
But he forsook [[H5800]] the counsel [[H6098]] which [[H834]] the old men [[H2205]] gave [[H3289]] him, and took counsel [[H3289]] with [[H854]] the young men [[H3206]] that [[H834]] were brought up [[H1431]] with [[H854]] him, that stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 9
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, What [[H4100]] advice give [[H3289]] ye [[H859]] that we may return [[H7725]] answer [[H1697]] to this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] have spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] Ease [[H7043]] somewhat [[H4480]] the yoke [[H5923]] that [[H834]] thy father [[H1]] did put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] us? [[H5921]]

### 10
And the young men [[H3206]] that [[H834]] were brought up [[H1431]] with [[H854]] him spake [[H1696]] unto [[H854]] him, saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] shalt thou answer [[H559]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Thy father [[H1]] made our yoke [[H5923]] heavy, [[H3513]] but make thou somewhat lighter [[H7043]] for [[H5921]] us; thus [[H3541]] shalt thou say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, My little [[H6995]] shall be thicker [[H5666]] than my father's [[H1]] loins. [[H4975]]

### 11
For whereas [[H6258]] my father [[H1]] put [[H6006]] a heavy [[H3515]] yoke [[H5923]] upon [[H5921]] you, I [[H589]] will put more [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] your yoke: [[H5923]] my father [[H1]] chastised [[H3256]] you with whips, [[H7752]] but I [[H589]] with scorpions. [[H6137]]

### 12
So Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] as [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] bade, [[H1696]] saying, [[H559]] Come again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] me on the third [[H7992]] day. [[H3117]]

### 13
And the king [[H4428]] answered [[H6030]] them roughly; [[H7186]] and king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] forsook [[H5800]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the old men, [[H2205]]

### 14
And answered [[H1696]] them after the advice [[H6098]] of the young men, [[H3206]] saying, [[H559]] My father [[H1]] made your yoke [[H5923]] heavy, [[H3513]] but I [[H589]] will add [[H3254]] thereto: [[H5921]] my father [[H1]] chastised [[H3256]] you with whips, [[H7752]] but I [[H589]] with scorpions. [[H6137]]

### 15
So the king [[H4428]] hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] the people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] the cause [[H5252]] was [[H1961]] of [[H5973]] God, [[H430]] that [[H4616]] the Lord [[H3068]] might perform [[H6965]] his word, [[H1697]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Ahijah [[H281]] the Shilonite [[H7888]] to [[H413]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat. [[H5028]]

### 16
And when all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] would not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto them, the people [[H5971]] answered [[H7725]] the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] portion [[H2506]] have we in David? [[H1732]] and none [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] in the son [[H1121]] of Jesse: [[H3448]] every man [[H376]] to your tents, [[H168]] O Israel: [[H3478]] now, [[H6258]] David, [[H1732]] see [[H7200]] to thine own house. [[H1004]] So all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] to their tents. [[H168]]

### 17
But the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 18
Then king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] sent [[H7971]] Hadoram [[H1913]] that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the tribute; [[H4522]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] stoned [[H7275]] him with stones, [[H68]] that he died. [[H4191]] But king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] made speed [[H553]] to get him up [[H5927]] to chariot, [[H4818]] to flee [[H5127]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 19
And Israel [[H3478]] rebelled [[H6586]] against the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]
