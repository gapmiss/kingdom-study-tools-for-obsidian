### 1
Ahaz [[H271]] twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] sixteen [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] but he did [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] like David [[H1732]] his father: [[H1]]

### 2
For he walked [[H3212]] in the ways [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and made [[H6213]] also [[H1571]] molten images [[H4541]] for Baalim. [[H1168]]

### 3
Moreover he [[H1931]] burnt incense [[H6999]] in the valley [[H1516]] of the son [[H1121]] of Hinnom, [[H2011]] and burnt [[H1197]] his children [[H1121]] in the fire, [[H784]] after the abominations [[H8441]] of the heathen [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had cast out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
He sacrificed [[H2076]] also and burnt incense [[H6999]] in the high places, [[H1116]] and on [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree. [[H6086]]

### 5
Wherefore the Lord [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] delivered [[H5414]] him into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Syria; [[H758]] and they smote [[H5221]] him, and carried away [[H7617]] a great multitude [[H1419]] of [[H4480]] them captives, [[H7633]] and brought [[H935]] to Damascus. [[H1834]] And he was also [[H1571]] delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who smote [[H5221]] him with a great [[H1419]] slaughter. [[H4347]]

### 6
For Pekah [[H6492]] the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah [[H7425]] slew [[H2026]] in Judah [[H3063]] an hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] in one [[H259]] day, [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] valiant [[H2428]] men; [[H1121]] because they had forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 7
And Zichri, [[H2147]] a mighty man [[H1368]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] slew [[H2026]] Maaseiah [[H4641]] the king's [[H4428]] son, [[H1121]] and Azrikam [[H5840]] the governor [[H5057]] of the house, [[H1004]] and Elkanah [[H511]] next [[H4932]] to the king. [[H4428]]

### 8
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] carried away captive [[H7617]] of their brethren [[H251]] two hundred [[H3967]] thousand, [[H505]] women, [[H802]] sons, [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] and took also away [[H962]] much [[H7227]] spoil [[H7998]] from them, and brought [[H935]] the spoil [[H7998]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 9
But a prophet [[H5030]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] there, [[H8033]] whose name [[H8034]] Oded: [[H5752]] and he went out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] the host [[H6635]] that came [[H935]] to Samaria, [[H8111]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Behold, [[H2009]] because the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers [[H1]] was wroth [[H2534]] with [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]] he hath delivered [[H5414]] them into your hand, [[H3027]] and ye have slain [[H2026]] them in a rage [[H2197]] reacheth up [[H5060]] unto [[H5704]] heaven. [[H8064]]

### 10
And now [[H6258]] ye [[H859]] purpose [[H559]] to keep under [[H3533]] the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] for bondmen [[H5650]] and bondwomen [[H8198]] unto you: not [[H3808]] with [[H5973]] you, even [[H7535]] with you, [[H859]] sins [[H819]] against the Lord [[H3068]] your God? [[H430]]

### 11
Now [[H6258]] hear [[H8085]] me therefore, and deliver [[H7725]] the captives [[H7633]] again, which [[H834]] ye have taken captive [[H7617]] of your brethren: [[H251]] for [[H3588]] the fierce [[H2740]] wrath [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 12
Then certain [[H376]] of the heads [[H7218]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] Azariah [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Johanan, [[H3076]] Berechiah [[H1296]] the son [[H1121]] of Meshillemoth, [[H4919]] and Jehizkiah [[H3169]] the son [[H1121]] of Shallum, [[H7967]] and Amasa [[H6021]] the son [[H1121]] of Hadlai, [[H2311]] stood up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] them that came [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the war, [[H6635]]

### 13
And said [[H559]] unto them, Ye shall not [[H3808]] bring in [[H935]] the captives [[H7633]] hither: [[H2008]] for whereas [[H3588]] we have offended against [[H819]] the Lord [[H3068]] ye [[H859]] intend [[H559]] to add [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] our sins [[H2403]] and to [[H5921]] our trespass: [[H819]] for [[H3588]] our trespass [[H819]] is great, [[H7227]] and fierce [[H2740]] wrath [[H639]] against [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 14
So the armed men [[H2502]] left [[H5800]] the captives [[H7633]] and the spoil [[H961]] before [[H6440]] the princes [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation. [[H6951]]

### 15
And the men [[H376]] which [[H834]] were expressed [[H5344]] by name [[H8034]] rose up, [[H6965]] and took [[H2388]] the captives, [[H7633]] and with [[H4480]] the spoil [[H7998]] clothed [[H3847]] all [[H3605]] that were naked [[H4636]] among them, and arrayed [[H3847]] them, and shod [[H5274]] them, and gave them to eat [[H398]] and to drink, [[H8248]] and anointed [[H5480]] them, and carried [[H5095]] all [[H3605]] the feeble [[H3782]] of them upon asses, [[H2543]] and brought [[H935]] them to Jericho, [[H3405]] the city [[H5892]] of palm trees, [[H8558]] to [[H681]] their brethren: [[H251]] then they returned [[H7725]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 16
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] did king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] send [[H7971]] unto [[H5921]] the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] to help [[H5826]] him. [[H5826]]

### 17
For again [[H5750]] the Edomites [[H130]] had come [[H935]] and smitten [[H5221]] Judah, [[H3063]] and carried away [[H7617]] captives. [[H7628]]

### 18
The Philistines [[H6430]] also had invaded [[H6584]] the cities [[H5892]] of the low country, [[H8219]] and of the south [[H5045]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and had taken [[H3920]] Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] and Ajalon, [[H357]] and Gederoth, [[H1450]] and Shocho [[H7755]] with the villages [[H1323]] thereof, and Timnah [[H8553]] with the villages [[H1323]] thereof, Gimzo [[H1579]] also and the villages [[H1323]] thereof: and they dwelt [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] brought [[H3665]] Judah [[H3063]] low because of [[H5668]] Ahaz [[H271]] king [[H4428]] of Israel; [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] he made Judah [[H3063]] naked, [[H6544]] and transgressed [[H4603]] sore [[H4604]] against the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
And Tilgath-pilneser [[H8407]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] came [[H935]] unto [[H5921]] him, and distressed [[H6696]] him, but strengthened [[H2388]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] Ahaz [[H271]] took away a portion [[H2505]]  of [[H853]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and of the house [[H1004]] of the king, [[H4428]] and of the princes, [[H8269]] and gave [[H5414]] unto the king [[H4428]] of Assyria: [[H804]] but he helped [[H5833]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 22
And in the time [[H6256]] of his distress [[H6887]] did he trespass [[H4603]] yet more [[H3254]] against the Lord: [[H3068]] this [[H1931]] king [[H4428]] Ahaz. [[H271]]

### 23
For he sacrificed [[H2076]] unto the gods [[H430]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] which smote [[H5221]] him: and he said, [[H559]] Because [[H3588]] the gods [[H430]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] help [[H5826]] them, will I sacrifice [[H2076]] to them, that they may help [[H5826]] me. But they [[H1992]] were [[H1961]] the ruin [[H3782]] of him, and of all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
And Ahaz [[H271]] gathered together [[H622]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and cut in pieces [[H7112]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and shut up [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and he made [[H6213]] him altars [[H4196]] in every [[H3605]] corner [[H6438]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 25
And in every [[H3605]] several city [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] he made [[H6213]] high places [[H1116]] to burn incense [[H6999]] unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and provoked to anger [[H3707]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of his fathers. [[H1]]

### 26
Now the rest [[H3499]] of his acts [[H1697]] and of all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] first [[H7223]] and last, [[H314]] behold, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
And Ahaz [[H271]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in the city, [[H5892]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] but [[H3588]] they brought [[H935]] him not [[H3808]] into the sepulchres [[H6913]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and Hezekiah [[H3169]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead.
