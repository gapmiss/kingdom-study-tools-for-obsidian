And Solomon [[H8010]] the son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] was strengthened [[H2388]] in [[H5921]] his kingdom, [[H4438]] and the Lord [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] him, and magnified [[H1431]] him exceedingly. [[H4605]]

### 2
Then Solomon [[H8010]] spake [[H559]] unto all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] to the captains [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of hundreds, [[H3967]] and to the judges, [[H8199]] and to every [[H3605]] governor [[H5387]] in all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] the chief [[H7218]] of the fathers. [[H1]]

### 3
So Solomon, [[H8010]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] with [[H5973]] him, went [[H1980]] to the high place [[H1116]] that [[H834]] at Gibeon; [[H1391]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] was [[H1961]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] of God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord [[H3068]] had made [[H6213]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 4
But [[H61]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] had David [[H1732]] brought up [[H5927]] from Kirjath-jearim [[H7157]] to David [[H1732]] had prepared [[H3559]] for it: for [[H3588]] he had pitched [[H5186]] a tent [[H168]] for it at Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 5
Moreover the brasen [[H5178]] altar, [[H4196]] that [[H834]] Bezaleel [[H1212]] the son [[H1121]] of Uri, [[H221]] the son [[H1121]] of Hur, [[H2354]] had made, [[H6213]] he put [[H7760]] before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and Solomon [[H8010]] and the congregation [[H6951]] sought [[H1875]] unto it. [[H1875]]

### 6
And Solomon [[H8010]] went up [[H5927]] thither [[H8033]] to [[H5921]] the brasen [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] at the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and offered [[H5927]] a thousand [[H505]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 7
In that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] did God [[H430]] appear [[H7200]] unto Solomon, [[H8010]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Ask [[H7592]] what [[H4100]] I shall give [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 8
And Solomon [[H8010]] said [[H559]] unto God, [[H430]] Thou [[H859]] hast shewed [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] mercy [[H2617]] unto [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] and hast made me to reign [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 9
Now, [[H6258]] O Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] let thy promise [[H1697]] unto [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] be established: [[H539]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast made me king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] a people [[H5971]] like the dust [[H6083]] of the earth [[H776]] in multitude. [[H7227]]

### 10
Give [[H5414]] me now [[H6258]] wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge, [[H4093]] that I may go out [[H3318]] and come in [[H935]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] can judge [[H8199]] this [[H2088]] thy people, [[H5971]] great? [[H1419]]

### 11
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to Solomon, [[H8010]] Because [[H3282]] this [[H2063]] was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] thine heart, [[H3824]] and thou hast not [[H3808]] asked [[H7592]] riches, [[H6239]] wealth, [[H5233]] or honour, [[H3519]] nor the life [[H5315]] of thine enemies, [[H8130]] neither [[H3808]] yet [[H1571]] hast asked [[H7592]] long [[H7227]] life; [[H3117]] but hast asked [[H7592]] wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge [[H4093]] for thyself, that [[H834]] thou mayest judge [[H8199]] my people, [[H5971]] over [[H5921]] whom [[H834]] I have made thee king: [[H4427]]

### 12
Wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge [[H4093]] granted [[H5414]] unto thee; and I will give [[H5414]] thee riches, [[H6239]] and wealth, [[H5233]] and honour, [[H3519]] such as [[H834]] none [[H3808]] of the kings [[H4428]] have had [[H1961]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] thee, neither [[H3808]] shall there any after [[H310]] thee have [[H1961]] the like. [[H3651]]

### 13
Then Solomon [[H8010]] came [[H935]] to the high place [[H1116]] that [[H834]] at Gibeon [[H1391]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] from before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 14
And Solomon [[H8010]] gathered [[H622]] chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen: [[H6571]] and he had [[H1961]] a thousand [[H505]] and four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] chariots, [[H7393]] and twelve [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] horsemen, [[H6571]] which he placed [[H3240]] in the chariot [[H7393]] cities, [[H5892]] and with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] at Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 15
And the king [[H4428]] made [[H5414]] silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] at Jerusalem [[H3389]] as stones, [[H68]] and cedar trees [[H730]] made [[H5414]] he as the sycomore trees [[H8256]] that [[H834]] in the vale [[H8219]] for abundance. [[H7230]]

### 16
And Solomon [[H8010]] had horses [[H5483]] brought out [[H4161]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and linen yarn: [[H4723]] the king's [[H4428]] merchants [[H5503]] received [[H3947]] the linen yarn [[H4723]] at a price. [[H4242]]

### 17
And they fetched up, [[H5927]] and brought forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] a chariot [[H4818]] for six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] of silver, [[H3701]] and an horse [[H5483]] for an hundred [[H3967]] and fifty: [[H2572]] and so [[H3651]] brought they out [[H3318]] for all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Hittites, [[H2850]] and for the kings [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] by their means.
