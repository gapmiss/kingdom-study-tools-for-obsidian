And the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]]  made [[H853]] Ahaziah [[H274]] his youngest [[H6996]] son [[H1121]] king [[H4427]] in his stead: [[H8478]] for [[H3588]] the band of men [[H1416]] that came [[H935]] with the Arabians [[H6163]] to the camp [[H4264]] had slain [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the eldest. [[H7223]] So Ahaziah [[H274]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] reigned. [[H4427]]

### 2
Forty [[H705]] and two [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] Ahaziah [[H274]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] one [[H259]] year [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] His mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] also Athaliah [[H6271]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Omri. [[H6018]]

### 3
He [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] walked [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab: [[H256]] for [[H3588]] his mother [[H517]] was [[H1961]] his counseller [[H3289]] to do wickedly. [[H7561]]

### 4
Wherefore he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] like the house [[H1004]] of Ahab: [[H256]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] were [[H1961]] his counsellers [[H3289]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of his father [[H1]] to his destruction. [[H4889]]

### 5
He walked [[H1980]] also [[H1571]] after their counsel, [[H6098]] and went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Jehoram [[H3088]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] at Ramoth-gilead: [[H7433]] and the Syrians [[H7421]] smote [[H5221]] Joram. [[H3141]]

### 6
And he returned [[H7725]] to be healed [[H7495]] in Jezreel [[H3157]] because of [[H3588]] the wounds [[H4347]] which [[H834]] were given [[H5221]] him at Ramah, [[H7414]] when he fought [[H3898]] with [[H854]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Syria. [[H758]] And Azariah [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went down [[H3381]] to see [[H7200]] Jehoram [[H3088]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] at Jezreel, [[H3157]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was sick. [[H2470]]

### 7
And the destruction [[H8395]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] was [[H1961]] of God [[H430]] by coming [[H935]] to [[H413]] Joram: [[H3141]] for when he was come, [[H935]] he went out [[H3318]] with [[H5973]] Jehoram [[H3088]] against [[H413]] Jehu [[H3058]] the son [[H1121]] of Nimshi, [[H5250]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had anointed [[H4886]] to cut off [[H3772]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab. [[H256]]

### 8
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that, when Jehu [[H3058]] was executing judgment [[H8199]] upon [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] and found [[H4672]] the princes [[H8269]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the sons [[H1121]] of the brethren [[H251]] of Ahaziah, [[H274]] that ministered [[H8334]] to Ahaziah, [[H274]] he slew [[H2026]] them. [[H2026]]

### 9
And he sought [[H1245]] Ahaziah: [[H274]] and they caught [[H3920]] him, (for he [[H1931]] was hid [[H2244]] in Samaria,) [[H8111]] and brought [[H935]] him to [[H413]] Jehu: [[H3058]] and when they had slain [[H4191]] him, they buried [[H6912]] him: Because, [[H3588]] said [[H559]] they, he [[H1931]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] who [[H834]] sought [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] his heart. [[H3824]] So the house [[H1004]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] had no [[H369]] power [[H3581]] to keep still [[H6113]] the kingdom. [[H4467]]

### 10
But when Athaliah [[H6271]] the mother [[H517]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] her son [[H1121]] was dead, [[H4191]] she arose [[H6965]] and destroyed [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the seed [[H2233]] royal [[H4467]] of the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 11
But Jehoshabeath, [[H3090]] the daughter [[H1323]] of the king, [[H4428]] took [[H3947]] Joash [[H3101]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahaziah, [[H274]] and stole [[H1589]] him from among [[H8432]] the king's [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] that were slain, [[H4191]] and put [[H5414]] him and his nurse [[H3243]] in a bedchamber. [[H2315]] So Jehoshabeath, [[H3090]] the daughter [[H1323]] of king [[H4428]] Jehoram, [[H3088]] the wife [[H802]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest, [[H3548]] (for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] the sister [[H269]] of Ahaziah,) [[H274]] hid [[H5641]] him from [[H6440]] Athaliah, [[H6271]] so that she slew [[H4191]] him not. [[H3808]]

### 12
And he was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] them hid [[H2244]] in the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] six [[H8337]] years: [[H8141]] and Athaliah [[H6271]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] the land. [[H776]]
