And in the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] strengthened himself, [[H2388]] and took [[H3947]] the captains [[H8269]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] Azariah [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeroham, [[H3395]] and Ishmael [[H3458]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehohanan, [[H3076]] and Azariah [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Obed, [[H5744]] and Maaseiah [[H4641]] the son [[H1121]] of Adaiah, [[H5718]] and Elishaphat [[H478]] the son [[H1121]] of Zichri, [[H2147]] into covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 2
And they went about [[H5437]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and gathered [[H6908]] the Levites [[H3881]] out of all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the chief [[H7218]] of the fathers [[H1]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] in the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]] And he said [[H559]] unto them, Behold, [[H2009]] the king's [[H4428]] son [[H1121]] shall reign, [[H4427]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H1696]] of [[H5921]] the sons [[H1121]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 4
This [[H2088]] the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] ye shall do; [[H6213]] A third part [[H7992]] of [[H4480]] you entering [[H935]] on the sabbath, [[H7676]] of the priests [[H3548]] and of the Levites, [[H3881]] porters [[H7778]] of the doors; [[H5592]]

### 5
And a third part [[H7992]] at the king's [[H4428]] house; [[H1004]] and a third part [[H7992]] at the gate [[H8179]] of the foundation: [[H3247]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] in the courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
But let none [[H408]] come [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] save [[H3588]] the priests, [[H3548]] and they that minister [[H8334]] of the Levites; [[H3881]] they [[H1992]] shall go in, [[H935]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] holy: [[H6944]] but all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] shall keep [[H8104]] the watch [[H4931]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
And the Levites [[H3881]] shall compass [[H5362]] the king [[H4428]] round about, [[H5439]] every man [[H376]] with his weapons [[H3627]] in his hand; [[H3027]] and whosoever cometh [[H935]] into [[H413]] the house, [[H1004]] he shall be put to death: [[H4191]] but be [[H1961]] ye with [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] when he cometh in, [[H935]] and when he goeth out. [[H3318]]

### 8
So the Levites [[H3881]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] did [[H6213]] according to all things [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] had commanded, [[H6680]] and took [[H3947]] every man [[H376]] his men [[H376]] that were to come in [[H935]] on the sabbath, [[H7676]] with [[H5973]] them that were to go [[H3318]] on the sabbath: [[H7676]] for [[H3588]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] dismissed [[H6362]] not [[H3808]] the courses. [[H4256]]

### 9
Moreover Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] delivered [[H5414]] to the captains [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] spears, [[H2595]] and bucklers, [[H4043]] and shields, [[H7982]] that [[H834]] king [[H4428]] David's, [[H1732]] which [[H834]] in the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

### 10
And he set [[H5975]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] every man [[H376]] having his weapon [[H7973]] in his hand, [[H3027]] from the right [[H3233]] side [[H3802]] of the temple [[H1004]] to [[H5704]] the left [[H8042]] side [[H3802]] of the temple, [[H1004]] along by the altar [[H4196]] and the temple, [[H1004]] by [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 11
Then they brought out [[H3318]] the king's [[H4428]] son, [[H1121]] and put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]]  him [[H853]] the crown, [[H5145]] and the testimony, [[H5715]] and made him king. [[H4427]] And Jehoiada [[H3077]] and his sons [[H1121]] anointed [[H4886]] him, and said, [[H559]] God save [[H2421]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 12
Now when Athaliah [[H6271]] heard [[H8085]] the noise [[H6963]] of the people [[H5971]] running [[H7323]] and praising [[H1984]] the king, [[H4428]] she came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 13
And she looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] his pillar [[H5982]] at the entering in, [[H3996]] and the princes [[H8269]] and the trumpets [[H2689]] by [[H5921]] the king: [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] rejoiced, [[H8056]] and sounded [[H8628]] with trumpets, [[H2689]] also the singers [[H7891]] with instruments [[H3627]] of musick, [[H7892]] and such as taught [[H3045]] to sing praise. [[H1984]] Then Athaliah [[H6271]] rent [[H7167]] her clothes, [[H899]] and said, [[H559]] Treason, [[H7195]] Treason. [[H7195]]

### 14
Then Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] brought out [[H3318]] the captains [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] that were set over [[H6485]] the host, [[H2428]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Have her forth [[H3318]] of the ranges: [[H1004]] and whoso followeth [[H935]] her, let him be slain [[H4191]] with the sword. [[H2719]] For [[H3588]] the priest [[H3548]] said, [[H559]] Slay [[H4191]] her not [[H3808]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
So they laid [[H7760]] hands [[H3027]] on her; and when she was come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the entering [[H3996]] of the horse [[H5483]] gate [[H8179]] by the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] they slew [[H4191]] her there. [[H8033]]

### 16
And Jehoiada [[H3077]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] between [[H996]] him, and between [[H996]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] and between [[H996]] the king, [[H4428]] that they should be [[H1961]] the Lord's [[H3068]] people. [[H5971]]

### 17
Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] went to [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and brake it down, [[H5422]] and brake pieces, [[H7665]] his altars [[H4196]] and his images [[H6754]] in and slew [[H2026]] Mattan [[H4977]] the priest [[H3548]] of Baal [[H1168]] before [[H6440]] the altars. [[H4196]]

### 18
Also Jehoiada [[H3077]] appointed [[H7760]] the offices [[H6486]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by the hand [[H3027]] of the priests [[H3548]] the Levites, [[H3881]] whom [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had distributed [[H2505]] in [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to offer [[H5927]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] as written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] with rejoicing [[H8057]] and with singing, [[H7892]] by [[H3027]] David. [[H1732]]

### 19
And he set [[H5975]] the porters [[H7778]] at [[H5921]] the gates [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that none [[H3808]] unclean [[H2931]] in any [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] should enter in. [[H935]]

### 20
And he took [[H3947]] the captains [[H8269]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] and the nobles, [[H117]] and the governors [[H4910]] of the people, [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and brought down [[H3381]] the king [[H4428]] from the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and they came [[H935]] through [[H8432]] the high [[H5945]] gate [[H8179]] into the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and set [[H3427]] the king [[H4428]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of the kingdom. [[H4467]]

### 21
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] rejoiced: [[H8055]] and the city [[H5892]] was quiet, [[H8252]] after that they had slain [[H4191]] Athaliah [[H6271]] with the sword. [[H2719]]
