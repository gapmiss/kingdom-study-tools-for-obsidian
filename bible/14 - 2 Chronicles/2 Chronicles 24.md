### 1
Joash [[H3101]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] His mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] also Zibiah [[H6645]] of Beer-sheba. [[H884]]

### 2
And Joash [[H3101]] did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest. [[H3548]]

### 3
And Jehoiada [[H3077]] took [[H5375]] for him two [[H8147]] wives; [[H802]] and he begat [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

### 4
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] Joash [[H3101]] was [[H1961]] minded [[H3820]] to repair [[H2318]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
And he gathered together [[H6908]] the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] and said [[H559]] to them, Go out [[H3318]] unto the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and gather [[H6908]] of all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] money [[H3701]] to repair [[H2388]] the house [[H1004]] of your God [[H430]] from [[H1767]] year [[H8141]] to year, [[H8141]] and see that ye [[H859]] hasten [[H4116]] the matter. [[H1697]] Howbeit the Levites [[H3881]] hastened [[H4116]] not. [[H3808]]

### 6
And the king [[H4428]] called [[H7121]] for Jehoiada [[H3077]] the chief, [[H7218]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Why [[H4069]] hast thou not [[H3808]] required [[H1875]] of [[H5921]] the Levites [[H3881]] to bring in [[H935]] out of Judah [[H3063]] and out of Jerusalem [[H3389]] the collection, [[H4864]] of Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and of the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] for the tabernacle [[H168]] of witness? [[H5715]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the sons [[H1121]] of Athaliah, [[H6271]] that wicked woman, [[H4849]] had broken up [[H6555]] the house [[H1004]] of God; [[H430]] and also [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] the dedicated things [[H6944]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] did they bestow [[H6213]] upon Baalim. [[H1168]]

### 8
And at the king's [[H4428]] commandment [[H559]] they made [[H6213]] a [[H259]] chest, [[H727]] and set [[H5414]] it without [[H2351]] at the gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And they made [[H5414]] a proclamation [[H6963]] through Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to bring in [[H935]] to the Lord [[H3068]] the collection [[H4864]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of God [[H430]] upon [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 10
And all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] rejoiced, [[H8055]] and brought in, [[H935]] and cast [[H7993]] into the chest, [[H727]] until [[H5704]] they had made an end. [[H3615]]

### 11
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] that at what time [[H6256]] the chest [[H727]] was brought [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] office [[H6486]] by the hand [[H3027]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] and when they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] much [[H7227]] money, [[H3701]] the king's [[H4428]] scribe [[H5608]] and the high [[H7218]] priest's [[H3548]] officer [[H6496]] came [[H935]] and emptied [[H6168]] the chest, [[H727]] and took [[H5375]] it, and carried [[H7725]] it to [[H413]] his place [[H4725]] again. Thus [[H3541]] they did [[H6213]] day [[H3117]] by day, [[H3117]] and gathered [[H622]] money [[H3701]] in abundance. [[H7230]]

### 12
And the king [[H4428]] and Jehoiada [[H3077]] gave [[H5414]] it to [[H413]] such as did [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] of the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and hired [[H7936]] masons [[H2672]] and carpenters [[H2796]] to repair [[H2318]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and also [[H1571]] such as wrought [[H2796]] iron [[H1270]] and brass [[H5178]] to mend [[H2388]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
So the workmen [[H4399]] wrought, [[H6213]] and the work [[H4399]] was [[H5927]] perfected [[H724]] by them, [[H3027]] and they set [[H5975]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] in [[H5921]] his state, [[H4971]] and strengthened [[H553]] it. [[H553]]

### 14
And when they had finished [[H3615]] they brought [[H935]] the rest [[H7605]] of the money [[H3701]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] and Jehoiada, [[H3077]] whereof were made [[H6213]] vessels [[H3627]] for the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] vessels [[H3627]] to minister, [[H8335]] and to offer [[H5927]] and spoons, [[H3709]] and vessels [[H3627]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver. [[H3701]] And they offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] continually [[H8548]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Jehoiada. [[H3077]]

### 15
But Jehoiada [[H3077]] waxed old, [[H2204]] and was full [[H7646]] of days [[H3117]] when he died; [[H4191]] an hundred [[H3967]] and thirty [[H7970]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he died. [[H4194]]

### 16
And they buried [[H6912]] him in the city [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] among [[H5973]] the kings, [[H4428]] because [[H3588]] he had done [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] in Israel, [[H3478]] both toward [[H5973]] God, [[H430]] and toward his house. [[H1004]]

### 17
Now after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] came [[H935]] the princes [[H8269]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and made obeisance [[H7812]] to the king. [[H4428]] Then [[H227]] the king [[H4428]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 18
And they left [[H5800]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] and served [[H5647]] groves [[H842]] and idols: [[H6091]] and wrath [[H7110]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] for this [[H2063]] their trespass. [[H819]]

### 19
Yet he sent [[H7971]] prophets [[H5030]] to them, to bring them again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and they testified [[H5749]] against them: but they would not [[H3808]] give ear. [[H238]]

### 20
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came upon [[H3847]] Zechariah [[H2148]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest, [[H3548]] which stood [[H5975]] above [[H5921]] the people, [[H5971]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] God, [[H430]] Why [[H4100]] transgress [[H5674]] ye [[H859]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that ye cannot [[H3808]] prosper? [[H6743]] because [[H3588]] ye have forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he hath also forsaken [[H5800]] you. [[H853]]

### 21
And they conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] him, and stoned [[H7275]] him with stones [[H68]] at the commandment [[H4687]] of the king [[H4428]] in the court [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
Thus Joash [[H3101]] the king [[H4428]] remembered [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] the kindness [[H2617]] which [[H834]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] his father [[H1]] had done [[H6213]] to [[H5973]] him, but slew [[H2026]] his son. [[H1121]] And when he died, [[H4191]] he said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] look upon [[H7200]] and require [[H1875]]

### 23
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H8622]] of the year, [[H8141]] the host [[H2428]] of Syria [[H758]] came up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] him: and they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and destroyed [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] of the people [[H5971]] from among the people, [[H5971]] and sent [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the spoil [[H7998]] of them unto the king [[H4428]] of Damascus. [[H1834]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] the army [[H2428]] of the Syrians [[H758]] came [[H935]] with a small company [[H4705]] of men, [[H582]] and the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H7230]] host [[H2428]] into their hand, [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] they had forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]] So they executed [[H6213]] judgment [[H8201]] against [[H854]] Joash. [[H3101]]

### 25
And when they were departed [[H1980]] from [[H4480]] him, (for [[H3588]] they left [[H5800]] him in great [[H7227]] diseases,) [[H4251]] his own servants [[H5650]] conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] him for the blood [[H1818]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest, [[H3548]] and slew [[H2026]] him on [[H5921]] his bed, [[H4296]] and he died: [[H4191]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] but they buried [[H6912]] him not [[H3808]] in the sepulchres [[H6913]] of the kings. [[H4428]]

### 26
And these [[H428]] are they that conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] him; Zabad [[H2066]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimeath [[H8100]] an Ammonitess, [[H5985]] and Jehozabad [[H3075]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimrith [[H8116]] a Moabitess. [[H4125]]

### 27
Now his sons, [[H1121]] and the greatness [[H7230]] of the burdens [[H4853]] upon [[H5921]] him, and the repairing [[H3247]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] behold, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the story [[H4097]] of the book [[H5612]] of the kings. [[H4428]] And Amaziah [[H558]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
