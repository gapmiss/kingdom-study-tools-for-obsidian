### 1
Now Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And Jehoram [[H3088]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 2
And he had brethren [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] Azariah, [[H5838]] and Jehiel, [[H3171]] and Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Azariah, [[H5838]] and Michael, [[H4317]] and Shephatiah: [[H8203]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
And their father [[H1]] gave [[H5414]] them great [[H7227]] gifts [[H4979]] of silver, [[H3701]] and of gold, [[H2091]] and of precious things, [[H4030]] with [[H5973]] fenced [[H4694]] cities [[H5892]] in Judah: [[H3063]] but the kingdom [[H4467]] gave [[H5414]] he to Jehoram; [[H3088]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the firstborn. [[H1060]]

### 4
Now when Jehoram [[H3088]] was risen up [[H6965]] to [[H5921]] the kingdom [[H4467]] of his father, [[H1]] he strengthened himself, [[H2388]] and slew [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] his brethren [[H251]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and also [[H1571]] of the princes [[H8269]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Jehoram [[H3088]] thirty [[H7970]] and two [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] eight [[H8083]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 6
And he walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] like as [[H834]] did [[H6213]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab: [[H256]] for [[H3588]] he had [[H1961]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Ahab [[H256]] to wife: [[H802]] and he wrought [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
Howbeit the Lord [[H3068]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] because of [[H4616]] the covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] he had made [[H3772]] with David, [[H1732]] and as [[H834]] he promised [[H559]] to give [[H5414]] a light [[H5216]] to him and to his sons [[H1121]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 8
In his days [[H3117]] the Edomites [[H123]] revolted [[H6586]] from under [[H8478]] the dominion [[H3027]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and made [[H4427]] themselves a king. [[H4428]]

### 9
Then Jehoram [[H3088]] went forth [[H5674]] with [[H5973]] his princes, [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] his chariots [[H7393]] with [[H5973]] him: and he rose up [[H6965]] by night, [[H3915]] and smote [[H5221]] the Edomites [[H123]] which compassed in, [[H5437]] him and the captains [[H8269]] of the chariots. [[H7393]]

### 10
So the Edomites [[H123]] revolted [[H6586]] from under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Judah [[H3063]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] The same [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] did Libnah [[H3841]] revolt [[H6586]] from under [[H8478]] his hand; [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] he had forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of his fathers. [[H1]]

### 11
Moreover [[H1571]] he [[H1931]] made [[H6213]] high places [[H1116]] in the mountains [[H2022]] of Judah, [[H3063]]  and caused [[H853]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] to commit fornication, [[H2181]] and compelled [[H5080]] Judah [[H3063]]

### 12
And there came [[H935]] a writing [[H4385]] to [[H413]] him from Elijah [[H452]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of David [[H1732]] thy father, [[H1]] Because [[H8478]] thou hast not [[H3808]] walked [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] thy father, [[H1]] nor in the ways [[H1870]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]]

### 13
But hast walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]]  and hast made [[H853]] Judah [[H3063]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] to go a whoring, [[H2181]] like to the whoredoms [[H2181]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] and also [[H1571]] hast slain [[H2026]] thy brethren [[H251]] of thy father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] thyself: [[H4480]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2009]] with a great [[H1419]] plague [[H4046]] will the Lord [[H3068]] smite [[H5062]] thy people, [[H5971]] and thy children, [[H1121]] and thy wives, [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] thy goods: [[H7399]]

### 15
And thou [[H859]] great [[H7227]] sickness [[H2483]] by disease [[H4245]] of thy bowels, [[H4578]] until [[H5704]] thy bowels [[H4578]] fall out [[H3318]] by reason of [[H4480]] the sickness [[H2483]] day [[H3117]] by [[H5921]] day. [[H3117]]

### 16
Moreover the Lord [[H3068]] stirred up [[H5782]] against [[H5921]] Jehoram [[H3088]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and of the Arabians, [[H6163]] that [[H834]] near [[H5921]] the Ethiopians: [[H3569]]

### 17
And they came up [[H5927]] into Judah, [[H3063]] and brake into [[H1234]] it, and carried away [[H7617]] all [[H3605]] the substance [[H7399]] that was found [[H4672]] in the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and his sons [[H1121]] also, [[H1571]] and his wives; [[H802]] so that there was never [[H3808]] a son [[H1121]] left [[H7604]] him, save [[H3588]] Jehoahaz, [[H3059]] the youngest [[H6996]] of his sons. [[H1121]]

### 18
And after [[H310]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] the Lord [[H3068]] smote [[H5062]] him in his bowels [[H4578]] with an incurable [[H369]] disease. [[H2483]]

### 19
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that in process of time, [[H3117]] after [[H3318]] the end [[H7093]] of two [[H8147]] years, [[H3117]] his bowels [[H4578]] fell out [[H3318]] by reason of [[H5973]] his sickness: [[H2483]] so he died [[H4191]] of sore [[H7451]] diseases. [[H8463]] And his people [[H5971]] made [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] burning [[H8316]] for him, like the burning [[H8316]] of his fathers. [[H1]]

### 20
Thirty [[H7970]] and two [[H8147]] years old [[H1121]] was [[H1961]] he when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eight [[H8083]] years, [[H8141]] and departed [[H1980]] without [[H3808]] being desired. [[H2532]] Howbeit they buried [[H6912]] him in the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] but not [[H3808]] in the sepulchres [[H6913]] of the kings. [[H4428]]
