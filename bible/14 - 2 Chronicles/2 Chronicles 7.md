### 1
Now when Solomon [[H8010]] had made an end [[H3615]] of praying, [[H6419]] the fire [[H784]] came down [[H3381]] from heaven, [[H8064]] and consumed [[H398]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the sacrifices; [[H2077]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the house. [[H1004]]

### 2
And the priests [[H3548]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] had filled [[H4390]] the Lord's [[H3068]] house. [[H1004]]

### 3
And when all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] how the fire [[H784]] came down, [[H3381]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H5921]] the house, [[H1004]] they bowed [[H3766]] themselves with their faces [[H639]] to the ground [[H776]] upon [[H5921]] the pavement, [[H7531]] and worshipped, [[H7812]] and praised [[H3034]] the Lord, [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] good; [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] his mercy [[H2617]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 4
Then the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] offered [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
And king [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] offered [[H2076]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] of twenty [[H6242]] and two [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] oxen, [[H1241]] and an hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] sheep: [[H6629]] so the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] dedicated [[H2596]] the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

### 6
And the priests [[H3548]] waited [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] their offices: [[H4931]] the Levites [[H3881]] also with instruments [[H3627]] of musick [[H7892]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] David [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] had made [[H6213]] to praise [[H3034]] the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] his mercy [[H2617]] for ever, [[H5769]] when David [[H1732]] praised [[H1984]] by their ministry; [[H3027]] and the priests [[H3548]] sounded trumpets [[H2690]] before [[H5048]] them, and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] stood. [[H5975]]

### 7
Moreover Solomon [[H8010]] hallowed [[H6942]] the middle [[H8432]] of the court [[H2691]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] he offered [[H6213]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and the fat [[H2459]] of the peace offerings, [[H8002]] because [[H3588]] the brasen [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made [[H6213]] was not able [[H3201]] to receive [[H3557]] the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and the meat offerings, [[H4503]] and the fat. [[H2459]]

### 8
Also at the same [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Solomon [[H8010]] kept [[H6213]] the feast [[H2282]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him, a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] congregation, [[H6951]] from the entering in [[H935]] of Hamath [[H2574]] unto [[H5704]] the river [[H5158]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
And in the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] they made [[H6213]] a solemn assembly: [[H6116]] for [[H3588]] they kept [[H6213]] the dedication [[H2598]] of the altar [[H4196]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and the feast [[H2282]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]

### 10
And on the three [[H7969]] and twentieth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month [[H2320]] he sent [[H7971]] the people [[H5971]] away into their tents, [[H168]] glad [[H8056]] and merry [[H2896]] in heart [[H3820]] for [[H5921]] the goodness [[H2896]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had shewed [[H6213]] unto David, [[H1732]] and to Solomon, [[H8010]] and to Israel [[H3478]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 11
Thus Solomon [[H8010]] finished [[H3615]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the king's [[H4428]] house: [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] that came [[H935]] into [[H5921]] Solomon's [[H8010]] heart [[H3820]] to make [[H6213]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and in his own house, [[H1004]] he prosperously effected. [[H6743]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Solomon [[H8010]] by night, [[H3915]] and said [[H559]] unto him, I have heard [[H8085]] thy prayer, [[H8605]] and have chosen [[H977]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] to myself for an house [[H1004]] of sacrifice. [[H2077]]

### 13
If [[H2005]] I shut up [[H6113]] heaven [[H8064]] that there be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain, [[H4306]] or if [[H2005]] I command [[H6680]] the locusts [[H2284]] to devour [[H398]] the land, [[H776]] or if [[H518]] I send [[H7971]] pestilence [[H1698]] among my people; [[H5971]]

### 14
If my people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] are called [[H7121]] by my name, [[H8034]] shall humble themselves, [[H3665]] and pray, [[H6419]] and seek [[H1245]] my face, [[H6440]] and turn [[H7725]] from their wicked [[H7451]] ways; [[H1870]] then will I [[H589]] hear [[H8085]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and will forgive [[H5545]] their sin, [[H2403]] and will heal [[H7495]] their land. [[H776]]

### 15
Now [[H6258]] mine eyes [[H5869]] shall be [[H1961]] open, [[H6605]] and mine ears [[H241]] attent [[H7183]] unto the prayer [[H8605]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 16
For now [[H6258]] have I chosen [[H977]] and sanctified [[H6942]] this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] that my name [[H8034]] may be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] for [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]] and mine eyes [[H5869]] and mine heart [[H3820]] shall be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] perpetually. [[H3117]]

### 17
And as for thee, [[H859]] if [[H518]] thou wilt walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] me, as [[H834]] David [[H1732]] thy father [[H1]] walked, [[H1980]] and do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] thee, and shalt observe [[H8104]] my statutes [[H2706]] and my judgments; [[H4941]]

### 18
Then will I stablish [[H6965]] the throne [[H3678]] of thy kingdom, [[H4438]] according as [[H834]] I have covenanted [[H3772]] with David [[H1732]] thy father, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] There shall not [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] thee a man [[H376]] ruler [[H4910]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 19
But if [[H518]] ye [[H859]] turn away, [[H7725]] and forsake [[H5800]] my statutes [[H2708]] and my commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I have set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you, and shall go [[H1980]] and serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and worship [[H7812]] them; [[H7812]]

### 20
Then will I pluck them up by the roots [[H5428]] out of [[H5921]] my land [[H127]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] them; and this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] I have sanctified [[H6942]] for my name, [[H8034]] will I cast out [[H7993]] of [[H5921]] my sight, [[H6440]] and will make [[H5414]] it a proverb [[H4912]] and a byword [[H8148]] among all [[H3605]] nations. [[H5971]]

### 21
And this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] which [[H834]] is [[H1961]] high, [[H5945]] shall be an astonishment [[H8074]] to every one [[H3605]] that passeth [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] it; so that he shall say, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] thus [[H3602]] unto this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and unto this [[H2088]] house? [[H1004]]

### 22
And it shall be answered, [[H559]] Because [[H5921]] they forsook [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] which [[H834]] brought them forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and laid hold [[H2388]] on other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and worshipped [[H7812]] them, and served [[H5647]] them: therefore [[H5921]] hath he brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]
