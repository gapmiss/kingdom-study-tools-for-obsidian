### 1
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Azariah [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Oded: [[H5752]]

### 2
And he went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H6440]] Asa, [[H609]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Hear [[H8085]] ye me, Asa, [[H609]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin; [[H1144]] The Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] you, while ye be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] him; and if [[H518]] ye seek [[H1875]] him, he will be found [[H4672]] of you; but if [[H518]] ye forsake [[H5800]] him, he will forsake [[H5800]] you. [[H5800]]

### 3
Now for a long [[H7227]] season [[H3117]] Israel [[H3478]] without [[H3808]] the true [[H571]] God, [[H430]] and without [[H3808]] a teaching [[H3384]] priest, [[H3548]] and without [[H3808]] law. [[H8451]]

### 4
But when they in their trouble [[H6862]] did turn [[H7725]] unto [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and sought [[H1245]] him, he was found [[H4672]] of them. [[H4672]]

### 5
And in those [[H1992]] times [[H6256]] no [[H369]] peace [[H7965]] to him that went out, [[H3318]] nor to him that came in, [[H935]] but [[H3588]] great [[H7227]] vexations [[H4103]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the countries. [[H776]]

### 6
And nation [[H1471]] was destroyed [[H3807]] of nation, [[H1471]] and city [[H5892]] of city: [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] did vex [[H2000]] them with all [[H3605]] adversity. [[H6869]]

### 7
Be ye strong [[H2388]] therefore, and let not [[H408]] your hands [[H3027]] be weak: [[H7503]] for [[H3588]] your work [[H6468]] shall be [[H3426]] rewarded. [[H7939]]

### 8
And when Asa [[H609]] heard [[H8085]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] and the prophecy [[H5016]] of Oded [[H5752]] the prophet, [[H5030]] he took courage, [[H2388]] and put away [[H5674]] the abominable idols [[H8251]] out of all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] and out of [[H4480]] the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] he had taken [[H3920]] from mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and renewed [[H2318]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] the porch [[H197]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And he gathered [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] and the strangers [[H1481]] with [[H5973]] them out of Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] and out of Simeon: [[H8095]] for [[H3588]] they fell [[H5307]] to [[H5921]] him out of Israel [[H3478]] in abundance, [[H7230]] when they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 10
So they gathered themselves together [[H6908]] at Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the third [[H7992]] month, [[H2320]] in the fifteenth [[H2568]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Asa. [[H609]]

### 11
And they offered [[H2076]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] the same [[H1931]] time, [[H3117]] of [[H4480]] the spoil [[H7998]] they had brought, [[H935]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] oxen [[H1241]] and seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] sheep. [[H6629]]

### 12
And they entered [[H935]] into a covenant [[H1285]] to seek [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers [[H1]] with all [[H3605]] their heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] their soul; [[H5315]]

### 13
That whosoever [[H3605]] would not [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] should be put to death, [[H4191]] whether [[H4480]] small [[H6996]] or [[H5704]] great, [[H1419]] whether man [[H376]] or [[H5704]] woman. [[H802]]

### 14
And they sware [[H7650]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] and with shouting, [[H8643]] and with trumpets, [[H2689]] and with cornets. [[H7782]]

### 15
And all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] rejoiced [[H8055]] at [[H5921]] the oath: [[H7621]] for [[H3588]] they had sworn [[H7650]] with all [[H3605]] their heart, [[H3824]] and sought [[H1245]] him with their whole [[H3605]] desire; [[H7522]] and he was found [[H4672]] of them: and the Lord [[H3068]] gave them rest [[H5117]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 16
And also [[H1571]] Maachah [[H4601]] the mother [[H517]] of Asa [[H609]] the king, [[H4428]] he removed [[H5493]] her from queen, [[H1377]] because [[H834]] she had made [[H6213]] an idol [[H4656]] in a grove: [[H842]] and Asa [[H609]] cut down [[H3772]] her idol, [[H4656]] and stamped [[H1854]] and burnt [[H8313]] at the brook [[H5158]] Kidron. [[H6939]]

### 17
But the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] taken away [[H5493]] out of Israel: [[H3478]] nevertheless [[H7535]] the heart [[H3824]] of Asa [[H609]] was [[H1961]] perfect [[H8003]] all [[H3605]] his days. [[H3117]]

### 18
And he brought into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] the things that his father [[H1]] had dedicated, [[H6944]] and that he himself had dedicated, [[H6944]] silver, [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and vessels. [[H3627]]

### 19
And there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] war [[H4421]] unto [[H5704]] the five [[H2568]] and thirtieth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Asa. [[H609]]
