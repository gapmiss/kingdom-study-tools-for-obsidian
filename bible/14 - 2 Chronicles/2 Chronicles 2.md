And Solomon [[H8010]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Huram [[H2361]] the king [[H4428]] of Tyre, [[H6865]] saying, [[H559]] As [[H834]] thou didst deal [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] and didst send [[H7971]] him cedars [[H730]] to build [[H1129]] him an house [[H1004]] to dwell [[H3427]] therein, [[H3427]]

Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] to the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] to dedicate [[H6942]] to him, to burn [[H6999]] before [[H6440]] him sweet [[H5561]] incense, [[H7004]] and for the continual [[H8548]] shewbread, [[H4635]] and for the burnt offerings [[H5930]] morning [[H1242]] and evening, [[H6153]] on the sabbaths, [[H7676]] and on the new moons, [[H2320]] and on the solemn feasts [[H4150]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God.

But who [[H4310]] is able [[H6113]] to build [[H1129]] him an house, [[H1004]] seeing [[H3588]] the heaven [[H8064]] and heaven [[H8064]] of heavens [[H8064]] cannot [[H3808]] contain [[H3557]] him? who [[H4310]] I [[H589]] then, that [[H834]] I should build [[H1129]] him an house, [[H1004]] save only [[H518]] to burn sacrifice [[H6999]] before [[H6440]] him? [[H6440]]

Then Huram [[H2361]] the king [[H4428]] of Tyre [[H6865]] answered [[H559]] in writing, [[H3791]] which he sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Solomon, [[H8010]] Because the Lord [[H3068]] hath loved [[H160]] his people, [[H5971]] he hath made [[H5414]] thee king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 12
Huram [[H2361]] said [[H559]] moreover, Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H834]] made [[H6213]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth, [[H776]] who [[H834]] hath given [[H5414]] to David [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] a wise [[H2450]] son, [[H1121]] endued [[H3045]] with prudence [[H7922]] and understanding, [[H998]] that [[H834]] might build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for the Lord, [[H3068]] and an house [[H1004]] for his kingdom.
