### 1
And Hezekiah [[H3169]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] and wrote [[H3789]] letters [[H107]] also [[H1571]] to [[H5921]] Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] that they should come [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to keep [[H6213]] the passover [[H6453]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
For the king [[H4428]] had taken counsel, [[H3289]] and his princes, [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to keep [[H6213]] the passover [[H6453]] in the second [[H8145]] month. [[H2320]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] keep [[H6213]] it at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] because [[H3588]] the priests [[H3548]] had not [[H3808]] sanctified themselves [[H6942]] sufficiently, [[H4078]] neither [[H3808]] had the people [[H5971]] gathered themselves together [[H622]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 4
And the thing [[H1697]] pleased [[H3474]] the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation. [[H6951]]

### 5
So they established [[H5975]] a decree [[H1697]] to make proclamation [[H5674]] throughout all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] from Beer-sheba [[H884]] even to [[H5704]] Dan, [[H1835]] that they should come [[H935]] to keep [[H6213]] the passover [[H6453]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] at Jerusalem: [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] they had not [[H3808]] done [[H6213]] of a long [[H7230]] as it was written. [[H3789]]

### 6
So the posts [[H7323]] went [[H1980]] with the letters [[H107]] from [[H3027]] the king [[H4428]] and his princes [[H8269]] throughout all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] and according to the commandment [[H4687]] of the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] Ye children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] turn again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Israel, [[H3478]] and he will return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the remnant [[H7604]] of you, that are escaped [[H6413]] out of the hand [[H3709]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 7
And be [[H1961]] not [[H408]] ye like your fathers, [[H1]] and like your brethren, [[H251]] which [[H834]] trespassed [[H4603]] against the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] therefore gave them up [[H5414]] to desolation, [[H8047]] as [[H834]] ye [[H859]] see. [[H7200]]

### 8
Now [[H6258]] be ye not stiffnecked, [[H7185]] as your fathers [[H1]] yield [[H5414]] yourselves [[H3027]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and enter [[H935]] into his sanctuary, [[H4720]] which [[H834]] he hath sanctified [[H6942]] for ever: [[H5769]] and serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] that the fierceness [[H2740]] of his wrath [[H639]] may turn away [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] you. [[H4480]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] if ye turn again [[H7725]] unto [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] your brethren [[H251]] and your children [[H1121]] compassion [[H7356]] before [[H6440]] them that lead them captive, [[H7617]] so that they shall come again [[H7725]] into this [[H2063]] land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] gracious [[H2587]] and merciful, [[H7349]] and will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] you, if [[H518]] ye return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 10
So the posts [[H7323]] passed [[H5674]] from city [[H5892]] to city [[H5892]] through the country [[H776]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] even unto [[H5704]] Zebulun: [[H2074]] but they laughed them to scorn, [[H7832]] and mocked [[H3932]] them. [[H3932]]

### 11
Nevertheless [[H389]] divers [[H582]] of Asher [[H836]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] and of Zebulun [[H2074]] humbled themselves, [[H3665]] and came [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 12
Also [[H1571]] in Judah [[H3063]] the hand [[H3027]] of God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] to give [[H5414]] them one [[H259]] heart [[H3820]] to do [[H6213]] the commandment [[H4687]] of the king [[H4428]] and of the princes, [[H8269]] by the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And there assembled [[H622]] at Jerusalem [[H3389]] much [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] to keep [[H6213]] the feast [[H2282]] of unleavened bread [[H4682]] in the second [[H8145]] month, [[H2320]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H7230]] congregation. [[H6951]]

### 14
And they arose [[H6965]] and took away [[H5493]] the altars [[H4196]] that [[H834]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and all [[H3605]] the altars for incense [[H6999]] took they away, [[H5493]] and cast [[H7993]] into the brook [[H5158]] Kidron. [[H6939]]

### 15
Then they killed [[H7819]] the passover [[H6453]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] of the second [[H8145]] month: [[H2320]] and the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites [[H3881]] were ashamed, [[H3637]] and sanctified themselves, [[H6942]] and brought in [[H935]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
And they stood [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] their place [[H5977]] after their manner, [[H4941]] according to the law [[H8451]] of Moses [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God: [[H430]] the priests [[H3548]] sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood, [[H1818]] of the hand [[H3027]] of the Levites. [[H3881]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] in the congregation [[H6951]] that [[H834]] were not [[H3808]] sanctified: [[H6942]] therefore the Levites [[H3881]] had the charge of [[H5921]] the killing [[H7821]] of the passovers [[H6453]] for every one [[H3605]] not [[H3808]] clean, [[H2889]] to sanctify [[H6942]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] a multitude [[H4768]] of the people, [[H5971]] many [[H7227]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] Issachar, [[H3485]] and Zebulun, [[H2074]] had not [[H3808]] cleansed themselves, [[H2891]] yet [[H3588]] did they eat [[H398]] the passover [[H6453]] otherwise [[H3808]] than it was written. [[H3789]] But [[H3588]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] prayed [[H6419]] for [[H5921]] them, saying, [[H559]] The good [[H2896]] Lord [[H3068]] pardon [[H3722]] every one [[H1157]]

### 19
prepareth [[H3559]] his heart [[H3824]] to seek [[H1875]] God, [[H430]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of his fathers, [[H1]] though not [[H3808]] according to the purification [[H2893]] of the sanctuary. [[H6944]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] hearkened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H3169]] and healed [[H7495]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 21
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] that were present [[H4672]] at Jerusalem [[H3389]] kept [[H6213]] the feast [[H2282]] of unleavened bread [[H4682]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] with great [[H1419]] gladness: [[H8057]] and the Levites [[H3881]] and the priests [[H3548]] praised [[H1984]] the Lord [[H3068]] day [[H3117]] by day, [[H3117]] with loud [[H5797]] instruments [[H3627]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
And Hezekiah [[H3169]] spake [[H1696]] comfortably [[H3820]] unto all [[H3605]] the Levites [[H3881]] that taught [[H7919]] the good [[H2896]] knowledge [[H7922]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and they did eat [[H398]] throughout [[H853]] the feast [[H4150]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] offering [[H2076]] peace [[H8002]] offerings, [[H2077]] and making confession [[H3034]] to the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 23
And the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] took counsel [[H3289]] to keep [[H6213]] other [[H312]] seven [[H7651]] days: [[H3117]] and they kept [[H6213]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] with gladness. [[H8057]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] did give [[H7311]] to the congregation [[H6951]] a thousand [[H505]] bullocks [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] sheep; [[H6629]] and the princes [[H8269]] gave [[H7311]] to the congregation [[H6951]] a thousand [[H505]] bullocks [[H6499]] and ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] sheep: [[H6629]] and a great number [[H7230]] of priests [[H3548]] sanctified themselves. [[H6942]]

### 25
And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Judah, [[H3063]] with the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] that came out [[H935]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the strangers [[H1616]] that came out [[H935]] of the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and that dwelt [[H3427]] in Judah, [[H3063]] rejoiced. [[H8055]]

### 26
So there was [[H1961]] great [[H1419]] joy [[H8057]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] since the time [[H3117]] of Solomon [[H8010]] the son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] not [[H3808]] the like [[H2063]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 27
Then the priests [[H3548]] the Levites [[H3881]] arose [[H6965]] and blessed [[H1288]] the people: [[H5971]] and their voice [[H6963]] was heard, [[H8085]] and their prayer [[H8605]] came [[H935]] to his holy [[H6944]] dwelling place, [[H4583]] unto heaven. [[H8064]]
