### 1
Hezekiah [[H3169]] began to reign [[H4427]] five [[H2568]] and twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] and he reigned [[H4427]] nine [[H8672]] and twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Abijah, [[H29]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zechariah. [[H2148]]

### 2
And he did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] his father [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]]

### 3
He [[H1931]] in the first [[H7223]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] in the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] opened [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and repaired [[H2388]] them. [[H2388]]

### 4
And he brought in [[H935]] the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] and gathered them together [[H622]] into the east [[H4217]] street, [[H7339]]

### 5
And said [[H559]] unto them, Hear [[H8085]] me, ye Levites, [[H3881]] sanctify [[H6942]]  now yourselves, [[H6258]] and sanctify [[H6942]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] and carry forth [[H3318]] the filthiness [[H5079]] out of [[H4480]] the holy [[H6944]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] our fathers [[H1]] have trespassed, [[H4603]] and done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and have forsaken [[H5800]] him, and have turned away [[H5437]] their faces [[H6440]] from the habitation [[H4908]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and turned [[H5414]] backs. [[H6203]]

### 7
Also [[H1571]] they have shut up [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] of the porch, [[H197]] and put out [[H3518]] the lamps, [[H5216]] and have not [[H3808]] burned [[H6999]] incense [[H7004]] nor [[H3808]] offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] in the holy [[H6944]] unto the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
Wherefore the wrath [[H7110]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he hath delivered [[H5414]] them to trouble, [[H2113]] to astonishment, [[H8047]] and to hissing, [[H8322]] as [[H834]] ye [[H859]] see [[H7200]] with your eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
For, lo, [[H2009]] our fathers [[H1]] have fallen [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and our sons [[H1121]] and our daughters [[H1323]] and our wives [[H802]] in captivity [[H7628]] for [[H5921]] this. [[H2063]]

### 10
Now [[H6258]] in [[H5973]] mine heart [[H3824]] to make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that his fierce [[H2740]] wrath [[H639]] may turn away [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] us. [[H4480]]

### 11
My sons, [[H1121]] be not [[H408]] now [[H6258]] negligent: [[H7952]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath chosen [[H977]] you to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him, to serve [[H8334]] him, and that ye should minister [[H8334]] unto him, and burn incense. [[H6999]]

### 12
Then the Levites [[H3881]] arose, [[H6965]] Mahath [[H4287]] the son [[H1121]] of Amasai, [[H6022]] and Joel [[H3100]] the son [[H1121]] of Azariah, [[H5838]] of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of the Kohathites: [[H6956]] and of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Merari, [[H4847]] Kish [[H7027]] the son [[H1121]] of Abdi, [[H5660]] and Azariah [[H5838]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehalelel: [[H3094]] and of [[H4480]] the Gershonites; [[H1649]] Joah [[H3098]] the son [[H1121]] of Zimmah, [[H2155]] and Eden [[H5731]] the son [[H1121]] of Joah: [[H3098]]

### 13
And of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Elizaphan; [[H469]] Shimri, [[H8113]] and Jeiel: [[H3273]] and of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Asaph; [[H623]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Mattaniah: [[H4983]]

### 14
And of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Heman; [[H1968]] Jehiel, [[H3171]] and Shimei: [[H8096]] and of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jeduthun; [[H3038]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] and Uzziel. [[H5816]]

### 15
And they gathered [[H622]] their brethren, [[H251]] and sanctified themselves, [[H6942]] and came, [[H935]] according to the commandment [[H4687]] of the king, [[H4428]] by the words [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to cleanse [[H2891]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
And the priests [[H3548]] went [[H935]] into the inner part [[H6441]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to cleanse [[H2891]] and brought out [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] the uncleanness [[H2932]] that [[H834]] they found [[H4672]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord [[H3068]] into the court [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And the Levites [[H3881]] took [[H6901]] to carry out [[H3318]] abroad [[H2351]] into the brook [[H5158]] Kidron. [[H6939]]

### 17
Now they began [[H2490]] on the first [[H259]] of the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] to sanctify, [[H6942]] and on the eighth [[H8083]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] came [[H935]] they to the porch [[H197]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] so they sanctified [[H6942]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in eight [[H8083]] days; [[H3117]] and in the sixteenth [[H8337]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] they made an end. [[H3615]]

### 18
Then they went [[H935]] in [[H6441]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] We have cleansed [[H2891]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering, [[H5930]] with all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] thereof, and the shewbread [[H4635]] table, [[H7979]]  with [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] thereof. [[H3627]]

### 19
Moreover all [[H3605]] the vessels, [[H3627]] which [[H834]] king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] in his reign [[H4438]] did cast away [[H2186]] in his transgression, [[H4604]] have we prepared [[H3559]] and sanctified, [[H6942]] and, behold, [[H2005]] they before [[H6440]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
Then Hezekiah [[H3169]] the king [[H4428]] rose early, [[H7925]] and gathered [[H622]] the rulers [[H8269]] of the city, [[H5892]] and went up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
And they brought [[H935]] seven [[H7651]] bullocks, [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams, [[H352]] and seven [[H7651]] lambs, [[H3532]] and seven [[H7651]] he [[H6842]] goats, [[H5795]] for a sin offering [[H2403]] for [[H5921]] the kingdom, [[H4467]] and for [[H5921]] the sanctuary, [[H4720]] and for [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]] And he commanded [[H559]] the priests [[H3548]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] to offer [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
So they killed [[H7819]] the bullocks, [[H1241]] and the priests [[H3548]] received [[H6901]] the blood, [[H1818]] and sprinkled [[H2236]] on the altar: [[H4196]] likewise, when they had killed [[H7819]] the rams, [[H352]] they sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] upon the altar: [[H4196]] they killed [[H7819]] also the lambs, [[H3532]] and they sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] upon the altar. [[H4196]]

### 23
And they brought forth [[H5066]] the he goats [[H8163]] the sin offering [[H2403]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] and the congregation; [[H6951]] and they laid [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] them: [[H5921]]

### 24
And the priests [[H3548]] killed [[H7819]] them, and they made reconciliation [[H2398]] with [[H854]] their blood [[H1818]] upon the altar, [[H4196]] to make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H559]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the sin offering [[H2403]] for all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 25
And he set [[H5975]] the Levites [[H3881]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with cymbals, [[H4700]] with psalteries, [[H5035]] and with harps, [[H3658]] according to the commandment [[H4687]] of David, [[H1732]] and of Gad [[H1410]] the king's [[H4428]] seer, [[H2374]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet: [[H5030]] for [[H3588]] the commandment [[H4687]] of [[H3027]] the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H3027]] his prophets. [[H5030]]

### 26
And the Levites [[H3881]] stood [[H5975]] with the instruments [[H3627]] of David, [[H1732]] and the priests [[H3548]] with the trumpets. [[H2689]]

### 27
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] commanded [[H559]] to offer [[H5927]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] upon the altar. [[H4196]] And when [[H6256]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] began, [[H2490]] the song [[H7892]] of the Lord [[H3068]] began [[H2490]] with the trumpets, [[H2689]] and with [[H5921]] the instruments [[H3627]] by [[H3027]] David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 28
And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] worshipped, [[H7812]] and the singers [[H7892]] sang, [[H7891]] and the trumpeters [[H2689]] sounded: [[H2690]] all [[H3605]] until [[H5704]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] was finished. [[H3615]]

### 29
And when they had made an end [[H3615]] of offering, [[H5927]] the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] that were present [[H4672]] with [[H854]] him bowed [[H3766]] themselves, and worshipped. [[H7812]]

### 30
Moreover Hezekiah [[H3169]] the king [[H4428]] and the princes [[H8269]] commanded [[H559]] the Levites [[H3881]] to sing praise [[H1984]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] with the words [[H1697]] of David, [[H1732]] and of Asaph [[H623]] the seer. [[H2374]] And they sang praises [[H1984]] with [[H5704]] gladness, [[H8057]] and they bowed their heads [[H6915]] and worshipped. [[H7812]]

### 31
Then Hezekiah [[H3169]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Now [[H6258]] ye have consecrated [[H4390]] yourselves unto the Lord, [[H3068]] come near [[H5066]] and bring [[H935]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and thank offerings [[H8426]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And the congregation [[H6951]] brought in [[H935]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and thank offerings; [[H8426]] and as many as [[H3605]] were of a free [[H5081]] heart [[H3820]] burnt offerings. [[H5930]]

### 32
And the number [[H4557]] of the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] which [[H834]] the congregation [[H6951]] brought, [[H935]] was [[H1961]] threescore and ten [[H7657]] bullocks, [[H1241]] an hundred [[H3967]] rams, [[H352]] two hundred [[H3967]] lambs: [[H3532]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] for a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 33
And the consecrated things [[H6944]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] oxen [[H1241]] and three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] sheep. [[H6629]]

### 34
But [[H7535]] the priests [[H3548]] were [[H1961]] too few, [[H4592]] so that they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] flay [[H6584]] all [[H3605]] the burnt offerings: [[H5930]] wherefore their brethren [[H251]] the Levites [[H3881]] did help [[H2388]] them, till [[H5704]] the work [[H4399]] was ended, [[H3615]] and until [[H5704]] the priests [[H3548]] had sanctified themselves: [[H6942]] for [[H3588]] the Levites [[H3881]] more upright [[H3477]] in heart [[H3824]] to sanctify themselves [[H6942]] than the priests. [[H3548]]

### 35
And also [[H1571]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] in abundance, [[H7230]] with the fat [[H2459]] of the peace offerings, [[H8002]] and the drink offerings [[H5262]] for burnt offering. [[H5930]] So the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was set in order. [[H3559]]

### 36
And Hezekiah [[H3169]] rejoiced, [[H8055]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] that [[H5921]] God [[H430]] had prepared [[H3559]] the people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] the thing [[H1697]] was [[H1961]] suddenly. [[H6597]]
