### 1
Now Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] had [[H1961]] riches [[H6239]] and honour [[H3519]] in abundance, [[H7230]] and joined affinity [[H2859]] with Ahab. [[H256]]

### 2
And after [[H7093]] years [[H8141]] he went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] Ahab [[H256]] to Samaria. [[H8111]] And Ahab [[H256]] killed [[H2076]] sheep [[H6629]] and oxen [[H1241]] for him in abundance, [[H7230]] and for the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him, and persuaded [[H5496]] him to go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]]

### 3
And Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Wilt thou go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] me to Ramoth-gilead? [[H7433]] And he answered [[H559]] him, I [[H3644]] as thou [[H3644]] and my people [[H5971]] as thy people; [[H5971]] and with [[H5973]] thee in the war. [[H4421]]

### 4
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Inquire, [[H1875]] I pray thee, [[H4994]]  at [[H853]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to day. [[H3117]]

### 5
Therefore the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] gathered together [[H6908]] of prophets [[H5030]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Shall we go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] to battle, [[H4421]] or [[H518]] shall I forbear? [[H2308]] And they said, [[H559]] Go up; [[H5927]] for God [[H430]] will deliver [[H5414]] into the king's [[H4428]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 6
But Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said, [[H559]] not [[H369]] here [[H6311]] a prophet [[H5030]] of the Lord [[H3068]] besides, [[H5750]] that we might inquire [[H1875]] of him? [[H853]]

### 7
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] yet [[H5750]] one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] by whom [[H853]] we may inquire [[H1875]]  of [[H853]] the Lord: [[H3068]] but I [[H589]] hate [[H8130]] him; for [[H3588]] he never [[H369]] prophesied [[H5012]] good [[H2896]] unto [[H5921]] me, but [[H3588]] always [[H3117]] evil: [[H7451]] the same [[H1931]] Micaiah [[H4321]] the son [[H1121]] of Imla. [[H3229]] And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] said, [[H559]] Let not [[H408]] the king [[H4428]] say [[H559]] so. [[H3651]]

### 8
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] called [[H7121]] for [[H413]] one [[H259]] officers, [[H5631]] and said, [[H559]] Fetch quickly [[H4116]] Micaiah [[H4319]] the son [[H1121]] of Imla. [[H3229]]

### 9
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] sat [[H3427]] either [[H376]] of them on [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] clothed [[H3847]] in robes, [[H899]] and they sat [[H3427]] in a void place [[H1637]] at the entering in [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of Samaria; [[H8111]] and all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] prophesied [[H5012]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 10
And Zedekiah [[H6667]] the son [[H1121]] of Chenaanah [[H3668]] had made [[H6213]] him horns [[H7161]] of iron, [[H1270]] and said, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] With these [[H428]] thou shalt push [[H5055]] Syria [[H758]] until [[H5704]] they be consumed. [[H3615]]

### 11
And all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] prophesied [[H5012]] so, [[H3651]] saying, [[H559]] Go up [[H5927]] to Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]] and prosper: [[H6743]] for the Lord [[H3068]] shall deliver [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king. [[H4428]]

### 12
And the messenger [[H4397]] that [[H834]] went [[H1980]] to call [[H7121]] Micaiah [[H4321]] spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the words [[H1697]] of the prophets [[H5030]] good [[H2896]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] with one [[H259]] assent; [[H6310]] let thy word [[H1697]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] be [[H1961]] like one [[H259]] of theirs, and speak [[H1696]] thou good. [[H2896]]

### 13
And Micaiah [[H4321]] said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] even [[H3588]] what [[H834]] my God [[H430]] saith, [[H559]] that will I speak. [[H1696]]

### 14
And when he was come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Micaiah, [[H4318]] shall we go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] to battle, [[H4421]] or [[H518]] shall I forbear? [[H2308]] And he said, [[H559]] Go ye up, [[H5927]] and prosper, [[H6743]] and they shall be delivered [[H5414]] into your hand. [[H3027]]

### 15
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] him, How many [[H5704]] times [[H6471]] shall I [[H589]] adjure [[H7650]] thee that [[H834]] thou say [[H1696]] nothing [[H3808]] but [[H7535]] the truth [[H571]] to [[H413]] me in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 16
Then he said, [[H559]] I did see [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] scattered [[H6327]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] as sheep [[H6629]] that [[H834]] have no [[H369]] shepherd: [[H7462]] and the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] These [[H428]] have no [[H3808]] master; [[H113]] let them return [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] to his house [[H1004]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 17
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] Did I not [[H3808]] tell [[H559]] thee he would not [[H3808]] prophesy [[H5012]] good [[H2896]] unto [[H5921]] me, but [[H3588]] evil? [[H7451]]

### 18
Again he said, [[H559]] Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] I saw [[H7200]] the Lord [[H3068]] sitting [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] standing [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] his right hand [[H3225]] and his left. [[H8040]]

### 19
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall entice [[H6601]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that he may go up [[H5927]] and fall [[H5307]] at Ramoth-gilead? [[H7433]] And one [[H2088]] spake [[H559]] saying [[H559]] after this manner, [[H3602]] and another [[H2088]] saying [[H559]] after that manner. [[H3602]]

### 20
Then there came out [[H3318]] a spirit, [[H7307]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] will entice [[H6601]] him. And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Wherewith? [[H4100]]

### 21
And he said, [[H559]] I will go out, [[H3318]] and be [[H1961]] a lying [[H8267]] spirit [[H7307]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of all [[H3605]] his prophets. [[H5030]] And said, [[H559]] Thou shalt entice [[H6601]] and thou shalt also [[H1571]] prevail: [[H3201]] go out, [[H3318]] and do [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]]

### 22
Now [[H6258]] therefore, behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath put [[H5414]] a lying [[H8267]] spirit [[H7307]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of these [[H428]] thy prophets, [[H5030]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 23
Then Zedekiah [[H6667]] the son [[H1121]] of Chenaanah [[H3668]] came near, [[H5066]] and smote [[H5221]] Micaiah [[H4321]] upon [[H5921]] the cheek, [[H3895]] and said, [[H559]] Which [[H335]] way [[H1870]] went [[H5674]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] from me [[H853]] to speak [[H1696]] unto thee? [[H854]]

### 24
And Micaiah [[H4321]] said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] when [[H834]] thou shalt go [[H935]] into an inner [[H2315]] chamber [[H2315]] to hide thyself. [[H2244]]

### 25
Then the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] Take [[H3947]]  ye [[H853]] Micaiah, [[H4321]] and carry him back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Amon [[H526]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city, [[H5892]] and to [[H413]] Joash [[H3101]] the king's [[H4428]] son; [[H1121]]

### 26
And say, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] Put [[H7760]] this [[H2088]] in the prison, [[H1004]] and feed [[H398]] him with bread [[H3899]] of affliction [[H3906]] and with water [[H4325]] of affliction, [[H3906]] until [[H5704]] I return [[H7725]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 27
And Micaiah [[H4321]] said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou certainly [[H7725]] return [[H7725]] in peace, [[H7965]] hath not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] spoken [[H1696]] by me. And he said, [[H559]] Hearken, [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] ye people. [[H5971]]

### 28
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]]

### 29
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] I will disguise myself, [[H2664]] and will go [[H935]] to the battle; [[H4421]] but put [[H3847]] thou on [[H859]] thy robes. [[H899]] So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] disguised himself; [[H2664]] and they went [[H935]] to the battle. [[H4421]]

### 30
Now the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] had commanded [[H6680]] the captains [[H8269]] of the chariots [[H7393]] that [[H834]] with him, saying, [[H559]] Fight [[H3898]] ye not [[H3808]] with [[H854]] small [[H6996]] or [[H854]] great, [[H1419]] save [[H3588]] only [[H905]] with [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 31
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the captains [[H8269]] of the chariots [[H7393]] saw [[H7200]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] that they [[H1992]] said, [[H559]] It [[H1931]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Therefore they compassed about [[H5437]] him to fight: [[H3898]] but Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] cried out, [[H2199]] and the Lord [[H3068]] helped [[H5826]] him; and God [[H430]] moved [[H5496]] them from [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 32
For it came to pass, [[H1961]] that, when the captains [[H8269]] of the chariots [[H7393]] perceived [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] it was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] they turned back again [[H7725]] from pursuing [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 33
And a man [[H376]] drew [[H4900]] a bow [[H7198]] at a venture, [[H8537]] and smote [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] between [[H996]] the joints [[H1694]] of the harness: [[H8302]] therefore he said [[H559]] to his chariot man, [[H7395]] Turn [[H2015]] thine hand, [[H3027]] that thou mayest carry me out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the host; [[H4264]] for [[H3588]] I am wounded. [[H2470]]

### 34
And the battle [[H4421]] increased [[H5927]] that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] howbeit the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] stayed up [[H5975]] in chariot [[H4818]] against [[H5227]] the Syrians [[H758]] until [[H5704]] the even: [[H6153]] and about the time [[H6256]] of the sun [[H8121]] going down [[H935]] he died. [[H4191]]
