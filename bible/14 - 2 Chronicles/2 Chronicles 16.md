### 1
In the six [[H8337]] and thirtieth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Asa [[H609]] Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] came up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]] and built [[H1129]] Ramah, [[H7414]] to the intent that he might let [[H5414]] none [[H1115]] go out [[H3318]] or come in [[H935]] to Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
Then Asa [[H609]] brought out [[H3318]] silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] out of the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] and of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] that dwelt [[H3427]] at Damascus, [[H1834]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
a league [[H1285]] between [[H996]] me and thee, as between [[H996]] my father [[H1]] and thy father: [[H1]] behold, [[H2009]] I have sent [[H7971]] thee silver [[H3701]] and gold; [[H2091]] go, [[H1980]] break [[H6565]] thy league [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that he may depart [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 4
And Ben-hadad [[H1130]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Asa, [[H609]] and sent [[H7971]] the captains [[H8269]] of his [[H834]] armies [[H2428]] against [[H413]] the cities [[H5892]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and they smote [[H5221]] Ijon, [[H5859]] and Dan, [[H1835]] and Abel-maim, [[H66]] and all [[H3605]] the store [[H4543]] cities [[H5892]] of Naphtali. [[H5321]]

### 5
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Baasha [[H1201]] heard [[H8085]] that he left off [[H2308]] building [[H1129]] of Ramah, [[H7414]]  and let [[H853]] his work [[H4399]] cease. [[H7673]]

### 6
Then Asa [[H609]] the king [[H4428]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] Judah; [[H3063]] and they carried away [[H5375]] the stones [[H68]] of Ramah, [[H7414]] and the timber [[H6086]] thereof, wherewith [[H834]] Baasha [[H1201]] was building; [[H1129]] and he built [[H1129]]  therewith [[H853]] Geba [[H1387]] and Mizpah. [[H4709]]

### 7
And at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Hanani [[H2607]] the seer [[H7200]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Because thou hast relied [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] and not [[H3808]] relied [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] therefore [[H5921]] is the host [[H2428]] of the king [[H4428]] of Syria [[H758]] escaped [[H4422]] out of thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 8
Were [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] the Ethiopians [[H3569]] and the Lubims [[H3864]] a huge [[H7230]] host, [[H2428]] with very [[H3966]] many [[H7235]] chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen? [[H6571]] yet, because thou didst rely [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he delivered [[H5414]] them into thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] run to and fro [[H7751]] throughout the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] to shew himself strong [[H2388]] in the behalf of [[H5973]] whose heart [[H3824]] perfect [[H8003]] toward [[H413]] him. Herein [[H5921]] thou hast done foolishly: [[H5528]] therefore [[H3588]] from henceforth [[H6258]] thou shalt have [[H3426]] wars. [[H4421]]

### 10
Then Asa [[H609]] was wroth [[H3707]] with [[H413]] the seer, [[H7200]] and put [[H5414]] him in a prison [[H4115]] house; [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] in a rage [[H2197]] with [[H5973]] him because of [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] And Asa [[H609]] oppressed [[H7533]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] the same [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

### 11
And, behold, [[H2009]] the acts [[H1697]] of Asa, [[H609]] first [[H7223]] and last, [[H314]] lo, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 12
And Asa [[H609]] in the thirty [[H7970]] and ninth [[H8672]] year [[H8141]] of his reign [[H4438]] was diseased [[H2456]] in his feet, [[H7272]] until [[H5704]] his disease [[H2483]] exceeding [[H4605]] yet [[H1571]] in his disease [[H2483]] he sought [[H1875]] not [[H3808]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] but [[H3588]] to the physicians. [[H7495]]

### 13
And Asa [[H609]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and died [[H4191]] in the one [[H259]] and fortieth [[H705]] year [[H8141]] of his reign. [[H4427]]

### 14
And they buried [[H6912]] him in his own sepulchres, [[H6913]] which [[H834]] he had made [[H3738]] for himself in the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] and laid [[H7901]] him in the bed [[H4904]] which [[H834]] was filled [[H4390]] with sweet odours [[H1314]] and divers kinds [[H2177]] prepared by the apothecaries' [[H4842]] art: [[H4639]] and they made [[H8313]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] burning [[H8316]] for him.
