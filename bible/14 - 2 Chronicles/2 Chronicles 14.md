### 1
So Abijah [[H29]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in the city [[H5892]] of David: [[H1732]] and Asa [[H609]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]] In his days [[H3117]] the land [[H776]] was quiet [[H8252]] ten [[H6235]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And Asa [[H609]] did [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] and right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his God: [[H430]]

### 3
For he took away [[H5493]] the altars [[H4196]] of the strange [[H5236]] and the high places, [[H1116]] and brake down [[H7665]] the images, [[H4676]] and cut down [[H1438]] the groves: [[H842]]

### 4
And commanded [[H559]] Judah [[H3063]] to seek [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] and to do [[H6213]] the law [[H8451]] and the commandment. [[H4687]]

### 5
Also he took away [[H5493]] out of all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] the high places [[H1116]] and the images: [[H2553]] and the kingdom [[H4467]] was quiet [[H8252]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 6
And he built [[H1129]] fenced [[H4694]] cities [[H5892]] in Judah: [[H3063]] for [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] had rest, [[H8252]] and he had no [[H369]] war [[H4421]] in those [[H428]] years; [[H8141]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had given him rest. [[H5117]]

### 7
Therefore he said [[H559]] unto Judah, [[H3063]] Let us build [[H1129]] these [[H428]] cities, [[H5892]] and make about [[H5437]] walls, [[H2346]] and towers, [[H4026]] gates, [[H1817]] and bars, [[H1280]] the land [[H776]] yet [[H5750]] before [[H6440]] us; because [[H3588]] we have sought [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] we have sought [[H1875]] and he hath given us rest [[H5117]] on every side. [[H5439]] So they built [[H1129]] and prospered. [[H6743]]

### 8
And Asa [[H609]] had [[H1961]] an army [[H2428]] that bare [[H5375]] targets [[H6793]] and spears, [[H7420]] out of Judah [[H3063]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand; [[H505]] and out of Benjamin, [[H1144]] that bare [[H5375]] shields [[H4043]] and drew [[H1869]] bows, [[H7198]] two hundred [[H3967]] and fourscore [[H8084]] thousand: [[H505]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] mighty men [[H1368]] of valour. [[H2428]]

### 9
And there came out [[H3318]] against [[H413]] them Zerah [[H2226]] the Ethiopian [[H3569]] with an host [[H2428]] of a thousand [[H505]] thousand, [[H505]] and three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] chariots; [[H4818]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] Mareshah. [[H4762]]

### 10
Then Asa [[H609]] went out [[H3318]] against [[H6440]] him, and they set the battle [[H4421]] in array [[H6186]] in the valley [[H1516]] of Zephathah [[H6859]] at Mareshah. [[H4762]]

### 11
And Asa [[H609]] cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] and said, [[H559]] Lord, [[H3068]] nothing [[H369]] with [[H5973]] thee to help, [[H5826]] whether [[H996]] with many, [[H7227]] or with them that have no [[H369]] power: [[H3581]] help [[H5826]] us, O Lord [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] we rest [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] thee, and in thy name [[H8034]] we go [[H935]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] multitude. [[H1995]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou [[H859]] our God; [[H430]] let not [[H408]] man [[H582]] prevail [[H6113]] against [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 12
So the Lord [[H3068]] smote [[H5062]] the Ethiopians [[H3569]] before [[H6440]] Asa, [[H609]] and before [[H6440]] Judah; [[H3063]] and the Ethiopians [[H3569]] fled. [[H5127]]

### 13
And Asa [[H609]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him pursued [[H7291]] them unto [[H5704]] Gerar: [[H1642]] and the Ethiopians [[H3569]] were overthrown, [[H5307]] that they could not [[H369]] recover [[H4241]] themselves; for [[H3588]] they were destroyed [[H7665]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and before [[H6440]] his host; [[H4264]] and they carried away [[H5375]] very [[H3966]] much [[H7235]] spoil. [[H7998]]

### 14
And they smote [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] round about [[H5439]] Gerar; [[H1642]] for [[H3588]] the fear [[H6343]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] them: and they spoiled [[H962]] all [[H3605]] the cities; [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] there was [[H1961]] exceeding much [[H7227]] spoil [[H961]] in them. [[H961]]

### 15
They smote [[H5221]] also [[H1571]] the tents [[H168]] of cattle, [[H4735]] and carried away [[H7617]] sheep [[H6629]] and camels [[H1581]] in abundance, [[H7230]] and returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
