### 1
Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] took [[H3947]] Uzziah, [[H5818]] who [[H1931]] sixteen [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] and made him king [[H4427]] in the room of [[H8478]] his father [[H1]] Amaziah. [[H558]]

### 2
He [[H1931]] built [[H1129]] Eloth, [[H359]] and restored [[H7725]] it to Judah, [[H3063]] after that [[H310]] the king [[H4428]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers. [[H1]]

### 3
Sixteen [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] Uzziah [[H5818]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] fifty [[H2572]] and two [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] His mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] also Jecoliah [[H3203]] of [[H4480]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 4
And he did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Amaziah [[H558]] did. [[H6213]]

### 5
And he sought [[H1875]] God [[H430]] in the days [[H3117]] of Zechariah, [[H2148]] who had understanding [[H995]] in the visions [[H7200]] of God: [[H430]] and as long as [[H3117]] he sought [[H1875]] the Lord, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] made him to prosper. [[H6743]]

### 6
And he went forth [[H3318]] and warred [[H3898]] against the Philistines, [[H6430]] and brake down [[H6555]] the wall [[H2346]] of Gath, [[H1661]] and the wall [[H2346]] of Jabneh, [[H2996]] and the wall [[H2346]] of Ashdod, [[H795]] and built [[H1129]] cities [[H5892]] about Ashdod, [[H795]] and among the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 7
And God [[H430]] helped [[H5826]] him against [[H5921]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and against [[H5921]] the Arabians [[H6163]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in Gur-baal, [[H1485]] and the Mehunims. [[H4586]]

### 8
And the Ammonites [[H5984]] gave [[H5414]] gifts [[H4503]] to Uzziah: [[H5818]] and his name [[H8034]] spread abroad [[H1980]] to [[H5704]] the entering in [[H935]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] he strengthened [[H2388]] exceedingly. [[H4605]]

### 9
Moreover Uzziah [[H5818]] built [[H1129]] towers [[H4026]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] at [[H5921]] the corner [[H6438]] gate, [[H8179]] and at [[H5921]] the valley [[H1516]] gate, [[H8179]] and at [[H5921]] the turning [[H4740]] and fortified [[H2388]] them. [[H2388]]

### 10
Also he built [[H1129]] towers [[H4026]] in the desert, [[H4057]] and digged [[H2672]] many [[H7227]] wells: [[H953]] for [[H3588]] he had [[H1961]] much [[H7227]] cattle, [[H4735]] both in the low country, [[H8219]] and in the plains: [[H4334]] husbandmen [[H406]] and vine dressers [[H3755]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] and in Carmel: [[H3760]] for [[H3588]] he loved [[H157]] husbandry. [[H127]]

### 11
Moreover Uzziah [[H5818]] had [[H1961]] an host [[H2428]] of fighting [[H4421]] men, [[H6213]] that went out [[H3318]] to war [[H6635]] by bands, [[H1416]] according to the number [[H4557]] of their account [[H6486]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Jeiel [[H3273]] the scribe [[H5608]] and Maaseiah [[H4641]] the ruler, [[H7860]] under [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of Hananiah, [[H2608]] of the king's [[H4428]] captains. [[H8269]]

### 12
The whole [[H3605]] number [[H4557]] of the chief [[H7218]] of the fathers [[H1]] of the mighty men [[H1368]] of valour [[H2428]] two thousand [[H505]] and six [[H8337]] hundred. [[H3967]]

### 13
And under [[H5921]] their hand [[H3027]] an army, [[H2428]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] and seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] and five [[H2568]] hundred, [[H3967]] that made [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] with mighty [[H2428]] power, [[H3581]] to help [[H5826]] the king [[H4428]] against [[H5921]] the enemy. [[H341]]

### 14
And Uzziah [[H5818]] prepared [[H3559]] for them throughout all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] shields, [[H4043]] and spears, [[H7420]] and helmets, [[H3553]] and habergeons, [[H8302]] and bows, [[H7198]] and slings [[H7050]] stones. [[H68]]

### 15
And he made [[H6213]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] engines, [[H2810]] invented [[H4284]] by cunning men, [[H2803]] to be [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the towers [[H4026]] and upon [[H5921]] the bulwarks, [[H6438]] to shoot [[H3384]] arrows [[H2671]] and great [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] withal. And his name [[H8034]] spread [[H3318]] far abroad; [[H7350]] for [[H3588]] he was marvellously [[H6381]] helped, [[H5826]] till [[H3588]] he was strong. [[H2388]]

### 16
But when he was strong, [[H2393]] his heart [[H3820]] was lifted up [[H1361]] to [[H5704]] destruction: [[H7843]] for he transgressed [[H4603]] against the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] and went [[H935]] into [[H413]] the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to burn incense [[H6999]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of incense. [[H7004]]

### 17
And Azariah [[H5838]] the priest [[H3548]] went in [[H935]] after [[H310]] him, and with [[H5973]] him fourscore [[H8084]] priests [[H3548]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] valiant [[H2428]] men: [[H1121]]

### 18
And they withstood [[H5975]] Uzziah [[H5818]] the king, [[H4428]] and said [[H559]] unto him, not [[H3808]] unto thee, Uzziah, [[H5818]] to burn incense [[H6999]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] but [[H3588]] to the priests [[H3548]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] that are consecrated [[H6942]] to burn incense: [[H6999]] go out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the sanctuary; [[H4720]] for [[H3588]] thou hast trespassed; [[H4603]] neither [[H3808]] for thine honour [[H3519]] from the Lord [[H3068]] God. [[H430]]

### 19
Then Uzziah [[H5818]] was wroth, [[H2196]] and a censer [[H4730]] in his hand [[H3027]] to burn incense: [[H6999]] and while he was wroth [[H2196]] with [[H5973]] the priests, [[H3548]] the leprosy [[H6883]] even rose up [[H2224]] in his forehead [[H4696]] before [[H6440]] the priests [[H3548]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] from beside [[H5921]] the incense [[H7004]] altar. [[H4196]]

### 20
And Azariah [[H5838]] the chief [[H7218]] priest, [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] the priests, [[H3548]] looked [[H6437]] upon [[H413]] him, and, behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] leprous [[H6879]] in his forehead, [[H4696]] and they thrust him out [[H926]] from thence; [[H8033]] yea, himself [[H1931]] hasted [[H1765]] also [[H1571]] to go out, [[H3318]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had smitten [[H5060]] him. [[H5060]]

### 21
And Uzziah [[H5818]] the king [[H4428]] was [[H1961]] a leper [[H6879]] unto [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of his death, [[H4194]] and dwelt in [[H3427]] a several [[H2669]] house, [[H1004]] a leper; [[H6879]] for [[H3588]] he was cut off [[H1504]] from the house [[H1004]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and Jotham [[H3147]] his son [[H1121]] over [[H5921]] the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] judging [[H8199]] the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 22
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] first [[H7223]] and last, [[H314]] did Isaiah [[H3470]] the prophet, [[H5030]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz, [[H531]] write. [[H3789]]

### 23
So Uzziah [[H5818]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and they buried [[H6912]] him with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the field [[H7704]] of the burial [[H6900]] which [[H834]] to the kings; [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] He [[H1931]] a leper: [[H6879]] and Jotham [[H3147]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead.
