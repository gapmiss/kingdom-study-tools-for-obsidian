### 1
After [[H310]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] and the establishment [[H571]] thereof, Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] came, [[H935]] and entered [[H935]] into Judah, [[H3063]] and encamped [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] the fenced [[H1219]] cities, [[H5892]] and thought [[H559]] to win [[H1234]] them for [[H413]] himself. [[H413]]

### 2
And when Hezekiah [[H3169]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] was come, [[H935]] and that he was purposed [[H6440]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]]

### 3
He took counsel [[H3289]] with [[H5973]] his princes [[H8269]] and his mighty men [[H1368]] to stop [[H5640]] the waters [[H4325]] of the fountains [[H5869]] which [[H834]] without [[H2351]] the city: [[H5892]] and they did help [[H5826]] him. [[H5826]]

### 4
So there was gathered together, [[H6908]] much [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] who stopped [[H5640]] all [[H3605]] the fountains, [[H4599]] and the brook [[H5158]] that ran [[H7857]] through the midst [[H8432]] of the land, [[H776]] saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] should the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] come, [[H935]] and find [[H4672]] much [[H7227]] water? [[H4325]]

### 5
Also he strengthened himself, [[H2388]] and built up [[H1129]] all [[H3605]] the wall [[H2346]] that was broken, [[H6555]] and raised up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] the towers, [[H4026]] and another [[H312]] wall [[H2346]] without, [[H2351]] and repaired [[H2388]] Millo [[H4407]] the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] and made [[H6213]] darts [[H7973]] and shields [[H4043]] in abundance. [[H7230]]

### 6
And he set [[H5414]] captains [[H8269]] of war [[H4421]] over [[H5921]] the people, [[H5971]] and gathered them together [[H6908]] to [[H413]] him in [[H413]] the street [[H7339]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the city, [[H5892]] and spake [[H1696]] comfortably [[H3824]] to them, saying, [[H559]]

### 7
Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous, [[H553]] be not afraid [[H3372]] nor [[H408]] dismayed [[H2865]] for [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] nor for [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the multitude [[H1995]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him: for [[H3588]] more [[H7227]] with [[H5973]] us than with [[H5973]] him: [[H5973]]

### 8
With [[H5973]] him an arm [[H2220]] of flesh; [[H1320]] but with [[H5973]] us the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] to help [[H5826]] us, and to fight [[H3898]] our battles. [[H4421]] And the people [[H5971]] rested themselves [[H5564]] upon [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of Hezekiah [[H3169]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 9
After [[H310]] this [[H2088]] did Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] send [[H7971]] his servants [[H5650]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] (but he [[H1931]] against [[H5921]] Lachish, [[H3923]] and all [[H3605]] his power [[H4475]] with [[H5973]] him,) unto [[H5921]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and unto [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] that [[H834]] at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]]

### 10
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] Whereon [[H5921]] do ye [[H859]] trust, [[H982]] that ye abide [[H3427]] in the siege [[H4692]] in Jerusalem? [[H3389]]

### 11
Doth not [[H3808]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] persuade [[H5496]] you to give over [[H5414]] yourselves to die [[H4191]] by famine [[H7458]] and by thirst, [[H6772]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] shall deliver [[H5337]] us out of the hand [[H3709]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria? [[H804]]

### 12
Hath not [[H3808]] the same [[H1931]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] taken away [[H5493]] his high places [[H1116]] and his altars, [[H4196]] and commanded [[H559]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] Ye shall worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] one [[H259]] altar, [[H4196]] and burn incense [[H6999]] upon [[H5921]] it? [[H5921]]

### 13
Know [[H3045]] ye not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]] I [[H589]] and my fathers [[H1]] have done [[H6213]] unto all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of lands? [[H776]] were the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H1471]] of those lands [[H776]] any ways [[H3605]] able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] their lands [[H776]] out of mine hand? [[H3027]]

### 14
Who [[H4310]] among all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of those [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] my fathers [[H1]] utterly destroyed, [[H2763]] that [[H834]] could [[H3201]] deliver [[H5337]] his people [[H5971]] out of mine hand, [[H3027]] that [[H3588]] your God [[H430]] should be able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] you out of mine hand? [[H3027]]

### 15
Now [[H6258]] therefore let not [[H408]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] deceive [[H5377]] you, nor [[H408]] persuade [[H5496]] you on this manner, [[H2063]] neither [[H408]] yet believe [[H539]] him: for [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] god [[H433]] of any [[H3605]] nation [[H1471]] or kingdom [[H4467]] was able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] his people [[H5971]] out of mine hand, [[H3027]] and out of the hand [[H3027]] of my fathers: [[H1]] how much less [[H637]] shall your God [[H430]] deliver [[H5337]] you out of mine hand? [[H3027]]

### 16
And his servants [[H5650]] spake [[H1696]] yet [[H5750]] against [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] and against [[H5921]] his servant [[H5650]] Hezekiah. [[H3169]]

### 17
He wrote [[H3789]] also letters [[H5612]] to rail [[H2778]] on the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and to speak [[H559]] against [[H5921]] him, saying, [[H559]] As the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H1471]] of lands [[H776]] have not [[H3808]] delivered [[H5337]] their people [[H5971]] out of mine hand, [[H3027]] so [[H3651]] shall not [[H3808]] the God [[H430]] of Hezekiah [[H3169]] deliver [[H5337]] his people [[H5971]] out of mine hand. [[H3027]]

### 18
Then they cried [[H7121]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] in the Jews' speech [[H3066]] unto [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] that [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] to affright [[H3372]] them, and to trouble [[H926]] them; that [[H4616]] they might take [[H3920]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 19
And they spake [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] the God [[H430]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] as against the gods [[H430]] of the people [[H5971]] of the earth, [[H776]] the work [[H4639]] of the hands [[H3027]] of man. [[H120]]

### 20
And for [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] the king, [[H4428]] and the prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz, [[H531]] prayed [[H6419]] and cried [[H2199]] to heaven. [[H8064]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] an angel, [[H4397]] which cut off [[H3582]] all [[H3605]] the mighty men [[H1368]] of valour, [[H2428]] and the leaders [[H5057]] and captains [[H8269]] in the camp [[H4264]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] So he returned [[H7725]] with shame [[H1322]] of face [[H6440]] to his own land. [[H776]] And when he was come into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of his god, [[H430]] they that came forth [[H3329]] of his own bowels [[H4578]] slew [[H5307]] him there [[H8033]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 22
Thus the Lord [[H3068]] saved [[H3467]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] from the hand [[H3027]] of Sennacherib [[H5576]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and from the hand [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] and guided [[H5095]] them on every side. [[H5439]]

### 23
And many [[H7227]] brought [[H935]] gifts [[H4503]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and presents [[H4030]] to Hezekiah [[H3169]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] so that he was magnified [[H5375]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] from thenceforth. [[H310]]

### 24
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] was sick [[H2470]] to [[H5704]] the death, [[H4191]] and prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and he spake [[H559]] unto him, and he gave [[H5414]] him a sign. [[H4159]]

### 25
But Hezekiah [[H3169]] rendered not again [[H7725]] according to the benefit [[H1576]] unto [[H5921]] him; for [[H3588]] his heart [[H3820]] was lifted up: [[H1361]] therefore there was [[H1961]] wrath [[H7110]] upon [[H5921]] him, and upon [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 26
Hezekiah [[H3169]] Notwithstanding humbled himself [[H3665]] for the pride [[H1363]] of his heart, [[H3820]] he [[H1931]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so that the wrath [[H7110]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H935]] not [[H3808]] upon them [[H5921]] in the days of [[H3117]] Hezekiah. [[H2396]]

### 27
And Hezekiah [[H3169]] had [[H1961]] exceeding [[H3966]] much [[H7235]] riches [[H6239]] and honour: [[H3519]] and he made [[H6213]] himself treasuries [[H214]] for silver, [[H3701]] and for gold, [[H2091]] and for precious [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] and for spices, [[H1314]] and for shields, [[H4043]] and for all manner [[H3605]] of pleasant [[H2532]] jewels; [[H3627]]

### 28
Storehouses [[H4543]] also for the increase [[H8393]] of corn, [[H1715]] and wine, [[H8492]] and oil; [[H3323]] and stalls [[H723]] for all manner [[H3605]] of beasts, [[H929]] and cotes [[H220]] for flocks. [[H5739]]

### 29
Moreover he provided [[H6213]] him cities, [[H5892]] and possessions [[H4735]] of flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] in abundance: [[H7230]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] had given [[H5414]] him substance [[H7399]] very [[H3966]] much. [[H7227]]

### 30
This same [[H1931]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] also stopped [[H5640]] the upper [[H5945]] watercourse [[H4161]] of Gihon, [[H1521]] and brought it straight [[H3474]] down [[H4295]] to the west side [[H4628]] of the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And Hezekiah [[H3169]] prospered [[H6743]] in all [[H3605]] his works. [[H4639]]

### 31
Howbeit [[H3651]] in the ambassadors [[H3887]] of the princes [[H8269]] of Babylon, [[H894]] who sent [[H7971]] unto [[H5921]] him to inquire of [[H1875]] the wonder [[H4159]] that [[H834]] was [[H1961]] in the land, [[H776]] God [[H430]] left [[H5800]] him, to try [[H5254]] him, that he might know [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] in his heart. [[H3824]]

### 32
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Hezekiah, [[H3169]] and his goodness, [[H2617]] behold, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] in the vision [[H2377]] of Isaiah [[H3470]] the prophet, [[H5030]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz, [[H531]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 33
And Hezekiah [[H3169]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in the chiefest [[H4608]] of the sepulchres [[H6913]] of the sons [[H1121]] of David: [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] did him [[H6213]] honour [[H3519]] at his death. [[H4194]] And Manasseh [[H4519]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
