### 1
Amaziah [[H558]] twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] twenty [[H6242]] and nine [[H8672]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Jehoaddan [[H3086]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 2
And he did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] but [[H7535]] not [[H3808]] with a perfect [[H8003]] heart. [[H3824]]

### 3
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] the kingdom [[H4467]] was established [[H2388]] to [[H5921]] him, that he slew [[H2026]] his servants [[H5650]] that had killed [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] his father. [[H1]]

### 4
But he slew [[H4191]] not [[H3808]] their children, [[H1121]] but [[H3588]] as written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] in the book [[H5612]] of Moses, [[H4872]] where [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded, [[H6680]] saying, [[H559]] The fathers [[H1]] shall not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] the children, [[H1121]] neither [[H3808]] shall the children [[H1121]] die [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] the fathers, [[H1]] but [[H3588]] every man [[H376]] shall die [[H4191]] for his own sin. [[H2399]]

### 5
Moreover Amaziah [[H558]] gathered together, [[H6908]] Judah [[H3063]] and made [[H5975]] them captains [[H8269]] over thousands, [[H505]] and captains [[H8269]] over hundreds, [[H3967]] according to the houses [[H1004]] of fathers, [[H1]] throughout all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin: [[H1144]] and he numbered [[H6485]] them from twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] and above, [[H4605]] and found [[H4672]] them three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] choice [[H977]] to go forth [[H3318]] to war, [[H6635]] that could handle [[H270]] spear [[H7420]] and shield. [[H6793]]

### 6
He hired [[H7936]] also an hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] mighty men [[H1368]] of valour [[H2428]] out of Israel [[H3478]] for an hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 7
But there came [[H935]] a man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] to [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] O king, [[H4428]] let not [[H408]] the army [[H6635]] of Israel [[H3478]] go [[H935]] with [[H5973]] thee; for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] not [[H369]] with [[H5973]] Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 8
But [[H3588]] if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] wilt go, [[H935]] do [[H6213]] be strong [[H2388]] for the battle: [[H4421]] God [[H430]] shall make thee fall [[H3782]] before [[H6440]] the enemy: [[H341]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] hath [[H3426]] power [[H3581]] to help, [[H5826]] and to cast down. [[H3782]]

### 9
And Amaziah [[H558]] said [[H559]] to the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] But what [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] for the hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] to the army [[H1416]] of Israel? [[H3478]] And the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] answered, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] is [[H3426]] able to give [[H5414]] thee much more [[H7235]] than this. [[H2088]]

### 10
Then Amaziah [[H558]] separated [[H914]] them, the army [[H1416]] that [[H834]] was come [[H935]] to [[H413]] him out of Ephraim, [[H669]] to go [[H3212]] home [[H4725]] again: wherefore their anger [[H639]] was greatly [[H3966]] kindled [[H2734]] against Judah, [[H3063]] and they returned [[H7725]] home [[H4725]] in great [[H2750]] anger. [[H639]]

### 11
And Amaziah [[H558]] strengthened himself, [[H2388]] and led forth [[H5090]] his people, [[H5971]] and went [[H1980]] to the valley [[H1516]] of salt, [[H4417]] and smote [[H5221]] of the children [[H1121]] of Seir [[H8165]] ten [[H6235]] thousand. [[H505]]

### 12
And ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] alive [[H2416]] did the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] carry away captive, [[H7617]] and brought [[H935]] them unto the top [[H7218]] of the rock, [[H5553]] and cast them down [[H7993]] from the top [[H7218]] of the rock, [[H5553]] that they all [[H3605]] were broken in pieces. [[H1234]]

### 13
But the soldiers [[H1121]] of the army [[H1416]] which [[H834]] Amaziah [[H558]] sent back, [[H7725]] that they should not go [[H3212]] with [[H5973]] him to battle, [[H4421]] fell upon [[H6584]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] from Samaria [[H8111]] even unto [[H5704]] Beth-horon, [[H1032]] and smote [[H5221]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] of them, and took [[H962]] much [[H7227]] spoil. [[H961]]

### 14
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] after that [[H310]] Amaziah [[H558]] was come [[H935]] from the slaughter [[H5221]] of the Edomites, [[H130]] that he brought [[H935]] the gods [[H430]] of the children [[H1121]] of Seir, [[H8165]] and set them up [[H5975]] his gods, [[H430]] and bowed down himself [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] them, and burned incense [[H6999]] unto them. [[H6999]]

### 15
Wherefore the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Amaziah, [[H558]] and he sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] him a prophet, [[H5030]] which said [[H559]] unto him, Why [[H4100]] hast thou sought after [[H1875]] the gods [[H430]] of the people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] could not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] their own people [[H5971]] out of thine hand? [[H3027]]

### 16
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as he talked [[H1696]] with [[H413]] him, that said [[H559]] unto him, Art thou made [[H5414]] of the king's [[H4428]] counsel? [[H3289]] forbear; [[H2308]] why [[H4100]] shouldest thou be smitten? [[H5221]] Then the prophet [[H5030]] forbare, [[H2308]] and said, [[H559]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] hath determined [[H3289]] to destroy [[H7843]] thee, because [[H3588]] thou hast done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] and hast not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto my counsel. [[H6098]]

### 17
Then Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] took advice, [[H3289]] and sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Joash, [[H3101]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz, [[H3059]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehu, [[H3058]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Come, [[H3212]] let us see one another [[H7200]] in the face. [[H6440]]

### 18
And Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] The thistle [[H2336]] that [[H834]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] the cedar [[H730]] that [[H834]] in Lebanon, [[H3844]] saying, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]] thy daughter [[H1323]] to my son [[H1121]] to wife: [[H802]] and there passed by [[H5674]] a wild [[H7704]] beast [[H2416]] that [[H834]] in Lebanon, [[H3844]] and trode down [[H7429]] the thistle. [[H2336]]

### 19
Thou sayest, [[H559]] Lo, [[H2009]] thou hast smitten [[H5221]] the Edomites; [[H123]] and thine heart [[H3820]] lifteth thee up [[H5375]] to boast: [[H3513]] abide [[H3427]] now [[H6258]] at home; [[H1004]] why [[H4100]] shouldest thou meddle [[H1624]] to hurt, [[H7451]] that thou shouldest fall, [[H5307]] thou, [[H859]] and Judah [[H3063]] with [[H5973]] thee? [[H5973]]

### 20
But Amaziah [[H558]] would not [[H3808]] hear; [[H8085]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] of God, [[H430]] that [[H4616]] he might deliver [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] they sought after [[H1875]] the gods [[H430]] of Edom. [[H123]]

### 21
So Joash [[H3101]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went up; [[H5927]] and they saw one another [[H7200]] in the face, [[H6440]] he [[H1931]] and Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] at Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] which [[H834]] to Judah. [[H3063]]

### 22
And Judah [[H3063]] was put to the worse [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] and they fled [[H5127]] every man [[H376]] to his tent. [[H168]]

### 23
And Joash [[H3101]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] took [[H8610]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash, [[H3101]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz, [[H3059]] at Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] and brought [[H935]] him to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and brake down [[H6555]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] from the gate [[H8179]] of Ephraim [[H669]] to [[H5704]] the corner [[H6437]] gate, [[H8179]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 24
And all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] and the silver, [[H3701]]  and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] that were found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] Obed-edom, [[H5654]] and the treasures [[H214]] of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] the hostages [[H1121]] also, and returned [[H7725]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 25
And Amaziah [[H558]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] lived [[H2421]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4191]] of Joash [[H3101]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] fifteen [[H2568]] years. [[H8141]]

### 26
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Amaziah, [[H558]] first [[H7223]] and last, [[H314]] behold, [[H2005]] they not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Israel? [[H3478]]

### 27
Now after the time [[H6256]] that [[H834]] Amaziah [[H558]] did turn away [[H5493]] from following [[H310]] the Lord [[H3068]] they made [[H7194]] a conspiracy [[H7195]] against [[H5921]] him in Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and he fled [[H5127]] to Lachish: [[H3923]] but they sent [[H7971]] to Lachish [[H3923]] after [[H310]] him, and slew [[H4191]] him there. [[H8033]]

### 28
And they brought [[H5375]] him upon [[H5921]] horses, [[H5483]] and buried [[H6912]] him with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]
