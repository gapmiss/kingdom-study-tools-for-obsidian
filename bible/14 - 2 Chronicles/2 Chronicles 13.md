### 1
Now in the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] began Abijah [[H29]] to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
He reigned [[H4427]] three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] His mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] also Michaiah [[H4322]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Uriel [[H222]] of [[H4480]] Gibeah. [[H1390]] And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Abijah [[H29]] and Jeroboam. [[H3379]]

### 3
And Abijah [[H29]] set [[H631]] the battle [[H4421]] in array with an army [[H2428]] of valiant men [[H1368]] of war, [[H4421]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] chosen [[H977]] men: [[H376]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] also set the battle [[H4421]] in array [[H6186]] against [[H5973]] him with eight [[H8083]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] chosen [[H977]] men, [[H376]] mighty men [[H1368]] of valour. [[H2428]]

### 4
And Abijah [[H29]] stood up [[H6965]] upon [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Zemaraim, [[H6787]] which [[H834]] in mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] me, thou Jeroboam, [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] Israel; [[H3478]]

### 5
Ought ye not [[H3808]] to know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] gave [[H5414]] the kingdom [[H4467]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] to David [[H1732]] for ever, [[H5769]] to him and to his sons [[H1121]] by a covenant [[H1285]] of salt? [[H4417]]

### 6
Yet Jeroboam [[H3379]] the son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] the servant [[H5650]] of Solomon [[H8010]] the son [[H1121]] of David, [[H1732]] is risen up, [[H6965]] and hath rebelled [[H4775]] against [[H5921]] his lord. [[H113]]

### 7
And there are gathered [[H6908]] unto [[H5921]] him vain [[H7386]] men, [[H582]] the children [[H1121]] of Belial, [[H1100]] and have strengthened themselves [[H553]] against [[H5921]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] the son [[H1121]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] when Rehoboam [[H7346]] was [[H1961]] young [[H5288]] and tenderhearted, [[H7390]] and could not [[H3808]] withstand [[H2388]] them. [[H6440]]

### 8
And now [[H6258]] ye [[H859]] think [[H559]] to withstand [[H2388]] the kingdom [[H6440]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the sons [[H1121]] of David; [[H1732]] and ye [[H859]] a great [[H7227]] multitude, [[H1995]] and with [[H5973]] you golden [[H2091]] calves, [[H5695]] which [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] made [[H6213]] you for gods. [[H430]]

### 9
Have ye not [[H3808]] cast out [[H5080]] the priests [[H3548]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] and have made [[H6213]] you priests [[H3548]] after the manner of the nations [[H5971]] of lands? [[H776]] so that whosoever [[H3605]] cometh [[H935]] to consecrate [[H4390]] himself with a young [[H1121]] bullock [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams, [[H352]] may be [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] of no [[H3808]] gods. [[H430]]

### 10
But as for us, [[H587]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and we have not [[H3808]] forsaken [[H5800]] him; and the priests, [[H3548]] which minister [[H8334]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] and the Levites [[H3881]] upon business: [[H4399]]

### 11
And they burn [[H6999]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] every morning [[H1242]] and every evening [[H6153]] burnt sacrifices [[H5930]] and sweet [[H5561]] incense: [[H7004]] the shewbread [[H3899]] also upon [[H5921]] the pure [[H2889]] table; [[H7979]] and the candlestick [[H4501]] of gold [[H2091]] with the lamps [[H5216]] thereof, to burn [[H1197]] every evening: [[H6153]] for [[H3588]] we [[H587]] keep [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] but ye [[H859]] have forsaken [[H5800]] him. [[H5800]]

### 12
And, behold, [[H2009]] God [[H430]] himself with [[H5973]] us for captain, [[H7218]] and his priests [[H3548]] with sounding [[H8643]] trumpets [[H2689]] to cry alarm [[H7321]] against [[H5921]] you. O children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] fight [[H3898]] ye not [[H408]] against [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers; [[H1]] for [[H3588]] ye shall not [[H3808]] prosper. [[H6743]]

### 13
But Jeroboam [[H3379]]  caused [[H853]] an ambushment [[H3993]] to come [[H935]] about [[H5437]] behind [[H310]] them: so they were [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] Judah, [[H3063]] and the ambushment [[H3993]] behind [[H310]] them. [[H310]]

### 14
And when Judah [[H3063]] looked back, [[H6437]] behold, [[H2009]] the battle [[H4421]] before [[H6440]] and behind: [[H268]] and they cried [[H6817]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and the priests [[H3548]] sounded [[H2690]] with the trumpets. [[H2689]]

### 15
Then the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] gave a shout: [[H7321]] and as the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] shouted, [[H7321]] it came to pass, [[H1961]] that God [[H430]] smote [[H5062]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] before [[H6440]] Abijah [[H29]] and Judah. [[H3063]]

### 16
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Judah: [[H3063]] and God [[H430]] delivered [[H5414]] them into their hand. [[H3027]]

### 17
And Abijah [[H29]] and his people [[H5971]] slew [[H5221]] them with a great [[H7227]] slaughter: [[H4347]] so there fell down [[H5307]] slain [[H2491]] of Israel [[H3478]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] chosen [[H977]] men. [[H376]]

### 18
Thus the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were brought under [[H3665]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] and the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] prevailed, [[H553]] because [[H3588]] they relied [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 19
And Abijah [[H29]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Jeroboam, [[H3379]] and took [[H3920]] cities [[H5892]] from [[H4480]]  him, [[H853]] Beth-el [[H1008]] with [[H853]] the towns [[H1323]] thereof, and Jeshanah [[H3466]] with [[H853]] the towns [[H1323]] thereof, and Ephrain [[H6085]] with the towns [[H1323]] thereof. [[H1323]]

### 20
Neither [[H3808]] did Jeroboam [[H3379]] recover [[H6113]] strength [[H3581]] again [[H5750]] in the days [[H3117]] of Abijah: [[H29]] and the Lord [[H3068]] struck [[H5062]] him, and he died. [[H4191]]

### 21
But Abijah [[H29]] waxed mighty, [[H2388]] and married [[H5375]] fourteen [[H702]] wives, [[H802]] and begat [[H3205]] twenty [[H6242]] and two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] and sixteen [[H8337]] daughters. [[H1323]]

### 22
And the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Abijah, [[H29]] and his ways, [[H1870]] and his sayings, [[H1697]] written [[H3789]] in the story [[H4097]] of the prophet [[H5030]] Iddo. [[H5714]]
