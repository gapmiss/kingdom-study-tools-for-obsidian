And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead, [[H8478]] and strengthened himself [[H2388]] against [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

And he placed [[H5414]] forces [[H2428]] in all [[H3605]] the fenced [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and set [[H5414]] garrisons [[H5333]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] which [[H834]] Asa [[H609]] his father [[H1]] had taken.

And the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] because [[H3588]] he walked [[H1980]] in the first [[H7223]] ways [[H1870]] of his father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and sought [[H1875]] not [[H3808]] unto Baalim; [[H1168]]

And they taught [[H3925]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] them, and went about [[H5437]] throughout all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and taught [[H3925]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 10
