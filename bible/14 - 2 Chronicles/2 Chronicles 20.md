### 1
It came to pass [[H1961]] after this [[H310]] also, the children [[H1121]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and with [[H5973]] them beside the Ammonites, [[H5984]] came [[H935]] against [[H5921]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] to battle. [[H4421]]

### 2
Then there came [[H935]] some that told [[H5046]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] saying, [[H559]] There cometh [[H935]] a great [[H7227]] multitude [[H1995]] against [[H5921]] thee from beyond [[H5676]] the sea [[H3220]] on this side Syria; [[H758]] and, behold, [[H2009]] they in Hazazon-tamar, [[H2688]] which [[H1931]] En-gedi. [[H5872]]

### 3
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] feared, [[H3372]] and set [[H5414]] himself [[H6440]] to seek [[H1875]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast [[H6685]] throughout [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 4
And Judah [[H3063]] gathered themselves together, [[H6908]] to ask [[H1245]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] even [[H1571]] out of all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] they came [[H935]] to seek [[H1245]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] stood [[H5975]] in the congregation [[H6951]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] the new [[H2319]] court, [[H2691]]

### 6
And said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of our fathers, [[H1]] not [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] God [[H430]] in heaven? [[H8064]] and rulest [[H4910]] thou [[H859]] over all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the heathen? [[H1471]] and in thine hand [[H3027]] power [[H3581]] and might, [[H1369]] so that none [[H369]] is able to withstand [[H3320]] thee? [[H5973]]

### 7
not [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] our God, [[H430]] didst drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] before [[H6440]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and gavest [[H5414]] it to the seed [[H2233]] of Abraham [[H85]] thy friend [[H157]] for ever? [[H5769]]

### 8
And they dwelt [[H3427]] therein, and have built [[H1129]] thee a sanctuary [[H4720]] therein for thy name, [[H8034]] saying, [[H559]]

### 9
If, [[H518]] evil [[H7451]] cometh [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] us, the sword, [[H2719]] judgment, [[H8196]] or pestilence, [[H1698]] or famine, [[H7458]] we stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] and in thy presence, [[H6440]] (for [[H3588]] thy name [[H8034]] in this [[H2088]] house,) [[H1004]] and cry [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] thee in our affliction, [[H6869]] then thou wilt hear [[H8085]] and help. [[H3467]]

### 10
And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] and Moab [[H4124]] and mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] whom [[H834]] thou wouldest not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] invade, [[H935]] when they came out [[H935]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] but [[H3588]] they turned [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] them, and destroyed [[H8045]] them not; [[H3808]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2009]] they [[H1992]] reward [[H1580]] us, to come [[H935]] to cast us out [[H1644]] of thy possession, [[H3425]] which [[H834]] thou hast given us to inherit. [[H3423]]

### 12
O our God, [[H430]] wilt thou not [[H3808]] judge [[H8199]] them? for [[H3588]] we have no [[H369]] might [[H3581]] against [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] great [[H7227]] company [[H1995]] that cometh [[H935]] against [[H5921]] us; neither [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] we [[H587]] what [[H4100]] to do: [[H6213]] but [[H3588]] our eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 13
And all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] with [[H1571]] their little ones, [[H2945]] their wives, [[H802]] and their children. [[H1121]]

### 14
Then upon [[H5921]] Jahaziel [[H3166]] the son [[H1121]] of Zechariah, [[H2148]] the son [[H1121]] of Benaiah, [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeiel, [[H3273]] the son [[H1121]] of Mattaniah, [[H4983]] a Levite [[H3881]] of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Asaph, [[H623]] came [[H1961]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the congregation; [[H6951]]

### 15
And he said, [[H559]] Hearken [[H7181]] ye, all [[H3605]] Judah, [[H3063]] and ye inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and thou king [[H4428]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto you, Be not afraid [[H3372]] nor [[H408]] dismayed [[H2865]] by reason [[H6440]] of this [[H2088]] great [[H7227]] multitude; [[H1995]] for [[H3588]] the battle [[H4421]] not [[H3808]] yours, but [[H3588]] God's. [[H430]]

### 16
To morrow [[H4279]] go ye down [[H3381]] against [[H5921]] them: behold, [[H2005]] they come up [[H5927]] by the cliff [[H4608]] of Ziz; [[H6732]] and ye shall find [[H4672]] them at the end [[H5490]] of the brook, [[H5158]] before [[H6440]] the wilderness [[H4057]] of Jeruel. [[H3385]]

### 17
Ye shall not [[H3808]] to fight [[H3898]] in this [[H2063]] set yourselves, [[H3320]] stand [[H5975]] ye and see [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3444]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] you, O Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem: [[H3389]] fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] nor [[H408]] be dismayed; [[H2865]] to morrow [[H4279]] go out [[H3318]] against [[H6440]] them: for the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] you. [[H5973]]

### 18
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] bowed [[H6915]] his head with face [[H639]] to the ground: [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] fell [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] worshipping [[H7812]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 19
And the Levites, [[H3881]] of the children [[H1121]] of [[H4480]] the Kohathites, [[H6956]] and of [[H4480]] the children [[H1121]] of the Korhites, [[H7145]] stood up [[H6965]] to praise [[H1984]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] on high. [[H4605]]

### 20
And they rose early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and went forth [[H3318]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] of Tekoa: [[H8620]] and as they went forth, [[H3318]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] stood [[H5975]] and said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] me, O Judah, [[H3063]] and ye inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]] Believe [[H539]] in the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] so shall ye be established; [[H539]] believe [[H539]] his prophets, [[H5030]] so shall ye prosper. [[H6743]]

### 21
And when he had consulted [[H3289]] with [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] he appointed [[H5975]] singers [[H7891]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and that should praise [[H1984]] the beauty [[H1927]] of holiness, [[H6944]] as they went out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] the army, [[H2502]] and to say, [[H559]] Praise [[H3034]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] his mercy [[H2617]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 22
And when [[H6256]] they began [[H2490]] to sing [[H7440]] and to praise, [[H8416]] the Lord [[H3068]] set [[H5414]] ambushments [[H693]] against [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] Moab, [[H4124]] and mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] which were come [[H935]] against Judah; [[H3063]] and they were smitten. [[H5062]]

### 23
For the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] and Moab [[H4124]] stood up [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] utterly to slay [[H2763]] and destroy [[H8045]] and when they had made an end [[H3615]] of the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Seir, [[H8165]] every one [[H376]] helped [[H5826]] to destroy [[H4889]] another. [[H7453]]

### 24
And when Judah [[H3063]] came [[H935]] toward [[H5921]] the watch tower [[H4707]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] they looked [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] the multitude, [[H1995]] and, behold, [[H2005]] they dead bodies [[H6297]] fallen [[H5307]] to the earth, [[H776]] and none [[H369]] escaped. [[H6413]]

### 25
And when Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] and his people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to take away [[H962]] the spoil [[H7998]] of them, they found [[H4672]] among them in abundance [[H7230]] both riches [[H7399]] with the dead bodies, [[H6297]] and precious [[H2530]] jewels, [[H3627]] which they stripped off [[H5337]] for themselves, more than [[H369]] they could carry away: [[H4853]] and they were [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] in gathering [[H962]] of the spoil, [[H7998]] it [[H1931]] was so much. [[H7227]]

### 26
And on the fourth [[H7243]] day [[H3117]] they assembled themselves [[H6950]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Berachah; [[H1294]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] they blessed [[H1288]] the Lord: [[H3068]] therefore [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of the same [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] was called, [[H7121]] The valley [[H6010]] of Berachah, [[H1294]] unto [[H5704]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 27
Then they returned, [[H7725]] every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] in the forefront [[H7218]] of them, to go again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with joy; [[H8057]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had made them to rejoice [[H8055]] over their enemies. [[H341]]

### 28
And they came [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] with psalteries [[H5035]] and harps [[H3658]] and trumpets [[H2689]] unto [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 29
And the fear [[H6343]] of God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of countries, [[H776]] when they had heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] the enemies [[H341]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 30
So the realm [[H4438]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] was quiet: [[H8252]] for his God [[H430]] gave him rest [[H5117]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 31
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah: [[H3063]] thirty [[H7970]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Azubah [[H5806]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Shilhi. [[H7977]]

### 32
And he walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of Asa [[H609]] his father, [[H1]] and departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from [[H4480]] it, doing [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 33
Howbeit [[H389]] the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] taken away: [[H5493]] for as yet [[H5750]] the people [[H5971]] had not [[H3808]] prepared [[H3559]] their hearts [[H3824]] unto the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 34
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] first [[H7223]] and last, [[H314]] behold, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] in the book [[H1697]] of Jehu [[H3058]] the son [[H1121]] of Hanani, [[H2607]] who [[H834]] mentioned [[H5927]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 35
And after [[H310]] this [[H3651]] did Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] join himself [[H2266]] with [[H5973]] Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H1931]] did [[H6213]] very wickedly: [[H7561]]

### 36
And he joined [[H2266]] himself with [[H5973]] him to make [[H6213]] ships [[H591]] to go [[H1980]] to Tarshish: [[H8659]] and they made [[H6213]] the ships [[H591]] in Ezion-geber. [[H6100]]

### 37
Then Eliezer [[H461]] the son [[H1121]] of Dodavah [[H1735]] of Mareshah [[H4762]] prophesied [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] saying, [[H559]] Because thou hast joined thyself [[H2266]] with [[H5973]] Ahaziah, [[H274]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath broken [[H6555]] thy works. [[H4639]] And the ships [[H591]] were broken, [[H7665]] that they were not able [[H6113]] to go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Tarshish. [[H8659]]
