### 1
Josiah [[H2977]] eight [[H8083]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] one [[H259]] and thirty [[H7970]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And he did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of David [[H1732]] his father, [[H1]] and declined [[H5493]] to the right hand, [[H3225]] nor to the left. [[H8040]]

### 3
For in the eighth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] while he [[H1931]] was yet [[H5750]] young, [[H5288]] he began [[H2490]] to seek [[H1875]] after the God [[H430]] of David [[H1732]] his father: [[H1]] and in the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] he began [[H2490]] to purge [[H2891]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] from [[H4480]] the high places, [[H1116]] and the groves, [[H842]] and the carved images, [[H6456]] and the molten images. [[H4541]]

### 4
And they brake down [[H5422]] the altars [[H4196]] of Baalim [[H1168]] in his presence; [[H6440]] and the images, [[H2553]] that [[H834]] on high [[H4605]] above [[H5921]] them, he cut down; [[H1438]] and the groves, [[H842]] and the carved images, [[H6456]] and the molten images, [[H4541]] he brake in pieces, [[H7665]] and made dust [[H1854]] and strowed [[H2236]] upon [[H6440]] the graves [[H6913]] of them that had sacrificed [[H2076]] unto them. [[H2076]]

### 5
And he burnt [[H8313]] the bones [[H6106]] of the priests [[H3548]] upon [[H5921]] their altars, [[H4196]] and cleansed [[H2891]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 6
And in the cities [[H5892]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] and Ephraim, [[H669]] and Simeon, [[H8095]] even unto [[H5704]] Naphtali, [[H5321]] with their mattocks [[H2719]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 7
And when he had broken down [[H5422]] the altars [[H4196]] and the groves, [[H842]] and had beaten [[H3807]] the graven images [[H6456]] into powder, [[H1854]] and cut down [[H1438]] all [[H3605]] the idols [[H2553]] throughout all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] he returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 8
Now in the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] when he had purged [[H2891]] the land, [[H776]] and the house, [[H1004]] he sent [[H7971]] Shaphan [[H8227]] the son [[H1121]] of Azaliah, [[H683]] and Maaseiah [[H4641]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city, [[H5892]] and Joah [[H3098]] the son [[H1121]] of Joahaz [[H3099]] the recorder, [[H2142]] to repair [[H2388]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his God. [[H430]]

### 9
And when they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] they delivered [[H5414]] the money [[H3701]] that was brought into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] the Levites [[H3881]] that kept [[H8104]] the doors [[H5592]] had gathered [[H622]] of the hand [[H3027]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] and Ephraim, [[H669]] and of all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and of all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin; [[H1144]] and they returned [[H3427]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
And they put [[H5414]] in [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of the workmen [[H6213]] that had the oversight [[H6485]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and they gave [[H5414]] it to the workmen [[H6213]] that [[H834]] wrought [[H6213]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to repair [[H918]] and amend [[H2388]] the house: [[H1004]]

### 11
Even to the artificers [[H2796]] and builders [[H1129]] gave [[H5414]] they to buy [[H7069]] hewn [[H4274]] stone, [[H68]] and timber [[H6086]] for couplings, [[H4226]] and to floor [[H7136]] the houses [[H1004]] which [[H834]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had destroyed. [[H7843]]

### 12
And the men [[H582]] did [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] faithfully: [[H530]] and the overseers [[H5329]] of [[H5921]] them Jahath [[H3189]] and Obadiah, [[H5662]] the Levites, [[H3881]] of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Merari; [[H4847]] and Zechariah [[H2148]] and Meshullam, [[H4918]] of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of the Kohathites, [[H6956]] to set forward; [[H6485]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] all [[H3605]] that could skill [[H995]] of instruments [[H3627]] of musick. [[H7892]]

### 13
Also over [[H5921]] the bearers of burdens, [[H5449]] and overseers [[H5329]] of all [[H3605]] that wrought [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] in any manner of service: [[H5656]] and of the Levites [[H3881]] scribes, [[H5608]] and officers, [[H7860]] and porters. [[H7778]]

### 14
And when they brought out [[H3318]] the money [[H3701]] that was brought into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest [[H3548]] found [[H4672]] a book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 15
And Hilkiah [[H2518]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] I have found [[H4672]] the book [[H5612]] of the law [[H8451]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] And Hilkiah [[H2518]] delivered [[H5414]] the book [[H5612]] to [[H413]] Shaphan. [[H8227]]

### 16
And Shaphan [[H8227]] carried [[H935]] the book [[H5612]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and brought [[H7725]] the king [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] back again, [[H5750]] saying, [[H559]] All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was committed [[H5414]] to [[H3027]] thy servants, [[H5650]] they [[H1992]] do [[H6213]]

### 17
And they have gathered together [[H5413]] the money [[H3701]] that was found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and have delivered [[H5414]] it into [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of the overseers, [[H6485]] and to [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of the workmen. [[H6213]]

### 18
Then Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe [[H5608]] told [[H5046]] the king, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] the priest [[H3548]] hath given [[H5414]] me a book. [[H5612]] And Shaphan [[H8227]] read [[H7121]] it before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 19
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the king [[H4428]] had heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the law, [[H8451]] that he rent [[H7167]] his clothes. [[H899]]

### 20
And the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Hilkiah, [[H2518]] and Ahikam [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] and Abdon [[H5658]] the son [[H1121]] of Micah, [[H4318]] and Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Asaiah [[H6222]] a servant [[H5650]] of the king's, [[H4428]] saying, [[H559]]

### 21
Go, [[H1980]] inquire of [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] for [[H1157]] me, and for [[H1157]] them that are left [[H7604]] in Israel [[H3478]] and in Judah, [[H3063]] concerning [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of the book [[H5612]] that [[H834]] is found: [[H4672]] for [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] the wrath [[H2534]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] is poured out [[H5413]] upon us, because [[H5921]] our fathers [[H1]] have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to do [[H6213]] after all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] book. [[H5612]]

### 22
And Hilkiah, [[H2518]] and that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Huldah [[H2468]] the prophetess, [[H5031]] the wife [[H802]] of Shallum [[H7967]] the son [[H1121]] of Tikvath, [[H8616]] the son [[H1121]] of Hasrah, [[H2641]] keeper [[H8104]] of the wardrobe; [[H899]] (now she [[H1931]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the college:) [[H4932]] and they spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] her to that [[H2063]]

### 23
And she answered [[H559]] them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Tell [[H559]] ye the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] sent [[H7971]] you to [[H413]] me, [[H413]]

### 24
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and upon [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]]  thereof, [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the curses [[H423]] that are written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] which [[H834]] they have read [[H7121]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]]

### 25
Because [[H8478]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and have burned incense [[H6999]] unto other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] that [[H4616]] they might provoke me to anger [[H3707]] with all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] of their hands; [[H3027]] therefore my wrath [[H2534]] shall be poured out [[H5413]] upon this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and shall not [[H3808]] be quenched. [[H3518]]

### 26
And as for [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] who sent [[H7971]] you to inquire [[H1875]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] so [[H3541]] shall ye say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thou hast heard; [[H8085]]

### 27
Because [[H3282]] thine heart [[H3824]] was tender, [[H7401]] and thou didst humble thyself [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] God, [[H430]] when thou heardest [[H8085]] his words [[H1697]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and against [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof, and humbledst thyself [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] me, and didst rend [[H7167]] thy clothes, [[H899]] and weep [[H1058]] before [[H6440]] me; I [[H589]] have even heard [[H8085]] also, [[H1571]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 28
Behold, [[H2005]] I will gather [[H622]] thee to [[H413]] thy fathers, [[H1]] and thou shalt be gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] thy grave [[H6913]] in peace, [[H7965]] neither [[H3808]] shall thine eyes [[H5869]] see [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] will bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and upon [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the same. So they brought [[H7725]] the king [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] again. [[H1697]]

### 29
Then the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] and gathered together [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 30
And the king [[H4428]] went up [[H5927]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the priests, [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] great [[H1419]] and small: [[H6996]] and he read [[H7121]] in their ears [[H241]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the book [[H5612]] of the covenant [[H1285]] that was found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 31
And the king [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] his place, [[H5977]] and made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and to keep [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H4687]] and his testimonies, [[H5715]] and his statutes, [[H2706]] with all [[H3605]] his heart, [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] his soul, [[H5315]] to perform [[H6213]] the words [[H1697]] of the covenant [[H1285]] which are written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] book. [[H5612]]

### 32
And he caused [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that were present [[H4672]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] to stand [[H5975]] And the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] did [[H6213]] according to the covenant [[H1285]] of God, [[H430]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 33
And Josiah [[H2977]] took away [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] out of all [[H3605]] the countries [[H776]] that [[H834]] to the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]]  and made [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that were present [[H4672]] in Israel [[H3478]] to serve, [[H5647]] to serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] all [[H3605]] his days [[H3117]] they departed [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] from following [[H310]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]
