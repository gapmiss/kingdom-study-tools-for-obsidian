### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Rehoboam [[H7346]] had established [[H3559]] the kingdom, [[H4438]] and had strengthened [[H2393]] himself, he forsook [[H5800]] the law [[H8451]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 2
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] in the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] Shishak [[H7895]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] came up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] because [[H3588]] they had transgressed [[H4603]] against the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 3
With twelve hundred [[H3967]] chariots, [[H7393]] and threescore [[H8346]] thousand [[H505]] horsemen: [[H6571]] and the people [[H5971]] without [[H369]] number [[H4557]] that [[H834]] came [[H935]] with [[H5973]] him out of Egypt; [[H4714]] the Lubims, [[H3864]] the Sukkiims, [[H5525]] and the Ethiopians. [[H3569]]

### 4
And he took [[H3920]] the fenced [[H4694]] cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] to Judah, [[H3063]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 5
Then came [[H935]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the prophet [[H5030]] to [[H413]] Rehoboam, [[H7346]] and the princes [[H8269]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that [[H834]] were gathered together [[H622]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] because [[H6440]] of Shishak, [[H7895]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Ye [[H859]] have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and therefore have I [[H589]] also [[H637]] left [[H5800]] you in the hand [[H3027]] of Shishak. [[H7895]]

### 6
Whereupon the princes [[H8269]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the king [[H4428]] humbled themselves; [[H3665]] and they said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] righteous. [[H6662]]

### 7
And when the Lord [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they humbled themselves, [[H3665]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] saying, [[H559]] They have humbled themselves; [[H3665]] I will not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] them, but I will grant [[H5414]] them some [[H4592]] deliverance; [[H6413]] and my wrath [[H2534]] shall not [[H3808]] be poured out [[H5413]] upon Jerusalem [[H3389]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Shishak. [[H7895]]

### 8
Nevertheless [[H3588]] they shall be [[H1961]] his servants; [[H5650]] that they may know [[H3045]] my service, [[H5656]] and the service [[H5656]] of the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the countries. [[H776]]

### 9
So Shishak [[H7895]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] came up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and took away [[H3947]] the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the treasures [[H214]] of the king's [[H4428]] house; [[H1004]] he took [[H3947]] all: [[H3605]] he carried away [[H3947]] also the shields [[H4043]] of gold [[H2091]] which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made. [[H6213]]

### 10
Instead of [[H8478]] which king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] made [[H6213]] shields [[H4043]] of brass, [[H5178]] and committed [[H6485]] to [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of the chief [[H8269]] of the guard, [[H7323]] that kept [[H8104]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the king's [[H4428]] house. [[H1004]]

### 11
And when [[H1767]] the king [[H4428]] entered [[H935]] into [[H1961]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the guard [[H7323]] came [[H935]] and fetched [[H5375]] them, and brought them again [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the guard [[H7323]] chamber. [[H8372]]

### 12
And when he humbled himself, [[H3665]] the wrath [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] turned [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] him, that he would not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] altogether: [[H3617]] and also [[H1571]] in Judah [[H3063]] things [[H1697]] went [[H1961]] well. [[H2896]]

### 13
So king [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] strengthened himself [[H2388]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and reigned: [[H4427]] for [[H3588]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] one [[H259]] and forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] seventeen [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had chosen [[H977]] out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to put [[H7760]] his name [[H8034]] there. [[H8033]] And his mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] Naamah [[H5279]] an Ammonitess. [[H5985]]

### 14
And he did [[H6213]] evil, [[H7451]] because [[H3588]] he prepared [[H3559]] not [[H3808]] his heart [[H3820]] to seek [[H1875]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 15
Now the acts [[H1697]] of Rehoboam, [[H7346]] first [[H7223]] and last, [[H314]] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in the book [[H1697]] of Shemaiah [[H8098]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and of Iddo [[H5714]] the seer [[H2374]] concerning genealogies? [[H3187]] And wars [[H4421]] between Rehoboam [[H7346]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] continually. [[H3117]]

### 16
And Rehoboam [[H7346]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the city [[H5892]] of David: [[H1732]] and Abijah [[H29]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
