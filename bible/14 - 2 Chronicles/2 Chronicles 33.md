### 1
Manasseh [[H4519]] twelve [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] fifty [[H2572]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]]

### 2
But did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] like unto the abominations [[H8441]] of the heathen, [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had cast out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
For he built [[H1129]] again [[H7725]] the high places [[H1116]] which [[H834]] Hezekiah [[H3169]] his father [[H1]] had broken down, [[H5422]] and he reared up [[H6965]] altars [[H4196]] for Baalim, [[H1168]] and made [[H6213]] groves, [[H842]] and worshipped [[H7812]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven, [[H8064]] and served [[H5647]] them. [[H5647]]

### 4
Also he built [[H1129]] altars [[H4196]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] whereof [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said, [[H559]] In Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall my name [[H8034]] be [[H1961]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 5
And he built [[H1129]] altars [[H4196]] for all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] in the two [[H8147]] courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And he [[H1931]]  caused [[H853]] his children [[H1121]] to pass [[H5674]] through the fire [[H784]] in the valley [[H1516]] of the son [[H1121]] of Hinnom: [[H2011]] also he observed times, [[H6049]] and used enchantments, [[H5172]] and used witchcraft, [[H3784]] and dealt with [[H6213]] a familiar spirit, [[H178]] and with wizards: [[H3049]] he wrought [[H6213]] much [[H7235]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to provoke him to anger. [[H3707]]

### 7
And he set [[H7760]] a carved image, [[H6459]] the idol [[H5566]] which [[H834]] he had made, [[H6213]] in the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] of which [[H834]] God [[H430]] had said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] and to [[H413]] Solomon [[H8010]] his son, [[H1121]] In this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] I have chosen [[H977]] before all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] will I put [[H7760]] my name [[H8034]] for ever: [[H5865]]

### 8
Neither [[H3808]] will I any more [[H3254]] remove [[H5493]] the foot [[H7272]] of Israel [[H3478]] from out [[H5921]] of the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] I have appointed [[H5975]] for your fathers; [[H1]] so that [[H518]] they will take heed [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] them, according to the whole [[H3605]] law [[H8451]] and the statutes [[H2706]] and the ordinances [[H4941]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]

### 9
So Manasseh [[H4519]]  made [[H853]] Judah [[H3063]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] to err, [[H8582]] to do [[H6213]] worse [[H7451]] than [[H4480]] the heathen, [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had destroyed [[H8045]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] and to [[H413]] his people: [[H5971]] but they would not [[H3808]] hearken. [[H7181]]

### 11
Wherefore the Lord [[H3068]] brought [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] them the captains of [[H8269]] the host of [[H6635]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] which [[H834]] took [[H3920]] Manasseh [[H4519]] among the thorns, [[H2336]] and bound him [[H631]] with fetters, [[H5178]] and carried [[H1980]] him to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 12
And when he was in affliction, [[H6887]] he besought [[H2470]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] and humbled himself [[H3665]] greatly [[H3966]] before [[H6440]] the God [[H430]] of his fathers, [[H1]]

### 13
And prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] him: and he was intreated [[H6279]] of him, and heard [[H8085]] his supplication, [[H8467]] and brought him again [[H7725]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] into his kingdom. [[H4438]] Then Manasseh [[H4519]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] God. [[H430]]

### 14
Now after this [[H310]] he built [[H1129]] a wall [[H2346]] without [[H2435]] the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] on the west side [[H4628]] of Gihon, [[H1521]] in the valley, [[H5158]] even to the entering in [[H935]] at the fish [[H1709]] gate, [[H8179]] and compassed about [[H5437]] Ophel, [[H6077]] and raised it up [[H1361]] a very great height, [[H3966]] and put [[H7760]] captains [[H8269]] of war [[H2428]] in all [[H3605]] the fenced [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 15
And he took away [[H5493]] the strange [[H5236]] gods, [[H430]] and the idol [[H5566]] out of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the altars [[H4196]] that [[H834]] he had built [[H1129]] in the mount [[H2022]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and cast [[H7993]] out of [[H2351]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 16
And he repaired [[H1129]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] thereon [[H5921]] peace [[H8002]] offerings [[H2077]] and thank offerings, [[H8426]] and commanded [[H559]] Judah [[H3063]] to serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
Nevertheless [[H61]] the people [[H5971]] did sacrifice [[H2076]] still [[H5750]] in the high places, [[H1116]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] only. [[H7535]]

### 18
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts of [[H1697]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] and his prayer [[H8605]] unto [[H413]] his God, [[H430]] and the words [[H1697]] of the seers [[H2374]] that spake [[H1696]] to [[H413]] him in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] behold, [[H2005]] they in [[H5921]] the book [[H1697]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 19
His prayer [[H8605]] also, and was intreated [[H6279]] of him, and all [[H3605]] his sin, [[H2403]] and his trespass, [[H4604]] and the places [[H4725]] wherein [[H834]] he built [[H1129]] high places, [[H1116]] and set up [[H5975]] groves [[H842]] and graven images, [[H6456]] before [[H6440]] he was humbled: [[H3665]] behold, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] among [[H5921]] the sayings [[H1697]] of the seers. [[H2374]]

### 20
So Manasseh [[H4519]] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and they buried [[H6912]] him in his own house: [[H1004]] and Amon [[H526]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 21
Amon [[H526]] two [[H8147]] and twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and reigned [[H4427]] two [[H8147]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 22
But he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] did [[H6213]] Manasseh [[H4519]] his father: [[H1]] for Amon [[H526]] sacrificed [[H2076]] unto all [[H3605]] the carved images [[H6456]] which [[H834]] Manasseh [[H4519]] his father [[H1]] had made, [[H6213]] and served [[H5647]] them; [[H5647]]

### 23
And humbled [[H3665]] not himself [[H3808]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as Manasseh [[H4519]] his father [[H1]] had humbled himself; [[H3665]] but [[H3588]] Amon [[H526]] trespassed [[H819]] more and more. [[H7235]]

### 24
And his servants [[H5650]] conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] him, and slew [[H4191]] him in his own house. [[H1004]]

### 25
But the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] slew [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] them that had conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] king [[H4428]] Amon; [[H526]] and the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] made Josiah [[H2977]] his son [[H1121]] king [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]
