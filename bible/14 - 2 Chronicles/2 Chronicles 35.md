### 1
Moreover Josiah [[H2977]] kept [[H6213]] a passover [[H6453]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and they killed [[H7819]] the passover [[H6453]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] of the first [[H7223]] month. [[H2320]]

### 2
And he set [[H5975]] the priests [[H3548]] in [[H5921]] their charges, [[H4931]] and encouraged [[H2388]] them to the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 3
And said [[H559]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] that taught [[H995]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] which were holy [[H6918]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] Put [[H5414]] the holy [[H6944]] ark [[H727]] in the house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] the son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] did build; [[H1129]] not [[H369]] a burden [[H4853]] upon shoulders: [[H3802]] serve [[H5647]] now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and his people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]]

### 4
And prepare [[H3559]] by the houses [[H1004]] of your fathers, [[H1]] after your courses, [[H4256]] according to the writing [[H3791]] of David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and according to the writing [[H4385]] of Solomon [[H8010]] his son. [[H1121]]

### 5
And stand in [[H5975]] the holy [[H6944]] according to the divisions [[H6391]] of the families [[H1004]] of the fathers [[H1]] of your brethren [[H251]] the people, [[H1121]] and the division [[H2515]] of the families [[H1]] of the Levites. [[H3881]]

### 6
So kill [[H7819]] the passover, [[H6453]] and sanctify yourselves, [[H6942]] and prepare [[H3559]] your brethren, [[H251]] that may do [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]

### 7
And Josiah [[H2977]] gave [[H7311]] to the people, [[H1121]] of the flock, [[H6629]] lambs [[H3532]] and kids, [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] for the passover offerings, [[H6453]] for all [[H3605]] that were present, [[H4672]] to the number [[H4557]] of thirty [[H7970]] thousand, [[H505]] and three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] bullocks: [[H1241]] these [[H428]] of the king's [[H4428]] substance. [[H7399]]

### 8
And his princes [[H8269]] gave [[H7311]] willingly [[H5071]] unto the people, [[H5971]] to the priests, [[H3548]] and to the Levites: [[H3881]] Hilkiah [[H2518]] and Zechariah [[H2148]] and Jehiel, [[H3171]] rulers [[H5057]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] unto the priests [[H3548]] for the passover offerings [[H6453]] two thousand [[H505]] and six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] and three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] oxen. [[H1241]]

### 9
Conaniah [[H3562]] also, and Shemaiah [[H8098]] and Nethaneel, [[H5417]] his brethren, [[H251]] and Hashabiah [[H2811]] and Jeiel [[H3273]] and Jozabad, [[H3107]] chief [[H8269]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] gave [[H7311]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] for passover offerings [[H6453]] five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] and five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] oxen. [[H1241]]

### 10
So the service [[H5656]] was prepared, [[H3559]] and the priests [[H3548]] stood [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] their place, [[H5977]] and the Levites [[H3881]] in [[H5921]] their courses, [[H4256]] according to the king's [[H4428]] commandment. [[H4687]]

### 11
And they killed [[H7819]] the passover, [[H6453]] and the priests [[H3548]] sprinkled [[H2236]] from their hands, [[H3027]] and the Levites [[H3881]] flayed [[H6584]]

### 12
And they removed [[H5493]] the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] that they might give [[H5414]] according to the divisions [[H4653]] of the families [[H1]] of the people, [[H1121]] to offer [[H7126]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] as written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of Moses. [[H4872]] And so [[H3651]] with the oxen. [[H1241]]

### 13
And they roasted [[H1310]] the passover [[H6453]] with fire [[H784]] according to the ordinance: [[H4941]] but the holy [[H6944]] sod [[H1310]] they in pots, [[H5518]] and in caldrons, [[H1731]] and in pans, [[H6745]] and divided speedily [[H7323]] among all [[H3605]] the people. [[H1121]]

### 14
And afterward [[H310]] they made ready [[H3559]] for themselves, and for the priests: [[H3548]] because [[H3588]] the priests [[H3548]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] in offering [[H5927]] of burnt offerings [[H5930]] and the fat [[H2459]] until [[H5704]] night; [[H3915]] therefore the Levites [[H3881]] prepared [[H3559]] for themselves, and for the priests [[H3548]] the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron. [[H175]]

### 15
And the singers [[H7891]] the sons [[H1121]] of Asaph [[H623]] in [[H5921]] their place, [[H4612]] according to the commandment [[H4687]] of David, [[H1732]] and Asaph, [[H623]] and Heman, [[H1968]] and Jeduthun [[H3038]] the king's [[H4428]] seer; [[H2374]] and the porters [[H7778]] at every gate; [[H8179]] they might not [[H369]] depart [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] their service; [[H5656]] for [[H3588]] their brethren [[H251]] the Levites [[H3881]] prepared [[H3559]] for them. [[H3559]]

### 16
So all [[H3605]] the service [[H5656]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was prepared [[H3559]] the same [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] to keep [[H6213]] the passover, [[H6453]] and to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] according to the commandment [[H4687]] of king [[H4428]] Josiah. [[H2977]]

### 17
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] that were present [[H4672]] kept [[H6213]] the passover [[H6453]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] and the feast [[H2282]] of unleavened bread [[H4682]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]

### 18
And there was no [[H3808]] passover [[H6453]] like to [[H3644]] that kept [[H6213]] in Israel [[H3478]] from the days [[H3117]] of Samuel [[H8050]] the prophet; [[H5030]] neither [[H3808]] did all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] keep [[H6213]] such a passover [[H6453]] as [[H834]] Josiah [[H2977]] kept, [[H6213]] and the priests, [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Israel [[H3478]] that were present, [[H4672]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 19
In the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Josiah [[H2977]] was this [[H2088]] passover [[H6453]] kept. [[H6213]]

### 20
After [[H310]] all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] when [[H834]] Josiah [[H2977]] had prepared [[H3559]] the temple, [[H1004]] Necho [[H5224]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] came up [[H5927]] to fight [[H3898]] against Carchemish [[H3751]] by [[H5921]] Euphrates: [[H6578]] and Josiah [[H2977]] went out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] him. [[H7125]]

### 21
But he sent [[H7971]] ambassadors [[H4397]] to [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have I to do with thee, thou king [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]] not [[H3808]] against [[H5921]] thee [[H859]] this day, [[H3117]] but [[H3588]] against [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] wherewith I have war: [[H4421]] for God [[H430]] commanded [[H559]] me to make haste: [[H926]] forbear [[H2308]] thee from God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] with [[H5973]] me, that he destroy [[H7843]] thee not. [[H408]]

### 22
Nevertheless Josiah [[H2977]] would not [[H3808]] turn [[H5437]] his face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] him, but [[H3588]] disguised himself, [[H2664]] that he might fight [[H3898]] with him, and hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of Necho [[H5224]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of God, [[H430]] and came [[H935]] to fight [[H3898]] in the valley [[H1237]] of Megiddo. [[H4023]]

### 23
And the archers [[H3384]] shot [[H3384]] at king [[H4428]] Josiah; [[H2977]] and the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to his servants, [[H5650]] Have me away; [[H5674]] for [[H3588]] I am sore [[H3966]] wounded. [[H2470]]

### 24
His servants [[H5650]] therefore took [[H5674]] him out of [[H4480]] that chariot, [[H4818]] and put [[H7392]] him in [[H5921]] the second [[H4932]] chariot [[H7393]] that [[H834]] he had; and they brought [[H1980]] him to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he died, [[H4191]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the sepulchres [[H6913]] of his fathers. [[H1]] And all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] mourned [[H56]] for [[H5921]] Josiah. [[H2977]]

### 25
And Jeremiah [[H3414]] lamented [[H6969]] for [[H5921]] Josiah: [[H2977]] and all [[H3605]] the singing men [[H7891]] and the singing women [[H7891]] spake [[H559]] of [[H5921]] Josiah [[H2977]] in their lamentations [[H7015]] to [[H5704]] this day, [[H3117]] and made [[H5414]] them an ordinance [[H2706]] in [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] and, behold, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the lamentations. [[H7015]]

### 26
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] and his goodness, [[H2617]] according to written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 27
And his deeds, [[H1697]] first [[H7223]] and last, [[H314]] behold, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]]
