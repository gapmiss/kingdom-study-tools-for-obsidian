[[H430]]

### 8
Now the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoiakim, [[H3079]] and his abominations [[H8441]] which [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] and that which was found [[H4672]] in [[H5921]] him, behold, [[H2005]] they written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah: [[H3063]] and Jehoiachin [[H3078]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 9
Jehoiachin [[H3078]] eight [[H8083]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] and ten [[H6235]] days [[H3117]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
And when the year [[H8141]] was expired, [[H8666]] king [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] sent, [[H7971]] and brought [[H935]] him to Babylon, [[H894]] with [[H5973]] the goodly [[H2532]] vessels [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]]  and made [[H853]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] his brother [[H251]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 11
Zedekiah [[H6667]] one [[H259]] and twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] and reigned [[H4427]] eleven [[H259]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 12
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] humbled [[H3665]]  not himself [[H3808]] before [[H6440]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And he also [[H1571]] rebelled [[H4775]] against king [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5019]] who [[H834]] had made him swear [[H7650]] by God: [[H430]] but he stiffened [[H7185]] his neck, [[H6203]] and hardened [[H553]] his heart [[H3824]] from turning [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 14
Moreover [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] the chief [[H8269]] of the priests, [[H3548]] and the people, [[H5971]] transgressed [[H4603]] very [[H4604]] much [[H7235]] after all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] of the heathen; [[H1471]] and polluted [[H2930]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he had hallowed [[H6942]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers [[H1]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H5921]] them by [[H3027]] his messengers, [[H4397]] rising up betimes, [[H7925]] and sending; [[H7971]] because [[H3588]] he had compassion [[H2550]] on [[H5921]] his people, [[H5971]] and on [[H5921]] his dwelling place: [[H4583]]

### 16
But they mocked [[H3931]] the messengers [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] and despised [[H959]] his words, [[H1697]] and misused [[H8591]] his prophets, [[H5030]] until [[H5704]] the wrath [[H2534]] of the Lord [[H3068]] arose [[H5927]] against his people, [[H5971]] till [[H5704]] no [[H369]] remedy. [[H4832]]

### 17
Therefore he brought [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]]  them [[H853]] the king [[H4428]] of the Chaldees, [[H3778]] who slew [[H2026]] their young men [[H970]] with the sword [[H2719]] in the house [[H1004]] of their sanctuary, [[H4720]] and had no compassion [[H2550]] upon [[H5921]] young man [[H970]] or maiden, [[H1330]] old man, [[H2205]] or him that stooped for age: [[H3486]] he gave [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] into his hand. [[H3027]]

### 18
And all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] great [[H1419]] and small, [[H6996]] and the treasures [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the treasures [[H214]] of the king, [[H4428]] and of his princes; [[H8269]] all [[H3605]] he brought [[H935]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 19
And they burnt [[H8313]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and brake down [[H5422]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and burnt [[H8313]] all [[H3605]] the palaces [[H759]] thereof with fire, [[H784]] and destroyed [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] the goodly [[H4261]] vessels [[H3627]] thereof. [[H3627]]

### 20
And them that had escaped [[H7611]] from [[H4480]] the sword [[H2719]] carried he away [[H1540]] to [[H413]] Babylon; [[H894]] where they were [[H1961]] servants [[H5650]] to him and his sons [[H1121]] until [[H5704]] the reign [[H4427]] of the kingdom [[H4438]] of Persia: [[H6539]]

### 21
To fulfil [[H4390]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by the mouth [[H6310]] of Jeremiah, [[H3414]] until [[H5704]] the land [[H776]] had enjoyed [[H7521]] her sabbaths: [[H7676]] as long as [[H3117]] she lay desolate [[H8074]] she kept sabbath, [[H7673]] to fulfil [[H4390]] threescore and ten [[H7657]] years. [[H8141]]

### 22
Now in the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia, [[H6539]] that the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by the mouth [[H6310]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] might be accomplished, [[H3615]] the Lord [[H3068]] stirred up [[H5782]] the spirit [[H7307]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia, [[H6539]] that he made a proclamation [[H5674]] throughout all [[H3605]] his kingdom, [[H4438]] and also [[H1571]] in writing, [[H4385]] saying, [[H559]]

### 23
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia, [[H6539]] All [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth [[H776]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of heaven [[H8064]] given [[H5414]] me; and he [[H1931]] hath charged [[H6485]] me to build [[H1129]] him an house [[H1004]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] in Judah. [[H3063]] Who [[H4310]] among you of all [[H3605]] his people? [[H5971]] The Lord [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] him, and let him go up. [[H5927]]
