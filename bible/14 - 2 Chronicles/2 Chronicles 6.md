### 1
Then [[H227]] said [[H559]] Solomon, [[H8010]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H559]] that he would dwell [[H7931]] in the thick darkness. [[H6205]]

### 2
But I [[H589]] have built [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] of habitation [[H2073]] for thee, and a place [[H4349]] for thy dwelling [[H3427]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] turned [[H5437]] his face, [[H6440]] and blessed [[H1288]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H6951]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] stood. [[H5975]]

### 4
And he said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who hath with his hands [[H3027]] fulfilled [[H4390]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] with his mouth [[H6310]] to [[H853]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]]

### 5
Since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] I brought forth [[H3318]] my people [[H5971]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] I chose [[H977]] no [[H3808]] city [[H5892]] among all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] in, that my name [[H8034]] might be [[H1961]] there; [[H8033]] neither [[H3808]] chose [[H977]] I any man [[H376]] to be [[H1961]] a ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel: [[H3478]]

### 6
But I have chosen [[H977]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that my name [[H8034]] might be [[H1961]] there; [[H8033]] and have chosen [[H977]] David [[H1732]] to be [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
Now it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] the heart [[H3824]] of David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
But the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] Forasmuch [[H3588]] as it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] thine heart [[H3824]] to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for my name, [[H8034]] thou didst well [[H2895]] in that it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] thine heart: [[H3824]]

### 9
Notwithstanding [[H7535]] thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] the house; [[H1004]] but [[H3588]] thy son [[H1121]] which shall come forth [[H3318]] out of thy loins, [[H2504]] he [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] for my name. [[H8034]]

### 10
The Lord [[H3068]] therefore hath performed [[H6965]] his word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he hath spoken: [[H1696]] for I am risen up [[H6965]] in the room [[H8478]] of David [[H1732]] my father, [[H1]] and am set [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] promised, [[H1696]] and have built [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] for the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
And in it [[H8033]] have I put [[H7760]] the ark, [[H727]] wherein [[H834]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] he made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 12
And he stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the presence of [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and spread forth [[H6566]] his hands: [[H3709]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made [[H6213]] a brasen [[H5178]] scaffold, [[H3595]] of five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] and five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] broad, [[H7341]] and three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H6967]] and had set [[H5414]] it in the midst [[H8432]] of the court: [[H5835]] and upon [[H5921]] it he stood, [[H5975]] and kneeled down [[H1288]] upon [[H5921]] his knees [[H1290]] before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and spread forth [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] toward heaven, [[H8064]]

### 14
And said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] no [[H369]] God [[H430]] like thee [[H3644]] in the heaven, [[H8064]] nor in the earth; [[H776]] which keepest [[H8104]] covenant, [[H1285]] and mercy [[H2617]] unto thy servants, [[H5650]] that walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee with all [[H3605]] their hearts: [[H3820]]

### 15
Thou which [[H834]] hast kept [[H8104]] with thy servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] that which [[H834]] thou hast promised [[H1696]] him; and spakest [[H1696]] with thy mouth, [[H6310]] and hast fulfilled [[H4390]] with thine hand, [[H3027]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 16
Now [[H6258]] therefore, O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] keep [[H8104]] with thy servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] my father [[H1]] that which [[H834]] thou hast promised [[H1696]] him, saying, [[H559]] There shall not [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] thee a man [[H376]] in my sight [[H6440]] to sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel; [[H3478]] yet so [[H7535]] that thy children [[H1121]] take heed [[H8104]] to their way [[H1870]] to walk [[H1980]] in my law, [[H8451]] as [[H834]] thou hast walked [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] me. [[H6440]]

### 17
Now [[H6258]] then, O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] let thy word [[H1697]] be verified, [[H539]] which [[H834]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] unto thy servant [[H5650]] David. [[H1732]]

### 18
But [[H3588]] will God [[H430]] in very deed [[H552]] dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] men [[H120]] on [[H5921]] the earth? [[H776]] behold, [[H2009]] heaven [[H8064]] and the heaven [[H8064]] of heavens [[H8064]] cannot [[H3808]] contain [[H3557]] thee; how much less [[H637]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] I have built! [[H1129]]

### 19
Have respect [[H6437]] therefore to [[H413]] the prayer [[H8605]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] and to [[H413]] his supplication, [[H8467]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] to hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] the cry [[H7440]] and the prayer [[H8605]] which [[H834]] thy servant [[H5650]] prayeth [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] thee: [[H6440]]

### 20
That thine eyes [[H5869]] may be [[H1961]] open [[H6605]] upon [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] upon [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] whereof [[H834]] thou hast said [[H559]] that thou wouldest put [[H7760]] thy name [[H8034]] there; [[H8033]] to hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] the prayer [[H8605]] which [[H834]] thy servant [[H5650]] prayeth [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 21
Hearken [[H8085]] therefore unto [[H413]] the supplications [[H8469]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] and of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] they shall make [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place: [[H4725]] hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] from thy dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4725]] from [[H4480]] heaven; [[H8064]] and when thou hearest, [[H8085]] forgive. [[H5545]]

### 22
If [[H518]] a man [[H376]] sin [[H2398]] against his neighbour, [[H7453]] and an oath [[H423]] be laid [[H5375]] upon him to make him swear, [[H422]] and the oath [[H423]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] thine altar [[H4196]] in this [[H2088]] house; [[H1004]]

### 23
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and do, [[H6213]] and judge [[H8199]] thy servants, [[H5650]] by requiting [[H7725]] the wicked, [[H7563]] by recompensing [[H5414]] his way [[H1870]] upon his own head; [[H7218]] and by justifying [[H6663]] the righteous, [[H6662]] by giving [[H5414]] him according to his righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 24
And if [[H518]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] be put to the worse [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] the enemy, [[H341]] because [[H3588]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against thee; and shall return [[H7725]] and confess [[H3034]] thy name, [[H8034]] and pray [[H6419]] and make supplication [[H2603]] before [[H6440]] thee in this [[H2088]] house; [[H1004]]

### 25
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] from [[H4480]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and forgive [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and bring them again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] to them and to their fathers. [[H1]]

### 26
When the heaven [[H8064]] is shut up, [[H6113]] and there is [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain, [[H4306]] because [[H3588]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against thee; if they pray [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and confess [[H3034]] thy name, [[H8034]] and turn [[H7725]] from their sin, [[H2403]] when [[H3588]] thou dost afflict [[H6031]] them; [[H6031]]

### 27
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] from heaven, [[H8064]] and forgive [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] of thy servants, [[H5650]] and of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] when [[H3588]] thou hast taught [[H3384]] them the good [[H2896]] way, [[H1870]] wherein [[H834]] they should walk; [[H1980]] and send [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] upon [[H5921]] thy land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou hast given [[H5414]] unto thy people [[H5971]] for an inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 28
If [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] dearth [[H7458]] in the land, [[H776]] if [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] pestilence, [[H1698]] if [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] blasting, [[H7711]] or mildew, [[H3420]] locusts, [[H697]] or caterpillers; [[H2625]] if [[H3588]] their enemies [[H341]] besiege [[H6887]] them in the cities [[H8179]] of their land; [[H776]] whatsoever [[H3605]] sore [[H5061]] or whatsoever [[H3605]] sickness [[H4245]]

### 29
what [[H3605]] prayer [[H8605]] what [[H3605]] supplication [[H8467]] soever [[H834]] shall be made [[H1961]] of any [[H3605]] man, [[H120]] or of all [[H3605]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] when [[H834]] every one [[H376]] shall know [[H3045]] his own sore [[H5061]] and his own grief, [[H4341]] and shall spread forth [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] in [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house: [[H1004]]

### 30
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] thy dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] and forgive, [[H5545]] and render [[H5414]] unto every man [[H376]] according unto all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] whose heart [[H3824]] thou knowest; [[H3045]] (for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] only [[H905]] knowest [[H3045]] the hearts [[H3824]] of the children [[H1121]] of men:) [[H120]]

### 31
That [[H4616]] they may fear [[H3372]] thee, to walk [[H1980]] in thy ways, [[H1870]] so long [[H3605]] as [[H3117]] they [[H1992]] live [[H2416]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] unto our fathers. [[H1]]

### 32
Moreover [[H1571]] concerning [[H413]] the stranger, [[H5237]] which [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] of thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] but is come [[H935]] from a far [[H7350]] country [[H776]] for thy great [[H1419]] name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]] and thy mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and thy stretched out [[H5186]] arm; [[H2220]] if they come [[H935]] and pray [[H6419]] in [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house; [[H1004]]

### 33
Then hear [[H8085]] thou [[H859]] from [[H4480]] the heavens, [[H8064]] from thy dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] and do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the stranger [[H5237]] calleth [[H7121]] to [[H413]] thee for; that [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] people [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] may know [[H3045]] thy name, [[H8034]] and fear [[H3372]] thee, as thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] I have built [[H1129]] is called [[H7121]] by thy name. [[H8034]]

### 34
If [[H3588]] thy people [[H5971]] go out [[H3318]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] their enemies [[H341]] by the way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] thou shalt send [[H7971]] them, and they pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] thee toward [[H1870]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] thou hast chosen, [[H977]] and the house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] I have built [[H1129]] for thy name; [[H8034]]

### 35
Then hear [[H8085]] thou from [[H4480]] the heavens [[H8064]] their prayer [[H8605]] and their supplication, [[H8467]] and maintain [[H6213]] their cause. [[H4941]]

### 36
If [[H3588]] they sin [[H2398]] against thee, (for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] man [[H120]] which [[H834]] sinneth [[H2398]] not,) [[H3808]] and thou be angry [[H599]] with them, and deliver [[H5414]] them over before [[H6440]] enemies, [[H341]] and they carry them away [[H7617]] captives [[H7617]] unto [[H413]] a land [[H776]] far off [[H7350]] or [[H176]] near; [[H7138]]

### 37
Yet they bethink [[H7725]]  themselves [[H3824]] in the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] they are carried captive, [[H7617]] and turn [[H7725]] and pray [[H2603]] unto [[H413]] thee in the land [[H776]] of their captivity, [[H7628]] saying, [[H559]] We have sinned, [[H2398]] we have done amiss, [[H5753]] and have dealt wickedly; [[H7561]]

### 38
If they return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] thee with all [[H3605]] their heart [[H3820]] and with all [[H3605]] their soul [[H5315]] in the land [[H776]] of their captivity, [[H7628]] whither [[H834]] they have carried them captives, [[H7617]] and pray [[H6419]] toward [[H1870]] their land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou gavest [[H5414]] unto their fathers, [[H1]] and the city [[H5892]] which [[H834]] thou hast chosen, [[H977]] and toward the house [[H1004]] which [[H834]] I have built [[H1129]] for thy name: [[H8034]]

### 39
Then hear [[H8085]] thou from [[H4480]] the heavens, [[H8064]] from thy dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] their prayer [[H8605]] and their supplications, [[H8467]] and maintain [[H6213]] their cause, [[H4941]] and forgive [[H5545]] thy people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] have sinned [[H2398]] against thee. [[H2398]]

### 40
Now, [[H6258]] my God, [[H430]] let, I beseech thee, [[H4994]] thine eyes [[H5869]] be [[H1961]] open, [[H6605]] and thine ears [[H241]] attent [[H7183]] unto the prayer [[H8605]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 41
Now [[H6258]] therefore arise, [[H6965]] O Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] into thy resting place, [[H5118]] thou, [[H859]] and the ark [[H727]] of thy strength: [[H5797]] let thy priests, [[H3548]] O Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] be clothed [[H3847]] with salvation, [[H8668]] and let thy saints [[H2623]] rejoice [[H8055]] in goodness. [[H2896]]

### 42
O Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] turn not away [[H7725]] the face [[H6440]] of thine anointed: [[H4899]] remember [[H2142]] the mercies [[H2617]] of David [[H1732]] thy servant. [[H5650]]
