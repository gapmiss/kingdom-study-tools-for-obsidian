### 1
Give ear, [[H238]] O ye heavens, [[H8064]] and I will speak; [[H1696]] and hear, [[H8085]] O earth, [[H776]] the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 2
My doctrine [[H3948]] shall drop [[H6201]] as the rain, [[H4306]] my speech [[H565]] shall distil [[H5140]] as the dew, [[H2919]] as the small rain [[H8164]] upon [[H5921]] the tender herb, [[H1877]] and as the showers [[H7241]] upon [[H5921]] the grass: [[H6212]]

### 3
Because [[H3588]] I will publish [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] ascribe [[H3051]] ye greatness [[H1433]] unto our God. [[H430]]

### 4
the Rock, [[H6697]] his work [[H6467]] perfect: [[H8549]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] his ways [[H1870]] judgment: [[H4941]] a God [[H410]] of truth [[H530]] and without [[H369]] iniquity, [[H5766]] just [[H6662]] and right [[H3477]] he. [[H1931]]

### 5
They have corrupted [[H7843]] themselves, their spot [[H3971]] not [[H3808]] of his children: [[H1121]] a perverse [[H6141]] and crooked [[H6618]] generation. [[H1755]]

### 6
Do ye thus [[H2063]] requite [[H1580]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O foolish [[H5036]] people [[H5971]] and unwise? [[H2450]] not [[H3808]] he [[H1931]] thy father [[H1]] hath bought [[H7069]] thee? hath he [[H1931]] not made [[H6213]] thee, and established [[H3559]] thee? [[H3559]]

### 7
Remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of old, [[H5769]] consider [[H995]] the years [[H8141]] of many [[H1755]] generations: [[H1755]] ask [[H7592]] thy father, [[H1]] and he will shew [[H5046]] thee; thy elders, [[H2205]] and they will tell [[H559]] thee. [[H559]]

### 8
When the most High [[H5945]] divided their inheritance, [[H5157]] to the nations [[H1471]] when he separated [[H6504]] the sons [[H1121]] of Adam, [[H120]] he set [[H5324]] the bounds [[H1367]] of the people [[H5971]] according to the number [[H4557]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] the Lord's [[H3068]] portion [[H2506]] his people; [[H5971]] Jacob [[H3290]] the lot [[H2256]] of his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 10
He found [[H4672]] him in a desert [[H4057]] land, [[H776]] and in the waste [[H8414]] howling [[H3214]] wilderness; [[H3452]] he led him about, [[H5437]] he instructed [[H995]] him, he kept [[H5341]] him as the apple [[H380]] of his eye. [[H5869]]

### 11
As an eagle [[H5404]] stirreth up [[H5782]] her nest, [[H7064]] fluttereth [[H7363]] over [[H5921]] her young, [[H1469]] spreadeth abroad [[H6566]] her wings, [[H3671]] taketh [[H3947]] them, beareth [[H5375]] them on [[H5921]] her wings: [[H84]]

### 12
the Lord [[H3068]] alone [[H910]] did lead [[H5148]] him, and no [[H369]] strange [[H5236]] god [[H410]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 13
He made him ride [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] the high places [[H1116]] of the earth, [[H776]] that he might eat [[H398]] the increase [[H8570]] of the fields; [[H7704]] and he made him to suck [[H3243]] honey [[H1706]] out of the rock, [[H5553]] and oil [[H8081]] out of the flinty [[H2496]] rock; [[H6697]]

### 14
Butter [[H2529]] of kine, [[H1241]] and milk [[H2461]] of sheep, [[H6629]] with [[H5973]] fat [[H2459]] of lambs, [[H3733]] and rams [[H352]] of the breed [[H1121]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] and goats, [[H6260]] with [[H5973]] the fat [[H2459]] of kidneys [[H3629]] of wheat; [[H2406]] and thou didst drink [[H8354]] the pure [[H2561]] blood [[H1818]] of the grape. [[H6025]]

### 15
But Jeshurun [[H3484]] waxed fat, [[H8080]] and kicked: [[H1163]] thou art waxen fat, [[H8080]] thou art grown thick, [[H5666]] thou art covered [[H3780]] then he forsook [[H5203]] God [[H433]] made [[H6213]] him, and lightly esteemed [[H5034]] the Rock [[H6697]] of his salvation. [[H3444]]

### 16
They provoked him to jealousy [[H7065]] with strange [[H2114]] with abominations [[H8441]] provoked they him to anger. [[H3707]]

### 17
They sacrificed [[H2076]] unto devils, [[H7700]] not [[H3808]] to God; [[H433]] to gods [[H430]] whom they knew [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] to new [[H2319]] came up, [[H935]] newly [[H7138]] whom your fathers [[H1]] feared [[H8175]] not. [[H3808]]

### 18
Of the Rock [[H6697]] begat [[H3205]] thee thou art unmindful, [[H7876]] and hast forgotten [[H7911]] God [[H410]] that formed [[H2342]] thee. [[H2342]]

### 19
And when the Lord [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] he abhorred [[H5006]] because of the provoking [[H3708]] of his sons, [[H1121]] and of his daughters. [[H1323]]

### 20
And he said, [[H559]] I will hide [[H5641]] my face [[H6440]] from them, I will see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] their end [[H319]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a very froward [[H8419]] generation, [[H1755]] children [[H1121]] in whom no [[H3808]] faith. [[H529]]

### 21
They [[H1992]] have moved me to jealousy [[H7065]] with not [[H3808]] God; [[H410]] they have provoked me to anger [[H3707]] with their vanities: [[H1892]] and I [[H589]] will move them to jealousy [[H7065]] with not [[H3808]] a people; [[H5971]] I will provoke them to anger [[H3707]] with a foolish [[H5036]] nation. [[H1471]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] a fire [[H784]] is kindled [[H6919]] in mine anger, [[H639]] and shall burn [[H3344]] unto [[H5704]] the lowest [[H8482]] hell, [[H7585]] and shall consume [[H398]] the earth [[H776]] with her increase, [[H2981]] and set on fire [[H3857]] the foundations [[H4146]] of the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 23
I will heap [[H5595]] mischiefs [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] them; I will spend [[H3615]] mine arrows [[H2671]] upon them. [[H2671]]

### 24
burnt [[H4198]] with hunger, [[H7458]] and devoured [[H3898]] with burning heat, [[H7565]] and with bitter [[H4815]] destruction: [[H6986]] I will also send [[H7971]] the teeth [[H8127]] of beasts [[H929]] upon them, with [[H5973]] the poison [[H2534]] of serpents [[H2119]] of the dust. [[H6083]]

### 25
The sword [[H2719]] without, [[H2351]] and terror [[H367]] within, [[H2315]] shall destroy [[H7921]] both [[H1571]] the young man [[H970]] and [[H1571]] the virgin, [[H1330]] the suckling [[H3243]] with [[H5973]] the man [[H376]] of gray hairs. [[H7872]]

### 26
I said, [[H559]] I would scatter them into corners, [[H6284]] I would make the remembrance [[H2143]] of them to cease [[H7673]] from among men: [[H582]]

### 27
Were it not that [[H3884]] I feared [[H1481]] the wrath [[H3708]] of the enemy, [[H341]] lest [[H6435]] their adversaries [[H6862]] should behave themselves strangely, [[H5234]] lest [[H6435]] they should say, [[H559]] Our hand [[H3027]] high, [[H7311]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] done [[H6466]] all [[H3605]] this. [[H2063]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] a nation [[H1471]] void [[H6]] of counsel, [[H6098]] neither [[H369]] understanding [[H8394]] in them. [[H8394]]

### 29
O that [[H3863]] they were wise, [[H2449]] they understood [[H7919]] this, [[H2063]] they would consider [[H995]] their latter end! [[H319]]

### 30
How [[H349]] should one [[H259]] chase [[H7291]] a thousand, [[H505]] and two [[H8147]] put ten thousand [[H7233]] to flight, [[H5127]] except [[H3808]] their Rock [[H6697]] had sold [[H4376]] them, [[H3588]] and the Lord [[H3068]] had shut them up? [[H5462]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] their rock [[H6697]] not [[H3808]] as our Rock, [[H6697]] even our enemies [[H341]] themselves judges. [[H6414]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] their vine [[H1612]] of the vine [[H1612]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] and of the fields [[H7709]] of Gomorrah: [[H6017]] their grapes [[H6025]] grapes [[H6025]] of gall, [[H7219]] their clusters [[H811]] bitter: [[H4846]]

### 33
Their wine [[H3196]] the poison [[H2534]] of dragons, [[H8577]] and the cruel [[H393]] venom [[H7219]] of asps. [[H6620]]

### 34
not [[H3808]] this [[H1931]] laid up in store [[H3647]] with [[H5978]] me, sealed up [[H2856]] among my treasures? [[H214]]

### 35
To me vengeance, [[H5359]] and recompence; [[H8005]] their foot [[H7272]] shall slide [[H4131]] in time: [[H6256]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of their calamity [[H343]] at hand, [[H7138]] and the things that shall come [[H6264]] upon them make haste. [[H2363]]

### 36
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall judge [[H1777]] his people, [[H5971]] and repent himself [[H5162]] for [[H5921]] his servants, [[H5650]] when [[H3588]] he seeth [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] power [[H3027]] is gone, [[H235]] and none [[H657]] shut up, [[H6113]] or left. [[H5800]]

### 37
And he shall say, [[H559]] Where [[H335]] their gods, [[H430]] rock [[H6697]] in whom they trusted, [[H2620]]

### 38
Which [[H834]] did eat [[H398]] the fat [[H2459]] of their sacrifices, [[H2077]] drank [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] of their drink offerings? [[H5257]] let them rise up [[H6965]] and help [[H5826]] you, be [[H1961]] your protection. [[H5643]]

### 39
See [[H7200]] now [[H6258]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] I, [[H589]] he, [[H1931]] and no [[H369]] god [[H430]] with [[H5978]] me: I [[H589]] kill, [[H4191]] and I make alive; [[H2421]] I wound, [[H4272]] and I [[H589]] heal: [[H7495]] neither [[H369]] that can deliver [[H5337]] out of my hand. [[H3027]]

### 40
For [[H3588]] I lift up [[H5375]] my hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] heaven, [[H8064]] and say, [[H559]] I [[H595]] live [[H2416]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 41
If [[H518]] I whet [[H8150]] my glittering [[H1300]] sword, [[H2719]] and mine hand [[H3027]] take hold [[H270]] on judgment; [[H4941]] I will render [[H7725]] vengeance [[H5359]] to mine enemies, [[H6862]] and will reward [[H7999]] them that hate [[H8130]] me. [[H8130]]

### 42
I will make mine arrows [[H2671]] drunk [[H7937]] with blood, [[H1818]] and my sword [[H2719]] shall devour [[H398]] flesh; [[H1320]] with the blood [[H1818]] of the slain [[H2491]] and of the captives, [[H7633]] from the beginning [[H7218]] of revenges [[H6546]] upon the enemy. [[H341]]

### 43
Rejoice, [[H7442]] O ye nations, [[H1471]] his people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] he will avenge [[H5358]] the blood [[H1818]] of his servants, [[H5650]] and will render [[H7725]] vengeance [[H5359]] to his adversaries, [[H6862]] and will be merciful [[H3722]] unto his land, [[H127]] to his people. [[H5971]]

### 44
And Moses [[H4872]] came [[H935]] and spake [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] in the ears [[H241]] of the people, [[H5971]] he, [[H1931]] and Hoshea [[H1954]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun. [[H5126]]

### 45
And Moses [[H4872]] made an end [[H3615]] of speaking [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]]

### 46
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Set [[H7760]] your hearts [[H3824]] unto all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] testify [[H5749]] among you this day, [[H3117]] which [[H834]] ye shall command [[H6680]] your children [[H1121]] to observe [[H8104]] to do, [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law. [[H8451]]

### 47
For [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] a vain [[H7386]] thing [[H1697]] for [[H4480]] you; because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] your life: [[H2416]] and through this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] ye shall prolong [[H748]] days [[H3117]] in [[H5921]] the land, [[H127]] whither [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 48
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] that [[H2088]] selfsame [[H6106]] day, [[H3117]] saying, [[H559]]

### 49
Get thee up [[H5927]] into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] mountain [[H2022]] Abarim, [[H5682]] mount [[H2022]] Nebo, [[H5015]] which [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] against [[H6440]] Jericho; [[H3405]] and behold [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] give [[H5414]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] for a possession: [[H272]]

### 50
And die [[H4191]] in the mount [[H2022]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest up, [[H5927]] and be gathered [[H622]] unto [[H413]] thy people; [[H5971]] as [[H834]] Aaron [[H175]] thy brother [[H251]] died [[H4191]] in mount [[H2022]] Hor, [[H2023]] and was gathered [[H622]] unto [[H413]] his people: [[H5971]]

### 51
Because [[H5921]] ye trespassed [[H4603]] against me among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] at the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah-Kadesh, [[H4808]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin; [[H6790]] because [[H5921]] ye sanctified [[H6942]] me not [[H3808]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 52
Yet [[H3588]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] before [[H5048]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] go [[H935]] thither [[H8033]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] give [[H5414]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]
