### 1
Now these [[H2063]] the commandments, [[H4687]] the statutes, [[H2706]] and the judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] to teach [[H3925]] you, that ye might do [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go [[H5674]] to possess [[H3423]] it: [[H3423]]

### 2
That [[H4616]] thou mightest fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] his statutes [[H2708]] and his commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee, thou, [[H859]] and thy son, [[H1121]] and thy son's [[H1121]] son, [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of thy life; [[H2416]] and that [[H4616]] thy days [[H3117]] may be prolonged. [[H748]]

### 3
Hear [[H8085]] therefore, O Israel, [[H3478]] and observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] that [[H834]] it may be well [[H3190]] with thee, and that [[H834]] ye may increase [[H7235]] mightily, [[H3966]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of thy fathers [[H1]] hath promised [[H1696]] thee, in the land [[H776]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

### 4
Hear, [[H8085]] O Israel: [[H3478]] The Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] one [[H259]] Lord: [[H3068]]

### 5
And thou shalt love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] thine heart, [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] thy soul, [[H5315]] and with all [[H3605]] thy might. [[H3966]]

### 6
And these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] shall be [[H1961]] in [[H5921]] thine heart: [[H3824]]

### 7
And thou shalt teach them diligently [[H8150]] unto thy children, [[H1121]] and shalt talk [[H1696]] of them when thou sittest [[H3427]] in thine house, [[H1004]] and when thou walkest [[H1980]] by the way, [[H1870]] and when thou liest down, [[H7901]] and when thou risest up. [[H6965]]

### 8
And thou shalt bind [[H7194]] them for a sign [[H226]] upon [[H5921]] thine hand, [[H3027]] and they shall be [[H1961]] as frontlets [[H2903]] between [[H996]] thine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
And thou shalt write [[H3789]] them upon [[H5921]] the posts [[H4201]] of thy house, [[H1004]] and on thy gates. [[H8179]]

### 10
And it shall be, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall have brought [[H935]] thee into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers, [[H1]] to Abraham, [[H85]] to Isaac, [[H3327]] and to Jacob, [[H3290]] to give [[H5414]] thee great [[H1419]] and goodly [[H2896]] cities, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] thou buildedst [[H1129]] not, [[H3808]]

### 11
And houses [[H1004]] full [[H4392]] of all [[H3605]] good [[H2898]] which [[H834]] thou filledst [[H4390]] not, [[H3808]] and wells [[H953]] digged, [[H2672]] which [[H834]] thou diggedst [[H2672]] not, [[H3808]] vineyards [[H3754]] and olive trees, [[H2132]] which [[H834]] thou plantedst [[H5193]] not; [[H3808]] when thou shalt have eaten [[H398]] and be full; [[H7646]]

### 12
beware [[H8104]] lest [[H6435]] thou forget [[H7911]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] brought thee forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the house [[H1004]] of bondage. [[H5650]]

### 13
Thou shalt fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and serve [[H5647]] him, and shalt swear [[H7650]] by his name. [[H8034]]

### 14
Ye shall not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] of the gods [[H430]] of the people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] you; [[H5439]]

### 15
(For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] a jealous [[H7067]] God [[H410]] among [[H7130]] you) lest [[H6435]] the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] be kindled [[H2734]] against thee, and destroy [[H8045]] thee from off [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 16
Ye shall not [[H3808]] tempt [[H5254]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] ye tempted [[H5254]] in Massah. [[H4532]]

### 17
Ye shall diligently [[H8104]] keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and his testimonies, [[H5713]] and his statutes, [[H2706]] which [[H834]] he hath commanded [[H6680]] thee. [[H6680]]

### 18
And thou shalt do [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] and good [[H2896]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] that [[H4616]] it may be well [[H3190]] with thee, and that thou mayest go in [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers, [[H1]]

### 19
To cast out [[H1920]] all [[H3605]] thine enemies [[H341]] from before [[H6440]] thee, as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken. [[H1696]]

### 20
when [[H3588]] thy son [[H1121]] asketh [[H7592]] thee in time to come, [[H4279]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] the testimonies, [[H5713]] and the statutes, [[H2706]] and the judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] hath commanded [[H6680]] you? [[H6680]]

### 21
Then thou shalt say [[H559]] unto thy son, [[H1121]] We were [[H1961]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] bondmen [[H5650]] in Egypt; [[H4714]] and the Lord [[H3068]] brought us out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand: [[H3027]]

### 22
And the Lord [[H3068]] shewed [[H5414]] signs [[H226]] and wonders, [[H4159]] great [[H1419]] and sore, [[H7451]] upon Egypt, [[H4714]] upon Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and upon all [[H3605]] his household, [[H1004]] before our eyes: [[H5869]]

### 23
And he brought us out [[H3318]] from thence, [[H8033]] that [[H4616]] he might bring us in, [[H935]] to give [[H5414]]  us [[H853]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto our fathers. [[H1]]

### 24
And the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] us to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] statutes, [[H2706]] to fear [[H3372]]  the [[H853]] Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] for our good [[H2896]] always, [[H3117]] that he might preserve us alive, [[H2421]] as at this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 25
And it shall be [[H1961]] our righteousness, [[H6666]] if [[H3588]] we observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2063]] commandments [[H4687]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] he hath commanded [[H6680]] us. [[H6680]]
