### 1
If [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] a controversy [[H7379]] between [[H996]] men, [[H582]] and they come [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] judgment, [[H4941]] that may judge [[H8199]] them; then they shall justify [[H6663]] the righteous, [[H6662]] and condemn [[H7561]] the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 2
And it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] the wicked man [[H7563]] worthy [[H1121]] to be beaten, [[H5221]] that the judge [[H8199]] shall cause him to lie down, [[H5307]] and to be beaten [[H5221]] before his face, [[H6440]] according to [[H1767]] his fault, [[H7564]] by a certain number. [[H4557]]

### 3
Forty [[H705]] stripes [[H5221]] he may give him, not [[H3808]] exceed: [[H3254]] lest, [[H6435]] he should exceed, [[H3254]] and beat [[H5221]] him above [[H5921]] these [[H428]] with many [[H7227]] stripes, [[H4347]] then thy brother [[H251]] should seem vile [[H7034]] unto [[H5869]] thee. [[H5869]]

### 4
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] muzzle [[H2629]] the ox [[H7794]] when he treadeth out [[H1758]]

### 5
If [[H3588]] brethren [[H251]] dwell [[H3427]] together, [[H3162]] and one [[H259]] of them die, [[H4191]] and have no [[H369]] child, [[H1121]] the wife [[H802]] of the dead [[H4191]] shall not [[H3808]] marry [[H1961]] without [[H2351]] unto a stranger: [[H376]] her husband's brother [[H2993]] shall go in [[H935]] unto [[H5921]] her, and take [[H3947]] her to him to wife, [[H802]] and perform the duty of an husband's brother [[H2992]] unto her. [[H2992]]

### 6
And it shall be, [[H1961]] the firstborn [[H1060]] which [[H834]] she beareth [[H3205]] shall succeed [[H6965]] in [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of his brother [[H251]] dead, [[H4191]] that his name [[H8034]] be not [[H3808]] put out [[H4229]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And if [[H518]] the man [[H376]] like [[H2654]] not [[H3808]] to take [[H3947]] his brother's wife, [[H2994]] then let his brother's wife [[H2994]] go up [[H5927]] to the gate [[H8179]] unto [[H413]] the elders, [[H2205]] and say, [[H559]] My husband's brother [[H2993]] refuseth [[H3985]] to raise up [[H6965]] unto his brother [[H251]] a name [[H8034]] in Israel, [[H3478]] he will [[H14]] not [[H3808]] perform the duty of my husband's brother. [[H2992]]

### 8
Then the elders [[H2205]] of his city [[H5892]] shall call [[H7121]] him, and speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him: and he stand [[H5975]] and say, [[H559]] I like [[H2654]] not [[H3808]] to take [[H3947]] her; [[H3947]]

### 9
Then shall his brother's wife [[H2994]] come [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] him in the presence [[H5869]] of the elders, [[H2205]] and loose [[H2502]] his shoe [[H5275]] from off [[H5921]] his foot, [[H7272]] and spit [[H3417]] in his face, [[H6440]] and shall answer [[H6030]] and say, [[H559]] So [[H3602]] shall it be done [[H6213]] unto that man [[H376]] that [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] build up [[H1129]] his brother's [[H251]] house. [[H1004]]

### 10
And his name [[H8034]] shall be called [[H7121]] in Israel, [[H3478]] The house [[H1004]] of him that hath his shoe [[H5275]] loosed. [[H2502]]

### 11
When [[H3588]] men [[H376]] strive [[H5327]] together [[H3162]] one [[H376]] with another, [[H251]] and the wife [[H802]] of the one [[H259]] draweth near [[H7126]] for to deliver [[H5337]] her husband [[H376]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of him that smiteth [[H5221]] him, and putteth forth [[H7971]] her hand, [[H3027]] and taketh [[H2388]] him by the secrets: [[H4016]]

### 12
Then thou shalt cut off [[H7112]] her hand, [[H3709]] thine eye [[H5869]] shall not [[H3808]] pity [[H2347]]

### 13
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] in thy bag [[H3599]] divers weights, [[H68]] a great [[H1419]] and a small. [[H6996]]

### 14
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] in thine house [[H1004]] divers measures, [[H374]] a great [[H1419]] and a small. [[H6996]]

### 15
thou shalt have [[H1961]] a perfect [[H8003]] and just [[H6664]] weight, [[H68]] a perfect [[H8003]] and just [[H6664]] measure [[H374]] shalt thou have: [[H1961]] that [[H4616]] thy days [[H3117]] may be lengthened [[H748]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] that do [[H6213]] such things, [[H428]] all [[H3605]] that do [[H6213]] unrighteously, [[H5766]] an abomination [[H8441]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 17
Remember [[H2142]] what [[H834]] Amalek [[H6002]] did [[H6213]] unto thee by the way, [[H1870]] when ye were come forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt; [[H4714]]

### 18
How [[H834]] he met [[H7136]] thee by the way, [[H1870]] and smote the hindmost [[H2179]] of thee, all [[H3605]] feeble [[H2826]] behind [[H310]] thee, when thou [[H859]] faint [[H5889]] and weary; [[H3023]] and he feared [[H3373]] not [[H3808]] God. [[H430]]

### 19
Therefore it shall be, [[H1961]] when the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath given thee rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] thine enemies [[H341]] round about, [[H5439]] in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee an inheritance [[H5159]] to possess [[H3423]] it, thou shalt blot out [[H4229]] the remembrance [[H2143]] of Amalek [[H6002]] from under [[H8478]] heaven; [[H8064]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]]
