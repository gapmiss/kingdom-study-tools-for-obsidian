### 1
These [[H428]] the words [[H1697]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] to make [[H3772]] with [[H854]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] beside [[H905]] the covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] he made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] them in Horeb. [[H2722]]

### 2
And Moses [[H4872]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Ye [[H859]] have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] before your eyes [[H5869]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and unto all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5650]] and unto all [[H3605]] his land; [[H776]]

### 3
The great [[H1419]] temptations [[H4531]] which [[H834]] thine eyes [[H5869]] have seen, [[H7200]] the signs, [[H226]] and those [[H1992]] great [[H1419]] miracles: [[H4159]]

### 4
Yet the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] given [[H5414]] you an heart [[H3820]] to perceive, [[H3045]] and eyes [[H5869]] to see, [[H7200]] and ears [[H241]] to hear, [[H8085]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 5
And I have led [[H1980]] you forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] in the wilderness: [[H4057]] your clothes [[H8008]] are not [[H3808]] waxen old [[H1086]] upon [[H5921]] you, and thy shoe [[H5275]] is not [[H3808]] waxen old [[H1086]] upon [[H5921]] thy foot. [[H7272]]

### 6
Ye have not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] neither [[H3808]] have ye drunk [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] or strong drink: [[H7941]] that [[H4616]] ye might know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 7
And when ye came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] Sihon [[H5511]] the king [[H4428]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] and Og [[H5747]] the king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] came out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] us unto battle, [[H4421]] and we smote [[H5221]] them: [[H5221]]

### 8
And we took [[H3947]] their land, [[H776]] and gave [[H5414]] it for an inheritance [[H5159]] unto the Reubenites, [[H7206]] and to the Gadites, [[H1425]] and to the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh. [[H4520]]

### 9
Keep [[H8104]]  therefore [[H853]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant, [[H1285]] and do [[H6213]] them, that [[H4616]] ye may prosper [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] ye do. [[H6213]]

### 10
Ye [[H859]] stand [[H5324]] this day [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] of you before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] your captains [[H7218]] of your tribes, [[H7626]] your elders, [[H2205]] and your officers, [[H7860]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 11
Your little ones, [[H2945]] your wives, [[H802]] and thy stranger [[H1616]] that [[H834]] in [[H7130]] thy camp, [[H4264]] from the hewer [[H2404]] of thy wood [[H6086]] unto [[H5704]] the drawer [[H7579]] of thy water: [[H4325]]

### 12
That thou shouldest enter [[H5674]] into covenant [[H1285]] with the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and into his oath, [[H423]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] maketh [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] thee this day: [[H3117]]

### 13
That [[H4616]] he may establish [[H6965]] thee to day [[H3117]] for a people [[H5971]] unto himself, and he [[H1931]] may be [[H1961]] unto thee a God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] he hath said [[H1696]] unto thee, and as [[H834]] he hath sworn [[H7650]] unto thy fathers, [[H1]] to Abraham, [[H85]] to Isaac, [[H3327]] and to Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 14
Neither [[H3808]] with [[H854]] you only [[H905]] do I [[H595]] make [[H3772]] this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] and this [[H2063]] oath; [[H423]]

### 15
But [[H3588]] with [[H854]] that [[H834]] standeth [[H5975]] here [[H6311]] with [[H5973]] us this [[H3426]] day [[H3117]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and also with [[H854]] that [[H834]] not [[H369]] here [[H6311]] with [[H5973]] us this day: [[H3117]]

### 16
(For [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] know [[H3045]] how [[H834]] we have dwelt [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] and how [[H834]] we came [[H5674]] through [[H7130]] the nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] ye passed by; [[H5674]]

### 17
And ye have seen [[H7200]] their abominations, [[H8251]] and their idols, [[H1544]] wood [[H6086]] and stone, [[H68]] silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] which [[H834]] among [[H5973]] them:) [[H5973]]

### 18
Lest [[H6435]] there should be [[H3426]] among you man, [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman, [[H802]] or [[H176]] family, [[H4940]] or [[H176]] tribe, [[H7626]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3824]] turneth away [[H6437]] this day [[H3117]] from [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] to go [[H1980]] serve [[H5647]] the gods [[H430]] of these [[H1992]] nations; [[H1471]] lest [[H6435]] there should be [[H3426]] among you a root [[H8328]] that beareth [[H6509]] gall [[H7219]] and wormwood; [[H3939]]

### 19
And it come to pass, [[H1961]] when he heareth [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] curse, [[H423]] that he bless himself [[H1288]] in his heart, [[H3824]] saying, [[H559]] I shall have [[H1961]] peace, [[H7965]] though [[H3588]] I walk [[H1980]] in the imagination [[H8307]] of mine heart, [[H3820]] to [[H4616]] add [[H5595]] drunkenness [[H7302]] to [[H853]] thirst: [[H6771]]

### 20
The Lord [[H3068]] will [[H14]] not [[H3808]] spare [[H5545]] him, but [[H3588]] then [[H227]] the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] and his jealousy [[H7068]] shall smoke [[H6225]] against that [[H1931]] man, [[H376]] and all [[H3605]] the curses [[H423]] that are written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] shall lie [[H7257]] upon him, and the Lord [[H3068]] shall blot out [[H4229]] his name [[H8034]] from under [[H8478]] heaven. [[H8064]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall separate [[H914]] him unto evil [[H7451]] out of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] according to all [[H3605]] the curses [[H423]] of the covenant [[H1285]] that are written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] of the law: [[H8451]]

### 22
So that the generation [[H1755]] to come [[H314]] of your children [[H1121]] that [[H834]] shall rise up [[H6965]] after [[H310]] you, and the stranger [[H5237]] that [[H834]] shall come [[H935]] from a far [[H7350]] land, [[H776]] shall say, [[H559]] when they see [[H7200]] the plagues [[H4347]] of that [[H1931]] land, [[H776]] and the sicknesses [[H8463]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath laid [[H2470]] upon it; [[H2470]]

### 23
the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] thereof brimstone, [[H1614]] and salt, [[H4417]] burning, [[H8316]] it is not [[H3808]] sown, [[H2232]] nor [[H3808]] beareth, [[H6779]] nor [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] grass [[H6212]] groweth [[H5927]] therein, like the overthrow [[H4114]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] and Gomorrah, [[H6017]] Admah, [[H126]] and Zeboim, [[H6636]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] overthrew [[H2015]] in his anger, [[H639]] and in his wrath: [[H2534]]

### 24
Even all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] shall say, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H5921]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] thus [[H3602]] unto this [[H2063]] land? [[H776]] what [[H4100]] the heat [[H2750]] of this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] anger? [[H639]]

### 25
Then men shall say, [[H559]] Because [[H5921]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] which [[H834]] he made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] them when he brought them forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 26
For they went [[H1980]] and served [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and worshipped [[H7812]] them, gods [[H430]] whom [[H834]] they knew [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] and he had not [[H3808]] given [[H2505]] unto them: [[H2505]]

### 27
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against this [[H1931]] land, [[H776]] to bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]]  it [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the curses [[H7045]] that are written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book: [[H5612]]

### 28
And the Lord [[H3068]] rooted [[H5428]] them out of [[H5921]] their land [[H127]] in anger, [[H639]] and in wrath, [[H2534]] and in great [[H1419]] indignation, [[H7110]] and cast [[H7993]] them into [[H413]] another [[H312]] land, [[H776]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 29
The secret [[H5641]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] our God: [[H430]] but those revealed [[H1540]] unto us and to our children [[H1121]] for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] that may do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law. [[H8451]]
