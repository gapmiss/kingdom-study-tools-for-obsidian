### 1
He that is wounded in the stones, [[H6481]] or hath his privy member [[H8212]] cut off, [[H3772]] shall not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
A bastard [[H4464]] shall not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] even [[H1571]] to his tenth [[H6224]] generation [[H1755]] shall he not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
An Ammonite [[H5984]] or Moabite [[H4125]] shall not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] even [[H1571]] to their tenth [[H6224]] generation [[H1755]] shall they not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord [[H3068]] for [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]]

### 4
Because [[H1697]] they [[H834]] met [[H6923]] you not [[H3808]] with bread [[H3899]] and with water [[H4325]] in the way, [[H1870]] when ye came forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt; [[H4714]] and because [[H834]] they hired [[H7936]] against [[H5921]]  thee [[H853]] Balaam [[H1109]] the son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] of Pethor [[H6604]] of Mesopotamia, [[H763]] to curse [[H7043]] thee. [[H7043]]

### 5
Nevertheless the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] Balaam; [[H1109]] but the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] turned [[H2015]] the curse [[H7045]] into a blessing [[H1293]] unto thee, because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] loved [[H157]] thee. [[H157]]

### 6
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] their peace [[H7965]] nor their prosperity [[H2896]] all [[H3605]] thy days [[H3117]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 7
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] abhor [[H8581]] an Edomite; [[H130]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] thy brother: [[H251]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] abhor [[H8581]] an Egyptian; [[H4713]] because [[H3588]] thou wast [[H1961]] a stranger [[H1616]] in his land. [[H776]]

### 8
The children [[H1121]] that [[H834]] are begotten [[H3205]] of them shall enter [[H935]] into the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in their third [[H7992]] generation. [[H1755]]

### 9
When [[H3588]] the host [[H4264]] goeth forth [[H3318]] against [[H5921]] thine enemies, [[H341]] then keep thee [[H8104]] from every [[H3605]] wicked [[H7451]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 10
If [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] among you any man, [[H376]] that [[H834]] is [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] clean [[H2889]] by reason of uncleanness that chanceth [[H7137]] him by night, [[H3915]] then shall he go [[H3318]] abroad [[H2351]] out of [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] he shall not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] within [[H8432]] the camp: [[H4264]]

### 11
But it shall be, [[H1961]] when evening [[H6153]] cometh on, [[H6437]] he shall wash [[H7364]] with water: [[H4325]] and when the sun [[H8121]] is down, [[H935]] he shall come [[H935]] into [[H8432]] the camp [[H4264]]

### 12
Thou shalt have [[H1961]] a place also [[H3027]] without [[H2351]] the camp, [[H4264]] whither [[H8033]] thou shalt go forth [[H3318]] abroad: [[H2351]]

### 13
And thou shalt have [[H1961]] a paddle [[H3489]] upon [[H5921]] thy weapon; [[H240]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] when thou wilt ease [[H3427]] thyself abroad, [[H2351]] thou shalt dig [[H2658]] therewith, and shalt turn back [[H7725]] and cover [[H3680]] that which cometh [[H6627]] from thee: [[H6627]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] walketh [[H1980]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thy camp, [[H4264]] to deliver [[H5337]] thee, and to give up [[H5414]] thine enemies [[H341]] before [[H6440]] thee; therefore shall thy camp [[H4264]] be [[H1961]] holy: [[H6918]] that he see [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] unclean [[H6172]] thing [[H1697]] in thee, and turn away [[H7725]] from thee. [[H310]]

### 15
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5462]] unto [[H413]] his master [[H113]] the servant [[H5650]] which [[H834]] is escaped [[H5337]] from [[H5973]] his master [[H113]] unto [[H413]] thee: [[H413]]

### 16
He shall dwell [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] thee, among [[H7130]] you, in that place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] he shall choose [[H977]] in one [[H259]] of thy gates, [[H8179]] where it liketh him best: [[H2896]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] oppress [[H3238]] him. [[H3238]]

### 17
There shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] whore [[H6948]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Israel, [[H3478]] nor [[H3808]] a sodomite [[H6945]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 18
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] the hire [[H868]] of a whore, [[H2181]] or the price [[H4242]] of a dog, [[H3611]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] for any [[H3605]] vow: [[H5088]] for [[H3588]] even [[H1571]] both [[H8147]] these abomination [[H8441]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 19
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] lend upon usury [[H5391]] to thy brother; [[H251]] usury [[H5392]] of money, [[H3701]] usury [[H5392]] of victuals, [[H400]] usury [[H5392]] of any [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] is lent upon usury: [[H5391]]

### 20
Unto a stranger [[H5237]] thou mayest lend upon usury; [[H5391]] but unto thy brother [[H251]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] lend upon usury: [[H5391]] that [[H4616]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] may bless [[H1288]] thee in all [[H3605]] that thou settest [[H4916]] thine hand [[H3027]] to in [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 21
When [[H3588]] thou shalt vow [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] slack [[H309]] to pay [[H7999]] it: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will surely [[H1875]] require [[H1875]] it of [[H5973]] thee; and it would be [[H1961]] sin [[H2399]] in thee. [[H2399]]

### 22
But if [[H3588]] thou shalt forbear [[H2308]] to vow, [[H5087]] it shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sin [[H2399]] in thee. [[H2399]]

### 23
That which is gone out [[H4161]] of thy lips [[H8193]] thou shalt keep [[H8104]] and perform; [[H6213]] a freewill offering, [[H5071]] according as [[H834]] thou hast vowed [[H5087]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] thou hast promised [[H1696]] with thy mouth. [[H6310]]

### 24
When [[H3588]] thou comest [[H935]] into thy neighbour's [[H7453]] vineyard, [[H3754]] then thou mayest eat [[H398]] grapes [[H6025]] thy fill [[H7648]] at thine own pleasure; [[H5315]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] put [[H5414]] in [[H413]] thy vessel. [[H3627]]

### 25
When [[H3588]] thou comest [[H935]] into the standing corn [[H7054]] of thy neighbour, [[H7453]] then thou mayest pluck [[H6998]] the ears [[H4425]] with thine hand; [[H3027]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] move [[H5130]] a sickle [[H2770]] unto [[H5921]] thy neighbour's [[H7453]] standing corn.
