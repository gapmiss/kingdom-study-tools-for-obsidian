### 1
Now [[H6258]] therefore hearken, [[H8085]] O Israel, [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] the statutes [[H2706]] and unto [[H413]] the judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] teach [[H3925]] you, for to do [[H6213]] that [[H4616]] ye may live, [[H2421]] and go in [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers [[H1]] giveth [[H5414]] you. [[H5414]]

### 2
Ye shall not [[H3808]] add [[H3254]] unto [[H5921]] the word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you, neither [[H3808]] shall ye diminish [[H1639]] from [[H4480]] it, that ye may keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you. [[H6680]]

### 3
Your eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] what [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] because of Baal-peor: [[H1187]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] followed [[H310]] Baal-peor, [[H1187]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath destroyed [[H8045]] them from among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 4
But ye [[H859]] that did cleave [[H1695]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] alive [[H2416]] every one [[H3605]] of you this day. [[H3117]]

### 5
Behold, [[H7200]] I have taught [[H3925]] you statutes [[H2706]] and judgments, [[H4941]] even as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] me, that ye should do [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] in [[H7130]] the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 6
Keep [[H8104]] therefore and do [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] your wisdom [[H2451]] and your understanding [[H998]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the nations, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] shall hear [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] statutes, [[H2706]] and say, [[H559]] Surely [[H7535]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] nation [[H1471]] a wise [[H2450]] and understanding [[H995]] people. [[H5971]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] what [[H4310]] nation [[H1471]] great, [[H1419]] who [[H834]] God [[H430]] nigh [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] them, as the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] in all [[H3605]] we call [[H7121]] upon [[H413]] him [[H413]]

### 8
And what [[H4310]] nation [[H1471]] great, [[H1419]] that [[H834]] hath statutes [[H2706]] and judgments [[H4941]] righteous [[H6662]] as all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] law, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you this day? [[H3117]]

### 9
Only [[H7535]] take heed [[H8104]] to thyself, and keep [[H8104]] thy soul [[H5315]] diligently, [[H3966]] lest [[H6435]] thou forget [[H7911]] the things [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thine eyes [[H5869]] have seen, [[H7200]] and lest [[H6435]] they depart [[H5493]] from thy heart [[H3824]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of thy life: [[H2416]] but teach [[H3045]] them thy sons, [[H1121]] and thy sons' [[H1121]] sons; [[H1121]]

### 10
the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] thou stoodest [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] in Horeb, [[H2722]] when the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Gather together, [[H6950]] me the people [[H5971]] and I will make them hear [[H8085]] my words, [[H1697]] that [[H834]] they may learn [[H3925]] to fear [[H3372]] me all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] they [[H1992]] shall live [[H2416]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H127]] and they may teach [[H3925]] their children. [[H1121]]

### 11
And ye came near [[H7126]] and stood [[H5975]] under [[H8478]] the mountain; [[H2022]] and the mountain [[H2022]] burned [[H1197]] with fire [[H784]] unto [[H5704]] the midst [[H3820]] of heaven, [[H8064]] with darkness, [[H6205]] clouds, [[H6051]] and thick darkness. [[H2822]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire: [[H784]] ye [[H859]] heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the words, [[H1697]] but saw [[H7200]] no [[H369]] similitude; [[H8544]] only [[H2108]] a voice. [[H6963]]

### 13
And he declared [[H5046]]  unto you [[H853]] his covenant, [[H1285]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] you to perform, [[H6213]] ten [[H6235]] commandments; [[H1697]] and he wrote [[H3789]] them upon [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone. [[H68]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] me at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] to teach [[H3925]] you statutes [[H2706]] and judgments, [[H4941]] that ye might do [[H6213]] them in the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go over [[H5674]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 15
Take ye therefore good [[H3966]] heed [[H8104]] unto yourselves; [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] ye saw [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] manner [[H3605]] of similitude [[H8544]] on the day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you in Horeb [[H2722]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire: [[H784]]

### 16
Lest [[H6435]] ye corrupt [[H7843]] and make [[H6213]] you a graven image, [[H6459]] the similitude [[H8544]] of any [[H3605]] figure, [[H5566]] the likeness [[H8403]] of male [[H2145]] or [[H176]] female, [[H5347]]

### 17
The likeness [[H8403]] of any [[H3605]] beast [[H929]] that [[H834]] on the earth, [[H776]] the likeness [[H8403]] of any [[H3605]] winged [[H3671]] fowl [[H6833]] that [[H834]] flieth [[H5774]] in the air, [[H8064]]

### 18
The likeness [[H8403]] of any thing [[H3605]] that creepeth [[H7430]] on the ground, [[H127]] the likeness [[H8403]] of any [[H3605]] fish [[H1710]] that [[H834]] in the waters [[H4325]] beneath [[H8478]] the earth: [[H776]]

### 19
And lest [[H6435]] thou lift up [[H5375]] thine eyes [[H5869]] unto heaven, [[H8064]] and when thou seest [[H7200]] the sun, [[H8121]] and the moon, [[H3394]] and the stars, [[H3556]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven, [[H8064]] shouldest be driven [[H5080]] to worship [[H7812]] them, and serve [[H5647]] them, which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath divided [[H2505]] unto all [[H3605]] nations [[H5971]] under [[H8478]] the whole [[H3605]] heaven. [[H8064]]

### 20
But the Lord [[H3068]] hath taken [[H3947]] you, and brought you forth [[H3318]] out of the iron [[H1270]] furnace, [[H3564]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] to be [[H1961]] unto him a people [[H5971]] of inheritance, [[H5159]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 21
Furthermore the Lord [[H3068]] was angry [[H599]] with me for your sakes, [[H1697]] and sware [[H7650]] that I should not [[H1115]] go over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and that I should not [[H1115]] go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] that good [[H2896]] land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee an inheritance: [[H5159]]

### 22
But [[H3588]] I [[H595]] must die [[H4191]] in this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] I must not [[H369]] go over [[H5674]] Jordan: [[H3383]] but ye [[H859]] shall go over, [[H5674]] and possess [[H3423]] that [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land. [[H776]]

### 23
Take heed [[H8104]] unto yourselves, lest [[H6435]] ye forget [[H7911]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] he made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] you, and make [[H6213]] you a graven image, [[H6459]] the likeness [[H8544]] of any [[H3605]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath forbidden [[H6680]] thee. [[H6680]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] a consuming [[H398]] fire, [[H784]] a jealous [[H7067]] God. [[H410]]

### 25
When [[H3588]] thou shalt beget [[H3205]] children, [[H1121]] and children's [[H1121]] children, [[H1121]] and ye shall have remained long [[H3462]] in the land, [[H776]] and shall corrupt [[H7843]] and make [[H6213]] a graven image, [[H6459]] the likeness [[H8544]] of any [[H3605]] and shall do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to provoke him to anger: [[H3707]]

### 26
I call [[H853]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] to witness [[H5749]] against you this day, [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] ye shall soon [[H4118]] utterly [[H6]] perish [[H6]] from off [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] whereunto [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] to possess [[H3423]] it; ye shall not [[H3808]] prolong [[H748]] days [[H3117]] upon [[H5921]] it, but [[H3588]] shall utterly [[H8045]] be destroyed. [[H8045]]

### 27
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall scatter [[H6327]] you among the nations, [[H5971]] and ye shall be left [[H7604]] few [[H4962]] in number [[H4557]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall lead [[H5090]] you. [[H5090]]

### 28
And there [[H8033]] ye shall serve [[H5647]] gods, [[H430]] the work [[H4639]] of men's [[H120]] hands, [[H3027]] wood [[H6086]] and stone, [[H68]] which [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] nor [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] nor [[H3808]] eat, [[H398]] nor [[H3808]] smell. [[H7306]]

### 29
But if from thence [[H8033]] thou shalt seek [[H1245]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] thou shalt find [[H4672]] if [[H3588]] thou seek [[H1875]] him with all [[H3605]] thy heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 30
When thou art in tribulation, [[H6862]] and all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] are come [[H4672]] upon thee, in the latter [[H319]] days, [[H3117]] if thou turn [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and shalt be obedient [[H8085]] unto his voice; [[H6963]]

### 31
(For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] a merciful [[H7349]] God;) [[H410]] he will not [[H3808]] forsake [[H7503]] thee, neither [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] thee, nor [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] the covenant [[H1285]] of thy fathers [[H1]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto them. [[H7650]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] ask [[H7592]] now [[H4994]] of the days [[H3117]] that are past, [[H7223]] which [[H834]] were [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] thee, since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] created [[H1254]] man [[H120]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and from the one side [[H7097]] of heaven [[H8064]] unto [[H5704]] the other, [[H7097]] whether there hath been [[H1961]] as this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] thing [[H1697]] or [[H176]] hath been heard [[H8085]] like it? [[H3644]]

### 33
Did people [[H5971]] hear [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of God [[H430]] speaking out [[H1696]] of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire, [[H784]] as [[H834]] thou [[H859]] hast heard, [[H8085]] and live? [[H2421]]

### 34
Or [[H176]] hath God [[H430]] assayed [[H5254]] to go [[H935]] take [[H3947]] him a nation [[H1471]] from the midst [[H7130]] of nation, [[H1471]] by temptations, [[H4531]] by signs, [[H226]] and by wonders, [[H4159]] and by war, [[H4421]] and by a mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and by a stretched out [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] and by great [[H1419]] terrors, [[H4172]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] did [[H6213]] for you in Egypt [[H4714]] before your eyes? [[H5869]]

### 35
Unto thee [[H859]] it was shewed, [[H7200]] that thou mightest know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] God; [[H430]] none [[H369]] else [[H5750]] beside [[H905]] him. [[H905]]

### 36
Out of [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] he made thee to hear [[H8085]] his voice, [[H6963]] that he might instruct [[H3256]] thee: and upon [[H5921]] earth [[H776]] he shewed [[H7200]]  thee [[H853]] his great [[H1419]] fire; [[H784]] and thou heardest [[H8085]] his words [[H1697]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire. [[H784]]

### 37
And because [[H8478]] he loved [[H157]] thy fathers, [[H1]] therefore he chose [[H977]] their seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] them, and brought thee out [[H3318]] in his sight [[H6440]] with his mighty [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] out of Egypt; [[H4714]]

### 38
To drive out [[H3423]] nations [[H1471]] from before [[H6440]] thee greater [[H1419]] and mightier [[H6099]] than [[H4480]] thou to bring [[H935]] thee in, to give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] their land [[H776]] an inheritance, [[H5159]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 39
Know [[H3045]] therefore this day, [[H3117]] and consider [[H7725]] in [[H413]] thine heart, [[H3824]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] God [[H430]] in heaven [[H8064]] above, [[H4605]] and upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] beneath: [[H8478]] none [[H369]] else. [[H5750]]

### 40
Thou shalt keep [[H8104]]  therefore [[H853]] his statutes, [[H2706]] and his commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] that [[H834]] it may go well [[H3190]] with thee, and with thy children [[H1121]] after [[H310]] thee, and that [[H4616]] thou mayest prolong [[H748]] days [[H3117]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee, for ever. [[H3605]]

### 41
Then [[H227]] Moses [[H4872]] severed [[H914]] three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] toward the sunrising; [[H8121]]

### 42
That the slayer [[H7523]] might flee [[H5127]] thither, [[H8033]] which [[H834]] should kill [[H7523]] his neighbour [[H7453]] unawares, [[H1097]] and hated [[H8130]] him not [[H3808]] in times [[H8543]] past; [[H8032]] and that fleeing [[H5127]] unto [[H413]] one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] these [[H411]] cities [[H5892]] he might live: [[H2425]]

### 43
Bezer [[H1221]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] in the plain [[H4334]] country, [[H776]] of the Reubenites; [[H7206]] and Ramoth [[H7216]] in Gilead, [[H1568]] of the Gadites; [[H1425]] and Golan [[H1474]] in Bashan, [[H1316]] of the Manassites. [[H4520]]

### 44
And this [[H2063]] the law [[H8451]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] set [[H7760]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 45
These [[H428]] the testimonies, [[H5713]] and the statutes, [[H2706]] and the judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] after they came forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]]

### 46
On this side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] in the valley [[H1516]] over against [[H4136]] Beth-peor, [[H1047]] in the land [[H776]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who [[H834]] dwelt [[H3427]] at Heshbon, [[H2809]] whom [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] smote, [[H5221]] after they were come forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 47
And they possessed [[H3423]] his land, [[H776]] and the land [[H776]] of Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which [[H834]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] toward the sunrising; [[H4217]]

### 48
From Aroer, [[H6177]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] of the river [[H5158]] Arnon, [[H769]] even unto [[H5704]] mount [[H2022]] Sion, [[H7865]] which [[H1931]] Hermon, [[H2768]]

### 49
And all [[H3605]] the plain [[H6160]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] eastward, [[H4217]] even unto [[H5704]] the sea [[H3220]] of the plain, [[H6160]] under [[H8478]] the springs [[H794]] of Pisgah. [[H6449]]
