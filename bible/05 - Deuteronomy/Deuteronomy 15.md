### 1
At the end [[H7093]] of seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] thou shalt make [[H6213]] a release. [[H8059]]

### 2
And this [[H2088]] the manner [[H1697]] of the release: [[H8059]] Every [[H3605]] creditor [[H4874]] that [[H834]] lendeth [[H5383]] unto his neighbour [[H7453]] shall release [[H8058]] he shall not [[H3808]] exact [[H5065]] of his neighbour, [[H7453]] or of his brother; [[H251]] because [[H3588]] it is called [[H7121]] the Lord's [[H3068]] release. [[H8059]]

### 3
Of [[H853]] a foreigner [[H5237]] thou mayest exact [[H5065]] but which [[H834]] is [[H1961]] thine with [[H854]] thy brother [[H251]] thine hand [[H3027]] shall release; [[H8058]]

### 4
Save [[H657]] when [[H3588]] there shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] poor [[H34]] among you; for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall greatly [[H1288]] bless [[H1288]] thee in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee an inheritance [[H5159]] to possess [[H3423]] it: [[H3423]]

### 5
Only [[H7535]] if [[H518]] thou carefully [[H8085]] hearken [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2063]] commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day. [[H3117]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] blesseth [[H1288]] thee, as [[H834]] he promised [[H1696]] thee: and thou shalt lend [[H5670]] unto many [[H7227]] nations, [[H1471]] but thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] borrow; [[H5670]] and thou shalt reign [[H4910]] over many [[H7227]] nations, [[H1471]] but they shall not [[H3808]] reign [[H4910]] over thee. [[H4910]]

### 7
If [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] among you a poor man [[H34]] of one [[H259]] of thy brethren [[H251]] within any [[H259]] of thy gates [[H8179]] in thy land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee, thou shalt not [[H3808]] harden [[H553]] thine heart, [[H3824]] nor [[H3808]] shut [[H7092]] thine hand [[H3027]] from thy poor [[H34]] brother: [[H251]]

### 8
But [[H3588]] thou shalt open [[H6605]] thine hand [[H3027]] wide [[H6605]] unto him, and shalt surely [[H5670]] lend [[H5670]] him sufficient [[H1767]] for his need, [[H4270]] which [[H834]] he wanteth. [[H2637]]

### 9
Beware [[H8104]] that [[H6435]] there be [[H1961]] not a thought [[H1697]] in [[H5973]] thy wicked [[H1100]] heart, [[H3824]] saying, [[H559]] The seventh [[H7651]] year, [[H8141]] the year [[H8141]] of release, [[H8059]] is at hand; [[H7126]] and thine eye [[H5869]] be evil [[H7489]] against thy poor [[H34]] brother, [[H251]] and thou givest [[H5414]] him nought; [[H3808]] and he cry [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] against [[H5921]] thee, and it be [[H1961]] sin [[H2399]] unto thee. [[H2399]]

### 10
Thou shalt surely [[H5414]] give [[H5414]] him, and thine heart [[H3824]] shall not [[H3808]] be grieved [[H7489]] when thou givest [[H5414]] unto him: because [[H1558]] that [[H3588]] for this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall bless [[H1288]] thee in all [[H3605]] thy works, [[H4639]] and in all [[H3605]] that thou puttest [[H4916]] thine hand [[H3027]] unto. [[H3027]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the poor [[H34]] shall never [[H3808]] cease [[H2308]] out of [[H7130]] the land: [[H776]] therefore [[H5921]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Thou shalt open [[H6605]] thine hand [[H3027]] wide [[H6605]] unto thy brother, [[H251]] to thy poor, [[H6041]] and to thy needy, [[H34]] in thy land. [[H776]]

### 12
if [[H3588]] thy brother, [[H251]] an Hebrew man, [[H5680]] or [[H176]] an Hebrew woman, [[H5680]] be sold [[H4376]] unto thee, and serve [[H5647]] thee six [[H8337]] years; [[H8141]] then in the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] thou shalt let him go [[H7971]] free [[H2670]] from [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 13
And when [[H3588]] thou sendest [[H7971]] him out free [[H2670]] from [[H5973]] thee, thou shalt not [[H3808]] let him go away [[H7971]] empty: [[H7387]]

### 14
Thou shalt furnish [[H6059]] him liberally [[H6059]] out of thy flock, [[H6629]] and out of thy floor, [[H1637]] and out of thy winepress: [[H3342]] wherewith [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath blessed [[H1288]] thee thou shalt give [[H5414]] unto him. [[H5414]]

### 15
And thou shalt remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] thou wast [[H1961]] a bondman [[H5650]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] redeemed [[H6299]] thee: therefore [[H5921]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]]  thee [[H853]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] to day. [[H3117]]

### 16
And it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H3588]] he say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, I will not [[H3808]] go away [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] thee; because [[H3588]] he loveth [[H157]] thee and thine house, [[H1004]] because [[H3588]] he is well [[H2895]] with [[H5973]] thee; [[H5973]]

### 17
Then thou shalt take [[H3947]] an aul, [[H4836]] and thrust [[H5414]] through his ear [[H241]] unto the door, [[H1817]] and he shall be [[H1961]] thy servant [[H5650]] for ever. [[H5769]] And also [[H637]] unto thy maidservant [[H519]] thou shalt do [[H6213]] likewise. [[H3651]]

### 18
It shall not [[H3808]] seem hard [[H7185]] unto thee, [[H5869]] when thou sendest him away [[H7971]] free [[H2670]] from [[H5973]] thee; for [[H3588]] he hath been worth [[H7939]] a double [[H4932]] hired servant [[H7916]] in serving [[H5647]] thee six [[H8337]] years: [[H8141]] and the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall bless [[H1288]] thee in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou doest. [[H6213]]

### 19
All [[H3605]] the firstling [[H1060]] males [[H2145]] that [[H834]] come [[H3205]] of thy herd [[H1241]] and of thy flock [[H6629]] thou shalt sanctify [[H6942]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]] thou shalt do no [[H3808]] work [[H5647]] with the firstling [[H1060]] of thy bullock, [[H7794]] nor [[H3808]] shear [[H1494]] the firstling [[H1060]] of thy sheep. [[H6629]]

### 20
Thou shalt eat [[H398]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] year [[H8141]] by year [[H8141]] in the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall choose, [[H977]] thou [[H859]] and thy household. [[H1004]]

### 21
And if [[H3588]] there be [[H1961]] blemish [[H3971]] therein, lame, [[H6455]] or [[H176]] blind, [[H5787]] any [[H3605]] ill [[H7451]] blemish, [[H3971]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] sacrifice [[H2076]] it unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 22
Thou shalt eat [[H398]] it within thy gates: [[H8179]] the unclean [[H2931]] and the clean [[H2889]] alike, [[H3162]] as the roebuck, [[H6643]] and as the hart. [[H354]]

### 23
Only [[H7535]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the blood [[H1818]] thereof; thou shalt pour [[H8210]] it upon [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] as water. [[H4325]]
