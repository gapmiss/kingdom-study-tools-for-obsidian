### 1
The priests [[H3548]] the Levites, [[H3881]] all [[H3605]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Levi, [[H3878]] shall have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] part [[H2506]] nor inheritance [[H5159]] with [[H5973]] Israel: [[H3478]] they shall eat [[H398]] the offerings [[H801]] of the Lord [[H3068]] made by fire, and his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 2
Therefore shall they have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H7130]] their brethren: [[H251]] the Lord [[H3068]] their inheritance, [[H5159]] as [[H834]] he hath said [[H1696]] unto them. [[H1696]]

### 3
And this [[H2088]] shall be [[H1961]] the priest's [[H3548]] due [[H4941]] from [[H853]] the people, [[H5971]] from [[H853]] them that offer [[H2076]] a sacrifice, [[H2077]] whether [[H518]] ox [[H7794]] or [[H518]] sheep; [[H7716]] and they shall give [[H5414]] unto the priest [[H3548]] the shoulder, [[H2220]] and the two cheeks, [[H3895]] and the maw. [[H6896]]

### 4
The firstfruit [[H7225]] of thy corn, [[H1715]] of thy wine, [[H8492]] and of thine oil, [[H3323]] and the first [[H7225]] of the fleece [[H1488]] of thy sheep, [[H6629]] shalt thou give [[H5414]] him. [[H5414]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath chosen [[H977]] him out of all [[H3605]] thy tribes, [[H7626]] to stand [[H5975]] to minister [[H8334]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] him [[H1931]] and his sons [[H1121]] for ever. [[H3117]]

### 6
And if [[H3588]] a Levite [[H3881]] come [[H935]] from any [[H259]] of thy gates [[H8179]] out of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] where [[H834]] he [[H1931]] sojourned, [[H1481]] and come [[H935]] with all [[H3605]] the desire [[H185]] of his mind [[H5315]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall choose; [[H977]]

### 7
Then he shall minister [[H8334]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] as all [[H3605]] his brethren [[H251]] the Levites [[H3881]] which stand [[H5975]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
They shall have like portions [[H2506]] to eat, [[H398]] beside [[H905]] that which cometh of the sale [[H4465]] of [[H5921]] his patrimony. [[H1]]

### 9
When [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] art come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee, thou shalt not [[H3808]] learn [[H3925]] to do [[H6213]] after the abominations [[H8441]] of those [[H1992]] nations. [[H1471]]

### 10
There shall not [[H3808]] be found [[H4672]] among you that maketh his son [[H1121]] or his daughter [[H1323]] to pass through [[H5674]] the fire, [[H784]] that useth [[H7080]] divination, [[H7081]] an observer of times, [[H6049]] or an enchanter, [[H5172]] or a witch, [[H3784]]

### 11
Or a charmer, [[H2266]] or a consulter [[H7592]] with familiar spirits, [[H178]] or a wizard, [[H3049]] or a necromancer. [[H1875]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] that do [[H6213]] these things [[H428]] an abomination [[H8441]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] and because [[H1558]] of these [[H428]] abominations [[H8441]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] doth drive them out [[H3423]] from before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 13
Thou shalt be [[H1961]] perfect [[H8549]] with [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] these [[H428]] nations, [[H1471]] which [[H834]] thou [[H859]] shalt possess, [[H3423]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] observers of times, [[H6049]] and unto [[H413]] diviners: [[H7080]] but as for thee, [[H859]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath not [[H3808]] suffered [[H5414]] thee so [[H3651]]

### 15
The Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will raise up [[H6965]] unto thee a Prophet [[H5030]] from the midst [[H7130]] of thee, of thy brethren, [[H251]] like unto me; [[H3644]] unto [[H413]] him ye shall hearken; [[H8085]]

### 16
According to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou desiredst [[H7592]] of [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] in Horeb [[H2722]] in the day [[H3117]] of the assembly, [[H6951]] saying, [[H559]] Let me not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] again [[H3254]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] neither [[H3808]] let me see [[H7200]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] fire [[H784]] any more, [[H5750]] that I die [[H4191]] not. [[H3808]]

### 17
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, They have well [[H3190]] which [[H834]] they have spoken. [[H1696]]

### 18
I will raise them up [[H6965]] a Prophet [[H5030]] from among [[H7130]] their brethren, [[H251]] like unto thee, [[H3644]] and will put [[H5414]] my words [[H1697]] in his mouth; [[H6310]] and he shall speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]]  them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I shall command [[H6680]] him. [[H6680]]

### 19
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] whosoever [[H376]] will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] my words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] he shall speak [[H1696]] in my name, [[H8034]] I [[H595]] will require [[H1875]] of [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 20
But [[H389]] the prophet, [[H5030]] which [[H834]] shall presume [[H2102]] to speak [[H1696]] a word [[H1697]] in my name, [[H8034]] which [[H834]] I have not [[H3808]] commanded [[H6680]] him to speak, [[H1696]] or that [[H834]] shall speak [[H1696]] in the name [[H8034]] of other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] even that [[H1931]] prophet [[H5030]] shall die. [[H4191]]

### 21
And if [[H3588]] thou say [[H559]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] How [[H349]] shall we know [[H3045]] the word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] spoken? [[H1696]]

### 22
When [[H834]] a prophet [[H5030]] speaketh [[H1696]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] if the thing [[H1697]] follow [[H1961]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] come to pass, [[H935]] that [[H1931]] the thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] spoken, [[H1696]] the prophet [[H5030]] hath spoken [[H1696]] it presumptuously: [[H2087]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H1481]] of [[H4480]] him.
