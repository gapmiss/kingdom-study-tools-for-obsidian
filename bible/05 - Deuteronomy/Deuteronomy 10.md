### 1
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Hew [[H6458]] thee two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone [[H68]] like unto the first, [[H7223]] and come up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] me into the mount, [[H2022]] and make [[H6213]] thee an ark [[H727]] of wood. [[H6086]]

### 2
And I will write [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] the tables [[H3871]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] in [[H5921]] the first [[H7223]] tables [[H3871]] which [[H834]] thou brakest, [[H7665]] and thou shalt put [[H7760]] them in the ark. [[H727]]

### 3
And I made [[H6213]] an ark [[H727]] shittim [[H7848]] wood, [[H6086]] and hewed [[H6458]] two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone [[H68]] like unto the first, [[H7223]] and went up [[H5927]] into the mount, [[H2022]] having the two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] in mine hand. [[H3027]]

### 4
And he wrote [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] the tables, [[H3871]] according to the first [[H7223]] writing, [[H4385]] the ten [[H6235]] commandments, [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you in the mount [[H2022]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire [[H784]] in the day [[H3117]] of the assembly: [[H6951]] and the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] them unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 5
And I turned myself [[H6437]] and came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mount, [[H2022]] and put [[H7760]] the tables [[H3871]] in the ark [[H727]] which [[H834]] I had made; [[H6213]] and there [[H8033]] they be, [[H1961]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] me. [[H6680]]

### 6
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] took their journey [[H5265]] from Beeroth [[H881]] of the children [[H1121]] of Jaakan [[H885]] to Mosera: [[H4149]] there [[H8033]] Aaron [[H175]] died, [[H4191]] and there [[H8033]] he was buried; [[H6912]] and Eleazar [[H499]] his son [[H1121]] ministered in the priest's office [[H3547]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 7
From thence [[H8033]] they journeyed [[H5265]] unto Gudgodah; [[H1412]] and from [[H4480]] Gudgodah [[H1412]] to Jotbath, [[H3193]] a land [[H776]] of rivers [[H5158]] of waters. [[H4325]]

### 8
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the Lord [[H3068]] separated [[H914]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Levi, [[H3878]] to bear [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] to minister [[H8334]] unto him, and to bless [[H1288]] in his name, [[H8034]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 9
Wherefore [[H5921]] Levi [[H3878]] hath [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] part [[H2506]] nor inheritance [[H5159]] with [[H5973]] his brethren; [[H251]] the Lord [[H3068]] his inheritance, [[H5159]] according [[H834]] as the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] promised [[H1696]] him. [[H1696]]

### 10
And I [[H595]] stayed [[H5975]] in the mount, [[H2022]] according to the first [[H7223]] time, [[H3117]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights; [[H3915]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me at that [[H1931]] time [[H6471]] also, [[H1571]] the Lord [[H3068]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] thee. [[H7843]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Arise, [[H6965]] take [[H1980]] journey [[H4550]] before [[H6440]] the people, [[H5971]] that they may go in [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto their fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] unto them. [[H5414]]

### 12
And now, [[H6258]] Israel, [[H3478]] what [[H4100]] doth the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] require [[H7592]] of [[H5973]] thee, but [[H3588]] to fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] and to love [[H157]] him, and to serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] thy heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] thy soul, [[H5315]]

### 13
To keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and his statutes, [[H2708]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day [[H3117]] for thy good? [[H2896]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2005]] the heaven [[H8064]] and the heaven [[H8064]] of heavens [[H8064]] the Lord's [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] the earth [[H776]] with all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein [[H834]]

### 15
Only [[H7535]] the Lord [[H3068]] had a delight [[H2836]] in thy fathers [[H1]] to love [[H157]] them, and he chose [[H977]] their seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] them, you above all [[H3605]] people, [[H5971]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 16
Circumcise [[H4135]]  therefore [[H853]] the foreskin [[H6190]] of your heart, [[H3824]] and be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] stiffnecked. [[H6203]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] God [[H430]] of gods, [[H430]] and Lord [[H113]] of lords, [[H113]] a great [[H1419]] God, [[H410]] a mighty, [[H1368]] and a terrible, [[H3372]] which [[H834]] regardeth [[H5375]] not [[H3808]] persons, [[H6440]] nor [[H3808]] taketh [[H3947]] reward: [[H7810]]

### 18
He doth execute [[H6213]] the judgment [[H4941]] of the fatherless [[H3490]] and widow, [[H490]] and loveth [[H157]] the stranger, [[H1616]] in giving [[H5414]] him food [[H3899]] and raiment. [[H8071]]

### 19
Love [[H157]]  ye therefore [[H853]] the stranger: [[H1616]] for [[H3588]] ye were [[H1961]] strangers [[H1616]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 20
Thou shalt fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God; [[H430]] him shalt thou serve, [[H5647]] and to him shalt thou cleave, [[H1692]] and swear [[H7650]] by his name. [[H8034]]

### 21
He [[H1931]] thy praise, [[H8416]] and he [[H1931]] thy God, [[H430]] that [[H834]] hath done [[H6213]] for [[H853]]  thee [[H853]] these [[H428]] great [[H1419]] and terrible things, [[H3372]] which [[H834]] thine eyes [[H5869]] have seen. [[H7200]]

### 22
Thy fathers [[H1]] went down [[H3381]] into Egypt [[H4714]] with threescore and ten [[H7657]] persons; [[H5315]] and now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath made [[H7760]] thee as the stars [[H3556]] of heaven [[H8064]] for multitude. [[H7230]]
