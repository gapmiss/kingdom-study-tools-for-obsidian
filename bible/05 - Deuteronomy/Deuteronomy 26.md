And it shall be, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] thou come in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee an inheritance, [[H5159]] and possessest [[H3423]] it, and dwellest [[H3427]] therein; [[H3427]]

That thou shalt take [[H3947]] of the first [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] the fruit [[H6529]] of the earth, [[H127]] which [[H834]] thou shalt bring [[H935]] of thy land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee, and shalt put [[H7760]] in a basket, [[H2935]] and shalt go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall choose [[H977]] to place [[H7931]] his name [[H8034]] there. [[H8033]]

### 3
And thou shalt go [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] that [[H834]] shall be [[H1961]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I profess [[H5046]] this day [[H3117]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] that [[H3588]] I am come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the country [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto our fathers [[H1]] for to give [[H5414]] us. [[H5414]]

### 5
And thou shalt speak [[H6030]] and say [[H559]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] A Syrian [[H761]] ready to perish [[H6]] my father, [[H1]] and he went down [[H3381]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] and sojourned [[H1481]] there [[H8033]] with [[H4962]] a few, [[H4592]] and became [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] a nation, [[H1471]] great, [[H1419]] mighty, [[H6099]] and populous: [[H7227]]

### 6
And the Egyptians [[H4713]] evil entreated [[H7489]] us, and afflicted [[H6031]] us, and laid [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] us hard [[H7186]] bondage: [[H5656]]

### 7
And when we cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of our fathers, [[H1]] the Lord [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] our voice, [[H6963]] and looked on [[H7200]] our affliction, [[H6040]] and our labour, [[H5999]] and our oppression: [[H3906]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] brought us forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and with an outstretched [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] and with great [[H1419]] terribleness, [[H4172]] and with signs, [[H226]] and with wonders: [[H4159]]

### 9
And he hath brought [[H935]] us into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and hath given [[H5414]]  us [[H853]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

### 10
And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] I have brought [[H935]] the firstfruits [[H6529]] of the land, [[H127]] which [[H834]] thou, O Lord, [[H3068]] hast given [[H5414]] me. And thou shalt set [[H3240]] it before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]]

### 11
And thou shalt rejoice [[H8056]] in every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] unto thee, and unto thine house, [[H1004]] thou, [[H859]] and the Levite, [[H3881]] and the stranger [[H1616]] that [[H834]] among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 12
When [[H3588]] thou hast made an end [[H3615]] of tithing [[H6237]] all [[H3605]] the tithes [[H4643]] of thine increase [[H8393]] the third [[H7992]] year, [[H8141]] the year [[H8141]] of tithing, [[H4643]] and hast given [[H5414]] unto the Levite, [[H3881]] the stranger, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow, [[H490]] that they may eat [[H398]] within thy gates, [[H8179]] and be filled; [[H7646]]

### 13
Then thou shalt say [[H559]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] I have brought away [[H1197]] the hallowed things [[H6944]] out of [[H4480]] house, [[H1004]] and also [[H1571]] have given [[H5414]] them unto the Levite, [[H3881]] and unto the stranger, [[H1616]] to the fatherless, [[H3490]] and to the widow, [[H490]] according to all [[H3605]] thy commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] thou hast commanded [[H6680]] me: I have not [[H3808]] transgressed [[H5674]] thy commandments, [[H4687]] neither [[H3808]] have I forgotten [[H7911]]

### 14
I have not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] thereof [[H4480]] in my mourning, [[H205]] neither [[H3808]] have I taken away [[H1197]] thereof [[H4480]] for unclean [[H2931]] nor [[H3808]] given [[H5414]] thereof [[H4480]] for the dead: [[H4191]] I have hearkened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] have done [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast commanded [[H6680]] me. [[H6680]]

### 15
Look down [[H8259]] from thy holy [[H6944]] habitation, [[H4583]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and bless [[H1288]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] thou hast given [[H5414]] us, as [[H834]] thou swarest [[H7650]] unto our fathers, [[H1]] a land [[H776]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

### 16
This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath commanded [[H6680]] thee to do [[H6213]] these [[H428]] statutes [[H2706]] and judgments: [[H4941]] thou shalt therefore keep [[H8104]] and do [[H6213]] them with all [[H3605]] thine heart, [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 17
Thou hast avouched [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] this day [[H3117]] to be [[H1961]] thy God, [[H430]] and to walk [[H1980]] in his ways, [[H1870]] and to keep [[H8104]] his statutes, [[H2706]] and his commandments, [[H4687]] and his judgments, [[H4941]] and to hearken [[H8085]] unto his voice: [[H6963]]

### 18
And the Lord [[H3068]] hath avouched [[H559]] thee this day [[H3117]] to be [[H1961]] his peculiar [[H5459]] people, [[H5971]] as [[H834]] he hath promised [[H1696]] thee, and that shouldest keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] his commandments; [[H4687]]

### 19
And to make [[H5414]] thee high [[H5945]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] he hath made, [[H6213]] in praise, [[H8416]] and in name, [[H8034]] and in honour; [[H8597]] and that thou mayest be [[H1961]] an holy [[H6918]] people [[H5971]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] he hath spoken.
