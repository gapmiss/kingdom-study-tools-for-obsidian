### 13
If [[H3588]] any man [[H376]] take [[H3947]] a wife, [[H802]] and go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her, and hate [[H8130]] her, [[H8130]]

### 17
And, lo, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] hath given [[H7760]] occasions [[H5949]] of speech [[H1697]] saying, [[H559]] I found [[H4672]] not [[H3808]] thy daughter [[H1323]] a maid; [[H1331]] and yet these [[H428]] my daughter's [[H1323]] virginity. [[H1331]] And they shall spread [[H6566]] the cloth [[H8071]] before [[H6440]] the elders [[H2205]] of the city. [[H5892]]

### 18
And the elders [[H2205]] of that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] shall take [[H3947]] that man [[H376]] and chastise [[H3256]] him; [[H3256]]

### 19
And they shall amerce [[H6064]] him in an hundred [[H3967]] of silver, [[H3701]] and give [[H5414]] unto the father [[H1]] of the damsel, [[H5291]] because [[H3588]] he hath brought up [[H3318]] an evil [[H7451]] name [[H8034]] upon [[H5921]] a virgin [[H1330]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and she shall be [[H1961]] his wife; [[H802]] he may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] put her away [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] his days. [[H3117]]

### 20
But if [[H518]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] be [[H1961]] true, [[H571]] virginity [[H1331]] be not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] for the damsel: [[H5291]]

### 21
Then they shall bring out [[H3318]] the damsel [[H5291]] to [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of her father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] and the men [[H376]] of her city [[H5892]] shall stone [[H5619]] her with stones [[H68]] that she die: [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] she hath wrought [[H6213]] folly [[H5039]] in Israel, [[H3478]] to play the whore [[H2181]] in her father's [[H1]] house: [[H1004]] so shalt thou put [[H1197]] evil [[H7451]] away from among you. [[H7130]]

### 22
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] be found [[H4672]] lying [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] a woman [[H802]] married [[H1166]] to an husband, [[H1167]] then they shall both [[H1571]] of them [[H8147]] die, [[H4191]] the man [[H376]] that lay [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] the woman, [[H802]] and the woman: [[H802]] so shalt thou put away [[H1197]] evil [[H7451]] from Israel. [[H3478]]

### 23
If [[H3588]] a damsel [[H5291]] a virgin [[H1330]] be [[H1961]] betrothed [[H781]] unto an husband, [[H376]] and a man [[H376]] find [[H4672]] her in the city, [[H5892]] and lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] her; [[H5973]]

### 24
Then ye shall bring [[H3318]] them both [[H8147]]  out [[H853]] unto [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] of that [[H1931]] city, [[H5892]] and ye shall stone [[H5619]] them with stones [[H68]] that they die; [[H4191]] the damsel, [[H5291]] because [[H834]] she cried [[H6817]] not, [[H3808]] in the city; [[H5892]] and the man, [[H376]] because [[H834]] he hath humbled [[H6031]] his neighbour's [[H7453]] wife: [[H802]] so thou shalt put away [[H1197]] evil [[H7451]] from among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 25
But if [[H518]] a man [[H376]] find [[H4672]] a betrothed [[H781]] damsel [[H5291]] in the field, [[H7704]] and the man [[H376]] force [[H2388]] her, and lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] her: then the man [[H376]] only [[H905]] that [[H834]] lay [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] her shall die: [[H4191]]

### 26
But unto the damsel [[H5291]] thou shalt do [[H6213]] nothing; [[H1697]] in the damsel [[H5291]] no [[H369]] sin [[H2399]] of death: [[H4194]] for [[H3588]] as [[H834]] when a man [[H376]] riseth [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] and slayeth [[H7523]] him, even so [[H3651]] this [[H2088]] matter: [[H1697]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] he found [[H4672]] her in the field, [[H7704]] the betrothed [[H781]] damsel [[H5291]] cried, [[H6817]] and none [[H369]] to save [[H3467]] her. [[H3467]]

### 28
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] find [[H4672]] a damsel [[H5291]] a virgin, [[H1330]] which [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] betrothed, [[H781]] and lay hold [[H8610]] on her, and lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] her, and they be found; [[H4672]]

### 29
Then the man [[H376]] that lay [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] her shall give [[H5414]] unto the damsel's [[H5291]] father [[H1]] fifty [[H2572]] of silver, [[H3701]] and she shall be [[H1961]] his wife; [[H802]] because [[H8478]] he hath humbled [[H6031]] her, he may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] put her away [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] his days. [[H3117]]

### 30
A man [[H376]] shall not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] his father's [[H1]] wife, [[H802]] nor [[H3808]] discover [[H1540]] his father's [[H1]] skirt. [[H3671]]
