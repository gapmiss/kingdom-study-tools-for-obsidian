### 1
Then we turned, [[H6437]] and went up [[H5927]] the way [[H1870]] to Bashan: [[H1316]] and Og [[H5747]] the king [[H4428]] of Bashan [[H1316]] came out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] us, he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] to battle [[H4421]] at Edrei. [[H154]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Fear [[H3372]] him not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I will deliver [[H5414]] him, and all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] and his land, [[H776]] into thy hand; [[H3027]] and thou shalt do [[H6213]] unto him as [[H834]] thou didst [[H6213]] unto Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which [[H834]] dwelt [[H3427]] at Heshbon. [[H2809]]

### 3
So the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] delivered [[H5414]] into our hands [[H3027]] Og [[H5747]] also, [[H1571]] the king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] and all [[H3605]] his people: [[H5971]] and we smote [[H5221]] him until [[H5704]] none [[H1115]] was left [[H7604]] to him remaining. [[H8300]]

### 4
And we took [[H3920]] all [[H3605]] his cities [[H5892]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] there was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] a city [[H7151]] which [[H834]] we took [[H3947]] not [[H3808]] from [[H853]] them, threescore [[H8346]] cities, [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] the region [[H2256]] of Argob, [[H709]] the kingdom [[H4467]] of Og [[H5747]] in Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 5
All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] fenced [[H1219]] with high [[H1364]] walls, [[H2346]] gates, [[H1817]] and bars; [[H1280]] beside [[H905]] unwalled [[H6521]] towns [[H5892]] a great [[H3966]] many. [[H7235]]

### 6
And we utterly destroyed [[H2763]] them, as [[H834]] we did [[H6213]] unto Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] utterly destroying [[H2763]] the men, [[H4962]] women, [[H802]] and children, [[H2945]] of every [[H3605]] city. [[H5892]]

### 7
But all [[H3605]] the cattle, [[H929]] and the spoil [[H7998]] of the cities, [[H5892]] we took for a prey [[H962]] to ourselves. [[H962]]

### 8
And we took out [[H3947]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] of the hand [[H3027]] of the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] from the river [[H5158]] of Arnon [[H769]] unto [[H5704]] mount [[H2022]] Hermon; [[H2768]]

### 9
Hermon [[H2768]] the Sidonians [[H6722]] call [[H7121]] Sirion; [[H8303]] and the Amorites [[H567]] call [[H7121]] it Shenir;) [[H8149]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the plain, [[H4334]] and all [[H3605]] Gilead, [[H1568]] and all [[H3605]] Bashan, [[H1316]] unto [[H5704]] Salchah [[H5548]] and Edrei, [[H154]] cities [[H5892]] of the kingdom [[H4467]] of Og [[H5747]] in Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] only [[H7535]] Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan [[H1316]] remained [[H7604]] of the remnant [[H3499]] of giants; [[H7497]] behold, [[H2009]] his bedstead [[H6210]] a bedstead [[H6210]] of iron; [[H1270]] it [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] in Rabbath [[H7237]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon? [[H5983]] nine [[H8672]] cubits [[H520]] the length [[H753]] thereof, and four [[H702]] cubits [[H520]] the breadth [[H7341]] of it, after the cubit [[H520]] of a man. [[H376]]

### 12
And this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] we possessed [[H3423]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] from Aroer, [[H6177]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H5158]] Arnon, [[H769]] and half [[H2677]] mount [[H2022]] Gilead, [[H1568]] and the cities [[H5892]] thereof, gave [[H5414]] I unto the Reubenites [[H7206]] and to the Gadites. [[H1425]]

### 13
And the rest [[H3499]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] and all [[H3605]] Bashan, [[H1316]] the kingdom [[H4467]] of Og, [[H5747]] gave [[H5414]] I unto the half [[H2677]] tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh; [[H4519]] all [[H3605]] the region [[H2256]] of Argob, [[H709]] with all [[H3605]] Bashan, [[H1316]] which [[H1931]] was called [[H7121]] the land [[H776]] of giants. [[H7497]]

### 14
Jair [[H2971]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the country [[H2256]] of Argob [[H709]] unto [[H5704]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Geshuri [[H1651]] and Maachathi; [[H4602]] and called [[H7121]] them after [[H5921]] his own name, [[H8034]] Bashan-havoth-jair, [[H1316]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 15
And I gave [[H5414]] Gilead [[H1568]] unto Machir. [[H4353]]

### 16
And unto the Reubenites [[H7206]] and unto the Gadites [[H1425]] I gave [[H5414]] from [[H4480]] Gilead [[H1568]] even unto [[H5704]] the river [[H5158]] Arnon [[H769]] half [[H8432]] the valley, [[H5158]] and the border [[H1366]] even unto [[H5704]] the river [[H5158]] Jabbok, [[H2999]] the border [[H1366]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon; [[H5983]]

### 17
The plain [[H6160]] also, and Jordan, [[H3383]] and the coast [[H1366]] from Chinnereth [[H3672]] even unto [[H5704]] the sea [[H3220]] of the plain, [[H6160]] the salt [[H4417]] sea, [[H3220]] under [[H8478]] Ashdoth-pisgah [[H794]] eastward. [[H4217]]

### 18
And I commanded [[H6680]] you at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to possess [[H3423]] it: ye shall pass over [[H5674]] armed [[H2502]] before [[H6440]] your brethren [[H251]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] meet [[H1121]] for the war. [[H2428]]

### 19
But [[H7535]] your wives, [[H802]] and your little ones, [[H2945]] and your cattle, [[H4735]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] ye have much [[H7227]] cattle,) [[H4735]] shall abide [[H3427]] in your cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] you; [[H5414]]

### 20
Until [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] have given rest [[H5117]] unto your brethren, [[H251]] as well as unto you, and they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] them beyond [[H5676]] Jordan: [[H3383]] and shall ye return [[H7725]] every man [[H376]] unto his possession, [[H3425]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] you. [[H5414]]

### 21
And I commanded [[H6680]] Joshua [[H3091]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saying, [[H559]] Thine eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath done [[H6213]] unto these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] kings: [[H4428]] so [[H3651]] shall the Lord [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] unto all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] passest. [[H5674]]

### 22
Ye shall not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] them: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] he [[H1931]] shall fight [[H3898]] for you. [[H3898]]

### 23
And I besought [[H2603]] the Lord [[H3068]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saying, [[H559]]

### 24
O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] thou [[H859]] hast begun [[H2490]] to shew [[H7200]] thy servant [[H5650]] thy greatness, [[H1433]] and thy mighty [[H2389]] hand: [[H3027]] for [[H834]] what [[H4310]] God [[H410]] in heaven [[H8064]] or in earth, [[H776]] that [[H834]] can do [[H6213]] according to thy works, [[H4639]] and according to thy might? [[H1369]]

### 25
I pray thee, [[H4994]] let me go over, [[H5674]] and see [[H7200]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] that [[H834]] beyond [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] that [[H2088]] goodly [[H2896]] mountain, [[H2022]] and Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 26
But the Lord [[H3068]] was wroth [[H5674]] with me for your sakes, [[H4616]] and would not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] me: and the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Let it suffice [[H7227]] thee; speak [[H1696]] no [[H408]] more [[H3254]] unto [[H413]] me of this [[H2088]] matter. [[H1697]]

### 27
Get thee up [[H5927]] into the top [[H7218]] of Pisgah, [[H6449]] and lift up [[H5375]] thine eyes [[H5869]] westward, [[H3220]] and northward, [[H6828]] and southward, [[H8486]] and eastward, [[H4217]] and behold [[H7200]] with thine eyes: [[H5869]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] go over [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 28
But charge [[H6680]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and encourage [[H2388]] him, and strengthen [[H553]] him: for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] shall go over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and he [[H1931]] shall cause them to inherit [[H5157]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] thou shalt see. [[H7200]]

### 29
So we abode [[H3427]] in the valley [[H1516]] over against [[H4136]] Beth-peor. [[H1047]]
