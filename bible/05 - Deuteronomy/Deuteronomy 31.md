### 1
And Moses [[H4872]] went [[H1980]] and spake [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I [[H595]] an hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] this day; [[H3117]] I can [[H3201]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] go out [[H3318]] and come in: [[H935]] also the Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Thou shalt not [[H3808]] go over [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] will go over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] thee, he [[H1931]] will destroy [[H8045]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] from before [[H6440]] thee, and thou shalt possess [[H3423]] them: Joshua, [[H3091]] he [[H1931]] shall go over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] thee, as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said. [[H1696]]

### 4
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall do [[H6213]] unto them as [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] to Sihon [[H5511]] and to Og, [[H5747]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] and unto the land [[H776]] of them, whom [[H834]] he destroyed. [[H8045]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall give them up [[H5414]] before your face, [[H6440]] that ye may do [[H6213]] unto them according unto all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you. [[H6680]]

### 6
Be strong [[H2388]] and of a good courage, [[H553]] fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] nor [[H408]] be afraid [[H6206]] of them: [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] that doth go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] thee; he will not [[H3808]] fail [[H7503]] thee, nor [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] thee. [[H5800]]

### 7
And Moses [[H4872]] called [[H7121]] unto Joshua, [[H3091]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] Be strong [[H2388]] and of a good courage: [[H553]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] must go [[H935]] with [[H854]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sworn [[H7650]] unto their fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] them; and thou [[H859]] shalt cause them to inherit [[H5157]] it. [[H5157]]

### 8
And the Lord, [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] that doth go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee; he [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] with thee, [[H5973]] he will not [[H3808]] fail [[H7503]] thee, neither [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] thee: fear [[H3372]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] be dismayed. [[H2865]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] wrote [[H3789]] this [[H2063]] law, [[H8451]] and delivered [[H5414]] it unto [[H413]] the priests [[H3548]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] which bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 10
And Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] them, saying, [[H559]] At the end [[H7093]] of seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]] in the solemnity [[H4150]] of the year [[H8141]] of release, [[H8059]] in the feast [[H2282]] of tabernacles, [[H5521]]

### 11
When all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] is come [[H935]] to appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] in the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] he shall choose, [[H977]] thou shalt read [[H7121]] this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] in their hearing. [[H241]]

### 12
Gather together, [[H6950]] the people [[H5971]] men, [[H376]] and women, [[H802]] and children, [[H2945]] and thy stranger [[H1616]] that [[H834]] within thy gates, [[H8179]] that [[H4616]] they may hear, [[H8085]] and that [[H4616]] they may learn, [[H3925]] and fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law: [[H8451]]

### 13
And their children, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] may hear, [[H8085]] and learn [[H3925]] to fear [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] as long as [[H3117]] ye [[H859]] live [[H2416]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] whither [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Behold, [[H2005]] thy days [[H3117]] approach [[H7126]] that thou must die: [[H4191]] call [[H7121]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and present yourselves [[H3320]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] that I may give him a charge. [[H6680]] And Moses [[H4872]] and Joshua [[H3091]] went, [[H1980]] and presented themselves [[H3320]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] in a pillar [[H5982]] of a cloud: [[H6051]] and the pillar [[H5982]] of the cloud [[H6051]] stood [[H5975]] over [[H5921]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle. [[H168]]

### 16
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Behold, [[H2009]] thou shalt sleep [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] thy fathers; [[H1]] and this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] will rise up, [[H6965]] and go a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] the gods [[H430]] of the strangers [[H5236]] of the land, [[H776]] whither [[H834]] they [[H1931]] go [[H935]] among [[H7130]] them, and will forsake [[H5800]] me, and break [[H6565]] my covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] I have made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] them. [[H854]]

### 17
Then my anger [[H639]] shall be kindled [[H2734]] against them in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and I will forsake [[H5800]] them, and I will hide [[H5641]] my face [[H6440]] from them, and they shall be [[H1961]] devoured, [[H398]] and many [[H7227]] evils [[H7451]] and troubles [[H6869]] shall befall [[H4672]] them; so that they will say [[H559]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] Are not [[H3808]] these [[H428]] evils [[H7451]] come upon [[H4672]] us, because [[H5921]] our God [[H430]] not [[H369]] among [[H7130]] us? [[H7130]]

### 18
And I [[H595]] will surely [[H5640]] hide [[H5641]] my face [[H6440]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the evils [[H7451]] which [[H834]] they shall have wrought, [[H6213]] in that [[H3588]] they are turned [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

### 19
Now [[H6258]] therefore write [[H3789]] ye this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] for you, and teach [[H3925]]  it [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] put [[H7760]] it in their mouths, [[H6310]] that [[H4616]] this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] may be [[H1961]] a witness [[H5707]] for me against the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] when I shall have brought [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto their fathers, [[H1]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey; [[H1706]] and they shall have eaten [[H398]] and filled themselves, [[H7646]] and waxen fat; [[H1878]] then will they turn [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and serve [[H5647]] them, and provoke [[H5006]] me, and break [[H6565]] my covenant. [[H1285]]

### 21
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] evils [[H7451]] and troubles [[H6869]] are befallen [[H4672]] them, that this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] shall testify [[H6030]] against [[H6440]] them as a witness; [[H5707]] for [[H3588]] it shall not [[H3808]] be forgotten [[H7911]] out of the mouths [[H6310]] of their seed: [[H2233]] for [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] their imagination [[H3336]] which [[H834]] they [[H1931]] go about, [[H6213]] even now, [[H3117]] before [[H2962]] I have brought [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware. [[H7650]]

### 22
Moses [[H4872]] therefore wrote [[H3789]] this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] the same [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and taught [[H3925]]  it [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 23
And he gave [[H853]] Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] a charge, [[H6680]] and said, [[H559]] Be strong [[H2388]] and of a good courage: [[H553]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] shalt bring [[H935]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto them: and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 24
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Moses [[H4872]] had made an end [[H3615]] of writing [[H3789]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] in [[H5921]] a book, [[H5612]] until [[H5704]] they were finished, [[H8552]]

### 25
That Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] the Levites, [[H3881]] which bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 26
Take [[H3947]] this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] of the law, [[H8451]] and put [[H7760]] it in the side [[H6654]] of the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] that it may be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] for a witness [[H5707]] against thee. [[H5707]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] know [[H3045]] thy rebellion, [[H4805]] and thy stiff [[H7186]] neck: [[H6203]] behold, [[H2005]] while I am yet [[H5750]] alive [[H2416]] with [[H5973]] you this day, [[H3117]] ye have been [[H1961]] rebellious [[H4784]] against [[H5973]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and how [[H3588]] much more [[H637]] after [[H310]] my death? [[H4194]]

### 28
Gather [[H6950]] unto [[H413]]  me [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of your tribes, [[H7626]] and your officers, [[H7860]] that I may speak [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in their ears, [[H241]] and call [[H5749]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] to record against them. [[H776]]

### 29
For [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] that after [[H310]] my death [[H4194]] ye will utterly [[H7843]] corrupt [[H7843]] and turn aside [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] you; and evil [[H7451]] will befall [[H7122]] you in the latter [[H319]] days; [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] ye will do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to provoke him to anger [[H3707]] through the work [[H4639]] of your hands. [[H3027]]

### 30
And Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] in the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] song, [[H7892]] until [[H5704]] they were ended. [[H8552]]
