### 1
When [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath cut off [[H3772]] the nations, [[H1471]] whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee, and thou succeedest [[H3423]] them, and dwellest [[H3427]] in their cities, [[H5892]] and in their houses; [[H1004]]

### 2
Thou shalt separate [[H914]] three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] for thee in the midst [[H8432]] of thy land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 3
Thou shalt prepare [[H3559]] thee a way, [[H1870]] and divide parts, [[H8027]] the coasts [[H1366]] of thy land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth thee to inherit, [[H5157]] into three that every [[H3605]] slayer [[H7523]] may [[H1961]] flee [[H5127]] thither. [[H8033]]

### 4
And this [[H2088]] the case [[H1697]] of the slayer, [[H7523]] which [[H834]] shall flee [[H5127]] thither, [[H8033]] that he may live: [[H2425]] Whoso [[H834]] killeth [[H5221]] his neighbour [[H7453]] ignorantly, [[H1097]] whom he [[H1931]] hated [[H8130]] not [[H3808]] in time [[H8543]] past; [[H8032]]

### 5
As when a man [[H834]] goeth [[H935]] into the wood [[H3293]] with [[H854]] his neighbour [[H7453]] to hew [[H2404]] wood, [[H6086]] and his hand [[H3027]] fetcheth a stroke [[H5080]] with the axe [[H1631]] to cut down [[H3772]] the tree, [[H6086]] and the head [[H1270]] slippeth [[H5394]] from [[H4480]] the helve, [[H6086]] and lighteth upon [[H4672]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] that he die; [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] shall flee [[H5127]] unto [[H413]] one [[H259]] of those [[H428]] cities, [[H5892]] and live: [[H2425]]

### 6
Lest [[H6435]] the avenger [[H1350]] of the blood [[H1818]] pursue [[H7291]] the slayer, [[H310]] while [[H3588]] his heart [[H3824]] is hot, [[H3179]] and overtake [[H5381]] him, because [[H3588]] the way [[H1870]] is long, [[H7235]] and slay [[H5221]] him; [[H5315]] whereas he not [[H369]] worthy [[H4941]] of death, [[H4194]] inasmuch as [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] hated [[H8130]] him not [[H3808]] in time [[H8543]] past. [[H8032]]

### 7
Wherefore [[H5921]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Thou shalt separate [[H914]] three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] for thee. [[H5892]]

### 8
And if [[H518]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] enlarge [[H7337]] thy coast, [[H1366]] as [[H834]] he hath sworn [[H7650]] unto thy fathers, [[H1]] and give [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] he promised [[H1696]] to give [[H5414]] unto thy fathers; [[H1]]

### 9
If [[H3588]] thou shalt keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2063]] commandments [[H4687]] to do [[H6213]] them, which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] to love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and to walk [[H1980]] ever [[H3117]] in his ways; [[H1870]] then shalt thou add [[H3254]] three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] more [[H5750]] for thee, beside [[H5921]] these [[H428]] three: [[H7969]]

### 10
That innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] be not [[H3808]] shed [[H8210]] in [[H7130]] thy land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee an inheritance, [[H5159]] and blood [[H1818]] be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 11
But if [[H3588]] any man [[H376]] hate [[H8130]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] and lie in wait [[H693]] for him, and rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] him, and smite [[H5221]] him mortally [[H5315]] that he die, [[H4191]] and fleeth [[H5127]] into [[H413]] one [[H259]] of these [[H411]] cities: [[H5892]]

### 12
Then the elders [[H2205]] of his city [[H5892]] shall send [[H7971]] and fetch [[H3947]] him thence, [[H8033]] and deliver [[H5414]] him into the hand [[H3027]] of the avenger [[H1350]] of blood, [[H1818]] that he may die. [[H4191]]

### 13
Thine eye [[H5869]] shall not [[H3808]] pity [[H2347]] him, but thou shalt put away [[H1197]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] from Israel, [[H3478]] that it may go well with thee. [[H2895]]

### 14
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] remove [[H5253]] thy neighbour's [[H7453]] landmark, [[H1366]] which [[H834]] they of old time [[H7223]] have set [[H1379]] in thine inheritance, [[H5159]] which [[H834]] thou shalt inherit [[H5157]] in the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 15
One [[H259]] witness [[H5707]] shall not [[H3808]] rise up [[H6965]] against a man [[H376]] for any [[H3605]] iniquity, [[H5771]] or for any [[H3605]] sin, [[H2403]] in any [[H3605]] sin [[H2399]] that [[H834]] he sinneth: [[H2398]] at [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of two [[H8147]] witnesses, [[H5707]] or [[H176]] at [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of three [[H7969]] witnesses, [[H5707]] shall the matter [[H1697]] be established. [[H6965]]

### 16
If [[H3588]] a false [[H2555]] witness [[H5707]] rise up [[H6965]] against any man [[H376]] to testify [[H6030]] against him wrong; [[H5627]]

### 17
Then both [[H8147]] the men, [[H376]] between whom [[H834]] the controversy [[H7379]] shall stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] the priests [[H3548]] and the judges, [[H8199]] which [[H834]] shall be [[H1961]] in those [[H1992]] days; [[H3117]]

### 18
And the judges [[H8199]] shall make diligent [[H3190]] inquisition: [[H1875]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the witness [[H5707]] a false [[H8267]] witness, [[H5707]] hath testified [[H6030]] falsely [[H8267]] against his brother; [[H251]]

### 19
Then shall ye do [[H6213]] unto him, as [[H834]] he had thought [[H2161]] to have done [[H6213]] unto his brother: [[H251]] so shalt thou put [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] away from among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 20
And those which remain [[H7604]] shall hear, [[H8085]] and fear, [[H3372]] and shall henceforth [[H3254]] commit [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] any [[H1697]] such [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 21
And thine eye [[H5869]] shall not [[H3808]] pity; [[H2347]] life [[H5315]] for life, [[H5315]] eye [[H5869]] for eye, [[H5869]] tooth [[H8127]] for tooth, [[H8127]] hand [[H3027]] for hand, [[H3027]] foot [[H7272]] for foot. [[H7272]]
