### 1
These [[H428]] the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] in the plain [[H6160]] over against [[H4136]] the Red [[H5489]] between [[H996]] Paran, [[H6290]] and Tophel, [[H8603]] and Laban, [[H3837]] and Hazeroth, [[H2698]] and Dizahab. [[H1774]]

### 2
eleven [[H259]] days' [[H3117]] from Horeb [[H2722]] by the way [[H1870]] of mount [[H2022]] Seir [[H8165]] unto [[H5704]] Kadesh-barnea.) [[H6947]]

### 3
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the fortieth [[H705]] year, [[H8141]] in the eleventh [[H6249]] month, [[H2320]] on the first [[H259]] of the month, [[H2320]] Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] according unto all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had given him in commandment [[H6680]] unto [[H413]] them; [[H413]]

### 4
After [[H310]] he had slain [[H5221]] Sihon [[H5511]] the king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which [[H834]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Heshbon, [[H2809]] and Og [[H5747]] the king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] which [[H834]] dwelt [[H3427]] at Astaroth [[H6252]] in Edrei: [[H154]]

### 5
On this side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] began [[H2974]] Moses [[H4872]] to declare [[H874]] this [[H2063]] law, [[H8451]] saying, [[H559]]

### 6
The Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] us in Horeb, [[H2722]] saying, [[H559]] Ye have dwelt [[H3427]] long enough [[H7227]] in this [[H2088]] mount: [[H2022]]

### 7
Turn [[H6437]] you, and take your journey, [[H5265]] and go [[H935]] to the mount [[H2022]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] nigh [[H7934]] thereunto, in the plain, [[H6160]] in the hills, [[H2022]] and in the vale, [[H8219]] and in the south, [[H5045]] and by the sea [[H3220]] side, [[H2348]] to the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and unto Lebanon, [[H3844]] unto [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] river, [[H5104]] the river [[H5104]] Euphrates. [[H6578]]

### 8
Behold, [[H7200]] I have set [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] before [[H6440]] you: go in [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto your fathers, [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob, [[H3290]] to give [[H5414]] unto them and to their seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] them. [[H310]]

### 9
And I spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saying, [[H559]] I am not able [[H3201]] to bear [[H5375]] you myself alone: [[H905]]

### 10
The Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath multiplied [[H7235]] you, and, behold, [[H2009]] ye this day [[H3117]] as the stars [[H3556]] of heaven [[H8064]] for multitude. [[H7230]]

### 11
(The Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of your fathers [[H1]] make you a thousand [[H505]] times [[H6471]] so many more as [[H3254]] ye and bless [[H1288]] you, as [[H834]] he hath promised [[H1696]] you!) [[H1696]]

### 12
How [[H349]] can I myself alone [[H905]] bear [[H5375]] your cumbrance, [[H2960]] and your burden, [[H4853]] and your strife? [[H7379]]

### 13
Take [[H3051]] you wise [[H2450]] men, [[H582]] and understanding, [[H995]] and known [[H3045]] among your tribes, [[H7626]] and I will make [[H7760]] them rulers [[H7218]] over you. [[H7218]]

### 14
And ye answered [[H6030]] me, and said, [[H559]] The thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] good [[H2896]] to do. [[H6213]]

### 15
So I took [[H3947]] the chief [[H7218]] of your tribes, [[H7626]] wise [[H2450]] men, [[H376]] and known, [[H3045]] and made [[H5414]] them heads [[H7218]] over [[H5921]] you, captains [[H8269]] over thousands, [[H505]] and captains [[H8269]] over hundreds, [[H3967]] and captains [[H8269]] over fifties, [[H2572]] and captains [[H8269]] over tens, [[H6235]] and officers [[H7860]] among your tribes. [[H7626]]

### 16
And I charged [[H6680]] your judges [[H8199]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] saying, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] between [[H996]] your brethren, [[H251]] and judge [[H8199]] righteously [[H6664]] between [[H996]] man [[H376]] and his brother, [[H251]] and the stranger [[H1616]] with him. [[H1616]]

### 17
Ye shall not [[H3808]] respect [[H5234]] persons [[H6440]] in judgment; [[H4941]] ye shall hear [[H8085]] the small [[H6996]] as well as the great; [[H1419]] ye shall not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H1481]] of the face [[H6440]] of man; [[H376]] for [[H3588]] the judgment [[H4941]] God's: [[H430]] and the cause [[H1697]] that [[H834]] is too hard [[H7185]] for [[H4480]] you, bring [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] me, and I will hear [[H8085]] it. [[H8085]]

### 18
And I commanded [[H6680]] you at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] all [[H3605]] the things [[H1697]] which [[H834]] ye should do. [[H6213]]

### 19
And when we departed [[H5265]] from Horeb, [[H2722]] we went through [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] great [[H1419]] and terrible [[H3372]] wilderness, [[H4057]] which [[H834]] ye saw [[H7200]] by the way [[H1870]] of the mountain [[H2022]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] us; and we came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Kadesh-barnea. [[H6947]]

### 20
And I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, Ye are come [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] the mountain [[H2022]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] doth give [[H5414]] unto us. [[H5414]]

### 21
Behold, [[H7200]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath set [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] before [[H6440]] thee: go up [[H5927]] possess [[H3423]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of thy fathers [[H1]] hath said [[H1696]] unto thee; fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] neither [[H408]] be discouraged. [[H2865]]

### 22
And ye came near [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] me every one [[H3605]] of you, and said, [[H559]] We will send [[H7971]] men [[H376]] before [[H6440]] us, and they shall search us out [[H2658]] the land, [[H776]] and bring [[H7725]] us word [[H1697]]  again [[H853]] by what [[H834]] way [[H1870]] we must go up, [[H5927]] and [[H853]] into [[H413]] what [[H834]] cities [[H5892]] we shall come. [[H935]]

### 23
And the saying [[H1697]] pleased me well: [[H3190]] and I took [[H3947]] twelve [[H8147]] men [[H582]] of [[H4480]] you, one [[H259]] of a tribe: [[H376]]

### 24
And they turned [[H6437]] and went up [[H5927]] into the mountain, [[H2022]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] the valley [[H5158]] of Eshcol, [[H812]] and searched it out. [[H7270]]

### 25
And they took [[H3947]] of the fruit [[H6529]] of the land [[H776]] in their hands, [[H3027]] and brought down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] us, and brought [[H7725]] us word [[H1697]] again, and said, [[H559]] a good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] doth give [[H5414]] us. [[H5414]]

### 26
Notwithstanding ye would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] go up, [[H5927]] but rebelled against [[H4784]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]]

### 27
And ye murmured [[H7279]] in your tents, [[H168]] and said, [[H559]] Because the Lord [[H3068]] hated [[H8130]] us, he hath brought us forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] to deliver [[H5414]] us into the hand [[H3027]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] to destroy [[H8045]] us. [[H8045]]

### 28
Whither [[H575]] shall we [[H587]] go up? [[H5927]] our brethren [[H251]] have discouraged [[H4549]] our heart, [[H3824]] saying, [[H559]] The people [[H5971]] greater [[H1419]] and taller [[H7311]] than [[H4480]] we; the cities [[H5892]] great [[H1419]] and walled up [[H1219]] to heaven; [[H8064]] and moreover [[H1571]] we have seen [[H7200]] the sons [[H1121]] of the Anakims [[H6062]] there. [[H8033]]

### 29
Then I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, Dread [[H6206]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them. [[H3372]]

### 30
The Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] which goeth [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] you, he [[H1931]] shall fight [[H3898]] for you, according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] for [[H854]] you in Egypt [[H4714]] before your eyes; [[H5869]]

### 31
And in the wilderness, [[H4057]] where [[H834]] thou hast seen [[H7200]] how that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] bare [[H5375]] thee, as [[H834]] a man [[H376]] doth bear [[H5375]] his son, [[H1121]] in all [[H3605]] the way [[H1870]] that [[H834]] ye went, [[H1980]] until [[H5704]] ye came [[H935]] into [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 32
Yet in this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] ye did not [[H369]] believe [[H539]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]]

### 33
Who went [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] before [[H6440]] you, to search you out [[H8446]] a place [[H4725]] to pitch your tents [[H2583]] in fire [[H784]] by night, [[H3915]] to shew [[H7200]] you by what [[H834]] way [[H1870]] ye should go, [[H1980]] and in a cloud [[H6051]] by day. [[H3119]]

### 34
And the Lord [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of your words, [[H1697]] and was wroth, [[H7107]] and sware, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]]

### 35
Surely [[H518]] there shall not one [[H376]] of these [[H428]] men [[H376]] of this [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] generation [[H1755]] see [[H7200]] that good [[H2896]] land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] to give [[H5414]] unto your fathers, [[H1]]

### 36
Save [[H2108]] Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh; [[H3312]] he [[H1931]] shall see [[H7200]] it, and to him will I give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] he hath trodden upon, [[H1869]] and to his children, [[H1121]] because [[H3282]] he hath wholly [[H4390]] followed [[H310]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 37
Also [[H1571]] the Lord [[H3068]] was angry [[H599]] with me for your sakes, [[H1558]] saying, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] shalt not [[H3808]] go in [[H935]] thither. [[H8033]]

### 38
Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] which standeth [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] thee, he [[H1931]] shall go in [[H935]] thither: [[H8033]] encourage [[H2388]] him: for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]]  shall cause [[H853]] Israel [[H3478]] to inherit [[H5157]] it. [[H5157]]

### 39
Moreover your little ones, [[H2945]] which [[H834]] ye said [[H559]] should be [[H1961]] a prey, [[H957]] and your children, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] in that day [[H3117]] had no knowledge [[H3045]] between good [[H2896]] and evil, [[H7451]] they [[H1992]] shall go in [[H935]] thither, [[H8033]] and unto them will I give [[H5414]] it, and they [[H1992]] shall possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 40
But you, [[H859]] turn [[H6437]] you, and take your journey [[H5265]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] by the way [[H1870]] of the Red [[H5488]] sea. [[H3220]]

### 41
Then ye answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, We have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] we [[H587]] will go up [[H5927]] and fight, [[H3898]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] us. And when ye had girded on [[H2296]] every man [[H376]] his weapons [[H3627]] of war, [[H4421]] ye were ready [[H1951]] to go up [[H5927]] into the hill. [[H2022]]

### 42
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Say [[H559]] unto them, Go not up, [[H5927]] neither [[H3808]] fight; [[H3898]] for [[H3588]] I not [[H369]] among [[H7130]] you; lest [[H3808]] ye be smitten [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] your enemies. [[H341]]

### 43
So I spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] you; and ye would not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] but rebelled against [[H4784]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and went up [[H5927]] presumptuously [[H2102]] into the hill. [[H2022]]

### 44
And the Amorites, [[H567]] which dwelt [[H3427]] in that [[H1931]] mountain, [[H2022]] came out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] you, and chased [[H7291]] you, as [[H834]] bees [[H1682]] do, [[H6213]] and destroyed [[H3807]] you in Seir, [[H8165]] unto [[H5704]] Hormah. [[H2767]]

### 45
And ye returned [[H7725]] and wept [[H1058]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] but the Lord [[H3068]] would not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] to your voice, [[H6963]] nor [[H3808]] give ear [[H238]] unto [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 46
So ye abode [[H3427]] in Kadesh [[H6946]] many [[H7227]] days, [[H3117]] according unto the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] ye abode [[H3427]]
