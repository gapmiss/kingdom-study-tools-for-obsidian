### 1
These [[H428]] the statutes [[H2706]] and judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] ye shall observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] in the land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of thy fathers [[H1]] giveth [[H5414]] thee to possess [[H3423]] it, all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] ye [[H859]] live [[H2416]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H127]]

### 2
Ye shall utterly [[H6]] destroy [[H6]] all [[H3605]] the places, [[H4725]] wherein [[H834]] the nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] ye [[H859]] shall possess [[H3423]] served [[H5647]] their gods, [[H430]] upon [[H5921]] the high [[H7311]] mountains, [[H2022]] and upon [[H5921]] the hills, [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree: [[H6086]]

### 3
And ye shall overthrow [[H5422]] their altars, [[H4196]] and break [[H7665]] their pillars, [[H4676]] and burn [[H8313]] their groves [[H842]] with fire; [[H784]] and ye shall hew down [[H1438]] the graven images [[H6456]] of their gods, [[H430]] and destroy [[H6]] the names [[H8034]] of them out of [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] place. [[H4725]]

### 4
Ye shall not [[H3808]] do so [[H6213]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 5
But [[H3588]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] shall choose [[H977]] out of all [[H3605]] your tribes [[H7626]] to put [[H7760]] his name [[H8034]] there, [[H8033]] unto his habitation [[H7933]] shall ye seek, [[H1875]] and thither [[H8033]] thou shalt come: [[H935]]

### 6
And thither [[H8033]] ye shall bring [[H935]] your burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and your sacrifices, [[H2077]] and your tithes, [[H4643]]  and [[H853]] heave offerings [[H8641]] of your hand, [[H3027]] and your vows, [[H5088]] and your freewill offerings, [[H5071]] and the firstlings [[H1062]] of your herds [[H1241]] and of your flocks: [[H6629]]

### 7
And there [[H8033]] ye shall eat [[H398]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and ye shall rejoice [[H8055]] in all [[H3605]] that ye put [[H4916]] your hand [[H3027]] unto, ye [[H859]] and your households, [[H1004]] wherein [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath blessed [[H1288]] thee. [[H1288]]

### 8
Ye shall not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] after all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] we [[H587]] do [[H6213]] here [[H6311]] this day, [[H3117]] every man [[H376]] whatsoever [[H3605]] right [[H3477]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] ye are not [[H3808]] as yet [[H5704]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the rest [[H4496]] and to [[H413]] the inheritance, [[H5159]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] you. [[H5414]]

### 10
But ye go over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] giveth you to inherit, [[H5157]] and he giveth you rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] round about, [[H5439]] so that ye dwell [[H3427]] in safety; [[H983]]

### 11
Then there shall be [[H1961]] a place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] shall choose [[H977]] to cause his name [[H8034]] to dwell [[H7931]] there; [[H8033]] thither [[H8033]] shall ye bring [[H935]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you; your burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and your sacrifices, [[H2077]] your tithes, [[H4643]] and the heave offering [[H8641]] of your hand, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] your choice [[H4005]] vows [[H5088]] which [[H834]] ye vow [[H5087]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 12
And ye shall rejoice [[H8055]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] ye, [[H859]] and your sons, [[H1121]] and your daughters, [[H1323]] and your menservants, [[H5650]] and your maidservants, [[H519]] and the Levite [[H3881]] that [[H834]] within your gates; [[H8179]] forasmuch [[H3588]] as he hath no [[H369]] part [[H2506]] nor inheritance [[H5159]] with [[H854]] you. [[H854]]

### 13
Take heed [[H8104]] to thyself that [[H6435]] thou offer [[H5927]] not thy burnt offerings [[H5930]] in every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] that [[H834]] thou seest: [[H7200]]

### 14
But [[H3588]] in the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall choose [[H977]] in one [[H259]] of thy tribes, [[H7626]] there [[H8033]] thou shalt offer [[H5927]] thy burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and there [[H8033]] thou shalt do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee. [[H6680]]

### 15
Notwithstanding [[H7535]] thou mayest kill [[H2076]] and eat [[H398]] flesh [[H1320]] in all [[H3605]] thy gates, [[H8179]] whatsoever [[H3605]] thy soul [[H5315]] lusteth after, [[H185]] according to the blessing [[H1293]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] which [[H834]] he hath given [[H5414]] thee: the unclean [[H2931]] and the clean [[H2889]] may eat [[H398]] thereof, as of the roebuck, [[H6643]] and as of the hart. [[H354]]

### 16
Only [[H7535]] ye shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the blood; [[H1818]] ye shall pour [[H8210]] it upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] as water. [[H4325]]

### 17
Thou mayest [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] within thy gates [[H8179]] the tithe [[H4643]] of thy corn, [[H1715]] or of thy wine, [[H8492]] or of thy oil, [[H3323]] or the firstlings [[H1062]] of thy herds [[H1241]] or of thy flock, [[H6629]] nor any [[H3605]] of thy vows [[H5088]] which [[H834]] thou vowest, [[H5087]] nor thy freewill offerings, [[H5071]] or heave offering [[H8641]] of thine hand: [[H3027]]

### 18
But [[H3588]] thou must eat [[H398]] them before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] in the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall choose, [[H977]] thou, [[H859]] and thy son, [[H1121]] and thy daughter, [[H1323]] and thy manservant, [[H5650]] and thy maidservant, [[H519]] and the Levite [[H3881]] that [[H834]] within thy gates: [[H8179]] and thou shalt rejoice [[H8055]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] in all [[H3605]] that thou puttest [[H4916]] thine hands [[H3027]] unto. [[H3027]]

### 19
Take heed [[H8104]] to thyself that thou forsake [[H5800]] not [[H6435]] the Levite [[H3881]] as long as thou livest [[H3117]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H127]]

### 20
When [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall enlarge [[H7337]] thy border, [[H1366]] as [[H834]] he hath promised [[H1696]] thee, and thou shalt say, [[H559]] I will eat [[H398]] flesh, [[H1320]] because [[H3588]] thy soul [[H5315]] longeth [[H183]] to eat [[H398]] flesh; [[H1320]] thou mayest eat [[H398]] flesh, [[H1320]] whatsoever [[H3605]] thy soul [[H5315]] lusteth after. [[H185]]

### 21
If [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath chosen [[H977]] to put [[H7760]] his name [[H8034]] there [[H8033]] be too far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] thee, then thou shalt kill [[H2076]] of thy herd [[H1241]] and of thy flock, [[H6629]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]] thee, as [[H834]] I have commanded [[H6680]] thee, and thou shalt eat [[H398]] in thy gates [[H8179]] whatsoever [[H3605]] thy soul [[H5315]] lusteth after. [[H185]]

### 22
Even [[H389]] as [[H834]] the roebuck [[H6643]] and the hart [[H354]] is eaten, [[H398]] so [[H3651]] thou shalt eat [[H398]] them: the unclean [[H2931]] and the clean [[H2889]] shall eat [[H398]] them alike. [[H3162]]

### 23
Only [[H7535]] be sure [[H2388]] that thou eat [[H398]] not [[H1115]] the blood: [[H1818]] for [[H3588]] the blood [[H1818]] the life; [[H5315]] and thou mayest not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the life [[H5315]] with [[H5973]] the flesh. [[H1320]]

### 24
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] it; thou shalt pour [[H8210]] it upon [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] as water. [[H4325]]

### 25
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] it; that [[H4616]] it may go well [[H3190]] with thee, and with thy children [[H1121]] after [[H310]] thee, when [[H3588]] thou shalt do [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 26
Only [[H7535]] thy holy things [[H6944]] which [[H834]] thou hast, [[H1961]] and thy vows, [[H5088]] thou shalt take, [[H5375]] and go [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall choose: [[H977]]

### 27
And thou shalt offer [[H6213]] thy burnt offerings, [[H5930]] the flesh [[H1320]] and the blood, [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]] and the blood [[H1818]] of thy sacrifices [[H2077]] shall be poured out [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and thou shalt eat [[H398]] the flesh. [[H1320]]

### 28
Observe [[H8104]] and hear [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee, that [[H4616]] it may go well [[H3190]] with thee, and with thy children [[H1121]] after [[H310]] thee for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] when [[H3588]] thou doest [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] and right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 29
When [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall cut off [[H3772]] the nations [[H1471]] from before [[H6440]] thee, whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] them, and thou succeedest [[H3423]] them, and dwellest [[H3427]] in their land; [[H776]]

### 30
Take heed [[H8104]] to thyself that [[H6435]] thou be not snared [[H5367]] by following [[H310]] them, after that [[H310]] they be destroyed [[H8045]] from before [[H6440]] thee; and that [[H6435]] thou inquire [[H1875]] not after their gods, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]] How [[H349]] did these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] serve [[H5647]] their gods? [[H430]] even so [[H3651]] will I [[H589]] do [[H6213]] likewise. [[H1571]]

### 31
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he hateth, [[H8130]] have they done [[H6213]] unto their gods; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] even [[H1571]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters [[H1323]] they have burnt [[H8313]] in the fire [[H784]] to their gods. [[H430]]

### 32
What thing [[H1697]] soever [[H3605]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you, observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] it: thou shalt not [[H3808]] add [[H3254]] thereto, [[H5921]] nor [[H3808]] diminish [[H1639]] from [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]
