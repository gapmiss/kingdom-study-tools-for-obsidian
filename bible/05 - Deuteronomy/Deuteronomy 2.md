### 1
Then we turned, [[H6437]] and took our journey [[H5265]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] by the way [[H1870]] of the Red [[H5488]] sea, [[H3220]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me: and we compassed [[H5437]] mount [[H2022]] Seir [[H8165]] many [[H7227]] days. [[H3117]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 3
Ye have compassed [[H5437]] this [[H2088]] mountain [[H2022]] long enough: [[H7227]] turn [[H6437]] you northward. [[H6828]]

### 4
And command [[H6680]] thou the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Ye [[H859]] to pass through [[H5674]] the coast [[H1366]] of your brethren [[H251]] the children [[H1121]] of Esau, [[H6215]] which dwell [[H3427]] in Seir; [[H8165]] and they shall be afraid [[H3372]] of [[H4480]] you: take ye good [[H3966]] heed [[H8104]] unto yourselves therefore: [[H8104]]

### 5
Meddle [[H1624]] not [[H408]] with them; for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] you of their land, [[H776]] no, not so much [[H5704]] as a foot [[H7272]] breadth; [[H4096]] because [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] mount [[H2022]] Seir [[H8165]] unto Esau [[H6215]] a possession. [[H3425]]

### 6
Ye shall buy [[H7666]] meat [[H400]] of [[H853]] them for money, [[H3701]] that ye may eat; [[H398]] and ye shall also [[H1571]] buy [[H3739]] water [[H4325]] of [[H853]] them for money, [[H3701]] that ye may drink. [[H8354]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath blessed [[H1288]] thee in all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] of thy hand: [[H3027]] he knoweth [[H3045]] thy walking through [[H3212]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] wilderness: [[H4057]] these [[H2088]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] thee; thou hast lacked [[H2637]] nothing. [[H1697]]

### 8
And when we passed by [[H5674]] from [[H854]] our brethren [[H251]] the children [[H1121]] of Esau, [[H6215]] which dwelt [[H3427]] in Seir, [[H8165]] through the way [[H1870]] of the plain [[H6160]] from Elath, [[H359]] and from Ezion-gaber, [[H6100]] we turned [[H6437]] and passed [[H5674]] by the way [[H1870]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Distress [[H6696]] not [[H408]] the Moabites, [[H4124]] neither [[H408]] contend [[H1624]] with them in battle: [[H4421]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] thee of their land [[H776]] a possession; [[H3425]] because [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] Ar [[H6144]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Lot [[H3876]] a possession. [[H3425]]

### 10
The Emims [[H368]] dwelt [[H3427]] therein in times past, [[H6440]] a people [[H5971]] great, [[H1419]] and many, [[H7227]] and tall, [[H7311]] as the Anakims; [[H6062]]

### 11
Which [[H1992]] also [[H637]] were accounted [[H2803]] giants, [[H7497]] as the Anakims; [[H6062]] but the Moabites [[H4125]] call [[H7121]] them Emims. [[H368]]

### 12
The Horims [[H2752]] also dwelt [[H3427]] in Seir [[H8165]] beforetime; [[H6440]] but the children [[H1121]] of Esau [[H6215]] succeeded [[H3423]] them, when they had destroyed [[H8045]] them from before [[H6440]] them, and dwelt [[H3427]] in their stead; [[H8478]] as [[H834]] Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] unto the land [[H776]] of his possession, [[H3425]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] unto them. [[H5414]]

### 13
Now [[H6258]] rise up, [[H6965]] and get you over [[H5674]] the brook [[H5158]] Zered. [[H2218]] And we went over [[H5674]] the brook [[H5158]] Zered. [[H2218]]

### 14
And the space [[H3117]] in which [[H834]] we came [[H1980]] from Kadesh-barnea, [[H6947]] until [[H5704]] we were come over [[H5674]] the brook [[H5158]] Zered, [[H2218]] thirty [[H7970]] and eight [[H8083]] years; [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the generation [[H1755]] of the men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] were wasted out [[H8552]] from among [[H7130]] the host, [[H4264]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto them. [[H7650]]

### 15
For indeed [[H1571]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] against them, to destroy [[H2000]] them from among [[H7130]] the host, [[H4264]] until [[H5704]] they were consumed. [[H8552]]

### 16
So it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of war [[H4421]] were consumed [[H8552]] and dead [[H4191]] from among [[H7130]] the people, [[H5971]]

### 17
That the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Thou [[H859]] art to pass over [[H5674]]  through [[H853]] Ar, [[H6144]] the coast [[H1366]] of Moab, [[H4124]] this day: [[H3117]]

### 19
And thou comest nigh [[H7126]] over against [[H4136]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] distress [[H6696]] them not, [[H408]] nor [[H408]] meddle [[H1624]] with them: for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] thee of the land [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] possession; [[H3425]] because [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] it unto the children [[H1121]] of Lot [[H3876]] a possession. [[H3425]]

### 20
(That [[H1931]] also [[H637]] was accounted [[H2803]] a land [[H776]] of giants: [[H7497]] giants [[H7497]] dwelt [[H3427]] therein in old time; [[H6440]] and the Ammonites [[H5984]] call [[H7121]] them Zamzummims; [[H2157]]

### 21
A people [[H5971]] great, [[H1419]] and many, [[H7227]] and tall, [[H7311]] as the Anakims; [[H6062]] but the Lord [[H3068]] destroyed [[H8045]] them before [[H6440]] them; and they succeeded [[H3423]] them, and dwelt [[H3427]] in their stead: [[H8478]]

### 22
As [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] to the children [[H1121]] of Esau, [[H6215]] which dwelt [[H3427]] in Seir, [[H8165]] when [[H834]] he destroyed [[H8045]] the Horims [[H2752]] from before [[H6440]] them; and they succeeded [[H3423]] them, and dwelt [[H3427]] in their stead [[H8478]] even unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day: [[H3117]]

### 23
And the Avims [[H5757]] which dwelt [[H3427]] in Hazerim, [[H2699]] unto [[H5704]] Azzah, [[H5804]] the Caphtorims, [[H3732]] which came forth [[H3318]] out of Caphtor, [[H3731]] destroyed [[H8045]] them, and dwelt [[H3427]] in their stead.) [[H8478]]

### 24
Rise ye up, [[H6965]] take your journey, [[H5265]] and pass over [[H5674]] the river [[H5158]] Arnon: [[H769]] behold, [[H7200]] I have given [[H5414]] into thine hand [[H3027]] Sihon [[H5511]] the Amorite, [[H567]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] and his land: [[H776]] begin [[H2490]] to possess [[H3423]] and contend [[H1624]] with him in battle. [[H4421]]

### 25
This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] will I begin [[H2490]] to put [[H5414]] the dread [[H6343]] of thee and the fear [[H3374]] of thee upon [[H5921]] the nations [[H6440]] under [[H8478]] the whole [[H3605]] heaven, [[H8064]] who [[H834]] shall hear [[H8085]] report [[H8088]] of thee, and shall tremble, [[H7264]] and be in anguish [[H2342]] because of thee. [[H6440]]

### 26
And I sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] out of the wilderness [[H4057]] of Kedemoth [[H6932]] unto [[H413]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] with words [[H1697]] of peace, [[H7965]] saying, [[H559]]

### 27
Let me pass [[H5674]] through thy land: [[H776]] I will go [[H1980]] along by the high way, [[H1870]] I will neither [[H3808]] turn [[H5493]] unto the right hand [[H3225]] nor to the left. [[H8040]]

### 28
Thou shalt sell [[H7666]] me meat [[H400]] for money, [[H3701]] that I may eat; [[H398]] and give [[H5414]] me water [[H4325]] for money, [[H3701]] that I may drink: [[H8354]] only [[H7535]] I will pass through [[H5674]] on my feet; [[H7272]]

### 29
(As [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Esau [[H6215]] which dwell [[H3427]] in Seir, [[H8165]] and the Moabites [[H4125]] which dwell [[H3427]] in Ar, [[H6144]] did [[H6213]] unto me;) until [[H5704]] I shall pass over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] us. [[H5414]]

### 30
But Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] let us pass [[H5674]] by him: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hardened [[H7185]] his spirit, [[H7307]] and made his heart [[H3824]] obstinate, [[H553]] that [[H4616]] he might deliver [[H5414]] him into thy hand, [[H3027]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 31
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Behold, [[H7200]] I have begun [[H2490]] to give [[H5414]] Sihon [[H5511]] and his land [[H776]] before [[H6440]] thee: begin [[H2490]] to possess, [[H3423]] that thou mayest inherit [[H3423]] his land. [[H776]]

### 32
Then Sihon [[H5511]] came out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] us, he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] to fight [[H4421]] at Jahaz. [[H3096]]

### 33
And the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] delivered [[H5414]] him before [[H6440]] us; and we smote [[H5221]] him, and his sons, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 34
And we took [[H3920]] all [[H3605]] his cities [[H5892]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] and utterly destroyed [[H2763]] the men, [[H4962]] and the women, [[H802]] and the little ones, [[H2945]] of every [[H3605]] city, [[H5892]] we left [[H7604]] none [[H3808]] to remain: [[H8300]]

### 35
Only [[H7535]] the cattle [[H929]] we took for a prey [[H962]] unto ourselves, and the spoil [[H7998]] of the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] we took. [[H3920]]

### 36
From Aroer, [[H6177]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the brink [[H8193]] of the river [[H5158]] of Arnon, [[H769]] and the city [[H5892]] that [[H834]] by the river, [[H5158]] even unto [[H5704]] Gilead, [[H1568]] there was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] one city [[H7151]] too strong [[H7682]] for us: [[H4480]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] delivered [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] unto us: [[H6440]]

### 37
Only [[H7535]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] thou camest [[H7126]] not, [[H3808]] unto any [[H3605]] place [[H3027]] of the river [[H5158]] Jabbok, [[H2999]] nor unto the cities [[H5892]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] nor unto whatsoever [[H3605]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] forbad [[H6680]] us. [[H6680]]
