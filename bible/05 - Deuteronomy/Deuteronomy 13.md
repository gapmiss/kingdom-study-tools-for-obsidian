### 1
If [[H3588]] there arise [[H6965]] among [[H7130]] you a prophet, [[H5030]] or [[H176]] a dreamer [[H2492]] of dreams, [[H2472]] and giveth [[H5414]] thee a sign [[H226]] or [[H176]] a wonder, [[H4159]]

### 2
And the sign [[H226]] or the wonder [[H4159]] come to pass, [[H935]] whereof [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Let us go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] thou hast not [[H3808]] known, [[H3045]] and let us serve [[H5647]] them; [[H5647]]

### 3
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of that [[H1931]] prophet, [[H5030]] or [[H176]] that [[H1931]] dreamer [[H2492]] of dreams: [[H2472]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] proveth [[H5254]] you, to know [[H3045]] whether ye [[H3426]] love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] your soul. [[H5315]]

### 4
Ye shall walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and fear [[H3372]] him, and keep [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H4687]] and obey [[H8085]] his voice, [[H6963]] and ye shall serve [[H5647]] him, and cleave [[H1692]] unto him. [[H1692]]

### 5
And that [[H1931]] prophet, [[H5030]] or [[H176]] that [[H1931]] dreamer [[H2492]] of dreams, [[H2472]] shall be put to death; [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] he hath spoken [[H1696]] to turn [[H5627]] away from [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and redeemed [[H6299]] you out of the house [[H1004]] of bondage, [[H5650]] to thrust [[H5080]] thee out of [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] thee to walk [[H3212]] in. So shalt thou put [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] away from the midst [[H7130]] of thee. [[H7130]]

### 6
If [[H3588]] thy brother, [[H251]] the son [[H1121]] of thy mother, [[H517]] or [[H176]] thy son, [[H1121]] or [[H176]] thy daughter, [[H1323]] or [[H176]] the wife [[H802]] of thy bosom, [[H2436]] or [[H176]] thy friend, [[H7453]] which [[H834]] as thine own soul, [[H5315]] entice [[H5496]] thee secretly, [[H5643]] saying, [[H559]] Let us go [[H1980]] and serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] thou hast not [[H3808]] known, [[H3045]] thou, [[H859]] nor thy fathers; [[H1]]

### 7
of the gods [[H430]] of the people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] you, nigh [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] thee, or [[H176]] far off [[H7350]] from [[H4480]] thee, from the end [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] even unto [[H5704]] the end [[H7097]] of the earth; [[H776]]

### 8
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] consent [[H14]] unto him, nor [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] him; neither [[H3808]] shall thine eye [[H5869]] pity [[H2347]] him, neither [[H3808]] shalt thou spare, [[H2550]] neither [[H3808]] shalt thou conceal [[H3680]] him: [[H5921]]

### 9
But [[H3588]] thou shalt surely [[H2026]] kill [[H2026]] him; thine hand [[H3027]] shall be [[H1961]] first [[H7223]] upon him to put him to death, [[H4191]] and afterwards [[H314]] the hand [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 10
And thou shalt stone [[H5619]] him with stones, [[H68]] that he die; [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] he hath sought [[H1245]] to thrust thee away [[H5080]] from [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which brought thee out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the house [[H1004]] of bondage. [[H5650]]

### 11
And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] shall hear, [[H8085]] and fear, [[H3372]] and shall do [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] any [[H1697]] such wickedness [[H7451]] as this [[H2088]] is among [[H7130]] you. [[H7130]]

### 12
If [[H3588]] thou shalt hear [[H8085]] in one [[H259]] of thy cities, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] thee to dwell [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] saying, [[H559]]

### 13
men, [[H376]] the children [[H1121]] of Belial, [[H1100]] are gone out [[H3318]] from among [[H7130]] you, and have withdrawn [[H5080]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of their city, [[H5892]] saying, [[H559]] Let us go [[H1980]] and serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] ye have not [[H3808]] known; [[H3045]]

### 14
Then shalt thou inquire, [[H1875]] and make search, [[H2713]] and ask [[H7592]] diligently; [[H3190]] and, behold, [[H2009]] truth, [[H571]] the thing [[H1697]] certain, [[H3559]] such [[H2063]] abomination [[H8441]] is wrought [[H6213]] among [[H7130]] you; [[H7130]]

### 15
Thou shalt surely [[H5221]] smite [[H5221]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] destroying it utterly, [[H2763]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein, and the cattle [[H929]] thereof, with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 16
And thou shalt gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the spoil [[H7998]] of it into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the street [[H7339]] thereof, and shalt burn [[H8313]] with fire [[H784]] the city, [[H5892]] and all [[H3605]] the spoil [[H7998]] thereof every whit, [[H3632]] for the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]] and it shall be [[H1961]] an heap [[H8510]] for ever; [[H5769]] it shall not [[H3808]] be built again. [[H1129]]

### 17
And there shall cleave [[H1692]] nought [[H3972]] of [[H4480]] the cursed thing [[H2764]] to thine hand: [[H3027]] that [[H4616]] the Lord [[H3068]] may turn [[H7725]] from the fierceness [[H2740]] of his anger, [[H639]] and shew [[H5414]] thee mercy, [[H7356]] and have compassion [[H7355]] upon thee, and multiply [[H7235]] thee, as [[H834]] he hath sworn [[H7650]] unto thy fathers; [[H1]]

### 18
When [[H3588]] thou shalt hearken [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] his commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] to do [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God.
