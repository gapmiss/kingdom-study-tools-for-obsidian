### 1
When [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall bring [[H935]] thee into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it, and hath cast out [[H5394]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] before [[H6440]] thee, the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Girgashites, [[H1622]] and the Amorites, [[H567]] and the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Perizzites, [[H6522]] and the Hivites, [[H2340]] and the Jebusites, [[H2983]] seven [[H7651]] nations [[H1471]] greater [[H7227]] and mightier [[H6099]] than [[H4480]] thou; [[H4480]]

### 2
And when the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall deliver [[H5414]] them before [[H6440]] thee; thou shalt smite [[H5221]] them, utterly [[H2763]] destroy [[H2763]] them; thou shalt make [[H3772]] no [[H3808]] covenant [[H1285]] with them, nor [[H3808]] shew mercy [[H2603]] unto them: [[H2603]]

### 3
Neither [[H3808]] shalt thou make marriages [[H2859]] with them; thy daughter [[H1323]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] unto his son, [[H1121]] nor [[H3808]] his daughter [[H1323]] shalt thou take [[H3947]] unto thy son. [[H1121]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] they will turn away [[H5493]] thy son [[H1121]] from following [[H310]] me, that they may serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods: [[H430]] so will the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] be kindled [[H2734]] against you, and destroy [[H8045]] thee suddenly. [[H4118]]

### 5
But [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] shall ye deal [[H6213]] with them; ye shall destroy [[H5422]] their altars, [[H4196]] and break down [[H7665]] their images, [[H4676]] and cut down [[H1438]] their groves, [[H842]] and burn [[H8313]] their graven images [[H6456]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] an holy [[H6918]] people [[H5971]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath chosen [[H977]] thee to be [[H1961]] a special [[H5459]] people [[H5971]] unto himself, above all [[H3605]] people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] set his love [[H2836]] upon you, nor choose [[H977]] you, because ye were more [[H7230]] in number than any [[H3605]] people; [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] the fewest [[H4592]] of all [[H3605]] people: [[H5971]]

### 8
But [[H3588]] because the Lord [[H3068]] loved [[H160]] you, and because he would keep [[H8104]] the oath [[H7621]] which [[H834]] he had sworn [[H7650]] unto your fathers, [[H1]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] brought you out [[H3318]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and redeemed [[H6299]] you out of the house [[H1004]] of bondmen, [[H5650]] from the hand [[H3027]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
Know [[H3045]] therefore that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] he [[H1931]] God, [[H430]] the faithful [[H539]] God, [[H410]] which keepeth [[H8104]] covenant [[H1285]] and mercy [[H2617]] with them that love [[H157]] him and keep [[H8104]] his commandments [[H4687]] to a thousand [[H505]] generations; [[H1755]]

### 10
And repayeth [[H7999]] them that hate [[H8130]] him to [[H413]] their face, [[H6440]] to destroy [[H6]] them: he will not [[H3808]] be slack [[H309]] to him that hateth [[H8130]] him, he will repay [[H7999]] him to [[H413]] his face. [[H6440]]

### 11
Thou shalt therefore keep [[H8104]] the commandments, [[H4687]] and the statutes, [[H2706]] and the judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] to do [[H6213]] them. [[H6213]]

### 12
Wherefore it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H6118]] ye hearken [[H8085]] to these [[H428]] judgments, [[H4941]] and keep, [[H8104]] and do [[H6213]] them, that the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall keep [[H8104]]  unto thee [[H853]] the covenant [[H1285]] and the mercy [[H2617]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers: [[H1]]

### 13
And he will love [[H157]] thee, and bless [[H1288]] thee, and multiply [[H7235]] thee: he will also bless [[H1288]] the fruit [[H6529]] of thy womb, [[H990]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of thy land, [[H127]] thy corn, [[H1715]] and thy wine, [[H8492]] and thine oil, [[H3323]] the increase [[H7698]] of thy kine, [[H504]] and the flocks [[H6251]] of thy sheep, [[H6629]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 14
Thou shalt be [[H1961]] blessed [[H1288]] above all [[H3605]] people: [[H5971]] there shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] male [[H6135]] or female barren [[H6135]] among you, or among your cattle. [[H929]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] will take away [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] thee all [[H3605]] sickness, [[H2483]] and will put [[H7760]] none [[H3605]] of the evil [[H7451]] diseases [[H4064]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] which [[H834]] thou knowest, [[H3045]] upon thee; but will lay [[H5414]] them upon all [[H3605]] that hate [[H8130]] thee. [[H8130]]

### 16
And thou shalt consume [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall deliver [[H5414]] thee; thine eye [[H5869]] shall have no pity [[H2347]] upon [[H5921]] them: neither [[H3808]] shalt thou serve [[H5647]] their gods; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] a snare [[H4170]] unto thee. [[H4170]]

### 17
If [[H3588]] thou shalt say [[H559]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] These [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] more [[H7227]] than [[H4480]] I; how [[H349]] can [[H3201]] I dispossess [[H3423]] them? [[H3423]]

### 18
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them: shalt well [[H2142]] remember [[H2142]] what [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] did [[H6213]] unto Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and unto all [[H3605]] Egypt; [[H4714]]

### 19
The great [[H1419]] temptations [[H4531]] which [[H834]] thine eyes [[H5869]] saw, [[H7200]] and the signs, [[H226]] and the wonders, [[H4159]] and the mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and the stretched out [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] whereby [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] brought thee out: [[H3318]] so [[H3651]] shall the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] do [[H6213]] unto all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of whom [[H834]] thou [[H859]] art afraid. [[H3373]]

### 20
Moreover [[H1571]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will send [[H7971]] the hornet [[H6880]] among them, until [[H5704]] they that are left, [[H7604]] and hide themselves [[H5641]] from [[H6440]] thee, be destroyed. [[H6]]

### 21
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] be affrighted [[H6206]] at [[H6440]] them: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] among [[H7130]] you, a mighty [[H1419]] God [[H410]] and terrible. [[H3372]]

### 22
And the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will put out [[H5394]] those [[H411]] nations [[H1471]] before [[H6440]] thee by little [[H4592]] and little: [[H4592]] thou mayest [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] consume [[H3615]] them at once, [[H4118]] lest [[H6435]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] increase [[H7235]] upon [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 23
But the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall deliver [[H5414]] them unto thee, [[H6440]] and shall destroy [[H1949]] them with a mighty [[H1419]] destruction, [[H4103]] until [[H5704]] they be destroyed. [[H8045]]

### 24
And he shall deliver [[H5414]] their kings [[H4428]] into thine hand, [[H3027]] and thou shalt destroy [[H6]] their name [[H8034]] from under [[H8478]] heaven: [[H8064]] there shall no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] be able to stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] thee, until [[H5704]] thou have destroyed [[H8045]] them. [[H8045]]

### 25
The graven images [[H6456]] of their gods [[H430]] shall ye burn [[H8313]] with fire: [[H784]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] desire [[H2530]] the silver [[H3701]] or gold [[H2091]] on [[H5921]] them, nor take [[H3947]] unto thee, lest [[H6435]] thou be snared [[H3369]] therein: for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] an abomination [[H8441]] to the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 26
Neither [[H3808]] shalt thou bring [[H935]] an abomination [[H8441]] into [[H413]] thine house, [[H1004]] lest thou be [[H1961]] a cursed thing [[H2764]] like it: [[H3644]] thou shalt utterly [[H8262]] detest [[H8262]] it, and thou shalt utterly [[H8581]] abhor [[H8581]] it; for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] a cursed thing. [[H2764]]
