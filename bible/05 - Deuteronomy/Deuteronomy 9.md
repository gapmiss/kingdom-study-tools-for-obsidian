### 1
Hear, [[H8085]] O Israel: [[H3478]] Thou [[H859]] to pass over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] this day, [[H3117]] to go in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] nations [[H1471]] greater [[H1419]] and mightier [[H6099]] than [[H4480]] thyself, cities [[H5892]] great [[H1419]] and fenced up [[H1219]] to heaven, [[H8064]]

### 2
A people [[H5971]] great [[H1419]] and tall, [[H7311]] the children [[H1121]] of the Anakims, [[H6062]] whom [[H834]] thou [[H859]] knowest, [[H3045]] and thou [[H859]] hast heard [[H8085]] Who [[H4310]] can stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Anak! [[H6061]]

### 3
Understand [[H3045]] therefore this day, [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] he [[H1931]] which goeth over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] thee; a consuming [[H398]] fire [[H784]] he [[H1931]] shall destroy [[H8045]] them, and he [[H1931]] shall bring them down [[H3665]] before thy face: [[H6440]] so shalt thou drive them out, [[H3423]] and destroy [[H6]] them quickly, [[H4118]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H1696]] unto thee. [[H1696]]

### 4
Speak [[H559]] not [[H408]] thou in thine heart, [[H3824]] after that the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath cast them out [[H1920]] from before [[H6440]] thee, saying, [[H559]] For my righteousness [[H6666]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath brought me in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] this [[H2063]] land: [[H776]] but for the wickedness [[H7564]] of these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] the Lord [[H3068]] doth drive them out [[H3423]] from before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 5
Not [[H3808]] for thy righteousness, [[H6666]] or for the uprightness [[H3476]] of thine heart, [[H3824]] dost thou [[H859]] go [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] their land: [[H776]] but [[H3588]] for the wickedness [[H7564]] of these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] doth drive them out [[H3423]] from before [[H6440]] thee, and that [[H4616]] he may perform [[H6965]] the word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers, [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 6
Understand [[H3045]] therefore, that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee not [[H3808]] this [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] to possess [[H3423]] it for thy righteousness; [[H6666]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a stiffnecked [[H6203]] people. [[H5971]]

### 7
Remember, [[H2142]] forget [[H7911]] not, [[H408]] how [[H834]]  thou provokedst [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] to wrath [[H7107]] in the wilderness: [[H4057]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] thou didst depart out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] until [[H5704]] ye came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] ye have been [[H1961]] rebellious [[H4784]] against [[H5973]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
Also in Horeb [[H2722]]  ye provoked [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] to wrath, [[H7107]] so that the Lord [[H3068]] was angry [[H599]] with you to have destroyed [[H8045]] you. [[H8045]]

### 9
When I was gone up [[H5927]] into the mount [[H2022]] to receive [[H3947]] the tables [[H3871]] of stone, [[H68]] the tables [[H3871]] of the covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] you, then I abode [[H3427]] in the mount [[H2022]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights, [[H3915]] I neither [[H3808]] did eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water: [[H4325]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] unto [[H413]]  me [[H853]] two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone [[H68]] written [[H3789]] with the finger [[H676]] of God; [[H430]] and on [[H5921]] them according to all [[H3605]] the words, [[H1697]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] you in the mount [[H2022]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire [[H784]] in the day [[H3117]] of the assembly. [[H6951]]

### 11
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7093]] of forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights, [[H3915]] the Lord [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]]  me [[H853]] the two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone, [[H68]] the tables [[H3871]] of the covenant. [[H1285]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Arise, [[H6965]] get thee down [[H3381]] quickly [[H4118]] from hence; [[H2088]] for [[H3588]] thy people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] thou hast brought forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] have corrupted [[H7843]] they are quickly [[H4118]] turned aside [[H5493]] out of [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] them; they have made [[H6213]] them a molten image. [[H4541]]

### 13
Furthermore the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]] I have seen [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and, behold, [[H2009]] it [[H1931]] a stiffnecked [[H6203]] people: [[H5971]]

### 14
Let me alone, [[H7503]] that I may destroy [[H8045]] them, and blot out [[H4229]] their name [[H8034]] from under [[H8478]] heaven: [[H8064]] and I will make [[H6213]] of [[H854]] thee a nation [[H1471]] mightier [[H6099]] and greater [[H7227]] than [[H4480]] they. [[H4480]]

### 15
So I turned [[H6437]] and came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mount, [[H2022]] and the mount [[H2022]] burned [[H1197]] with fire: [[H784]] and the two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of the covenant [[H1285]] in [[H5921]] my two [[H8147]] hands. [[H3027]]

### 16
And I looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] ye had sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] had made [[H6213]] you a molten [[H4541]] calf: [[H5695]] ye had turned aside [[H5493]] quickly [[H4118]] out of [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] you. [[H6680]]

### 17
And I took [[H8610]] the two [[H8147]] tables, [[H3871]] and cast [[H7993]] them out of [[H5921]] my two [[H8147]] hands, [[H3027]] and brake [[H7665]] them before your eyes. [[H5869]]

### 18
And I fell down [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as at the first, [[H7223]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights: [[H3915]] I did neither [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] nor [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water, [[H4325]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] your sins [[H2403]] which [[H834]] ye sinned, [[H2398]] in doing [[H6213]] wickedly [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to provoke him to anger. [[H3707]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] I was afraid [[H3025]] of [[H6440]] the anger [[H639]] and hot displeasure, [[H2534]] wherewith [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] was wroth [[H7107]] against [[H5921]] you to destroy [[H8045]] you. But the Lord [[H3068]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me at that [[H1931]] time [[H6471]] also. [[H1571]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] was very [[H3966]] angry [[H599]] with Aaron [[H175]] to have destroyed [[H8045]] him: and I prayed [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] Aaron [[H175]] also [[H1571]] the same [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

### 21
And I took [[H3947]] your sin, [[H2403]] the calf [[H5695]] which [[H834]] ye had made, [[H6213]] and burnt [[H8313]] it with fire, [[H784]] and stamped [[H3807]] it, ground [[H2912]] very small, [[H3190]] until [[H5704]] it [[H834]] was as small [[H1854]] as dust: [[H6083]] and I cast [[H7993]] the dust [[H6083]] thereof into [[H413]] the brook [[H5158]] that descended out [[H3381]] of [[H4480]] the mount. [[H2022]]

### 22
And at Taberah, [[H8404]] and at Massah, [[H4532]] and at Kibroth-hattaavah, [[H6914]]  ye provoked [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] to wrath. [[H7107]]

### 23
Likewise when the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] you from Kadesh-barnea, [[H6947]] saying, [[H559]] Go up [[H5927]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] you; then ye rebelled against [[H4784]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and ye believed [[H539]] him not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] to his voice. [[H6963]]

### 24
Ye have been [[H1961]] rebellious [[H4784]] against [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] from the day [[H3117]] that I knew [[H3045]] you. [[H3045]]

### 25
Thus I fell down [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights, [[H3915]] as [[H834]] I fell down [[H5307]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] he would destroy [[H8045]] you. [[H8045]]

### 26
I prayed [[H6419]] therefore unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3068]] destroy [[H7843]] not [[H408]] thy people [[H5971]] and thine inheritance, [[H5159]] which [[H834]] thou hast redeemed [[H6299]] through thy greatness, [[H1433]] which [[H834]] thou hast brought forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 27
Remember [[H2142]] thy servants, [[H5650]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob; [[H3290]] look [[H6437]] not [[H408]] unto [[H413]] the stubbornness [[H7190]] of this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] nor to [[H413]] their wickedness, [[H7562]] nor to [[H413]] their sin: [[H2403]]

### 28
Lest [[H6435]] the land [[H776]] whence [[H834]] thou broughtest us out [[H3318]] say, [[H559]] Because the Lord [[H3068]] was not able [[H3201]] to bring [[H935]] them into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] he promised [[H1696]] them, and because he hated [[H8135]] them, he hath brought them out [[H3318]] to slay [[H4191]] them in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 29
Yet they [[H1992]] thy people [[H5971]] and thine inheritance, [[H5159]] which [[H834]] thou broughtest out [[H3318]] by thy mighty [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and by thy stretched out [[H5186]] arm. [[H2220]]
