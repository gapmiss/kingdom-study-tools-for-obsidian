If [[H3588]] be found [[H4672]] slain [[H2491]] in the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee to possess [[H3423]] it, lying [[H5307]] in the field, [[H7704]] it be not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] who [[H4310]] hath slain [[H5221]] him: [[H5221]]

### 2
Then thy elders [[H2205]] and thy judges [[H8199]] shall come forth, [[H3318]] and they shall measure [[H4058]] unto [[H413]] the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] him that is slain: [[H2491]]

### 3
And it shall be, [[H1961]] the city [[H5892]] next [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] the slain man, [[H2491]] even the elders [[H2205]] of that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] shall take [[H3947]] an heifer, [[H1241]] which [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] been wrought with, [[H5647]] which [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] drawn [[H4900]] in the yoke; [[H5923]]

### 4
And the elders [[H2205]] of that [[H1931]] city [[H5892]] shall bring down [[H3381]] the heifer [[H5697]] unto [[H413]] a rough [[H386]] valley, [[H5158]] which [[H834]] is neither [[H3808]] eared [[H5647]] nor [[H3808]] sown, [[H2232]]  and shall strike off [[H853]] the heifer's [[H5697]] neck [[H6202]] there [[H8033]] in the valley: [[H5158]]

### 5
And the priests [[H3548]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] shall come near; [[H5066]] for [[H3588]] them the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath chosen [[H977]] to minister [[H8334]] unto him, and to bless [[H1288]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and by [[H5921]] their word [[H6310]] shall every [[H3605]] controversy [[H7379]] and every [[H3605]] stroke [[H5061]] be [[H1961]]

### 6
And all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of that [[H1931]] city, [[H5892]] next [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] the slain [[H2491]] shall wash [[H7364]] their hands [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the heifer [[H5697]] that is beheaded [[H6202]] in the valley: [[H5158]]

### 7
And they shall answer [[H6030]] and say, [[H559]] Our hands [[H3027]] have not [[H3808]] shed [[H8210]] this [[H2088]] blood, [[H1818]] neither [[H3808]] have our eyes [[H5869]] seen [[H7200]]

### 8
Be merciful, [[H3722]] O Lord, [[H3068]] unto thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] thou hast redeemed, [[H6299]] and lay [[H5414]] not [[H408]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] unto thy people [[H5971]] of Israel's [[H3478]] charge. [[H7130]] And the blood [[H1818]] shall be forgiven [[H3722]] them. [[H3722]]

### 9
So shalt thou [[H859]] put away [[H1197]] the innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] from among [[H7130]] you, when [[H3588]] thou shalt do [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
When [[H3588]] thou goest forth [[H3318]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] thine enemies, [[H341]] and the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath delivered [[H5414]] them into thine hands, [[H3027]] and thou hast taken [[H7617]] them captive, [[H7617]]

### 11
And seest [[H7200]] among the captives [[H7633]] a beautiful [[H8389]] woman, [[H802]] and hast a desire [[H2836]] unto her, that thou wouldest have her [[H3947]] to thy wife; [[H802]]

### 12
Then thou shalt bring [[H935]] her home [[H8432]] to thine house; [[H1004]] and she shall shave [[H1548]] her head, [[H7218]] and pare [[H6213]] her nails; [[H6856]]

### 13
And she shall put [[H5493]] the raiment [[H8071]] of her captivity [[H7628]] from off [[H5921]] her, and shall remain [[H3427]] in thine house, [[H1004]] and bewail [[H1058]] her father [[H1]] and her mother [[H517]] a full [[H3117]] month: [[H3391]] and after [[H310]] that [[H3651]] thou shalt go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her, and be her husband, [[H1167]] and she shall be [[H1961]] thy wife. [[H802]]

### 14
And it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] thou have no delight [[H2654]] in her, then thou shalt let her go [[H7971]] whither she will; [[H5315]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] sell [[H4376]] her at all [[H4376]] for money, [[H3701]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] make merchandise [[H6014]] of her, because [[H834]] thou hast humbled [[H6031]] her. [[H6031]]

### 15
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] have [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] one [[H259]] beloved, [[H157]] and another [[H259]] hated, [[H8130]] and they have born [[H3205]] him children, [[H1121]] the beloved [[H157]] and the hated; [[H8130]] and the firstborn [[H1060]] son [[H1121]] be [[H1961]] hers that was hated: [[H8146]]

### 16
Then it shall be, [[H1961]] when [[H3117]]  he maketh [[H853]] his sons [[H1121]] to inherit [[H5157]] which [[H834]] he hath, [[H1961]] he may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]]  make [[H853]] the son [[H1121]] of the beloved [[H157]] firstborn [[H1060]] before [[H6440]] the son [[H1121]] of the hated, [[H8130]] the firstborn: [[H1060]]

### 17
But [[H3588]] he shall acknowledge [[H5234]] the son [[H1121]] of the hated [[H8130]] the firstborn, [[H1060]] by giving [[H5414]] him a double [[H8147]] portion [[H6310]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath: [[H4672]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] the beginning [[H7225]] of his strength; [[H202]] the right [[H4941]] of the firstborn [[H1062]] his. [[H1062]]

### 18
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] have [[H1961]] a stubborn [[H5637]] and rebellious [[H4784]] son, [[H1121]] which will not [[H369]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of his father, [[H1]] or the voice [[H6963]] of his mother, [[H517]] and when they have chastened [[H3256]] him, will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] them: [[H413]]

### 19
Then shall his father [[H1]] and his mother [[H517]] lay hold [[H8610]] on him, and bring him out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] of his city, [[H5892]] and unto [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] of his place; [[H4725]]

### 20
And they shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] of his city, [[H5892]] This [[H2088]] our son [[H1121]] stubborn [[H5637]] and rebellious, [[H4784]] he will not [[H369]] obey [[H8085]] our voice; [[H6963]] a glutton, [[H2151]] and a drunkard. [[H5433]]

### 21
And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of his city [[H5892]] shall stone [[H7275]] him with stones, [[H68]] that he die: [[H4191]] so shalt thou put [[H1197]] evil [[H7451]] away from among [[H7130]] you; and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] shall hear, [[H8085]] and fear. [[H3372]]

### 22
And if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] have committed [[H1961]] a sin [[H2399]] worthy of [[H4941]] death, [[H4194]] and he be to be put to death, [[H4191]] and thou hang [[H8518]] him on [[H5921]] a tree: [[H6086]]

### 23
His body [[H5038]] shall not [[H3808]] remain all night [[H3885]] upon [[H5921]] the tree, [[H6086]] but [[H3588]] thou shalt in any wise [[H6912]] bury [[H6912]] him that [[H1931]] day; [[H3117]] (for [[H3588]] he that is hanged [[H8518]] accursed [[H7045]] of God;) [[H430]]  that [[H853]] thy land [[H127]] be not [[H3808]] defiled, [[H2930]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee an inheritance.
