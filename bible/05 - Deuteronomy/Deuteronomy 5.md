And Moses [[H4872]] called [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Hear, [[H8085]] O Israel, [[H3478]] the statutes [[H2706]] and judgments [[H4941]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] speak [[H1696]] in your ears [[H241]] this day, [[H3117]] that ye may learn [[H3925]] them, and keep, [[H8104]] and do [[H6213]] them. [[H6213]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] us in Horeb. [[H2722]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] made [[H3772]] not [[H3808]] this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] our fathers, [[H1]] but [[H3588]] with us, [[H854]] us, [[H587]] who [[H428]] all [[H3605]] of us here [[H6311]] alive [[H2416]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 4
The Lord [[H3068]] talked [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] you face [[H6440]] to face [[H6440]] in the mount [[H2022]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire, [[H784]]

### 5
(I [[H595]] stood [[H5975]] between [[H996]] the Lord [[H3068]] and you at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] to shew [[H5046]]  you [[H853]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] ye were afraid [[H3372]] by reason [[H6440]] of the fire, [[H784]] and went not up [[H5927]] into the mount;) [[H2022]] saying, [[H559]]

### 6
I [[H595]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] brought out [[H3318]] thee of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the house [[H1004]] of bondage. [[H5650]]

### 7
Thou shalt have [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] before [[H6440]] me. [[H5921]]

### 8
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] thee graven image, [[H6459]] any [[H3605]] likeness [[H8544]] that [[H834]] in heaven [[H8064]] above, [[H4605]] or that [[H834]] in the earth [[H776]] beneath, [[H8478]] or that [[H834]] in the waters [[H4325]] beneath [[H8478]] the earth: [[H776]]

### 9
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] bow down thyself [[H7812]] unto them, nor [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] them: for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] a jealous [[H7067]] God, [[H410]] visiting [[H6485]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] upon [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] unto [[H5921]] the third [[H8029]] and fourth [[H7256]] of them that hate [[H8130]] me, [[H8130]]

### 10
And shewing [[H6213]] mercy [[H2617]] unto thousands [[H505]] of them that love [[H157]] me and keep [[H8104]] my commandments. [[H4687]]

### 11
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] take [[H5375]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] in vain: [[H7723]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] hold guiltless [[H5352]] that [[H834]] taketh [[H5375]] his name [[H8034]] in vain. [[H7723]]

### 12
Keep [[H8104]] the sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] to sanctify [[H6942]] it, as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath commanded [[H6680]] thee. [[H6680]]

### 13
Six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] thou shalt labour, [[H5647]] and do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] thy work: [[H4399]]

### 14
But the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the sabbath [[H7676]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work, [[H4399]] thou, [[H859]] nor thy son, [[H1121]] nor thy daughter, [[H1323]] nor thy manservant, [[H5650]] nor thy maidservant, [[H519]] nor thine ox, [[H7794]] nor thine ass, [[H2543]] nor any [[H3605]] of thy cattle, [[H929]] nor thy stranger [[H1616]] that [[H834]] within thy gates; [[H8179]] that [[H4616]] thy manservant [[H5650]] and thy maidservant [[H519]] may rest [[H5117]] as well as thou. [[H5117]]

### 15
And remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] thou wast [[H1961]] a servant [[H5650]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] brought [[H3318]] thee out thence [[H8033]] through a mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and by a stretched out [[H5186]] arm: [[H2220]] therefore [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] thee to keep [[H6213]] the sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]]

### 16
Honour [[H3513]] thy father [[H1]] and thy mother, [[H517]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath commanded [[H6680]] thee; that [[H4616]] thy days [[H3117]] may be prolonged, [[H748]] and that [[H4616]] it may go well [[H3190]] with thee, in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 17
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] kill. [[H7523]]

### 18
Neither [[H3808]] shalt thou commit adultery. [[H5003]]

### 19
Neither [[H3808]] shalt thou steal. [[H1589]]

### 20
Neither [[H3808]] shalt thou bear [[H6030]] false [[H7723]] witness [[H5707]] against thy neighbour. [[H7453]]

### 21
Neither [[H3808]] shalt thou desire [[H2530]] thy neighbour's [[H7453]] wife, [[H802]] neither [[H3808]] shalt thou covet [[H183]] thy neighbour's [[H7453]] house, [[H1004]] his field, [[H7704]] or his manservant, [[H5650]] or his maidservant, [[H519]] his ox, [[H7794]] or his ass, [[H2543]] or any [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thy neighbour's. [[H7453]]

### 22
These [[H428]] words [[H1697]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] your assembly [[H6951]] in the mount [[H2022]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire, [[H784]] of the cloud, [[H6051]] and of the thick darkness, [[H6205]] with a great [[H1419]] voice: [[H6963]] and he added no more. [[H3254]] And he wrote [[H3789]] them in [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] tables [[H3871]] of stone, [[H68]] and delivered [[H5414]] them unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 23
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when ye heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the darkness, [[H2822]] (for the mountain [[H2022]] did burn [[H1197]] with fire,) [[H784]] that ye came near [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] me, all [[H3605]] the heads [[H7218]] of your tribes, [[H7626]] and your elders; [[H2205]]

### 24
And ye said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] hath shewed [[H7200]]  us [[H853]] his glory [[H3519]] and his greatness, [[H1433]] and we have heard [[H8085]] his voice [[H6963]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire: [[H784]] we have seen [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] doth talk [[H1696]] with [[H854]] man, [[H120]] and he liveth. [[H2425]]

### 25
Now [[H6258]] therefore why [[H4100]] should we die? [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] fire [[H784]] will consume [[H398]] us: if [[H518]] we [[H587]] hear [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] any more, [[H3254]] then we shall die. [[H4191]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] that [[H834]] hath heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the living [[H2416]] God [[H430]] speaking [[H1696]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the fire, [[H784]] as we [[H3644]] and lived? [[H2421]]

### 27
Go thou near, [[H7126]] and hear [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] shall say: [[H559]] and speak [[H1696]] thou [[H859]] unto [[H413]]  us [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] shall speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee; and we will hear [[H8085]] and do [[H6213]]

### 28
And the Lord [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of your words, [[H1697]] when ye spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me; and the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, I have heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] they have spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee: they have well said [[H3190]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] they have spoken. [[H1696]]

### 29
O that [[H4310]] there were [[H1961]] such [[H2088]] an heart [[H3824]] in them, [[H5414]] that they would fear [[H3372]] me, and keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] my commandments [[H4687]] always, [[H3117]] that [[H4616]] it might be well [[H3190]] with them, and with their children [[H1121]] for ever! [[H5769]]

### 30
Go [[H1980]] say [[H559]] to them, Get [[H7725]] you into your tents [[H168]] again. [[H168]]

### 31
But as for thee, [[H859]] stand [[H5975]] thou here [[H6311]] by me, [[H5978]] and I will speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]]  thee [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the commandments, [[H4687]] and the statutes, [[H2706]] and the judgments, [[H4941]] which [[H834]] thou shalt teach [[H3925]] them, that they may do [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] give [[H5414]] them to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 32
Ye shall observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] therefore as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath commanded [[H6680]] you: ye shall not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] to the right hand [[H3225]] or to the left. [[H8040]]

### 33
Ye shall walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] hath commanded [[H6680]] you, that [[H4616]] ye may live, [[H2421]] and well [[H2895]] with you, and ye may prolong [[H748]] days [[H3117]] in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] ye shall possess.
