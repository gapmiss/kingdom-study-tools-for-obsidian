### 1
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] are come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee, the blessing [[H1293]] and the curse, [[H7045]] which [[H834]] I have set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] thee, and thou shalt call [[H7725]] to [[H413]] mind [[H3824]] among all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H1471]] whither [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath driven [[H5080]] thee, [[H5080]]

### 2
And shalt return [[H7725]] unto [[H5704]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and shalt obey [[H8085]] his voice [[H6963]] according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] thou [[H859]] and thy children, [[H1121]] with all [[H3605]] thine heart, [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] thy soul; [[H5315]]

### 3
That then the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will turn [[H7725]] thy captivity, [[H7622]] and have compassion [[H7355]] upon thee, and will return [[H7725]] and gather [[H6908]] thee from all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H5971]] whither [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath scattered [[H6327]] thee. [[H6327]]

### 4
If [[H518]] of thine be [[H1961]] driven out [[H5080]] unto the outmost [[H7097]] of heaven, [[H8064]] from thence [[H8033]] will the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] gather [[H6908]] thee, and from thence [[H8033]] will he fetch [[H3947]] thee: [[H3947]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will bring [[H935]] thee into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] thy fathers [[H1]] possessed, [[H3423]] and thou shalt possess [[H3423]] it; and he will do thee good, [[H3190]] and multiply [[H7235]] thee above thy fathers. [[H1]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will circumcise [[H4135]] thine heart, [[H3824]] and the heart [[H3824]] of thy seed, [[H2233]] to love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] thine heart, [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] thy soul, [[H5315]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest live. [[H2416]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will put [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] curses [[H423]] upon [[H5921]] thine enemies, [[H341]] and on [[H5921]] them that hate [[H8130]] thee, which [[H834]] persecuted [[H7291]] thee. [[H7291]]

### 8
And thou [[H859]] shalt return [[H7725]] and obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] his commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day. [[H3117]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will make thee plenteous [[H3498]] in every [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] of thine hand, [[H3027]] in the fruit [[H6529]] of thy body, [[H990]] and in the fruit [[H6529]] of thy cattle, [[H929]] and in the fruit [[H6529]] of thy land, [[H127]] for good: [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will again [[H7725]] rejoice [[H7797]] over [[H5921]] thee for good, [[H2896]] as [[H834]] he rejoiced [[H7797]] over [[H5921]] thy fathers: [[H1]]

### 10
If [[H3588]] thou shalt hearken [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to keep [[H8104]] his commandments [[H4687]] and his statutes [[H2708]] which are written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] of the law, [[H8451]] if [[H3588]] thou turn [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] thine heart, [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] commandment [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] it [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] hidden [[H6381]] from [[H4480]] thee, neither [[H3808]] it [[H1931]] far off. [[H7350]]

### 12
It [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] in heaven, [[H8064]] that thou shouldest say, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall go up [[H5927]] for us to heaven, [[H8064]] and bring [[H3947]] it unto us, that we may hear [[H8085]] it, and do [[H6213]] it? [[H6213]]

### 13
Neither [[H3808]] it [[H1931]] beyond [[H5676]] the sea, [[H3220]] that thou shouldest say, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall go [[H5674]] over [[H5676]] the sea [[H3220]] for us, and bring [[H3947]] it unto us, that we may hear [[H8085]] it, and do [[H6213]] it? [[H6213]]

### 14
But [[H3588]] the word [[H1697]] very [[H3966]] nigh [[H7138]] unto [[H413]] thee, in thy mouth, [[H6310]] and in thy heart, [[H3824]] that thou mayest do [[H6213]] it. [[H6213]]

### 15
See, [[H7200]] I have set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] thee this day [[H3117]] life [[H2416]] and good, [[H2896]] and death [[H4194]] and evil; [[H7451]]

### 16
In that [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day [[H3117]] to love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in his ways, [[H1870]] and to keep [[H8104]] his commandments [[H4687]] and his statutes [[H2708]] and his judgments, [[H4941]] that thou mayest live [[H2421]] and multiply: [[H7235]] and the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall bless [[H1288]] thee in the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 17
But if [[H518]] thine heart [[H3824]] turn away, [[H6437]] so that thou wilt not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] but shalt be drawn away, [[H5080]] and worship [[H7812]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and serve [[H5647]] them; [[H5647]]

### 18
I denounce [[H5046]] unto you this day, [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] ye shall surely [[H6]] perish, [[H6]] ye shall not [[H3808]] prolong [[H748]] days [[H3117]] upon [[H5921]] the land, [[H127]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] passest over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] to go [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 19
I call [[H5749]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] to record this day [[H3117]] against you, I have set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you life [[H2416]] and death, [[H4194]] blessing [[H1293]] and cursing: [[H7045]] therefore choose [[H977]] life, [[H2416]] that [[H4616]] both thou [[H859]] and thy seed [[H2233]] may live: [[H2421]]

### 20
That thou mayest love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] that thou mayest obey [[H8085]] his voice, [[H6963]] and that thou mayest cleave [[H1692]] unto him: for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] thy life, [[H2416]] and the length [[H753]] of thy days: [[H3117]] that thou mayest dwell [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers, [[H1]] to Abraham, [[H85]] to Isaac, [[H3327]] and to Jacob, [[H3290]] to give [[H5414]] them.
