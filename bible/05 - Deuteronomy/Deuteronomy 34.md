[[H3405]] And the Lord [[H3068]] shewed [[H7200]]  him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] unto [[H5704]] Dan, [[H1835]]

And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, This [[H2063]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto Abraham, [[H85]] unto Isaac, [[H3327]] and unto Jacob, [[H3290]] saying, [[H559]] I will give [[H5414]] it unto thy seed: [[H2233]] I have caused thee to see [[H7200]] with thine eyes, [[H5869]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] go over [[H5674]] thither. [[H8033]]

And he buried [[H6912]] him in a valley [[H1516]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] over against [[H4136]] Beth-peor: [[H1047]] but no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] knoweth [[H3045]]  of [[H853]] his sepulchre [[H6900]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 7
And Moses [[H4872]] an hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he died: [[H4194]] his eye [[H5869]] was not dim, [[H3543]] nor [[H3808]] his natural force [[H3893]] abated. [[H5127]]

### 8
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] wept [[H1058]]  for [[H853]] Moses [[H4872]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] thirty [[H7970]] days: [[H3117]] so the days [[H3117]] of weeping [[H1065]] mourning [[H60]] for Moses [[H4872]] were ended. [[H8552]]

### 9
And Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] was full [[H4392]] of the spirit [[H7307]] of wisdom; [[H2451]] for [[H3588]] Moses [[H4872]] had laid [[H5564]] his hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] him: and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] him, and did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 10
And there arose [[H6965]] not [[H3808]] a prophet [[H5030]] since [[H5750]] in Israel [[H3478]] like unto Moses, [[H4872]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] knew [[H3045]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face, [[H6440]]

### 11
In all [[H3605]] the signs [[H226]] and the wonders, [[H4159]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] him to do [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and to all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5650]] and to all [[H3605]] his land, [[H776]]

### 12
And in all [[H3605]] that mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and in all [[H3605]] the great [[H1419]] terror [[H4172]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] shewed [[H6213]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]
