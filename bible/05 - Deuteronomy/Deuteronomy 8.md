### 1
All [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day [[H3117]] shall ye observe [[H8104]] to do, [[H6213]] that [[H4616]] ye may live, [[H2421]] and multiply, [[H7235]] and go in [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto your fathers. [[H1]]

### 2
And thou shalt remember [[H2142]] all [[H3605]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] led [[H1980]] thee these [[H2088]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] to [[H4616]] humble [[H6031]] thee, to prove [[H5254]] thee, to know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] whether thou wouldest keep [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H4687]] or [[H518]] no. [[H3808]]

### 3
And he humbled [[H6031]] thee, and suffered thee to hunger, [[H7456]] and fed [[H398]] thee with [[H853]] manna, [[H4478]] which [[H834]] thou knewest [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] did thy fathers [[H1]] know; [[H3045]] that [[H4616]] he might make thee know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] man [[H120]] doth not [[H3808]] live [[H2421]] by [[H5921]] bread [[H3899]] only, [[H905]] but [[H3588]] by [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] that proceedeth out [[H4161]] of the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] doth man [[H120]] live. [[H2421]]

### 4
Thy raiment [[H8071]] waxed not old [[H1086]] upon [[H5921]] thee, neither [[H3808]] did thy foot [[H7272]] swell, [[H1216]] these [[H2088]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

### 5
Thou shalt also consider [[H3045]] in [[H5973]] thine heart, [[H3824]] that, [[H3588]] as [[H834]] a man [[H376]] chasteneth [[H3256]] his son, [[H1121]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] chasteneth [[H3256]] thee. [[H3256]]

### 6
Therefore thou shalt keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in his ways, [[H1870]] and to fear [[H3372]] him. [[H3372]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] bringeth [[H935]] thee into [[H413]] a good [[H2896]] land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] of brooks [[H5158]] of water, [[H4325]] of fountains [[H5869]] and depths [[H8415]] that spring out [[H3318]] of valleys [[H1237]] and hills; [[H2022]]

### 8
A land [[H776]] of wheat, [[H2406]] and barley, [[H8184]] and vines, [[H1612]] and fig trees, [[H8384]] and pomegranates; [[H7416]] a land [[H776]] of oil [[H8081]] olive, [[H2132]] and honey; [[H1706]]

### 9
A land [[H776]] wherein [[H834]] thou shalt eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] without [[H3808]] scarceness, [[H4544]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] lack [[H2637]] any [[H3605]] in it; a land [[H776]] whose [[H834]] stones [[H68]] iron, [[H1270]] and out of whose hills [[H2042]] thou mayest dig [[H2672]] brass. [[H5178]]

### 10
When thou hast eaten [[H398]] and art full, [[H7646]] then thou shalt bless [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] for [[H5921]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] which [[H834]] he hath given [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 11
Beware [[H8104]] that thou forget [[H7911]] not [[H6435]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] in not [[H1115]] keeping [[H8104]] his commandments, [[H4687]] and his judgments, [[H4941]] and his statutes, [[H2708]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day: [[H3117]]

### 12
Lest [[H6435]] thou hast eaten [[H398]] and art full, [[H7646]] and hast built [[H1129]] goodly [[H2896]] houses, [[H1004]] and dwelt [[H3427]]

### 13
And thy herds [[H1241]] and thy flocks [[H6629]] multiply, [[H7235]] and thy silver [[H3701]] and thy gold [[H2091]] is multiplied, [[H7235]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou hast is multiplied; [[H7235]]

### 14
Then thine heart [[H3824]] be lifted up, [[H7311]] and thou forget [[H7911]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which brought thee forth [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from the house [[H1004]] of bondage; [[H5650]]

### 15
Who led [[H1980]] thee through that great [[H1419]] and terrible [[H3372]] wilderness, [[H4057]] fiery [[H8314]] serpents, [[H5175]] and scorpions, [[H6137]] and drought, [[H6774]] where [[H834]] no [[H369]] water; [[H4325]] who brought thee forth [[H3318]] water [[H4325]] out of the rock [[H6697]] of flint; [[H2496]]

### 16
Who fed [[H398]] thee in the wilderness [[H4057]] with manna, [[H4478]] which [[H834]] thy fathers [[H1]] knew [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] that [[H4616]] he might humble [[H6031]] thee, and that [[H4616]] he might prove [[H5254]] thee, to do thee good [[H3190]] at thy latter end; [[H319]]

### 17
And thou say [[H559]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] My power [[H3581]] and the might [[H6108]] of hand [[H3027]] hath gotten [[H6213]]  me [[H853]] this [[H2088]] wealth. [[H2428]]

### 18
But thou shalt remember [[H2142]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] that giveth [[H5414]] thee power [[H3581]] to get [[H6213]] wealth, [[H2428]] that [[H4616]] he may establish [[H6965]] his covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers, [[H1]] as this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 19
And it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] thou do at all [[H7911]] forget [[H7911]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and walk [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and serve [[H5647]] them, and worship [[H7812]] them, I testify [[H5749]] against you this day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] ye shall surely [[H6]] perish. [[H6]]

### 20
As the nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] destroyeth [[H6]] before your face, [[H6440]] so [[H3651]] shall ye perish; [[H6]] because [[H6118]] ye would not [[H3808]] be obedient [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]
