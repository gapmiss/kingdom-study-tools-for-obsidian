### 20
all [[H3605]] clean [[H2889]] fowls [[H5775]] ye may eat. [[H398]]

### 21
Ye shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] thing that dieth of itself: [[H5038]] thou shalt give [[H5414]] it unto the stranger [[H1616]] that [[H834]] in thy gates, [[H8179]] that he may eat [[H398]] it; or [[H176]] thou mayest sell [[H4376]] it unto an alien: [[H5237]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] an holy [[H6918]] people [[H5971]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] seethe [[H1310]] a kid [[H1423]] in his mother's [[H517]] milk. [[H2461]]

[[H3117]]

### 24
And if [[H3588]] the way [[H1870]] be too long [[H7235]] for [[H4480]] thee, so that [[H3588]] thou art not able [[H3201]] to carry [[H5375]] it; if [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] be too far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] thee, which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] shall choose [[H977]] to set [[H7760]] his name [[H8034]] there, [[H8033]] when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath blessed [[H1288]] thee: [[H1288]]

### 26
And thou shalt bestow [[H5414]] that money [[H3701]] for whatsoever [[H3605]] thy soul [[H5315]] lusteth after, [[H183]] for oxen, [[H1241]] or for sheep, [[H6629]] or for wine, [[H3196]] or for strong drink, [[H7941]] or for whatsoever [[H3605]] thy soul [[H5315]] desireth: [[H7592]] and thou shalt eat [[H398]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and thou shalt rejoice, [[H8055]] thou, [[H859]] and thine household, [[H1004]]

### 27
And the Levite [[H3881]] that [[H834]] within thy gates; [[H8179]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] him; for [[H3588]] he hath no [[H369]] part [[H2506]] nor inheritance [[H5159]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 28
At the end [[H7097]] of three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] thou shalt bring forth [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] the tithe [[H4643]] of thine increase [[H8393]] the same [[H1931]] year, [[H8141]] and shalt lay up [[H3240]] within thy gates: [[H8179]]

### 29
And the Levite, [[H3881]] (because [[H3588]] he hath no [[H369]] part [[H2506]] nor inheritance [[H5159]] with [[H5973]] thee,) and the stranger, [[H1616]] and the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow, [[H490]] which [[H834]] within thy gates, [[H8179]] shall come, [[H935]] and shall eat [[H398]] and be satisfied; [[H7646]] that [[H4616]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] may bless [[H1288]] thee in all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of thine hand [[H3027]] which [[H834]] thou doest.
