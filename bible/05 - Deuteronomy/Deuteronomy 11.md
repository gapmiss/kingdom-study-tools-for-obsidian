### 1
Therefore thou shalt love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and keep [[H8104]] his charge, [[H4931]] and his statutes, [[H2708]] and his judgments, [[H4941]] and his commandments, [[H4687]] alway. [[H3117]]

### 2
And know [[H3045]] ye this day: [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] with [[H854]] your children [[H1121]] which [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] known, [[H3045]] and which [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] the chastisement [[H4148]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] his greatness, [[H1433]] his mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and his stretched out [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]]

### 3
And his miracles, [[H226]] and his acts, [[H4639]] which [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] in the midst [[H8432]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto Pharaoh [[H6547]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and unto all [[H3605]] his land; [[H776]]

### 4
And what [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] unto the army [[H2428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] unto their horses, [[H5483]] and to their chariots; [[H7393]] how [[H834]]  he made [[H853]] the water [[H4325]] of the Red [[H5488]] sea [[H3220]] to overflow [[H6687]] them [[H6440]] as they pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] you, and the Lord [[H3068]] hath destroyed [[H6]] them unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]]

### 5
And what [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] unto you in the wilderness, [[H4057]] until [[H5704]] ye came [[H935]] into [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] place; [[H4725]]

### 6
And what [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] unto Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] the sons [[H1121]] of Eliab, [[H446]] the son [[H1121]] of Reuben: [[H7205]] how [[H834]] the earth [[H776]] opened [[H6475]] her mouth, [[H6310]] and swallowed them up, [[H1104]] and their households, [[H1004]] and their tents, [[H168]] and all [[H3605]] the substance [[H3351]] that [[H834]] in their possession, [[H7272]] in the midst [[H7130]] of all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]]

### 7
But [[H3588]] your eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the great [[H1419]] acts [[H4639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he did. [[H6213]]

### 8
Therefore shall ye keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you this day, [[H3117]] that [[H4616]] ye may be strong, [[H2388]] and go in [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] whither [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go [[H5674]] to possess [[H3423]] it; [[H3423]]

### 9
And that [[H4616]] ye may prolong [[H748]] days [[H3117]] in [[H5921]] the land, [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto your fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] unto them and to their seed, [[H2233]] a land [[H776]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the land, [[H776]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it, not [[H3808]] as the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] from whence [[H834]] ye came out, [[H3318]] where [[H834]] thou sowedst [[H2232]] thy seed, [[H2233]] and wateredst [[H8248]] with thy foot, [[H7272]] as a garden [[H1588]] of herbs: [[H3419]]

### 11
But the land, [[H776]] whither [[H834]] ye [[H859]] go [[H5674]] to possess [[H3423]] it, a land [[H776]] of hills [[H2022]] and valleys, [[H1237]] drinketh [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] of the rain [[H4306]] of heaven: [[H8064]]

### 12
A land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] careth for: [[H1875]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] always [[H8548]] upon it, from the beginning [[H7225]] of the year [[H8141]] even unto [[H5704]] the end [[H319]] of the year. [[H8141]]

### 13
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] ye shall hearken [[H8085]] diligently [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] my commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you this day, [[H3117]] to love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and to serve [[H5647]] him with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and with all [[H3605]] your soul, [[H5315]]

### 14
That I will give [[H5414]] the rain [[H4306]] of your land [[H776]] in his due season, [[H6256]] the first rain [[H3138]] and the latter rain, [[H4456]] that thou mayest gather in [[H622]] thy corn, [[H1715]] and thy wine, [[H8492]] and thine oil. [[H3323]]

### 15
And I will send [[H5414]] grass [[H6212]] in thy fields [[H7704]] for thy cattle, [[H929]] that thou mayest eat [[H398]] and be full. [[H7646]]

### 16
Take heed [[H8104]] to yourselves, that [[H6435]] your heart [[H3824]] be not deceived, [[H6601]] and ye turn aside, [[H5493]] and serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and worship [[H7812]] them; [[H7812]]

### 17
And the Lord's [[H3068]] wrath [[H639]] be kindled [[H2734]] against you, and he shut up [[H6113]] the heaven, [[H8064]] that there be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain, [[H4306]] and that the land [[H127]] yield [[H5414]] not [[H3808]] her fruit; [[H2981]] and ye perish [[H6]] quickly [[H4120]] from off [[H5921]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] giveth [[H5414]] you. [[H5414]]

### 18
Therefore shall ye lay up [[H7760]] these [[H428]] my words [[H1697]] in [[H5921]] your heart [[H3824]] and in [[H5921]] your soul, [[H5315]] and bind [[H7194]] them for a sign [[H226]] upon [[H5921]] your hand, [[H3027]] that they may be [[H1961]] as frontlets [[H2903]] between [[H996]] your eyes. [[H5869]]

### 19
And ye shall teach [[H3925]]  them [[H853]] your children, [[H1121]] speaking [[H1696]] of them when thou sittest [[H3427]] in thine house, [[H1004]] and when thou walkest [[H1980]] by the way, [[H1870]] when thou liest down, [[H7901]] and when thou risest up. [[H6965]]

### 20
And thou shalt write [[H3789]] them upon [[H5921]] the door posts [[H4201]] of thine house, [[H1004]] and upon thy gates: [[H8179]]

### 21
That [[H4616]] your days [[H3117]] may be multiplied, [[H7235]] and the days [[H3117]] of your children, [[H1121]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto your fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] them, as the days [[H3117]] of heaven [[H8064]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] ye shall diligently [[H8104]] keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2063]] commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you, to do [[H6213]] them, to love [[H157]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] and to cleave [[H1692]] unto him; [[H1692]]

### 23
Then will the Lord [[H3068]] drive out [[H3423]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] from before [[H6440]] you, and ye shall possess [[H3423]] greater [[H1419]] nations [[H1471]] and mightier [[H6099]] than [[H4480]] yourselves. [[H4480]]

### 24
Every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] whereon [[H834]] the soles [[H3709]] of your feet [[H7272]] shall tread [[H1869]] shall be [[H1961]] yours: from [[H4480]] the wilderness [[H4057]] and Lebanon, [[H3844]] from [[H4480]] the river, [[H5104]] the river [[H5104]] Euphrates, [[H6578]] even unto [[H5704]] the uttermost [[H314]] sea [[H3220]] shall your coast [[H1366]] be. [[H1961]]

### 25
There shall no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] be able to stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] you: the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] shall lay [[H5414]] the fear [[H6343]] of you and the dread [[H4172]] of you upon [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] ye shall tread [[H1869]] upon, as [[H834]] he hath said [[H1696]] unto you. [[H1696]]

### 26
Behold, [[H7200]] I [[H595]] set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you this day [[H3117]] a blessing [[H1293]] and a curse; [[H7045]]

### 27
A blessing, [[H1293]] if [[H834]] ye obey [[H8085]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you this day: [[H3117]]

### 28
And a curse, [[H7045]] if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] but turn aside [[H5493]] out of [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] you this day, [[H3117]] to go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] ye have not [[H3808]] known. [[H3045]]

### 29
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath brought thee in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it, that thou shalt put [[H5414]] the blessing [[H1293]] upon [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Gerizim, [[H1630]] and the curse [[H7045]] upon [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Ebal. [[H5858]]

### 30
they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] by [[H310]] the way [[H1870]] where the sun [[H8121]] goeth down, [[H3996]] in the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] which dwell [[H3427]] in the champaign [[H6160]] over against [[H4136]] Gilgal, [[H1537]] beside [[H681]] the plains [[H436]] of Moreh? [[H4176]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] shall pass over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] to go in [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] you, and ye shall possess [[H3423]] it, and dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 32
And ye shall observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the statutes [[H2706]] and judgments [[H4941]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you this day. [[H3117]]
