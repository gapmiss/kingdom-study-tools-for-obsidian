And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] thou shalt hearken [[H8085]] diligently [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] his commandments [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] that the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will set [[H5414]] thee on high [[H5945]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] of the earth: [[H776]]

### 2
And all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] blessings [[H1293]] shall come [[H935]] on [[H5921]] thee, and overtake [[H5381]] thee, if [[H3588]] thou shalt hearken [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 3
Blessed [[H1288]] thou [[H859]] in the city, [[H5892]] and blessed [[H1288]] thou [[H859]] in the field. [[H7704]]

### 4
Blessed [[H1288]] the fruit [[H6529]] of thy body, [[H990]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of thy ground, [[H127]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of thy cattle, [[H929]] the increase [[H7698]] of thy kine, [[H504]] and the flocks [[H6251]] of thy sheep. [[H6629]]

### 5
Blessed [[H1288]] thy basket [[H2935]] and thy store. [[H4863]]

### 6
Blessed [[H1288]] thou [[H859]] when thou comest in, [[H935]] and blessed [[H1288]] thou [[H859]] when thou goest out. [[H3318]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] shall cause [[H5414]] thine enemies [[H341]] that rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] thee to be smitten [[H5062]] before thy face: [[H6440]] they shall come out [[H3318]] against [[H413]] thee one [[H259]] way, [[H1870]] and flee [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] thee seven [[H7651]] ways. [[H1870]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] shall command [[H6680]] the blessing [[H1293]] upon [[H854]] thee in thy storehouses, [[H618]] and in all [[H3605]] that thou settest [[H4916]] thine hand [[H3027]] unto; and he shall bless [[H1288]] thee in the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] giveth [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 9
The Lord [[H3068]] shall establish [[H6965]] thee an holy [[H6918]] people [[H5971]] unto himself, as [[H834]] he hath sworn [[H7650]] unto thee, if [[H3588]] thou shalt keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and walk [[H1980]] in his ways. [[H1870]]

### 10
And all [[H3605]] people [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] shall see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] thou art called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and they shall be afraid [[H3372]] of [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall make thee plenteous [[H3498]] in goods, [[H2896]] in the fruit [[H6529]] of thy body, [[H990]] and in the fruit [[H6529]] of thy cattle, [[H929]] and in the fruit [[H6529]] of thy ground, [[H127]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] sware [[H7650]] unto thy fathers [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 12
The Lord [[H3068]] shall open [[H6605]]  unto thee [[H853]] his good [[H2896]] treasure, [[H214]] the heaven [[H8064]] to give [[H5414]] the rain [[H4306]] unto thy land [[H776]] in his season, [[H6256]] and to bless [[H1288]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of thine hand: [[H3027]] and thou shalt lend [[H3867]] unto many [[H7227]] nations, [[H1471]] and thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] borrow. [[H3867]]

### 13
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall make [[H5414]] thee the head, [[H7218]] and not [[H3808]] the tail; [[H2180]] and thou shalt be [[H1961]] above only, [[H4605]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] beneath; [[H4295]] if [[H3588]] that thou hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] to observe [[H8104]] and to do [[H6213]]

### 14
And thou shalt not [[H3808]] go aside [[H5493]] from any [[H3605]] of the words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day, [[H3117]] the right hand, [[H3225]] or the left, [[H8040]] to go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve [[H5647]] them. [[H5647]]

### 15
But it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] his commandments [[H4687]] and his statutes [[H2708]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] command [[H6680]] thee this day; [[H3117]] that all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] curses [[H7045]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and overtake [[H5381]] thee: [[H5381]]

### 16
Cursed [[H779]] thou [[H859]] in the city, [[H5892]] and cursed [[H779]] thou [[H859]] in the field. [[H7704]]

### 17
Cursed [[H779]] thy basket [[H2935]] and thy store. [[H4863]]

### 18
Cursed [[H779]] the fruit [[H6529]] of thy body, [[H990]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of thy land, [[H127]] the increase [[H7698]] of thy kine, [[H504]] and the flocks [[H6251]] of thy sheep. [[H6629]]

### 19
Cursed [[H779]] thou [[H859]] when thou comest in, [[H935]] and cursed [[H779]] thou [[H859]] when thou goest out. [[H3318]]

### 20
The Lord [[H3068]] shall send [[H7971]]  upon thee [[H853]] cursing, [[H3994]] vexation, [[H4103]] and rebuke, [[H4045]] in all [[H3605]] that thou settest [[H4916]] thine hand [[H3027]] unto for [[H834]] to do, [[H6213]] until [[H5704]] thou be destroyed, [[H8045]] and until [[H5704]] thou perish [[H6]] quickly; [[H4118]] because [[H6440]] of the wickedness [[H7455]] of thy doings, [[H4611]] whereby [[H834]] thou hast forsaken [[H5800]] me. [[H5800]]

### 21
The Lord [[H3068]]  shall make [[H853]] the pestilence [[H1698]] cleave [[H1692]] unto thee, until [[H5704]] he have consumed [[H3615]] thee from off [[H5921]] the land, [[H127]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 22
The Lord [[H3068]] shall smite [[H5221]] thee with a consumption, [[H7829]] and with a fever, [[H6920]] and with an inflammation, [[H1816]] and with an extreme burning, [[H2746]] and with the sword, [[H2719]] and with blasting, [[H7711]] and with mildew; [[H3420]] and they shall pursue [[H7291]] thee until [[H5704]] thou perish. [[H6]]

### 23
And thy heaven [[H8064]] that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] thy head [[H7218]] shall be [[H1961]] brass, [[H5178]] and the earth [[H776]] that [[H834]] under [[H8478]] thee iron. [[H1270]]

### 24
The Lord [[H3068]] shall make [[H5414]] the rain [[H4306]] of thy land [[H776]] powder [[H80]] and dust: [[H6083]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] shall it come down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] thee, until [[H5704]] thou be destroyed. [[H8045]]

### 25
The Lord [[H3068]] shall cause [[H5414]] thee to be smitten [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] thine enemies: [[H341]] thou shalt go out [[H3318]] one [[H259]] way [[H1870]] against [[H413]] them, and flee [[H5127]] seven [[H7651]] ways [[H1870]] before [[H6440]] them: and shalt be [[H1961]] removed [[H2189]] into all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 26
And thy carcase [[H5038]] shall be [[H1961]] meat [[H3978]] unto all [[H3605]] fowls [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and unto the beasts [[H929]] of the earth, [[H776]] and no man [[H369]] shall fray away. [[H2729]]

### 27
The Lord [[H3068]] will smite [[H5221]] thee with the botch [[H7822]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and with the emerods, [[H6076]] and with the scab, [[H1618]] and with the itch, [[H2775]] whereof [[H834]] thou canst [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] be healed. [[H7495]]

### 28
The Lord [[H3068]] shall smite [[H5221]] thee with madness, [[H7697]] and blindness, [[H5788]] and astonishment [[H8541]] of heart: [[H3824]]

### 29
And thou shalt [[H1961]] grope [[H4959]] at noonday, [[H6672]] as [[H834]] the blind [[H5787]] gropeth [[H4959]] in darkness, [[H653]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] prosper [[H6743]] in thy ways: [[H1870]] and thou shalt be [[H1961]] only [[H389]] oppressed [[H6231]] and spoiled [[H1497]] evermore, [[H3117]] and no man [[H369]] shall save [[H3467]]

### 30
Thou shalt betroth [[H781]] a wife, [[H802]] and another [[H312]] man [[H376]] shall lie [[H7693]] with her: thou shalt build [[H1129]] an house, [[H1004]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] dwell [[H3427]] therein: thou shalt plant [[H5193]] a vineyard, [[H3754]] and shalt not [[H3808]] gather the grapes [[H2490]] thereof. [[H2490]]

### 31
Thine ox [[H7794]] slain [[H2873]] before thine eyes, [[H5869]] and thou shalt not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] thereof: [[H4480]] thine ass [[H2543]] violently taken away [[H1497]] from before thy face, [[H6440]] and shall not [[H3808]] be restored [[H7725]] to thee: thy sheep [[H6629]] given [[H5414]] unto thine enemies, [[H341]] and thou shalt have none [[H369]] to rescue [[H3467]]

### 32
Thy sons [[H1121]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] given [[H5414]] unto another [[H312]] people, [[H5971]] and thine eyes [[H5869]] shall look, [[H7200]] and fail [[H3616]] for [[H413]] them all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long: and no [[H369]] might [[H410]] in thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 33
The fruit [[H6529]] of thy land, [[H127]] and all [[H3605]] thy labours, [[H3018]] shall a nation [[H5971]] which [[H834]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] eat up; [[H398]] and thou shalt be [[H1961]] only [[H7535]] oppressed [[H6231]] and crushed [[H7533]] alway: [[H3117]]

### 34
So that thou shalt be [[H1961]] mad [[H7696]] for the sight [[H4758]] of thine eyes [[H5869]] which [[H834]] thou shalt see. [[H7200]]

### 35
The Lord [[H3068]] shall smite [[H5221]] thee in [[H5921]] the knees, [[H1290]] and in [[H5921]] the legs, [[H7785]] with a sore [[H7451]] botch [[H7822]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H3201]] be healed, [[H7495]] from the sole [[H3709]] of thy foot [[H7272]] unto [[H5704]] the top of thy head. [[H6936]]

### 36
The Lord [[H3068]] shall bring [[H1980]] thee, and thy king [[H4428]] which [[H834]] thou shalt set [[H6965]] over [[H5921]] thee, unto [[H413]] a nation [[H1471]] which [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] nor thy fathers [[H1]] have known; [[H3045]] and there [[H8033]] shalt thou serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] wood [[H6086]] and stone. [[H68]]

### 37
And thou shalt become [[H1961]] an astonishment, [[H8047]] a proverb, [[H4912]] and a byword, [[H8148]] among all [[H3605]] nations [[H5971]] whither [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall lead [[H5090]] thee. [[H5090]]

### 38
Thou shalt carry out [[H3318]] much [[H7227]] seed [[H2233]] into the field, [[H7704]] and shalt gather in; [[H622]] little [[H4592]] for [[H3588]] the locust [[H697]] shall consume [[H2628]] it. [[H2628]]

### 39
Thou shalt plant [[H5193]] vineyards, [[H3754]] and dress [[H5647]] but shalt neither [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] the wine, [[H3196]] nor [[H3808]] gather [[H103]] for [[H3588]] the worms [[H8438]] shall eat [[H398]] them. [[H398]]

### 40
Thou shalt have [[H1961]] olive trees [[H2132]] throughout all [[H3605]] thy coasts, [[H1366]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] anoint [[H5480]] with the oil; [[H8081]] for [[H3588]] thine olive [[H2132]] shall cast [[H5394]]

### 41
Thou shalt beget [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] but thou shalt not [[H3808]] enjoy [[H1961]] them; for [[H3588]] they shall go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]]

### 42
All [[H3605]] thy trees [[H6086]] and fruit [[H6529]] of thy land [[H127]] shall the locust [[H6767]] consume. [[H3423]]

### 43
The stranger [[H1616]] that [[H834]] within [[H7130]] thee shall get up [[H5927]] above [[H5921]] thee very [[H4605]] high; [[H4605]] and thou [[H859]] shalt come down [[H3381]] very [[H4295]] low. [[H4295]]

### 44
He [[H1931]] shall lend [[H3867]] to thee, and thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] lend [[H3867]] to him: he [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] the head, [[H7218]] and thou [[H859]] shalt be [[H1961]] the tail. [[H2180]]

### 45
Moreover all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] curses [[H7045]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and shall pursue [[H7291]] thee, and overtake [[H5381]] thee, till [[H5704]] thou be destroyed; [[H8045]] because [[H3588]] thou hearkenedst [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] to keep [[H8104]] his commandments [[H4687]] and his statutes [[H2708]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] thee: [[H6680]]

### 46
And they shall be [[H1961]] upon thee for a sign [[H226]] and for a wonder, [[H4159]] and upon thy seed [[H2233]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 47
Because [[H8478]] thou servedst [[H5647]] not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] with joyfulness, [[H8057]] and with gladness [[H2898]] of heart, [[H3824]] for the abundance [[H7230]] of all [[H3605]]

### 48
Therefore shalt thou serve [[H5647]] thine enemies [[H341]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall send [[H7971]] against thee, in hunger, [[H7458]] and in thirst, [[H6772]] and in nakedness, [[H5903]] and in want [[H2640]] of all [[H3605]] and he shall put [[H5414]] a yoke [[H5923]] of iron [[H1270]] upon [[H5921]] thy neck, [[H6677]] until [[H5704]] he have destroyed [[H8045]] thee. [[H8045]]

### 49
The Lord [[H3068]] shall bring [[H5375]] a nation [[H1471]] against [[H5921]] thee from far, [[H7350]] from the end [[H7097]] of the earth, [[H776]] as [[H834]] the eagle [[H5404]] flieth; [[H1675]] a nation [[H1471]] whose [[H834]] tongue [[H3956]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] understand; [[H8085]]

### 50
A nation [[H1471]] of fierce [[H5794]] countenance, [[H6440]] which [[H834]] shall not [[H3808]] regard [[H5375]] the person [[H6440]] of the old, [[H2205]] nor [[H3808]] shew favour [[H2603]] to the young: [[H5288]]

### 51
And he shall eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of thy cattle, [[H929]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of thy land, [[H127]] until [[H5704]] thou be destroyed: [[H8045]] which [[H834]] shall not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] thee corn, [[H1715]] wine, [[H8492]] or oil, [[H3323]] the increase [[H7698]] of thy kine, [[H504]] or flocks [[H6251]] of thy sheep, [[H6629]] until [[H5704]] he have destroyed [[H6]] thee. [[H6]]

### 52
And he shall besiege [[H6887]] thee in all [[H3605]] thy gates, [[H8179]] until [[H5704]] thy high [[H1364]] and fenced [[H1219]] walls [[H2346]] come down, [[H3381]] wherein [[H834]] thou [[H859]] trustedst, [[H982]] throughout all [[H3605]] thy land: [[H776]] and he shall besiege [[H6887]] thee in all [[H3605]] thy gates [[H8179]] throughout all [[H3605]] thy land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 53
And thou shalt eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of thine own body, [[H990]] the flesh [[H1320]] of thy sons [[H1121]] and of thy daughters, [[H1323]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] thee, in the siege, [[H4692]] and in the straitness, [[H4689]] wherewith [[H834]] thine enemies [[H341]] shall distress [[H6693]] thee: [[H6693]]

### 54
the man [[H376]] tender [[H7390]] among you, and very [[H3966]] delicate, [[H6028]] his eye [[H5869]] shall be evil [[H7489]] toward his brother, [[H251]] and toward the wife [[H802]] of his bosom, [[H2436]] and toward the remnant [[H3499]] of his children [[H1121]] which [[H834]] he shall leave: [[H3498]]

### 55
So that he will not give [[H5414]] to any [[H259]] of them of the flesh [[H1320]] of his children [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] he shall eat: [[H398]] because [[H1097]] he hath nothing [[H3605]] left [[H7604]] him in the siege, [[H4692]] and in the straitness, [[H4689]] wherewith [[H834]] thine enemies [[H341]] shall distress [[H6693]] thee in all [[H3605]] thy gates. [[H8179]]

### 56
The tender [[H7390]] and delicate woman [[H6028]] among you, which [[H834]] would not [[H3808]] adventure [[H5254]] to set [[H3322]] the sole [[H3709]] of her foot [[H7272]] upon [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] for delicateness [[H6026]] and tenderness, [[H7391]] her eye [[H5869]] shall be evil [[H7489]] toward the husband [[H376]] of her bosom, [[H2436]] and toward her son, [[H1121]] and toward her daughter, [[H1323]]

### 57
And toward her young one [[H7988]] that cometh out [[H3318]] from between [[H996]] her feet, [[H7272]] and toward her children [[H1121]] which [[H834]] she shall bear: [[H3205]] for [[H3588]] she shall eat [[H398]] them for want [[H2640]] of all [[H3605]] secretly [[H5643]] in the siege [[H4692]] and straitness, [[H4689]] wherewith [[H834]] thine enemy [[H341]] shall distress [[H6693]] thee in thy gates. [[H8179]]

### 58
If [[H518]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] observe [[H8104]] to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] that are written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book, [[H5612]] that thou mayest fear [[H3372]] this [[H2088]] glorious [[H3513]] and fearful [[H3372]] name, [[H8034]] THE LORD [[H3068]] THY GOD; [[H430]]

### 59
Then the Lord [[H3068]] will make [[H6381]] thy plagues [[H4347]] wonderful, and the plagues [[H4347]] of thy seed, [[H2233]] great [[H1419]] plagues, [[H4347]] and of long continuance, [[H539]] and sore [[H7451]] sicknesses, [[H2483]] and of long continuance. [[H539]]

### 60
Moreover he will bring [[H7725]]  upon thee [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the diseases [[H4064]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] which [[H834]] thou wast afraid [[H3025]] of; [[H6440]] and they shall cleave [[H1692]] unto thee. [[H1692]]

### 61
Also [[H1571]] every [[H3605]] sickness, [[H2483]] and every [[H3605]] plague, [[H4347]] which [[H834]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of this [[H2063]] law, [[H8451]] them will the Lord [[H3068]] bring [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] thee, until [[H5704]] thou be destroyed. [[H8045]]

### 62
And ye shall be left [[H7604]] few [[H4592]] in number, [[H4962]] whereas [[H834]] ye were [[H1961]] as the stars [[H3556]] of heaven [[H8064]] for multitude; [[H7230]] because [[H3588]] thou wouldest not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 63
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] rejoiced [[H7797]] over [[H5921]] you to do you good, [[H3190]] and to multiply [[H7235]] you; so [[H3651]] the Lord [[H3068]] will rejoice [[H7797]] over [[H5921]] you to destroy [[H6]] you, and to bring you to nought; [[H8045]] and ye shall be plucked [[H5255]] from off [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] whither [[H834]] thou [[H859]] goest [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 64
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall scatter [[H6327]] thee among all [[H3605]] people, [[H5971]] from the one end [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] even unto [[H5704]] the other; [[H7097]] and there [[H8033]] thou shalt serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] nor thy fathers [[H1]] have known, [[H3045]] wood [[H6086]] and stone. [[H68]]

### 65
And among these [[H1992]] nations [[H1471]] shalt thou find no ease, [[H7280]] neither [[H3808]] shall the sole [[H3709]] of thy foot [[H7272]] have [[H1961]] rest: [[H4494]] but the Lord [[H3068]] shall give [[H5414]] thee there [[H8033]] a trembling [[H7268]] heart, [[H3820]] and failing [[H3631]] of eyes, [[H5869]] and sorrow [[H1671]] of mind: [[H5315]]

### 66
And thy life [[H2416]] shall hang [[H8511]] in doubt before [[H5048]] thee; and thou shalt fear [[H6342]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] and shalt have none assurance [[H539]] of thy life: [[H2416]]

### 67
In the morning [[H1242]] thou shalt say, [[H559]] Would God [[H4310]] it were [[H5414]] even! [[H6153]] and at even [[H6153]] thou shalt say, [[H559]] Would God it were [[H5414]] morning! [[H1242]] for the fear [[H6343]] of thine heart [[H3824]] wherewith [[H834]] thou shalt fear, [[H6342]] and for the sight [[H4758]] of thine eyes [[H5869]] which [[H834]] thou shalt see. [[H7200]]

### 68
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall bring [[H7725]] thee into Egypt [[H4714]] again with ships, [[H591]] by the way [[H1870]] whereof [[H834]] I spake [[H559]] unto thee, Thou shalt see [[H7200]] it no [[H3808]] more again: [[H3254]] and there [[H8033]] ye shall be sold [[H4376]] unto your enemies [[H341]] for bondmen [[H5650]] and bondwomen, [[H8198]] and no man [[H369]] shall buy [[H7069]]
