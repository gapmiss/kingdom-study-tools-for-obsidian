Now these [[H428]] the last [[H314]] words [[H1697]] of David. [[H1732]] David [[H1732]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] said, [[H5002]] and the man [[H1397]] raised up [[H6965]] on high, [[H5920]] the anointed [[H4899]] of the God [[H430]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and the sweet [[H5273]] psalmist [[H2158]] of Israel, [[H3478]] said, [[H5002]]

### 2
The Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] by me, and his word [[H4405]] in [[H5921]] my tongue. [[H3956]]

### 3
The God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] the Rock [[H6697]] of Israel [[H3478]] spake [[H1696]] to me, He that ruleth over [[H4910]] men [[H120]] just, [[H6662]] ruling [[H4910]] in the fear [[H3374]] of God. [[H430]]

### 4
And as the light [[H216]] of the morning, [[H1242]] the sun [[H8121]] riseth, [[H2224]] a morning [[H1242]] without [[H3808]] clouds; [[H5645]] the tender grass [[H1877]] out of the earth [[H776]] by clear shining [[H5051]] after rain. [[H4306]]

### 5
Although [[H3588]] my house [[H1004]] not [[H3808]] so [[H3651]] with [[H5973]] God; [[H410]] yet [[H3588]] he hath made [[H7760]] with me an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant, [[H1285]] ordered [[H6186]] in all [[H3605]] and sure: [[H8104]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] my salvation, [[H3468]] and all [[H3605]] desire, [[H2656]] although [[H3588]] he make not [[H3808]] to grow. [[H6779]]

### 6
But of Belial [[H1100]] all [[H3605]] of them as thorns [[H6975]] thrust away, [[H5074]] because [[H3588]] they cannot [[H3808]] be taken [[H3947]] with hands: [[H3027]]

### 7
But the man [[H376]] shall touch [[H5060]] them must be fenced [[H4390]] with iron [[H1270]] and the staff [[H6086]] of a spear; [[H2595]] and they shall be utterly [[H8313]] burned [[H8313]] with fire [[H784]] in the place. [[H7675]]

### 8
These [[H428]] the names [[H8034]] of the mighty men [[H1368]] whom [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had: The Tachmonite [[H8461]] that sat [[H3427]] in the seat, [[H7675]] chief [[H7218]] among the captains; [[H7991]] the same [[H1931]] Adino [[H5722]] the Eznite: [[H6112]] against [[H5921]] eight [[H8083]] hundred, [[H3967]] whom he slew [[H2491]] at one [[H259]] time. [[H6471]]

### 9
And after [[H310]] him Eleazar [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Dodo [[H1734]] the Ahohite, [[H266]] of the three [[H7969]] mighty men [[H1368]] with [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] when they defied [[H2778]] the Philistines [[H6430]] were there [[H8033]] gathered together [[H622]] to battle, [[H4421]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] were gone away: [[H5927]]

### 10
He [[H1931]] arose, [[H6965]] and smote [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H6430]] until [[H3588]] his hand [[H3027]] was weary, [[H3021]] and his hand [[H3027]] clave [[H1692]] unto [[H413]] the sword: [[H2719]] and the Lord [[H3068]] wrought [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] victory [[H8668]] that [[H1931]] day; [[H3117]] and the people [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] after [[H310]] him only [[H389]] to spoil. [[H6584]]

### 11
And after [[H310]] him Shammah [[H8048]] the son [[H1121]] of Agee [[H89]] the Hararite. [[H2043]] And the Philistines [[H6430]] were gathered together [[H622]] into a troop, [[H2416]] where [[H8033]] was [[H1961]] a piece [[H2513]] of ground [[H7704]] full [[H4392]] of lentiles: [[H5742]] and the people [[H5971]] fled [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 12
But he stood [[H3320]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the ground, [[H2513]] and defended [[H5337]] it, and slew [[H5221]] the Philistines: [[H6430]] and the Lord [[H3068]] wrought [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] victory. [[H8668]]

### 13
And three [[H7969]] of the thirty [[H7970]] chief [[H7218]] went down, [[H3381]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] in [[H413]] the harvest time [[H7105]] unto [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] of Adullam: [[H5725]] and the troop [[H2416]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] pitched [[H2583]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] then [[H227]] in an hold, [[H4686]] and the garrison [[H4673]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] then [[H227]] Bethlehem. [[H1035]]

### 15
And David [[H1732]] longed, [[H183]] and said, [[H559]] Oh that one [[H4310]] would give me drink [[H8248]] of the water [[H4325]] of the well [[H953]] of Bethlehem, [[H1035]] which [[H834]] by the gate! [[H8179]]

And the three [[H7969]] mighty men [[H1368]] brake through [[H1234]] the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and drew [[H7579]] water [[H4325]] out of the well [[H953]] of Bethlehem, [[H1035]] that [[H834]] by the gate, [[H8179]] and took [[H5375]] and brought [[H935]] to [[H413]] David: [[H1732]] nevertheless he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] thereof, but poured it out [[H5258]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
And he said, [[H559]] Be it far [[H2486]] from me, O Lord, [[H3068]] that I should do [[H6213]] this: [[H2063]] the blood [[H1818]] of the men [[H582]] that went [[H1980]] in jeopardy of their lives? [[H5315]] therefore he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] it. These [[H428]] things did [[H6213]] these three [[H7969]] mighty men. [[H1368]]

### 19

### 21
And he [[H1931]] slew [[H5221]] an Egyptian, [[H4713]] a goodly [[H4758]] man: [[H376]] and the Egyptian [[H4713]] had a spear [[H2595]] in his hand; [[H3027]] but he went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] him with a staff, [[H7626]] and plucked [[H1497]] the spear [[H2595]] out of the Egyptian's [[H4713]] hand, [[H3027]] and slew [[H2026]] him with his own spear.
