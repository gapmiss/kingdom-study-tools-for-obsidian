### 1
Now there was [[H1961]] long [[H752]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] and the house [[H1004]] of David: [[H1732]] but David [[H1732]] waxed [[H1980]] stronger and stronger, [[H2390]] and the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] waxed [[H1980]] weaker and weaker. [[H1800]]

### 2
And unto David [[H1732]] were sons [[H1121]] born [[H3205]] in Hebron: [[H2275]] and his firstborn [[H1060]] was [[H1961]] Amnon, [[H550]] of Ahinoam [[H293]] the Jezreelitess; [[H3159]]

### 3
And his second, [[H4932]] Chileab, [[H3609]] of Abigail [[H26]] the wife [[H802]] of Nabal [[H5037]] the Carmelite; [[H3761]] and the third, [[H7992]] Absalom [[H53]] the son [[H1121]] of Maacah [[H4601]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Talmai [[H8526]] king [[H4428]] of Geshur; [[H1650]]

### 4
And the fourth, [[H7243]] Adonijah [[H138]] the son [[H1121]] of Haggith; [[H2294]] and the fifth, [[H2549]] Shephatiah [[H8203]] the son [[H1121]] of Abital; [[H37]]

### 5
And the sixth, [[H8345]] Ithream, [[H3507]] by Eglah [[H5698]] David's [[H1732]] wife. [[H802]] These [[H428]] were born [[H3205]] to David [[H1732]] in Hebron. [[H2275]]

### 6
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] while there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] and the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] that Abner [[H74]] made himself strong [[H2388]] for the house [[H1004]] of Saul. [[H7586]]

### 7
And Saul [[H7586]] had a concubine, [[H6370]] whose name [[H8034]] Rizpah, [[H7532]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Aiah: [[H345]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abner, [[H74]] Wherefore [[H4069]] hast thou gone in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] my father's [[H1]] concubine? [[H6370]]

### 8
Then was Abner [[H74]] very [[H3966]] wroth [[H2734]] for [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of Ish-bosheth, [[H378]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] a dog's [[H3611]] head, [[H7218]] which [[H834]] against Judah [[H3063]] do shew [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] this day [[H3117]] unto [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] thy father, [[H1]] to [[H413]] his brethren, [[H251]] and to [[H413]] his friends, [[H4828]] and have not [[H3808]] delivered [[H4672]] thee into the hand [[H3027]] of David, [[H1732]] that thou chargest [[H6485]] me to day [[H3117]] with a fault [[H5771]] concerning this woman? [[H802]]

### 9
So [[H3541]] do [[H6213]] God [[H430]] to Abner, [[H74]] and more also, [[H3254]] except, [[H3588]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sworn [[H7650]] to David, [[H1732]] even [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] I do [[H6213]] to him; [[H6213]]

### 10
To translate [[H5674]] the kingdom [[H4467]] from the house [[H1004]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and to set up [[H6965]]  the [[H853]] throne [[H3678]] of David [[H1732]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and over [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]] from Dan [[H1835]] even to [[H5704]] Beer-sheba. [[H884]]

### 11
And he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] answer [[H7725]] Abner [[H74]] a word [[H1697]] again, [[H5750]] because he feared [[H3372]] him. [[H3372]]

### 12
And Abner [[H74]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] on his behalf, [[H8478]] saying, [[H559]] Whose [[H4310]] the land? [[H776]] saying [[H559]] Make [[H3772]] thy league [[H1285]] with [[H854]] me, and, behold, [[H2009]] my hand [[H3027]] with [[H5973]] thee, to bring about [[H5437]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 13
And he said, [[H559]] Well; [[H2896]] I [[H589]] will make [[H3772]] a league [[H1285]] with [[H854]] thee: but [[H389]] one [[H259]] thing [[H1697]] I [[H595]] require [[H7592]] of [[H854]] thee, that is, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face, [[H6440]] except [[H3588]] thou first [[H6440]] bring [[H935]] Michal [[H4324]] Saul's [[H7586]] daughter, [[H1323]] when thou comest [[H935]] to see [[H7200]] my face. [[H6440]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Ish-bosheth [[H378]] Saul's [[H7586]] son, [[H1121]] saying, [[H559]] Deliver [[H5414]] my wife [[H802]] Michal, [[H4324]] which [[H834]] I espoused [[H781]] to me for an hundred [[H3967]] foreskins [[H6190]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 15
And Ish-bosheth [[H378]] sent, [[H7971]] and took [[H3947]] her from [[H5973]] husband, [[H376]] from [[H5973]] Phaltiel [[H6409]] the son [[H1121]] of Laish. [[H3889]]

### 16
And her husband [[H376]] went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] her along [[H1980]] weeping [[H1058]] behind [[H310]] her to [[H5704]] Bahurim. [[H980]] Then said [[H559]] Abner [[H74]] unto [[H413]] him, Go, [[H1980]] return. [[H7725]] And he returned. [[H7725]]

### 17
And Abner [[H74]] had [[H1961]] communication [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Ye sought [[H1245]]  for [[H853]] David [[H1732]] in times [[H8543]] past [[H8032]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] you: [[H5921]]

### 18
Now [[H6258]] then do [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H559]] of [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] By the hand [[H3027]] of my servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] I will save [[H3467]] my people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and out of the hand [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] their enemies. [[H341]]

### 19
And Abner [[H74]] also [[H1571]] spake [[H1696]] in the ears [[H241]] of Benjamin: [[H1144]] and Abner [[H74]] went [[H1980]] also [[H1571]] to speak [[H1696]] in the ears [[H241]] of David [[H1732]] in Hebron [[H2275]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] seemed [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] to Israel, [[H3478]] and that seemed good [[H5869]] to the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]]

### 20
So Abner [[H74]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] to Hebron, [[H2275]] and twenty [[H6242]] men [[H376]] with [[H854]] him. And David [[H1732]] made [[H6213]] Abner [[H74]] and the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him a feast. [[H4960]]

### 21
And Abner [[H74]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] I will arise [[H6965]] and go, [[H1980]] and will gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] that they may make [[H3772]] a league [[H1285]] with [[H854]] thee, and that thou mayest reign [[H4427]] over all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thine heart [[H5315]] desireth. [[H183]] And David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] Abner [[H74]] away; and he went [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 22
And, behold, [[H2009]] the servants [[H5650]] of David [[H1732]] and Joab [[H3097]] came [[H935]] from a troop, [[H1416]] and brought in [[H935]] a great [[H7227]] spoil [[H7998]] with [[H5973]] them: but Abner [[H74]] not [[H369]] with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] in Hebron; [[H2275]] for [[H3588]] he had sent him away, [[H7971]] and he was gone [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 23
When Joab [[H3097]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him were come, [[H935]] they told [[H5046]] Joab, [[H3097]] saying, [[H559]] Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner [[H5369]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and he hath sent him away, [[H7971]] and he is gone [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 24
Then Joab [[H3097]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] hast thou done? [[H6213]] behold, [[H2009]] Abner [[H74]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee; why [[H4100]] it thou hast sent him away, [[H7971]] and he is quite [[H1980]] gone? [[H1980]]

### 25
Thou knowest [[H3045]] Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] that [[H3588]] he came [[H935]] to deceive [[H6601]] thee, and to know [[H3045]] thy going out [[H4161]] and thy coming in, [[H3996]] and to know [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] doest. [[H6213]]

### 26
And when Joab [[H3097]] was come out [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] after [[H310]] Abner, [[H74]] which brought him again [[H7725]] from the well [[H953]] of Sirah: [[H5626]] but David [[H1732]] knew [[H3045]] not. [[H3808]]

### 27
And when Abner [[H74]] was returned [[H7725]] to Hebron, [[H2275]] Joab [[H3097]] took him aside [[H5186]] in [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] to speak [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him quietly, [[H7987]] and smote [[H5221]] him there [[H8033]] under the fifth [[H2570]] that he died, [[H4191]] for the blood [[H1818]] of Asahel [[H6214]] his brother. [[H251]]

### 28
And afterward [[H310]] when David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] and my kingdom [[H4467]] guiltless [[H5355]] before [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] for [[H5703]] ever [[H5769]] from the blood [[H1818]] of Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner: [[H5369]]

### 29
Let it rest [[H2342]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of Joab, [[H3097]] and on [[H413]] all [[H3605]] his father's [[H1]] house; [[H1004]] and let there not [[H408]] fail [[H3772]] from the house [[H1004]] of Joab [[H3097]] one that hath an issue, [[H2100]] or that is a leper, [[H6879]] or that leaneth [[H2388]] on a staff, [[H6418]] or that falleth [[H5307]] on the sword, [[H2719]] or that lacketh [[H2638]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 30
So Joab [[H3097]] and Abishai [[H52]] his brother [[H251]] slew [[H2026]] Abner, [[H74]] because [[H5921]] he had slain [[H4191]] their brother [[H251]] Asahel [[H6214]] at Gibeon [[H1391]] in the battle. [[H4421]]

### 31
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, Rend [[H7167]] your clothes, [[H899]] and gird [[H2296]] you with sackcloth, [[H8242]] and mourn [[H5594]] before [[H6440]] Abner. [[H74]] And king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] followed [[H1980]] the bier. [[H4296]]

### 32
And they buried [[H6912]] Abner [[H74]] in Hebron: [[H2275]] and the king [[H4428]] lifted up [[H5375]] his voice, [[H6963]] and wept [[H1058]] at [[H413]] the grave [[H6913]] of Abner; [[H74]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] wept. [[H1058]]

### 33
And the king [[H4428]] lamented [[H6969]] over [[H413]] Abner, [[H74]] and said, [[H559]] Died [[H4191]] Abner [[H74]] as a fool [[H5036]] dieth? [[H4194]]

### 34
Thy hands [[H3027]] not [[H3808]] bound, [[H631]] nor [[H3808]] thy feet [[H7272]] put [[H5066]] into fetters: [[H5178]] as a man falleth [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] wicked [[H5766]] men, [[H1121]] fellest [[H5307]] thou. And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] wept [[H1058]] again [[H3254]] over [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 35
And when all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]]  to cause [[H853]] David [[H1732]] to eat [[H1262]] meat [[H3899]] while it was yet [[H5750]] day, [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] sware, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] So [[H3541]] do [[H6213]] God [[H430]] to me, and more also, [[H3254]] if [[H3588]] I taste [[H2938]] bread, [[H3899]] or [[H176]] ought [[H3972]] else, [[H3605]] till [[H6440]] the sun [[H8121]] be down. [[H935]]

### 36
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] took notice [[H5234]] and it pleased [[H3190]] them: [[H5869]] as whatsoever [[H3605]] the king [[H4428]] did [[H6213]] pleased [[H5869]] all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 37
For all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] understood [[H3045]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] it was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] of the king [[H4428]] to slay [[H4191]] Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner. [[H5369]]

### 38
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] Know [[H3045]] ye not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] there is a prince [[H8269]] and a great man [[H1419]] fallen [[H5307]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] in Israel? [[H3478]]

### 39
And I [[H595]] this day [[H3117]] weak, [[H7390]] though anointed [[H4886]] king; [[H4428]] and these [[H428]] men [[H376]] the sons [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] too hard [[H7186]] for [[H4480]] me: the Lord [[H3068]] shall reward [[H7999]] the doer evil [[H6213]]  of [[H7451]] according to his wickedness. [[H7451]]
