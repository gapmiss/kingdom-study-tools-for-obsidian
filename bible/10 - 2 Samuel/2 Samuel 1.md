### 1
Now it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Saul, [[H7586]] when David [[H1732]] was returned [[H7725]] from the slaughter [[H5221]]  of [[H853]] the Amalekites, [[H6002]] and David [[H1732]] had abode [[H3427]] two [[H8147]] days [[H3117]] in Ziklag; [[H6860]]

### 2
It came even to pass [[H1961]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] that, behold, [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] came [[H935]] out of [[H4480]] the camp [[H4264]] from [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] with his clothes [[H899]] rent, [[H7167]] and earth [[H127]] upon [[H5921]] his head: [[H7218]] and it was, [[H1961]] when he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] that he fell [[H5307]] to the earth, [[H776]] and did obeisance. [[H7812]]

### 3
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto him, From whence [[H335]] comest [[H935]] thou? And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Out of the camp [[H4264]] of Israel [[H3478]] am I escaped. [[H4422]]

### 4
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, How [[H4100]] went [[H1961]] the matter? [[H1697]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] tell [[H5046]] me. And he answered, [[H559]] That [[H834]] the people [[H5971]] are fled [[H5127]] from [[H4480]] the battle, [[H4421]] and many [[H7235]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] also [[H1571]] are fallen [[H5307]] and dead; [[H4191]] and Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] his son [[H1121]] are dead [[H4191]] also. [[H1571]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the young man [[H5288]] that told [[H5046]] him, How [[H349]] knowest [[H3045]] thou that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] his son [[H1121]] be dead? [[H4191]]

### 6
And the young man [[H5288]] that told [[H5046]] him said, [[H559]] As I happened [[H7136]] by chance [[H7122]] upon mount [[H2022]] Gilboa, [[H1533]] behold, [[H2009]] Saul [[H7586]] leaned [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] his spear; [[H2595]] and, lo, [[H2009]] the chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H1167]] followed hard [[H1692]] after him. [[H1692]]

### 7
And when he looked [[H6437]] behind [[H310]] him, he saw [[H7200]] me, and called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] me. And I answered, [[H559]] Here [[H2005]] I. [[H2005]]

### 8
And he said [[H559]] unto me, Who [[H4310]] thou? [[H859]] And I answered [[H559]] him, [[H413]] I [[H595]] an Amalekite. [[H6003]]

### 9
He said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me again, Stand, [[H5975]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] upon [[H5921]] me, and slay [[H4191]] me: for [[H3588]] anguish [[H7661]] is come [[H270]] upon me, because [[H3588]] my life [[H5315]] yet [[H5750]] whole [[H3605]] in me. [[H3605]]

### 10
So I stood [[H5975]] upon [[H5921]] him, and slew [[H4191]] him, because [[H3588]] I was sure [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he could not [[H3808]] live [[H2421]] after that [[H310]] he was fallen: [[H5307]] and I took [[H3947]] the crown [[H5145]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and the bracelet [[H685]] that [[H834]] on [[H5921]] his arm, [[H2220]] and have brought [[H935]] them hither [[H2008]] unto [[H413]] my lord. [[H113]]

### 11
Then David [[H1732]] took hold [[H2388]] on his clothes, [[H899]] and rent [[H7167]] them; and likewise [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him: [[H854]]

### 12
And they mourned, [[H5594]] and wept, [[H1058]] and fasted [[H6684]] until [[H5704]] even, [[H6153]] for [[H5921]] Saul, [[H7586]] and for [[H5921]] Jonathan [[H3083]] his son, [[H1121]] and for [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and for [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] because [[H3588]] they were fallen [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 13
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the young man [[H5288]] that told [[H5046]] him, Whence [[H335]] thou? [[H859]] And he answered, [[H559]] I [[H595]] the son [[H1121]] of a stranger, [[H376]] an Amalekite. [[H6003]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, How [[H349]] wast thou not [[H3808]] afraid [[H3372]] to stretch forth [[H7971]] thine hand [[H3027]] to destroy [[H7843]] the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed? [[H4899]]

### 15
And David [[H1732]] called [[H7121]] one [[H259]] of the young men, [[H5288]] and said, [[H559]] Go near, [[H5066]] fall [[H6293]] upon him. And he smote [[H5221]] him that he died. [[H4191]]

### 16
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thy blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] thy head; [[H7218]] for [[H3588]] thy mouth [[H6310]] hath testified [[H6030]] against thee, saying, [[H559]] I [[H595]] have slain [[H4191]] the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed. [[H4899]]

### 17
And David [[H1732]] lamented [[H6969]] with [[H854]] this [[H2063]] lamentation [[H7015]] over [[H5921]] Saul [[H7586]] and over [[H5921]] Jonathan [[H3083]] his son: [[H1121]]

### 18
(Also he bade [[H559]] them teach [[H3925]] the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] the bow: [[H7198]] behold, [[H2009]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of Jasher.) [[H3477]]

### 19
The beauty [[H6643]] of Israel [[H3478]] is slain [[H2491]] upon [[H5921]] thy high places: [[H1116]] how [[H349]] are the mighty [[H1368]] fallen! [[H5307]]

### 20
Tell [[H5046]] not [[H408]] in Gath, [[H1661]] publish [[H1319]] not [[H408]] in the streets [[H2351]] of Askelon; [[H831]] lest [[H6435]] the daughters [[H1323]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] rejoice, [[H8055]] lest [[H6435]] the daughters [[H1323]] of the uncircumcised [[H6189]] triumph. [[H5937]]

### 21
Ye mountains [[H2022]] of Gilboa, [[H1533]] no [[H408]] dew, [[H2919]] neither [[H408]] rain, [[H4306]] upon [[H5921]] you, nor fields [[H7704]] of offerings: [[H8641]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the shield [[H4043]] of the mighty [[H1368]] is vilely cast away, [[H1602]] the shield [[H4043]] of Saul, [[H7586]] not [[H1097]] anointed [[H4899]] with oil. [[H8081]]

### 22
From the blood [[H1818]] of the slain, [[H2491]] from the fat [[H2459]] of the mighty, [[H1368]] the bow [[H7198]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] turned [[H7734]] not [[H3808]] back, [[H268]] and the sword [[H2719]] of Saul [[H7586]] returned [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] empty. [[H7387]]

### 23
Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] lovely [[H157]] and pleasant [[H5273]] in their lives, [[H2416]] and in their death [[H4194]] they were not [[H3808]] divided: [[H6504]] they were swifter [[H7043]] than eagles, [[H5404]] they were stronger [[H1396]] than lions. [[H738]]

### 24
Ye daughters [[H1323]] of Israel, [[H3478]] weep over [[H1058]] Saul, [[H7586]] who clothed [[H3847]] you in scarlet, [[H8144]] with [[H5973]] delights, [[H5730]] who put on [[H5927]] ornaments [[H5716]] of gold [[H2091]] upon [[H5921]] your apparel. [[H3830]]

### 25
How [[H349]] are the mighty [[H1368]] fallen [[H5307]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the battle! [[H4421]] O Jonathan, [[H3083]] slain [[H2491]] in [[H5921]] thine high places. [[H1116]]

### 26
I am distressed [[H6887]] for [[H5921]] thee, my brother [[H251]] Jonathan: [[H3083]] very [[H3966]] pleasant [[H5276]] hast thou been unto me: thy love [[H160]] to me was wonderful, [[H6381]] passing the love [[H160]] of women. [[H802]]

### 27
How [[H349]] are the mighty [[H1368]] fallen, [[H5307]] and the weapons [[H3627]] of war [[H4421]] perished! [[H6]]
