### 1
Then there was [[H1961]] a famine [[H7458]] in the days [[H3117]] of David [[H1732]] three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] year [[H8141]] after [[H310]] year; [[H8141]] and David [[H1732]] inquired [[H1245]] of [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]] And the Lord [[H3068]] answered, [[H559]] for [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] and for [[H413]] bloody [[H1818]] house, [[H1004]] because [[H5921]] he slew [[H4191]] the Gibeonites. [[H1393]]

### 2
And the king [[H4428]] called [[H7121]] the Gibeonites, [[H1393]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them; (now the Gibeonites [[H1393]] not [[H3808]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] but [[H3588]] of the remnant [[H3499]] of the Amorites; [[H567]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] had sworn [[H7650]] unto them: and Saul [[H7586]] sought [[H1245]] to slay [[H5221]] them in his zeal [[H7065]] to the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah.) [[H3063]]

### 3
Wherefore David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Gibeonites, [[H1393]] What [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] for you? and wherewith [[H4100]] shall I make the atonement, [[H3722]] that ye may bless [[H1288]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 4
And the Gibeonites [[H1393]] said [[H559]] unto him, We will have no [[H369]] silver [[H3701]] nor gold [[H2091]] of [[H5973]] Saul, [[H7586]] nor of [[H5973]] his house; [[H1004]] neither [[H369]] for us shalt thou kill [[H4191]] any man [[H376]] in Israel. [[H3478]] And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] ye [[H859]] shall say, [[H559]] will I do [[H6213]] for you. [[H6213]]

### 5
And they answered [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] The man [[H376]] that [[H834]] consumed [[H3615]] us, and that [[H834]] devised [[H1819]] against us we should be destroyed [[H8045]] from remaining [[H3320]] in any [[H3605]] of the coasts [[H1366]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 6
Let seven [[H7651]] men [[H376]] of his sons [[H1121]] be delivered [[H5414]] unto us, and we will hang up [[H3363]] them unto the Lord [[H3068]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] of Saul, [[H7586]] the Lord [[H3068]] did choose. [[H972]] And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] I [[H589]] will give [[H5414]]

### 7
But the king [[H4428]] spared [[H2550]] Mephibosheth, [[H4648]] the son [[H1121]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] because [[H5921]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] oath [[H7621]] that [[H834]] between [[H996]] them, between [[H996]] David [[H1732]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul. [[H7586]]

### 8
But the king [[H4428]] took [[H3947]] the two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] of Rizpah [[H7532]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Aiah, [[H345]] whom [[H834]] she bare [[H3205]] unto Saul, [[H7586]] Armoni [[H764]] and Mephibosheth; [[H4648]] and the five [[H2568]] sons [[H1121]] of Michal [[H4324]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Saul, [[H7586]] whom [[H834]] she brought up [[H3205]] for Adriel [[H5741]] the son [[H1121]] of Barzillai [[H1271]] the Meholathite: [[H4259]]

### 9
And he delivered [[H5414]] them into the hands [[H3027]] of the Gibeonites, [[H1393]] and they hanged [[H3363]] them in the hill [[H2022]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and they fell [[H5307]] seven [[H7651]] together, [[H3162]] and were put to death [[H4191]] in the days [[H3117]] of harvest, [[H7105]] in the first [[H7223]] in the beginning [[H8462]] of barley [[H8184]] harvest. [[H7105]]

### 10
And Rizpah [[H7532]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Aiah [[H345]] took [[H3947]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] and spread [[H5186]] it for her upon [[H413]] the rock, [[H6697]] from the beginning [[H8462]] of harvest [[H7105]] until [[H5704]] water [[H4325]] dropped [[H5413]] upon [[H5921]] them out of [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and suffered [[H5414]] neither [[H3808]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] to rest [[H5117]] on [[H5921]] them by day, [[H3119]] nor the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 11
And it was told [[H5046]] David [[H1732]] what [[H834]] Rizpah [[H7532]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Aiah, [[H345]] the concubine [[H6370]] of Saul, [[H7586]] had done. [[H6213]]

### 12
And David [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] and took [[H3947]] the bones [[H6106]] of Saul [[H7586]] and the bones [[H6106]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] his son [[H1121]] from [[H853]] the men [[H1167]] of Jabesh-gilead, [[H3003]] which [[H834]] had stolen [[H1589]] them from the street [[H7339]] of Beth-shan, [[H1052]] where [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had hanged [[H8511]] them, when [[H3117]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had slain [[H5221]] Saul [[H7586]] in Gilboa: [[H1533]]

### 13
And he brought up [[H5927]] from thence [[H8033]] the bones [[H6106]] of Saul [[H7586]] and the bones [[H6106]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] his son; [[H1121]] and they gathered [[H622]] the bones [[H6106]] of them that were hanged. [[H3363]]

### 14
And [[H853]] the bones [[H6106]] of Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] his son [[H1121]] buried [[H6912]] they in the country [[H776]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] in Zelah, [[H6762]] in the sepulchre [[H6913]] of Kish [[H7027]] his father: [[H1]] and they performed [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] commanded. [[H6680]] And after that [[H310]] God [[H430]] was intreated [[H6279]] for the land. [[H776]]

### 15
Moreover the Philistines [[H6430]] had [[H1961]] yet war [[H4421]] again with [[H854]] Israel; [[H3478]] and David [[H1732]] went down, [[H3381]] and his servants [[H5650]] with [[H5973]] him, and fought against [[H3898]] the Philistines: [[H6430]] and David [[H1732]] waxed faint. [[H5774]]

### 16
And Ishbi-benob, [[H3430]] which [[H834]] of the sons [[H3211]] of the giant, [[H7497]] the weight [[H4948]] of whose spear [[H7013]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] of brass [[H5178]] in weight, [[H4948]] he [[H1931]] being girded [[H2296]] with a new [[H2319]] thought [[H559]] to have slain [[H5221]] David. [[H1732]]

### 17
But Abishai [[H52]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] succoured [[H5826]] him, and smote [[H5221]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] and killed [[H4191]] him. Then [[H227]] the men [[H376]] of David [[H1732]] sware [[H7650]] unto him, saying, [[H559]] Thou shalt go [[H3318]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] out with us to battle, [[H4421]] that thou quench [[H3518]] not [[H3808]] the light [[H5216]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 18
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after this, [[H310]] that there was [[H1961]] again [[H5750]] a battle [[H4421]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines [[H6430]] at Gob: [[H1359]] then [[H227]] Sibbechai [[H5444]] the Hushathite [[H2843]] slew [[H5221]] Saph, [[H5593]] which [[H834]] of the sons [[H3211]] of the giant. [[H7497]]

### 19
And there was [[H1961]] again [[H5750]] a battle [[H4421]] in Gob [[H1359]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] where Elhanan [[H445]] the son [[H1121]] of Jaare-oregim, [[H3296]] a Bethlehemite, [[H1022]] slew [[H5221]] Goliath [[H1555]] the Gittite, [[H1663]] the staff [[H6086]] of whose spear [[H2595]] like a weaver's [[H707]] beam. [[H4500]]

### 20
And there was [[H1961]] yet [[H5750]] a battle [[H4421]] in Gath, [[H1661]] where was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of stature, [[H4067]] that had on every hand [[H3027]] six [[H8337]] fingers, [[H676]] and on every foot [[H7272]] six [[H8337]] toes, [[H676]] four [[H702]] and twenty [[H6242]] in number; [[H4557]] and he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] was born [[H3205]] to the giant. [[H7497]]

### 21
And when he defied [[H2778]] Israel, [[H3478]] Jonathan [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimea [[H8092]] the brother [[H251]] of David [[H1732]] slew him. [[H5221]]

### 22
These [[H428]] four [[H702]] were born [[H3205]] to the giant [[H7497]] in Gath, [[H1661]] and fell [[H5307]] by the hand [[H3027]] of David, [[H1732]] and by the hand [[H3027]] of his servants. [[H5650]]
