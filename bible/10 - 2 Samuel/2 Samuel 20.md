### 1
And there [[H8033]] happened [[H7122]] to be there a man [[H376]] of Belial, [[H1100]] whose name [[H8034]] Sheba, [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri, [[H1075]] a Benjamite: [[H3228]] and he blew [[H8628]] a trumpet, [[H7782]] and said, [[H559]] We have no [[H369]] part [[H2506]] in David, [[H1732]] neither [[H3808]] have we inheritance [[H5159]] in the son [[H1121]] of Jesse: [[H3448]] every [[H376]] man [[H376]] to his tents, [[H168]] O Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
So every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] went up [[H5927]] from after [[H310]] David, [[H1732]] followed [[H310]] Sheba [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri: [[H1075]] but the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] clave [[H1692]] unto their king, [[H4428]] from [[H4480]] Jordan [[H3383]] even to [[H5704]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
And David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] his house [[H1004]] at Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and the king [[H4428]] took [[H3947]] the ten [[H6235]] women [[H802]] concubines, [[H6370]] whom [[H834]] he had left [[H3240]] to keep [[H8104]] the house, [[H1004]] and put [[H5414]] them in ward, [[H4931]] and fed [[H3557]] them, but went in [[H935]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] them. So they were [[H1961]] shut up [[H6887]] unto [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of their death, [[H4194]] living [[H2424]] in widowhood. [[H491]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] to [[H413]] Amasa, [[H6021]] Assemble [[H2199]]  me [[H853]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] within three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] and be thou [[H859]] here [[H6311]] present. [[H5975]]

### 5
So Amasa [[H6021]] went [[H1980]] to assemble [[H2199]] Judah: [[H3063]] but he tarried longer [[H309]] than [[H4480]] the set time [[H4150]] which [[H834]] he had appointed [[H3259]] him. [[H3259]]

### 6
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abishai, [[H52]] Now [[H6258]] shall Sheba [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri [[H1075]] do us more harm [[H3415]] than [[H4480]] Absalom: [[H53]] take [[H3947]] thou [[H859]] thy lord's [[H113]] servants, [[H5650]] and pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] him, lest [[H6435]] he get [[H4672]] him fenced [[H1219]] cities, [[H5892]] and escape [[H5337]] us. [[H5869]]

### 7
And there went out [[H3318]] after [[H310]] him Joab's [[H3097]] men, [[H376]] and the Cherethites, [[H3774]] and the Pelethites, [[H6432]] and all [[H3605]] the mighty men: [[H1368]] and they went out [[H3318]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Sheba [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri. [[H1075]]

### 8
When they [[H1992]] at [[H5973]] the great [[H1419]] stone [[H68]] which [[H834]] in Gibeon, [[H1391]] Amasa [[H6021]] went [[H935]] before [[H6440]] them. And Joab's [[H3097]] garment [[H4055]] that he had put on [[H3830]] was girded [[H2296]] unto him, and upon [[H5921]] it a girdle [[H2289]] a sword [[H2719]] fastened [[H6775]] upon [[H5921]] his loins [[H4975]] in the sheath [[H8593]] thereof; and as he [[H1931]] went forth [[H3318]] it fell out. [[H5307]]

### 9
And Joab [[H3097]] said [[H559]] to Amasa, [[H6021]] thou [[H859]] in health, [[H7965]] my brother? [[H251]] And Joab [[H3097]] took [[H270]] Amasa [[H6021]] by the beard [[H2206]] with the right [[H3225]] hand [[H3027]] to kiss [[H5401]] him. [[H5401]]

### 10
But Amasa [[H6021]] took no [[H3808]] heed [[H8104]] to the sword [[H2719]] that [[H834]] in Joab's [[H3097]] hand: [[H3027]] so he smote [[H5221]] him therewith in [[H413]] the fifth [[H2570]] and shed out [[H8210]] his bowels [[H4578]] to the ground, [[H776]] and struck [[H8138]] him not [[H3808]] again; and he died. [[H4191]] So Joab [[H3097]] and Abishai [[H52]] his brother [[H251]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Sheba [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri. [[H1075]]

### 11
And one [[H376]] of Joab's [[H3097]] men [[H5288]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] him, and said, [[H559]] He [[H4310]] that [[H834]] favoureth [[H2654]] Joab, [[H3097]] and he [[H4310]] that [[H834]] for David, [[H1732]] after [[H310]] Joab. [[H3097]]

### 12
And Amasa [[H6021]] wallowed [[H1556]] in blood [[H1818]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the highway. [[H4546]] And when the man [[H376]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] stood still, [[H5975]] he removed [[H5437]] Amasa [[H6021]] out of [[H4480]] the highway [[H4546]] into the field, [[H7704]] and cast [[H7993]] a cloth [[H899]] upon [[H5921]] him, when [[H834]] he saw [[H7200]] that every [[H3605]] one that came [[H935]] by [[H5921]] him stood still. [[H5975]]

### 13
When [[H834]] he was removed [[H3014]] out of [[H4480]] the highway, [[H4546]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H376]] went on [[H5674]] after [[H310]] Joab, [[H3097]] to pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Sheba [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri. [[H1075]]

### 14
And he went through [[H5674]] all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] unto Abel, [[H59]] and to Beth-maachah, [[H1038]] and all [[H3605]] the Berites: [[H1276]] and they were gathered together, [[H7035]] and went [[H935]] also [[H637]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 15
And they came [[H935]] and besieged [[H6696]] him in Abel [[H59]] of Beth-maachah, [[H1038]] and they cast up [[H8210]] a bank [[H5550]] against [[H413]] the city, [[H5892]] and it stood [[H5975]] in the trench: [[H2426]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] Joab [[H3097]] battered [[H7843]] the wall, [[H2346]] to throw it down. [[H5307]]

### 16
Then cried [[H7121]] a wise [[H2450]] woman [[H802]] out of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] Hear, [[H8085]] hear; [[H8085]] say, [[H559]] I pray you, [[H4994]] unto [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] Come near [[H7126]] hither, [[H5704]] that I may speak [[H1696]] with [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 17
And when he was come near [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] her, the woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] thou [[H859]] Joab? [[H3097]] And he answered, [[H559]] I [[H589]] Then she said [[H559]] unto him, Hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of thine handmaid. [[H519]] And he answered, [[H559]] I [[H595]] do hear. [[H8085]]

### 18
Then she spake, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]] They were wont [[H1696]] to speak [[H1696]] in old time, [[H7223]] saying, [[H559]] They shall surely [[H7592]] ask [[H7592]] at Abel: [[H59]] and so [[H3651]] they ended [[H8552]]

### 19
I [[H595]] peaceable [[H7999]] faithful [[H539]] in Israel: [[H3478]] thou [[H859]] seekest [[H1245]] to destroy [[H4191]] a city [[H5892]] and a mother [[H517]] in Israel: [[H3478]] why [[H4100]] wilt thou swallow up [[H1104]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 20
And Joab [[H3097]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Far be it, [[H2486]] far be it [[H2486]] from me, that [[H518]] I should swallow up [[H1104]] or [[H518]] destroy. [[H7843]]

### 21
The matter [[H1697]] not [[H3808]] so: [[H3651]] but [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] of mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] Sheba [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri [[H1075]] by name, [[H8034]] hath lifted up [[H5375]] his hand [[H3027]] against the king, [[H4428]] against David: [[H1732]] deliver [[H5414]] him only, [[H905]] and I will depart [[H1980]] from [[H5921]] the city. [[H5892]] And the woman [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] Behold, [[H2009]] his head [[H7218]] shall be thrown [[H7993]] to [[H413]] thee over [[H1157]] the wall. [[H2346]]

### 22
Then the woman [[H802]] went [[H935]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] in her wisdom. [[H2451]] And they cut off [[H3772]] the head [[H7218]] of Sheba [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri, [[H1075]] and cast [[H7993]] out to [[H413]] Joab. [[H3097]] And he blew [[H8628]] a trumpet, [[H7782]] and they retired [[H6327]] from [[H5921]] the city, [[H5892]] every man [[H376]] to his tent. [[H168]] And Joab [[H3097]] returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 23
Now Joab [[H3097]] over [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] over [[H5921]] the Cherethites [[H3774]] and over [[H5921]] the Pelethites: [[H6432]]

### 24
And Adoram [[H151]] over [[H5921]] the tribute: [[H4522]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahilud [[H286]] recorder: [[H2142]]

### 25
And Sheva [[H7724]] scribe: [[H5608]] and Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar [[H54]] the priests: [[H3548]]

### 26
And Ira [[H5896]] also [[H1571]] the Jairite [[H2972]] was [[H1961]] a chief ruler [[H3548]] about David. [[H1732]]
