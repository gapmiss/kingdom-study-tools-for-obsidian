### 1
And David [[H1732]] spake [[H1696]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] in the day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] had delivered [[H5337]] him out of the hand [[H3709]] of all [[H3605]] his enemies, [[H341]] and out of the hand [[H3709]] of Saul: [[H7586]]

### 2
And he said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] my rock, [[H5553]] and my fortress, [[H4686]] and my deliverer; [[H6403]]

### 3
The God [[H430]] of my rock; [[H6697]] in him will I trust: [[H2620]] my shield, [[H4043]] and the horn [[H7161]] of my salvation, [[H3468]] my high tower, [[H4869]] and my refuge, [[H4498]] my saviour; [[H3467]] thou savest [[H3467]] me from violence. [[H2555]]

### 4
I will call on [[H7121]] the Lord, [[H3068]] worthy to be praised: [[H1984]] so shall I be saved [[H3467]] from mine enemies. [[H341]]

### 5
When [[H3588]] the waves [[H4867]] of death [[H4194]] compassed [[H661]] me, the floods [[H5158]] of ungodly men [[H1100]] made me afraid; [[H1204]]

### 6
The sorrows [[H2256]] of hell [[H7585]] compassed me about; [[H5437]] the snares [[H4170]] of death [[H4194]] prevented [[H6923]] me; [[H6923]]

### 7
In my distress [[H6862]] I called upon [[H7121]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and cried [[H7121]] to [[H413]] my God: [[H430]] and he did hear [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] out of his temple, [[H1964]] and my cry [[H7775]] into his ears. [[H241]]

### 8
Then the earth [[H776]] shook [[H1607]] and trembled; [[H7493]] the foundations [[H4146]] of heaven [[H8064]] moved [[H7264]] and shook, [[H1607]] because [[H3588]] he was wroth. [[H2734]]

### 9
There went up [[H5927]] a smoke [[H6227]] out of his nostrils, [[H639]] and fire [[H784]] out of his mouth [[H6310]] devoured: [[H398]] coals [[H1513]] were kindled [[H1197]] by [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]

### 10
He bowed [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] also, and came down; [[H3381]] and darkness [[H6205]] under [[H8478]] his feet. [[H7272]]

### 11
And he rode [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] a cherub, [[H3742]] and did fly: [[H5774]] and he was seen [[H7200]] upon [[H5921]] the wings [[H3671]] of the wind. [[H7307]]

### 12
And he made [[H7896]] darkness [[H2822]] pavilions [[H5521]] round about [[H5439]] him, dark [[H2841]] waters, [[H4325]] thick clouds [[H5645]] of the skies. [[H7834]]

### 13
Through the brightness [[H5051]] before [[H5048]] him were coals [[H1513]] of fire [[H784]] kindled. [[H1197]]

### 14
The Lord [[H3068]] thundered [[H7481]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and the most High [[H5945]] uttered [[H5414]] his voice. [[H6963]]

### 15
And he sent out [[H7971]] arrows, [[H2671]] and scattered [[H6327]] them; lightning, [[H1300]] and discomfited [[H2000]] them. [[H2000]]

### 16
And the channels [[H650]] of the sea [[H3220]] appeared, [[H7200]] the foundations [[H4146]] of the world [[H8398]] were discovered, [[H1540]] at the rebuking [[H1606]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] at the blast [[H5397]] of the breath [[H7307]] of his nostrils. [[H639]]

### 17
He sent [[H7971]] from above, [[H4791]] he took [[H3947]] me; he drew [[H4871]] me out of many [[H7227]] waters; [[H4325]]

### 18
He delivered [[H5337]] me from my strong [[H5794]] enemy, [[H341]] from them that hated [[H8130]] me: for [[H3588]] they were too strong [[H553]] for [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 19
They prevented [[H6923]] me in the day [[H3117]] of my calamity: [[H343]] but the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] my stay. [[H4937]]

### 20
He brought me forth [[H3318]] also into a large place: [[H4800]] he delivered [[H2502]] me, because [[H3588]] he delighted [[H2654]] in me. [[H2654]]

### 21
The Lord [[H3068]] rewarded [[H1580]] me according to my righteousness: [[H6666]] according to the cleanness [[H1252]] of my hands [[H3027]] hath he recompensed [[H7725]] me. [[H7725]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] I have kept [[H8104]] the ways [[H1870]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and have not [[H3808]] wickedly departed [[H7561]] from my God. [[H430]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] his judgments [[H4941]] before [[H5048]] me: and his statutes, [[H2708]] I did not [[H3808]] depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] them. [[H4480]]

### 24
I was [[H1961]] also upright [[H8549]] before him, and have kept myself [[H8104]] from mine iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 25
Therefore the Lord [[H3068]] hath recompensed [[H7725]] me according to my righteousness; [[H6666]] according to my cleanness [[H1252]] in his eye sight. [[H5048]]

### 26
With [[H5973]] the merciful [[H2623]] thou wilt shew thyself merciful, [[H2616]] with [[H5973]] the upright [[H8549]] man [[H1368]] thou wilt shew thyself upright. [[H8552]]

### 27
With [[H5973]] the pure [[H1305]] thou wilt shew thyself pure; [[H1305]] and with [[H5973]] the froward [[H6141]] thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. [[H6617]]

### 28
And the afflicted [[H6041]] people [[H5971]] thou wilt save: [[H3467]] but thine eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H5921]] the haughty, [[H7311]] thou mayest bring down. [[H8213]]

### 29
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my lamp, [[H5216]] O Lord: [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] will lighten [[H5050]] my darkness. [[H2822]]

### 30
For [[H3588]] by thee I have run [[H7323]] through a troop: [[H1416]] by my God [[H430]] have I leaped over [[H1801]] a wall. [[H7791]]

### 31
God, [[H410]] his way [[H1870]] perfect; [[H8549]] the word [[H565]] of the Lord [[H3068]] tried: [[H6884]] he [[H1931]] a buckler [[H4043]] to all [[H3605]] them that trust [[H2620]] in him. [[H2620]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] God, [[H410]] save [[H1107]] the Lord? [[H3068]] and who [[H4310]] a rock, [[H6697]] save [[H1107]] our God? [[H430]]

### 33
God [[H410]] my strength [[H4581]] power: [[H2428]] and he maketh [[H5425]] my way [[H1870]] perfect. [[H8549]]

### 34
He maketh [[H7737]] my feet [[H7272]] like hinds' [[H355]] and setteth [[H5975]] me upon [[H5921]] my high places. [[H1116]]

### 35
He teacheth [[H3925]] my hands [[H3027]] to war; [[H4421]] so that a bow [[H7198]] of steel [[H5154]] is broken [[H5181]] by mine arms. [[H2220]]

### 36
Thou hast also given [[H5414]] me the shield [[H4043]] of thy salvation: [[H3468]] and thy gentleness [[H6031]] hath made me great. [[H7235]]

### 37
Thou hast enlarged [[H7337]] my steps [[H6806]] under [[H8478]] me; so that my feet [[H7166]] did not [[H3808]] slip. [[H4571]]

### 38
I have pursued [[H7291]] mine enemies, [[H341]] and destroyed [[H8045]] them; and turned not again [[H7725]] until [[H5704]] I had consumed [[H3615]] them. [[H3615]]

### 39
And I have consumed [[H3615]] them, and wounded [[H4272]] them, that they could not [[H3808]] arise: [[H6965]] yea, they are fallen [[H5307]] under [[H8478]] my feet. [[H7272]]

### 40
For thou hast girded [[H247]] me with strength [[H2428]] to battle: [[H4421]] them that rose up [[H6965]] against me hast thou subdued [[H3766]] under [[H8478]] me. [[H8478]]

### 41
Thou hast also given [[H5414]] me the necks [[H6203]] of mine enemies, [[H341]] that I might destroy [[H6789]] them that hate [[H8130]] me. [[H8130]]

### 42
They looked, [[H8159]] but none [[H369]] to save; [[H3467]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] but he answered [[H6030]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 43
Then did I beat [[H7833]] them as small as the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] I did stamp [[H1854]] them as the mire [[H2916]] of the street, [[H2351]] did spread them abroad. [[H7554]]

### 44
Thou also hast delivered [[H6403]] me from the strivings [[H7379]] of my people, [[H5971]] thou hast kept [[H8104]] me head [[H7218]] of the heathen: [[H1471]] a people [[H5971]] I knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] shall serve [[H5647]] me. [[H5647]]

### 45
Strangers [[H1121]] shall submit themselves [[H3584]] unto me: as soon as they hear, [[H8085]] they shall be obedient [[H8085]] unto me. [[H8085]]

### 46
Strangers [[H1121]] shall fade away, [[H5034]] and they shall be afraid [[H2296]] out of their close places. [[H4526]]

### 47
The Lord [[H3068]] liveth; [[H2416]] and blessed [[H1288]] my rock; [[H6697]] and exalted [[H7311]] be the God [[H430]] of the rock [[H6697]] of my salvation. [[H3468]]

### 48
It God [[H410]] that avengeth [[H5414]] me, and that bringeth down [[H3381]] the people [[H5971]] under [[H8478]] me, [[H8478]]

### 49
And that bringeth me forth [[H3318]] from mine enemies: [[H341]] thou also hast lifted me up on high [[H7311]] above them that rose up [[H6965]] against me: thou hast delivered [[H5337]] me from the violent [[H2555]] man. [[H376]]

### 50
Therefore [[H5921]] I will give thanks [[H3034]] unto thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] and I will sing praises [[H2167]] unto thy name. [[H8034]]

### 51
the tower [[H4024]] of salvation [[H3444]] for his king: [[H4428]] and sheweth [[H6213]] mercy [[H2617]] to his anointed, [[H4899]] unto David, [[H1732]] and to his seed [[H2233]] for [[H5704]] evermore. [[H5769]]
