### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] that Absalom [[H53]] the son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] had a fair [[H3303]] sister, [[H269]] whose name [[H8034]] Tamar; [[H8559]] and Amnon [[H550]] the son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] loved [[H157]] her. [[H157]]

### 2
And Amnon [[H550]] was so vexed, [[H3334]] that he fell sick [[H2470]] for [[H5668]] his sister [[H269]] Tamar; [[H8559]] for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] a virgin; [[H1330]] and Amnon [[H550]] thought [[H5869]] it hard [[H6381]] for him to do [[H6213]] any thing [[H3972]] to her. [[H3972]]

### 3
But Amnon [[H550]] had a friend, [[H7453]] whose name [[H8034]] Jonadab, [[H3122]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimeah [[H8093]] David's [[H1732]] brother: [[H251]] and Jonadab [[H3122]] a very [[H3966]] subtil [[H2450]] man. [[H376]]

### 4
And he said [[H559]] unto him, Why [[H4069]] thou, [[H859]] the king's [[H4428]] son, [[H1121]] lean [[H1800]] from day [[H1242]] to day? [[H1242]] wilt thou not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] me? And Amnon [[H550]] said [[H559]] unto him, I [[H589]] love [[H157]] Tamar, [[H8559]] my brother [[H251]] Absalom's [[H53]] sister. [[H269]]

### 5
And Jonadab [[H3082]] said [[H559]] unto him, Lay thee down [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] thy bed, [[H4904]] and make thyself sick: [[H2470]] and when thy father [[H1]] cometh [[H935]] to see [[H7200]] thee, say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I pray thee, [[H4994]] let my sister [[H269]] Tamar [[H8559]] come, [[H935]] and give [[H1262]] me meat, [[H3899]] and dress [[H6213]] the meat [[H1279]] in my sight, [[H5869]] that [[H4616]] I may see [[H7200]] and eat [[H398]] at her hand. [[H3027]]

### 6
So Amnon [[H550]] lay down, [[H7901]] and made himself sick: [[H2470]] and when the king [[H4428]] was come [[H935]] to see [[H7200]] him, Amnon [[H550]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] let Tamar [[H8559]] my sister [[H269]] come, [[H935]] and make [[H3823]] me a couple [[H8147]] of cakes [[H3834]] in my sight, [[H5869]] that I may eat [[H1262]] at her hand. [[H3027]]

### 7
Then David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] home [[H1004]] to [[H413]] Tamar, [[H8559]] saying, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] now [[H4994]] to thy brother [[H251]] Amnon's [[H550]] house, [[H1004]] and dress [[H6213]] him meat. [[H1279]]

### 8
So Tamar [[H8559]] went [[H1980]] to her brother [[H251]] Amnon's [[H550]] house; [[H1004]] and he [[H1931]] was laid down. [[H7901]] And she took [[H3947]] flour, [[H1217]] and kneaded [[H3888]] and made cakes [[H3823]] in his sight, [[H5869]] and did bake [[H1310]] the cakes. [[H3834]]

### 9
And she took [[H3947]] a pan, [[H4958]] and poured out [[H3332]] before [[H6440]] him; but he refused [[H3985]] to eat. [[H398]] And Amnon [[H550]] said, [[H559]] Have out [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] men [[H376]] from [[H5921]] me. And they went out [[H3318]] every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] from him. [[H5921]]

### 10
And Amnon [[H550]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Tamar, [[H8559]] Bring [[H935]] the meat [[H1279]] into the chamber, [[H2315]] that I may eat [[H1262]] of thine hand. [[H3027]] And Tamar [[H8559]] took [[H3947]] the cakes [[H3834]] which [[H834]] she had made, [[H6213]] and brought [[H935]] into the chamber [[H2315]] to Amnon [[H550]] her brother. [[H251]]

### 11
And when she had brought [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] him to eat, [[H398]] he took hold [[H2388]] of her, and said [[H559]] unto her, Come [[H935]] lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] me, my sister. [[H269]]

### 12
And she answered [[H559]] him, Nay, [[H408]] my brother, [[H251]] do not [[H408]] force [[H6031]] me; for [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] such thing ought [[H3651]] to be done [[H6213]] in Israel: [[H3478]] do [[H6213]] not [[H408]]  thou [[H853]] this [[H2063]] folly. [[H5039]]

### 13
And I, [[H589]] whither [[H575]]  shall I cause [[H853]] my shame [[H2781]] to go? [[H1980]] and as for thee, [[H859]] thou shalt be [[H1961]] as one [[H259]] of the fools [[H5036]] in Israel. [[H3478]] Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the king; [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] he will not [[H3808]] withhold [[H4513]] me from [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 14
Howbeit he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto her voice: [[H6963]] but, being stronger [[H2388]] than she, forced [[H6031]] her, and lay with [[H7901]] her. [[H7901]]

### 15
Then Amnon [[H550]] hated [[H8130]] her exceedingly; [[H3966]] so that [[H3588]] the hatred [[H8135]] wherewith [[H834]] he hated [[H8130]] her greater [[H1419]] than the love [[H160]] wherewith [[H834]] he had loved [[H157]] her. And Amnon [[H550]] said [[H559]] unto her, Arise, [[H6965]] be gone. [[H1980]]

### 16
And she said [[H559]] unto him, no [[H408]] cause: [[H182]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] in sending me away [[H7971]] greater [[H1419]] than the other [[H312]] that [[H834]] thou didst [[H6213]] unto [[H5973]] me. But he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto her. [[H8085]]

### 17
Then he called [[H7121]] his servant [[H5288]] that ministered [[H8334]] unto him, and said, [[H559]] Put [[H7971]] now [[H4994]] this [[H2063]] out [[H2351]] from me, [[H5921]] and bolt [[H5274]] the door [[H1817]] after [[H310]] her. [[H310]]

### 18
And a garment [[H3801]] of divers colours [[H6446]] upon [[H5921]] her: for [[H3588]] with such [[H3651]] robes [[H4598]] were the king's [[H4428]] daughters [[H1323]] virgins [[H1330]] apparelled. [[H3847]] Then his servant [[H8334]] brought [[H3318]] her out, [[H2351]] and bolted [[H5274]] the door [[H1817]] after [[H310]] her. [[H310]]

### 19
And Tamar [[H8559]] put [[H3947]] ashes [[H665]] on [[H5921]] her head, [[H7218]] and rent [[H7167]] her garment [[H3801]] of divers colours [[H6446]] that [[H834]] on [[H5921]] her, and laid [[H7760]] her hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] her head, [[H7218]] and went [[H1980]] on [[H1980]] crying. [[H2199]]

### 20
And Absalom [[H53]] her brother [[H251]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Hath Amnon [[H550]] thy brother [[H251]] been [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee? but hold [[H2790]] now [[H6258]] thy peace, my sister: [[H269]] he [[H1931]] thy brother; [[H251]] regard [[H7896]] not [[H408]] this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]] So Tamar [[H8559]] remained [[H3427]] desolate [[H8076]] in her brother [[H251]] Absalom's [[H53]] house. [[H1004]]

### 21
But when king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]]  of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things, [[H1697]] he was very [[H3966]] wroth. [[H2734]]

### 22
And Absalom [[H53]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H5973]] his brother Amnon [[H550]] neither [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] nor [[H5704]] bad: [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] Absalom [[H53]] hated [[H8130]] Amnon, [[H550]] because [[H1697]] he had forced [[H6031]] his sister [[H269]] Tamar. [[H8559]]

### 23
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after two full [[H3117]] years, [[H8141]] that Absalom [[H53]] had [[H1961]] sheepshearers [[H1494]] in Baal-hazor, [[H1178]] which [[H834]] beside [[H5973]] Ephraim: [[H669]] and Absalom [[H53]] invited [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] sons. [[H1121]]

### 24
And Absalom [[H53]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] thy servant [[H5650]] hath sheepshearers; [[H1494]] let the king, [[H4428]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] and his servants [[H5650]] go [[H3212]] with [[H5973]] thy servant. [[H5650]]

### 25
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] Nay, [[H408]] my son, [[H1121]] let us not [[H408]] all [[H3605]] now [[H4994]] go, [[H1980]] lest [[H3808]] we be chargeable [[H3513]] unto [[H5921]] thee. And he pressed [[H6555]] him: howbeit he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] go, [[H1980]] but blessed [[H1288]] him. [[H1288]]

### 26
Then said [[H559]] Absalom, [[H53]] If not, [[H3808]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] let my brother [[H251]] Amnon [[H550]] go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] us. And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto him, Why [[H4100]] should he go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] thee? [[H5973]]

### 27
But Absalom [[H53]] pressed [[H6555]]  him, that he let [[H853]] Amnon [[H550]] and all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] go [[H7971]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 28
Now Absalom [[H53]] had commanded [[H6680]] his servants, [[H5288]] saying, [[H559]] Mark [[H7200]] ye now [[H4994]] when Amnon's [[H550]] heart [[H3820]] is merry [[H2896]] with wine, [[H3196]] and when I say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, Smite [[H5221]] Amnon; [[H550]] then kill [[H4191]] him, fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] have not [[H3808]] I [[H595]] commanded [[H6680]] you? be courageous, [[H2388]] and be [[H1961]] valiant. [[H1121]]

### 29
And the servants [[H5288]] of Absalom [[H53]] did [[H6213]] unto Amnon [[H550]] as [[H834]] Absalom [[H53]] had commanded. [[H6680]] Then all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] arose, [[H6965]] and every man [[H376]] gat him up [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] his mule, [[H6505]] and fled. [[H5127]]

### 30
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] while they [[H1992]] were in the way, [[H1870]] that tidings [[H8052]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Absalom [[H53]] hath slain [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] sons, [[H1121]] and there is not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of them left. [[H3498]]

### 31
Then the king [[H4428]] arose, [[H6965]] and tare [[H7167]] his garments, [[H899]] and lay [[H7901]] on the earth; [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] stood by [[H5324]] with their clothes [[H899]] rent. [[H7167]]

### 32
And Jonadab, [[H3122]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimeah [[H8093]] David's [[H1732]] brother, [[H251]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Let not [[H408]] my lord [[H113]] suppose [[H559]] they have slain [[H4191]] all [[H3605]] the young men [[H5288]] the king's [[H4428]] sons; [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] Amnon [[H550]] only [[H905]] is dead: [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] by [[H5921]] the appointment [[H6310]] of Absalom [[H53]] this hath been [[H1961]] determined [[H7760]] from the day [[H3117]] that he forced [[H6031]] his sister [[H269]] Tamar. [[H8559]]

### 33
Now [[H6258]] therefore let not [[H408]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] take [[H7760]] the thing [[H1697]] to [[H413]] his heart, [[H3820]] to think [[H559]] that all [[H3605]] the king's [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] are dead: [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] Amnon [[H550]] only [[H905]] is dead. [[H4191]]

### 34
But Absalom [[H53]] fled. [[H1272]] And the young man [[H5288]] that kept the watch [[H6822]] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H1980]] much [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] by the way [[H1870]] of the hill [[H2022]] side [[H6654]] behind [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 35
And Jonadab [[H3122]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Behold, [[H2009]] the king's [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] come: [[H935]] as thy servant [[H5650]] said, [[H1697]] so [[H3651]] it is. [[H1961]]

### 36
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as soon as he had made an end [[H3615]] of speaking, [[H1696]] that, behold, [[H2009]] the king's [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] came, [[H935]] and lifted up [[H5375]] their voice [[H6963]] and wept: [[H1058]] and the king [[H4428]] also [[H1571]] and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] wept [[H1058]] very [[H3966]] sore. [[H1065]]

### 37
But Absalom [[H53]] fled, [[H1272]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Talmai, [[H8526]] the son [[H1121]] of Ammihud, [[H5991]] king [[H4428]] of Geshur. [[H1650]] And mourned [[H56]] for [[H5921]] his son [[H1121]] every [[H3605]] day. [[H3117]]

### 38
So Absalom [[H53]] fled, [[H1272]] and went [[H1980]] to Geshur, [[H1650]] and was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]]

### 39
And king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] longed [[H3615]] to go forth [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] Absalom: [[H53]] for [[H3588]] he was comforted [[H5162]] concerning [[H5921]] Amnon, [[H550]] seeing [[H3588]] he was dead. [[H4191]]
