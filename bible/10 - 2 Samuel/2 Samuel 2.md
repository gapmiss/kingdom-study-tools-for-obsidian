### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after this, [[H310]] that David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Shall I go up [[H5927]] into any [[H259]] of the cities [[H5892]] of Judah? [[H3063]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Go up. [[H5927]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Whither [[H575]] shall I go up? [[H5927]] And he said, [[H559]] Unto Hebron. [[H2275]]

### 2
So David [[H1732]] went up [[H5927]] thither, [[H8033]] and his two [[H8147]] wives [[H802]] also, [[H1571]] Ahinoam [[H293]] the Jezreelitess, [[H3159]] and Abigail [[H26]] Nabal's [[H5037]] wife [[H802]] the Carmelite. [[H3761]]

### 3
And his men [[H376]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him did David [[H1732]] bring up, [[H5927]] every man [[H376]] with his household: [[H1004]] and they dwelt [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Hebron. [[H2275]]

### 4
And the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] came, [[H935]] and there [[H8033]] they anointed [[H4886]] David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] And they told [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] the men [[H376]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] that [[H834]] buried [[H6912]] Saul. [[H7586]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Jabesh-gilead, [[H3003]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Blessed [[H1288]] ye [[H859]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] ye have shewed [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] kindness [[H2617]] unto [[H5973]] your lord, [[H113]] unto [[H5973]] Saul, [[H7586]] and have buried [[H6912]] him. [[H6912]]

### 6
And now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] shew [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] unto [[H5973]] you: and I [[H595]] also [[H1571]] will requite [[H6213]] you this [[H2063]] kindness, [[H2896]] because [[H834]] ye have done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 7
Therefore now [[H6258]] let your hands [[H3027]] be strengthened, [[H2388]] and be [[H1961]] ye valiant: [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] your master [[H113]] Saul [[H7586]] is dead, [[H4191]] and also [[H1571]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] have anointed [[H4886]] me king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 8
But Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] captain [[H8269]] of Saul's [[H7586]] host, [[H6635]] took [[H3947]] Ish-bosheth [[H378]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and brought him over [[H5674]] to Mahanaim; [[H4266]]

### 9
And made him king [[H4427]] over [[H413]] Gilead, [[H1568]] and over [[H413]] the Ashurites, [[H805]] and over [[H413]] Jezreel, [[H3157]] and over [[H5921]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and over [[H5921]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] and over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 10
Ish-bosheth [[H378]] Saul's [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and reigned [[H4427]] two [[H8147]] years. [[H8141]] But [[H389]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] followed [[H310]] David. [[H1732]]

### 11
And the time [[H4557]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] was [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] in Hebron [[H2275]] over [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] was [[H1961]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] and six [[H8337]] months. [[H2320]]

### 12
And Abner [[H74]] the son [[H1121]] of Ner, [[H5369]] and the servants [[H5650]] of Ish-bosheth [[H378]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] went out [[H3318]] from Mahanaim [[H4266]] to Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 13
And Joab [[H3097]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] and the servants [[H5650]] of David, [[H1732]] went out, [[H3318]] and met [[H6298]] together [[H3162]] by [[H5921]] the pool [[H1295]] of Gibeon: [[H1391]] and they sat down, [[H3427]] the one [[H428]] on the one side [[H2088]] of [[H5921]] the pool, [[H1295]] and the other [[H428]] on the other side [[H2088]] of [[H5921]] the pool. [[H1295]]

### 14
And Abner [[H74]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] Let the young men [[H5288]] now [[H4994]] arise, [[H6965]] and play [[H7832]] before [[H6440]] us. And Joab [[H3097]] said, [[H559]] Let them arise. [[H6965]]

### 15
Then there arose [[H6965]] and went over [[H5674]] by number [[H4557]] twelve [[H8147]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] which to Ish-bosheth [[H378]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and twelve [[H8147]] of the servants [[H5650]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 16
And they caught [[H2388]] every one [[H376]] his fellow [[H7453]] by the head, [[H7218]] and his sword [[H2719]] in his fellow's [[H7453]] side; [[H6654]] so they fell down [[H5307]] together: [[H3162]] wherefore that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] was called [[H7121]] Helkath-hazzurim, [[H2521]] which [[H834]] in Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 17
And there was [[H1961]] a very [[H3966]] sore [[H7186]] battle [[H4421]] that [[H1931]] day; [[H3117]] and Abner [[H74]] was beaten, [[H5062]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] before [[H6440]] the servants [[H5650]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 18
And there [[H8033]] were [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] there, Joab, [[H3097]] and Abishai, [[H52]] and Asahel: [[H6214]] and Asahel [[H6214]] light [[H7031]] of foot [[H7272]] as a [[H259]] wild [[H7704]] roe. [[H6643]]

### 19
And Asahel [[H6214]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Abner; [[H74]] and in going [[H1980]] he turned [[H5186]] not [[H3808]] to [[H5921]] the right hand [[H3225]] nor to [[H5921]] the left [[H8040]] from following [[H310]] Abner. [[H74]]

### 20
Then Abner [[H74]] looked [[H6437]] behind [[H310]] him, and said, [[H559]] thou [[H859]] Asahel? [[H6214]] And he answered, [[H559]] I [[H595]]

### 21
And Abner [[H74]] said [[H559]] to him, Turn thee aside [[H5186]] to [[H5921]] thy right hand [[H3225]] or [[H176]] to [[H5921]] thy left, [[H8040]] and lay thee hold [[H270]] on one [[H259]] of the young men, [[H5288]] and take [[H3947]]  thee [[H853]] his armour. [[H2488]] But Asahel [[H6214]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] from following [[H310]] of him. [[H310]]

### 22
And Abner [[H74]] said [[H559]] again [[H3254]] to [[H413]] Asahel, [[H6214]] Turn thee aside [[H5493]] from following [[H310]] me: wherefore [[H4100]] should I smite [[H5221]] thee to the ground? [[H776]] how [[H349]] then should I hold up [[H5375]] my face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] Joab [[H3097]] thy brother? [[H251]]

### 23
Howbeit he refused [[H3985]] to turn aside: [[H5493]] wherefore Abner [[H74]] with the hinder end of the spear [[H2595]] smote [[H5221]] him under [[H413]] the fifth [[H2570]] that the spear [[H2595]] came out [[H3318]] behind [[H310]] him; and he fell down [[H5307]] there, [[H8033]] and died [[H4191]] in the same place: [[H8478]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] as many [[H3605]] as came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] Asahel [[H6214]] fell down [[H5307]] and died [[H4191]] stood still. [[H5975]]

### 24
Joab [[H3097]] also and Abishai [[H52]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Abner: [[H74]] and the sun [[H8121]] went down [[H935]] when they [[H1992]] were come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the hill [[H1389]] of Ammah, [[H522]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] Giah [[H1520]] by the way [[H1870]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] of Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 25
And the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] gathered themselves together [[H6908]] after [[H310]] Abner, [[H74]] and became [[H1961]] one [[H259]] troop, [[H92]] and stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of an [[H259]] hill. [[H1389]]

### 26
Then Abner [[H74]] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] and said, [[H559]] Shall the sword [[H2719]] devour [[H398]] for ever? [[H5331]] knowest [[H3045]] thou not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] it will be [[H1961]] bitterness [[H4751]] in the latter end? [[H314]] how long [[H5704]] shall it be then, ere [[H3808]] thou bid [[H559]] the people [[H5971]] return [[H7725]] from following [[H310]] their brethren? [[H251]]

### 27
And Joab [[H3097]] said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] liveth, [[H2416]] unless [[H3884]] thou hadst spoken, [[H1696]] surely [[H3588]] then [[H227]] in the morning [[H1242]] the people [[H5971]] had gone up [[H5927]] every one [[H376]] from following [[H310]] his brother. [[H251]]

### 28
So Joab [[H3097]] blew [[H8628]] a trumpet, [[H7782]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] stood still, [[H5975]] and pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Israel [[H3478]] no [[H3808]] more, [[H5750]] neither [[H3808]] fought [[H3898]] they any more. [[H3254]]

### 29
And Abner [[H74]] and his men [[H582]] walked [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] through the plain, [[H6160]] and passed over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and went through [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] Bithron, [[H1338]] and they came [[H935]] to Mahanaim. [[H4266]]

### 30
And Joab [[H3097]] returned [[H7725]] from following [[H310]] Abner: [[H74]] and when he had gathered together, [[H6908]] all the people [[H5971]] there lacked [[H6485]] of David's [[H1732]] servants [[H5650]] nineteen [[H8672]] men [[H376]] and Asahel. [[H6214]]

### 31
But the servants [[H5650]] of David [[H1732]] had smitten [[H5221]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and of Abner's [[H74]] men, [[H582]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] and threescore [[H8346]] men [[H376]] died. [[H4191]]

### 32
And they took up [[H5375]] Asahel, [[H6214]] and buried [[H6912]] him in the sepulchre [[H6913]] of his father, [[H1]] which [[H834]] Bethlehem. [[H1035]] And Joab [[H3097]] and his men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] night, [[H3915]] and they came to Hebron [[H2275]] at break of day. [[H215]]
