### 1
And again [[H3254]] the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and he moved [[H5496]] David [[H1732]] against them to say, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] number [[H4487]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
For the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab [[H3097]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host, [[H2428]] which [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, Go [[H7751]] now [[H4994]] through all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] from Dan [[H1835]] even to [[H5704]] Beer-sheba, [[H884]] and number [[H6485]]  ye [[H853]] the people, [[H5971]] that I may know [[H3045]] the number [[H4557]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 3
And Joab [[H3097]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Now the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] add [[H3254]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] how many soever [[H1992]]  they be, [[H1992]] an hundredfold, [[H3967]] and that the eyes [[H5869]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] may see [[H7200]] but why [[H4100]] doth my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] delight [[H2654]] in this [[H2088]] thing? [[H1697]]

### 4
Notwithstanding the king's [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] prevailed [[H2388]] against [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] and against [[H5921]] the captains [[H8269]] of the host. [[H2428]] And Joab [[H3097]] and the captains [[H8269]] of the host [[H2428]] went out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the king, [[H4428]] to number [[H6485]] the people [[H5971]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And they passed over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and pitched [[H2583]] in Aroer, [[H6177]] on the right side [[H3225]] of the city [[H5892]] that [[H834]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the river [[H5158]] of Gad, [[H1410]] and toward [[H413]] Jazer: [[H3270]]

### 6
Then they came [[H935]] to Gilead, [[H1568]] and to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Tahtim-hodshi; [[H8483]] and they came [[H935]] to Dan-jaan, [[H1842]] and about [[H5439]] to [[H413]] Zidon, [[H6721]]

### 7
And came [[H935]] to the strong hold [[H4013]] of Tyre, [[H6865]] and to all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the Hivites, [[H2340]] and of the Canaanites: [[H3669]] and they went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the south [[H5045]] of Judah, [[H3063]] to Beer-sheba. [[H884]]

### 8
So when they had gone [[H7751]] through all [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] they came [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] at the end [[H7097]] of nine [[H8672]] months [[H2320]] and twenty [[H6242]] days. [[H3117]]

### 9
And Joab [[H3097]] gave up [[H5414]] the sum [[H4557]] of the number [[H4662]] of the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] the king: [[H4428]] and there were [[H1961]] in Israel [[H3478]] eight [[H8083]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] valiant [[H2428]] men [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] the sword; [[H2719]] and the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 10
And David's [[H1732]] heart [[H3820]] smote [[H5221]] him after [[H310]] that [[H3651]] he had numbered [[H5608]] the people. [[H5971]] And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I have sinned [[H2398]] greatly [[H3966]] in that [[H834]] I have done: [[H6213]] and now, [[H6258]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] O Lord, [[H3068]] take away [[H5674]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of thy servant; [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I have done very [[H3966]] foolishly. [[H5528]]

### 11
For when David [[H1732]] was up [[H6965]] in the morning, [[H1242]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Gad, [[H1410]] David's [[H1732]] seer, [[H2374]] saying, [[H559]]

### 12
Go [[H1980]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H1696]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I [[H595]] offer [[H5190]] thee three [[H7969]] choose [[H977]] thee one [[H259]] of them, [[H1992]] that I may do [[H6213]] it unto thee. [[H6213]]

### 13
So Gad [[H1410]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and told [[H5046]] him, and said [[H559]] unto him, Shall seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine [[H7458]] come [[H935]] unto thee in thy land? [[H776]] or [[H518]] wilt thou flee [[H5127]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] before [[H6440]] thine enemies, [[H6862]] while they [[H1931]] pursue [[H7291]] thee? or [[H518]] that there be [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] days' [[H3117]] pestilence [[H1698]] in thy land? [[H776]] now [[H6258]] advise, [[H3045]] and see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] answer [[H1697]] I shall return [[H7725]] to him that sent [[H7971]] me. [[H7971]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Gad, [[H1410]] I am in a great [[H3966]] strait: [[H6862]] let us fall [[H5307]] now [[H4994]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] his mercies [[H7356]] great: [[H7227]] and let me not [[H408]] fall [[H5307]] into the hand [[H3027]] of man. [[H120]]

### 15
So the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H5414]] a pestilence [[H1698]] upon Israel [[H3478]] from the morning [[H1242]] even to [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] appointed: [[H4150]] and there died [[H4191]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] from Dan [[H1835]] even to [[H5704]] Beer-sheba [[H884]] seventy [[H7657]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 16
And when the angel [[H4397]] stretched out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] upon Jerusalem [[H3389]] to destroy [[H7843]] it, the Lord [[H3068]] repented him [[H5162]] of [[H413]] the evil, [[H7451]] and said [[H559]] to the angel [[H4397]] that destroyed [[H7843]] the people, [[H5971]] It is enough: [[H7227]] stay [[H7503]] now [[H6258]] thine hand. [[H3027]] And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] by [[H5973]] the threshingplace [[H1637]] of Araunah [[H728]] the Jebusite. [[H2983]]

### 17
And David [[H1732]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] when he saw [[H7200]] the angel [[H4397]] that smote [[H5221]] the people, [[H5971]] and said, [[H559]] Lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] have sinned, [[H2398]] and I [[H595]] have done wickedly: [[H5753]] but these [[H428]] sheep, [[H6629]] what [[H4100]] have they done? [[H6213]] let thine hand, [[H3027]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] be [[H1961]] against me, and against my father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 18
And Gad [[H1410]] came [[H935]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Go up, [[H5927]] rear [[H6965]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] in the threshingfloor [[H1637]] of Araunah [[H728]] the Jebusite. [[H2983]]

### 19
And David, [[H1732]] according to the saying [[H1697]] of Gad, [[H1410]] went up [[H5927]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded. [[H6680]]

### 20
And Araunah [[H728]] looked, [[H8259]] and saw [[H7200]] the king [[H4428]] and his servants [[H5650]] coming on [[H5674]] toward [[H5921]] him: and Araunah [[H728]] went out, [[H3318]] and bowed himself [[H7812]] before the king [[H4428]] on his face [[H639]] upon the ground. [[H776]]

### 21
And Araunah [[H728]] said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4069]] is my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] his servant? [[H5650]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] To buy [[H7069]] the threshingfloor [[H1637]] of [[H5973]] thee, to build [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] that the plague [[H4046]] may be stayed [[H6113]] from [[H5921]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 22
And Araunah [[H728]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Let my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] take [[H3947]] and offer up [[H5927]] what good [[H2896]] unto him: [[H5869]] behold, [[H7200]] oxen [[H1241]] for burnt sacrifice, [[H5930]] and threshing instruments [[H4173]] and instruments [[H3627]] of the oxen [[H1241]] for wood. [[H6086]]

### 23
All [[H3605]] these did Araunah, [[H728]] a king, [[H4428]] give [[H5414]] unto [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]] And Araunah [[H728]] said [[H559]] unto the king, [[H4428]] The Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] accept [[H7521]] thee. [[H7521]]

### 24
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Araunah, [[H728]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] I will surely [[H7069]] buy [[H7069]] of [[H853]] thee at a price: [[H4242]] neither [[H3808]] will I offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] of that which doth cost me nothing. [[H2600]] So David [[H1732]] bought [[H7069]] the threshingfloor [[H1637]] and the oxen [[H1241]] for fifty [[H2572]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 25
And David [[H1732]] built [[H1129]] there [[H8033]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings. [[H8002]] So the Lord [[H3068]] was intreated [[H6279]] for the land, [[H776]] and the plague [[H4046]] was stayed [[H6113]] from [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]
