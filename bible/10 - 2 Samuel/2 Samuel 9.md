And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Is [[H3426]] there yet [[H5750]] any [[H834]] that is left [[H3498]] of the house [[H1004]] of Saul, [[H7586]] that I may shew [[H6213]] him kindness [[H2617]] for Jonathan's [[H3083]] sake? [[H5668]]

### 2
And of the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] a servant [[H5650]] whose name [[H8034]] Ziba. [[H6717]] And when they had called [[H7121]] him unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, thou [[H859]] Ziba? [[H6717]] And he said, [[H559]] Thy servant [[H5650]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] there not [[H657]] yet [[H5750]] any [[H376]] of the house [[H1004]] of Saul, [[H7586]] that I may shew [[H6213]] the kindness [[H2617]] of God [[H430]] unto [[H5973]] him? And Ziba [[H6717]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Jonathan [[H3083]] hath yet [[H5750]] a son, [[H1121]] lame [[H5223]] on feet. [[H7272]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto him, Where [[H375]] he? [[H1931]] And Ziba [[H6717]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] in the house [[H1004]] of Machir, [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Ammiel, [[H5988]] in Lo-debar. [[H3810]]

### 5
Then king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] sent, [[H7971]] and fetched [[H3947]] him out of the house [[H1004]] of Machir, [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Ammiel, [[H5988]] from Lo-debar. [[H3810]]

### 6
Now when Mephibosheth, [[H4648]] the son [[H1121]] of Jonathan, [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] was come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] he fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] his face, [[H6440]] and did reverence. [[H7812]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Mephibosheth. [[H4648]] And he answered, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] thy servant! [[H5650]]

### 7
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto him, Fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I will surely [[H6213]] shew [[H6213]] thee kindness [[H2617]] for Jonathan [[H3083]] thy father's [[H1]] sake, [[H5668]] and will restore [[H7725]]  thee [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H7704]] of Saul [[H7586]] thy father; [[H1]] and thou [[H859]] shalt eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] at [[H5921]] my table [[H7979]] continually. [[H8548]]

### 8
And he bowed himself, [[H7812]] and said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] thy servant, [[H5650]] that [[H3588]] thou shouldest look [[H6437]] upon [[H413]] such [[H834]] a dead [[H4191]] dog [[H3611]] as I [[H3644]]

### 9
Then the king [[H4428]] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Ziba, [[H6717]] Saul's [[H7586]] servant, [[H5288]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I have given [[H5414]] unto thy master's [[H113]] son [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] pertained [[H1961]] to Saul [[H7586]] and to all [[H3605]] his house. [[H1004]]

### 10
Thou [[H859]] therefore, and thy sons, [[H1121]] and thy servants, [[H5650]] shall till [[H5647]] the land [[H127]] for him, and thou shalt bring [[H935]] in that thy master's [[H113]] son [[H1121]] may have [[H1961]] food [[H3899]] to eat: [[H398]] but Mephibosheth [[H4648]] thy master's [[H113]] son [[H1121]] shall eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] alway [[H8548]] at [[H5921]] my table. [[H7979]] Now Ziba [[H6717]] had fifteen [[H2568]] sons [[H1121]] and twenty [[H6242]] servants. [[H5650]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] Ziba [[H6717]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] According to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] hath commanded [[H6680]] his servant, [[H5650]] so [[H3651]] shall thy servant [[H5650]] do. [[H6213]] As for Mephibosheth, [[H4648]] he shall eat [[H398]] at [[H5921]] my table, [[H7979]] as one [[H259]] of the king's [[H4428]] sons. [[H1121]]

### 12
And Mephibosheth [[H4648]] had a young [[H6996]] son, [[H1121]] whose name [[H8034]] Micha. [[H4316]] And all [[H3605]] that dwelt [[H4186]] in the house [[H1004]] of Ziba [[H6717]] servants [[H5650]] unto Mephibosheth. [[H4648]]

### 13
So Mephibosheth [[H4648]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] did eat [[H398]] continually [[H8548]] at [[H5921]] the king's [[H4428]] table; [[H7979]] and was lame [[H6455]] on both [[H8147]] his feet. [[H7272]]
