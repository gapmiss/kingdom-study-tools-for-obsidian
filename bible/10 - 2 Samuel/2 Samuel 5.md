### 1
Then came [[H935]] all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] unto Hebron, [[H2275]] and spake, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] we [[H587]] thy bone [[H6106]] and thy flesh. [[H1320]]

### 2
Also [[H1571]] in time past, [[H865]] when Saul [[H7586]] was [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] us, thou [[H859]] wast [[H1961]] he that leddest out [[H3318]] and broughtest in [[H935]] Israel: [[H3478]] and the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to thee, Thou [[H859]] shalt feed [[H7462]] my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and thou [[H859]] shalt be [[H1961]] a captain [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
So all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] to Hebron; [[H2275]] and king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] made [[H3772]] a league [[H1285]] with them in Hebron [[H2275]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and they anointed [[H4886]] David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
David [[H1732]] thirty [[H7970]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he began to reign, [[H4427]] he reigned [[H4427]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

### 5
In Hebron [[H2275]] he reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] and six [[H8337]] months: [[H2320]] and in Jerusalem [[H3389]] he reigned [[H4427]] thirty [[H7970]] and three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah. [[H3063]]

### 6
And the king [[H4428]] and his men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto [[H413]] the Jebusites, [[H2983]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land: [[H776]] which spake [[H559]] unto David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Except [[H3588]] thou take away [[H5493]] the blind [[H5787]] and the lame, [[H6455]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] come in [[H935]] hither: [[H2008]] thinking, [[H559]] David [[H1732]] cannot [[H3808]] come in [[H935]] hither. [[H2008]]

### 7
Nevertheless David [[H1732]] took [[H3920]] the strong hold [[H4686]] of Zion: [[H6726]] the same [[H1931]] the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] Whosoever [[H3605]] getteth up [[H5060]] to the gutter, [[H6794]] and smiteth [[H5221]] the Jebusites, [[H2983]] and the lame [[H6455]] and the blind, [[H5787]] hated [[H8130]] of David's [[H1732]] soul, [[H5315]] Wherefore [[H5921]] they said, [[H559]] The blind [[H5787]] and the lame [[H6455]] shall not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the house. [[H1004]]

### 9
So David [[H1732]] dwelt [[H3427]] in the fort, [[H4686]] and called [[H7121]] it the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And David [[H1732]] built [[H1129]] round about [[H5439]] from [[H4480]] Millo [[H4407]] and inward. [[H1004]]

### 10
And David [[H1732]] went [[H3212]] on, [[H1980]] and grew great, [[H1419]] and the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts [[H6635]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 11
And Hiram [[H2438]] king [[H4428]] of Tyre [[H6865]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and cedar [[H730]] trees, [[H6086]] and carpenters, [[H2796]] and masons: [[H7023]] and they built [[H1129]] David [[H1732]] an house. [[H1004]]

### 12
And David [[H1732]] perceived [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had established [[H3559]] him king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and that [[H3588]] he had exalted [[H5375]] his kingdom [[H4467]] for his people [[H5971]] Israel's [[H3478]] sake. [[H5668]]

### 13
And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] more [[H5750]] concubines [[H6370]] and wives [[H802]] out of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] after [[H310]] he was come [[H935]] from Hebron: [[H2275]] and there were yet [[H5750]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] born [[H3205]] to David. [[H1732]]

### 14
And these [[H428]] the names [[H8034]] of those that were born [[H3209]] unto him in Jerusalem; [[H3389]] Shammua, [[H8051]] and Shobab, [[H7727]] and Nathan, [[H5416]] and Solomon, [[H8010]]

### 15
Ibhar [[H2984]] also, and Elishua, [[H474]] and Nepheg, [[H5298]] and Japhia, [[H3309]]

### 16
And Elishama, [[H476]] and Eliada, [[H450]] and Eliphalet. [[H467]]

### 17
But when the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] they had anointed [[H4886]] David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the Philistines [[H6430]] came up [[H5927]] to seek [[H1245]] David; [[H1732]] and David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] and went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the hold. [[H4686]]

### 18
The Philistines [[H6430]] also came [[H935]] and spread themselves [[H5203]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 19
And David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Shall I go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the Philistines? [[H6430]] wilt thou deliver [[H5414]] them into mine hand? [[H3027]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Go up: [[H5927]] for [[H3588]] I will doubtless [[H5414]] deliver [[H5414]] the Philistines [[H6430]] into thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 20
And David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to Baal-perazim, [[H1188]] and David [[H1732]] smote [[H5221]] them there, [[H8033]] and said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath broken forth upon [[H6555]] mine enemies [[H341]] before [[H6440]] me, as the breach [[H6556]] of waters. [[H4325]] Therefore [[H5921]] he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Baal-perazim. [[H1188]]

### 21
And there [[H8033]] they left [[H5800]] their images, [[H6091]] and David [[H1732]] and his men [[H582]] burned [[H5375]] them. [[H5375]]

### 22
And the Philistines [[H6430]] came up [[H5927]] yet [[H5750]] again, [[H3254]] and spread themselves [[H5203]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 23
And when David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] he said, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] go up; [[H5927]] fetch a compass [[H5437]] behind [[H310]] them, and come [[H935]] upon them over against [[H4136]] the mulberry trees. [[H1057]]

### 24
And let it be, [[H1961]] when thou hearest [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of a going [[H6807]] in the tops [[H7218]] of the mulberry trees, [[H1057]] that then [[H227]] thou shalt bestir [[H2782]] thyself: for [[H3588]] then [[H227]] shall the Lord [[H3068]] go out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] thee, to smite [[H5221]] the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 25
And David [[H1732]] did so, [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him; and smote [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H6430]] from Geba [[H1387]] until thou come [[H935]] to Gazer. [[H1507]]
