### 1
Again, [[H5750]] David [[H1732]] gathered [[H3254]]  together [[H853]] all [[H3605]] chosen [[H977]] of Israel, [[H3478]] thirty [[H7970]] thousand. [[H505]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] with all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him from Baale [[H1184]] of Judah, to bring up [[H5927]] from thence [[H8033]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] whose [[H834]] name [[H8034]] is called [[H7121]] by the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] that dwelleth [[H3427]] the cherubims. [[H3742]]

### 3
And they set [[H7392]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] upon [[H413]] a new [[H2319]] cart, [[H5699]] and brought [[H5375]] it out of the house [[H1004]] of Abinadab [[H41]] that [[H834]] in Gibeah: [[H1390]] and Uzzah [[H5798]] and Ahio, [[H283]] the sons [[H1121]] of Abinadab, [[H41]] drave [[H5090]] the new [[H2319]] cart. [[H5699]]

### 4
And they brought [[H5375]] it out of the house [[H1004]] of Abinadab [[H41]] which [[H834]] at Gibeah, [[H1390]] accompanying [[H5973]] the ark [[H727]] of God: [[H430]] and Ahio [[H283]] went [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] the ark. [[H727]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] played [[H7832]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] on all [[H3605]] manner of fir [[H1265]] wood, [[H6086]] even on harps, [[H3658]] and on psalteries, [[H5035]] and on timbrels, [[H8596]] and on cornets, [[H4517]] and on cymbals. [[H6767]]

### 6
And when they came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Nachon's [[H5225]] threshingfloor, [[H1637]] Uzzah [[H5798]] put forth [[H7971]] to [[H413]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] and took hold [[H270]] of it; for [[H3588]] the oxen [[H1241]] shook [[H8058]]

### 7
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Uzzah; [[H5798]] and God [[H430]] smote [[H5221]] him there [[H8033]] for [[H5921]] error; [[H7944]] and there [[H8033]] he died [[H4191]] by [[H5973]] the ark [[H727]] of God. [[H430]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] was displeased, [[H2734]] because [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] had made [[H6555]] a breach [[H6556]] upon Uzzah: [[H5798]] and he called [[H7121]] the name of the [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Perez-uzzah [[H6560]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 9
And David [[H1732]] was afraid [[H3372]]  of [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and said, [[H559]] How [[H349]] shall the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] me? [[H413]]

### 10
So David [[H1732]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] remove [[H5493]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] him into [[H5921]] the city [[H5892]] of David: [[H1732]] but David [[H1732]] carried it aside [[H5186]] into the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] the Gittite. [[H1663]]

### 11
And the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] continued [[H3427]] in the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] the Gittite [[H1663]] three [[H7969]] months: [[H2320]] and the Lord [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] Obed-edom, [[H5654]] and all [[H3605]] his household. [[H1004]]

### 12
And it was told [[H5046]] king [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath blessed [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom, [[H5654]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] unto him, because [[H5668]] of the ark [[H727]] of God. [[H430]] So David [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] and brought up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] from the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] into the city [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] with gladness. [[H8057]]

### 13
And it was [[H1961]] that when [[H3588]] they that bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] had gone [[H6805]] six [[H8337]] paces, [[H6806]] he sacrificed [[H2076]] oxen [[H7794]] and fatlings. [[H4806]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] danced [[H3769]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] might; [[H5797]] and David [[H1732]] girded [[H2296]] with a linen [[H906]] ephod. [[H646]]

### 15
So David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] brought up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with shouting, [[H8643]] and with the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet. [[H7782]]

### 16
And as [[H1961]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H935]] into the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] Michal [[H4324]] Saul's [[H7586]] daughter [[H1323]] looked [[H8259]] through [[H1157]] a window, [[H2474]] and saw [[H7200]] king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] leaping [[H6339]] and dancing [[H3769]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and she despised [[H959]] him in her heart. [[H3820]]

### 17
And they brought in [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and set [[H3322]] it in his place, [[H4725]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had pitched [[H5186]] for it: and David [[H1732]] offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
And as soon as David [[H1732]] had made an end [[H3615]] of offering [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings, [[H8002]] he blessed [[H1288]] the people [[H5971]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 19
And he dealt [[H2505]] among all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] among the whole [[H3605]] multitude [[H1995]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as well to [[H5704]] the women [[H802]] as men, [[H376]] to every one [[H376]] a [[H259]] cake [[H2471]] of bread, [[H3899]] and a [[H259]] good piece [[H829]] and a [[H259]] flagon [[H809]] So all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] departed [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] to his house. [[H1004]]

### 20
Then David [[H1732]] returned [[H7725]] to bless [[H1288]] his household. [[H1004]] And Michal [[H4324]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Saul [[H7586]] came out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] David, [[H1732]] and said, [[H559]] How [[H4100]] glorious [[H3513]] was the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] to day, [[H3117]] who [[H834]] uncovered himself [[H1540]] to day [[H3117]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the handmaids [[H519]] of his servants, [[H5650]] as one [[H259]] of the vain fellows [[H7386]] shamelessly uncovereth himself! [[H1540]]

### 21
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Michal, [[H4324]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] chose [[H977]] me before thy father, [[H1]] and before all [[H3605]] his house, [[H1004]] to appoint [[H6680]] me ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] over [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] therefore will I play [[H7832]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
And I will yet [[H5750]] be more vile [[H7043]] than thus, [[H2063]] and will be [[H1961]] base [[H8217]] in mine own sight: [[H5869]] and of [[H5973]] the maidservants [[H519]] which [[H834]] thou hast spoken [[H559]] of, of them shall I be had in honour. [[H3513]]

### 23
Therefore Michal [[H4324]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Saul [[H7586]] had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] child [[H3206]] unto [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of her death. [[H4194]]
