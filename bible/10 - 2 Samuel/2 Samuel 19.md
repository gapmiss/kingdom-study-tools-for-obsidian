### 1
And it was told [[H5046]] Joab, [[H3097]] Behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] weepeth [[H1058]] and mourneth [[H56]] for [[H5921]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 2
And the victory [[H8668]] that [[H1961]] day [[H3117]] was into mourning [[H60]] unto all [[H3605]] the people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] say [[H559]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] how the king [[H4428]] was grieved [[H6087]] for [[H5921]] his son. [[H1121]]

### 3
And the people [[H5971]] gat [[H935]] them by stealth [[H1589]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] into the city, [[H5892]] as [[H834]] people [[H5971]] being ashamed [[H3637]] steal away [[H1589]] when they flee [[H5127]] in battle. [[H4421]]

### 4
But the king [[H4428]] covered [[H3813]] his face, [[H6440]] and the king [[H4428]] cried [[H2199]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] O my son [[H1121]] Absalom, [[H53]] O Absalom, [[H53]] my son, [[H1121]] my son! [[H1121]]

### 5
And Joab [[H3097]] came [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] Thou hast shamed [[H3001]] this day [[H3117]] the faces [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] thy servants, [[H5650]] which this day [[H3117]] have saved [[H4422]] thy life, [[H5315]] and the lives [[H5315]] of thy sons [[H1121]] and of thy daughters, [[H1323]] and the lives [[H5315]] of thy wives, [[H802]] and the lives [[H5315]] of thy concubines; [[H6370]]

### 6
In that thou lovest [[H157]] thine enemies, [[H8130]] and hatest [[H8130]] thy friends. [[H157]] For [[H3588]] thou hast declared [[H5046]] this day, [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] thou regardest neither [[H369]] princes [[H8269]] nor servants: [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] this day [[H3117]] I perceive, [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] if [[H3863]] Absalom [[H53]] had lived, [[H2416]] and all [[H3605]] we had died [[H4191]] this day, [[H3117]] then [[H227]] it had pleased thee well. [[H3477]]

### 7
Now [[H6258]] therefore arise, [[H6965]] go forth, [[H3318]] and speak [[H1696]] comfortably [[H3820]] unto thy servants: [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I swear [[H7650]] by the Lord, [[H3068]] if [[H3588]] thou go not forth, [[H3318]] there will not [[H518]] tarry [[H3885]] one [[H376]] with [[H854]] thee this night: [[H3915]] and that [[H2063]] will be worse [[H7489]] unto thee than all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] befell [[H935]] thee from thy youth [[H5271]] until [[H5704]] now. [[H6258]]

### 8
Then the king [[H4428]] arose, [[H6965]] and sat [[H3427]] in the gate. [[H8179]] And they told [[H5046]] unto all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] doth sit [[H3427]] in the gate. [[H8179]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king: [[H4428]] for Israel [[H3478]] had fled [[H5127]] every man [[H376]] to his tent. [[H168]]

### 9
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] were [[H1961]] at strife [[H1777]] throughout all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] The king [[H4428]] saved [[H5337]] us out of the hand [[H3709]] of our enemies, [[H341]] and he [[H1931]] delivered [[H4422]] us out of the hand [[H3709]] of the Philistines; [[H6430]] and now [[H6258]] he is fled [[H1272]] out of [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] for Absalom. [[H53]]

### 10
And Absalom, [[H53]] whom [[H834]] we anointed [[H4886]] over [[H5921]] us, is dead [[H4191]] in battle. [[H4421]] Now [[H6258]] therefore why [[H4100]] speak [[H2790]] ye [[H859]] not a word of bringing [[H7725]] the king [[H4428]] back? [[H4428]]

### 11
And king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Zadok [[H6659]] and to [[H413]] Abiathar [[H54]] the priests, [[H3548]] saying, [[H559]] Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] are [[H1961]] ye the last [[H314]] to bring [[H7725]] the king [[H4428]] back to [[H413]] his house? [[H1004]] seeing the speech [[H1697]] of all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] is come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] to [[H413]] his house. [[H1004]]

### 12
Ye [[H859]] my brethren, [[H251]] ye [[H859]] my bones [[H6106]] and my flesh: [[H1320]] wherefore [[H4100]] then are [[H1961]] ye the last [[H314]] to bring back [[H7725]] the king? [[H4428]]

### 13
And say [[H559]] ye to Amasa, [[H6021]] thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] of my bone, [[H6106]] and of my flesh? [[H1320]] God [[H430]] do [[H6213]] so [[H3541]] to me, and more [[H3254]] also, [[H3541]] if [[H518]] thou be [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] before [[H6440]] me continually [[H3117]] in the room [[H8478]] of Joab. [[H3097]]

### 14
And he bowed [[H5186]] the heart [[H3824]] of all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] even as one [[H259]] man; [[H376]] so that they sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Return [[H7725]] thou, [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] thy servants. [[H5650]]

### 15
So the king [[H4428]] returned, [[H7725]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Jordan. [[H3383]] And Judah [[H3063]] came [[H935]] to Gilgal, [[H1537]] to go [[H1980]] to meet [[H7125]] the king, [[H4428]] to conduct [[H5674]] the king [[H4428]]  over [[H853]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 16
And Shimei [[H8096]] the son [[H1121]] of Gera, [[H1617]] a Benjamite, [[H1145]] which [[H834]] of Bahurim, [[H980]] hasted [[H4116]] and came down [[H3381]] with [[H5973]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] to meet [[H7125]] king [[H4428]] David. [[H1732]]

### 17
And a thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] with [[H5973]] him, and Ziba [[H6717]] the servant [[H5288]] of the house [[H1004]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and his fifteen [[H2568]] sons [[H1121]] and his twenty [[H6242]] servants [[H5650]] with [[H854]] him; and they went over [[H6743]] Jordan [[H3383]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 18
And there went over [[H5674]] a ferry boat [[H5679]] to carry over [[H5674]] the king's [[H4428]] household, [[H1004]] and to do [[H6213]] what he thought [[H5869]] good. [[H2896]] And Shimei [[H8096]] the son [[H1121]] of Gera [[H1617]] fell down [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] as he was come over [[H5674]] Jordan; [[H3383]]

### 19
And said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Let not [[H408]] my lord [[H113]] impute [[H2803]] iniquity [[H5771]] unto me, neither [[H408]] do thou remember [[H2142]] that which [[H834]] thy servant [[H5650]] did perversely [[H5753]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] went out [[H3318]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that the king [[H4428]] should take [[H7760]] it to [[H413]] his heart. [[H3820]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] doth know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have sinned: [[H2398]] therefore, behold, [[H2009]] I am come [[H935]] the first [[H7223]] this day [[H3117]] of all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] to go down [[H3381]] to meet [[H7125]] my lord [[H113]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 21
But Abishai [[H52]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Shall not [[H3808]] Shimei [[H8096]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H8478]] this, [[H2063]] because [[H3588]] he cursed [[H7043]] the Lord's [[H3068]] anointed? [[H4899]]

### 22
And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have I to do with you, ye sons [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] that [[H3588]] ye should this day [[H3117]] be [[H1961]] adversaries [[H7854]] unto me? shall there any man [[H376]] be put to death [[H4191]] this day [[H3117]] in Israel? [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] do not [[H3808]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] this day [[H3117]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel? [[H3478]]

### 23
Therefore the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Shimei, [[H8096]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] And the king [[H4428]] sware [[H7650]] unto him. [[H7650]]

### 24
And Mephibosheth [[H4648]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] came down [[H3381]] to meet [[H7125]] the king, [[H4428]] and had neither [[H3808]] dressed [[H6213]] his feet, [[H7272]] nor [[H3808]] trimmed [[H6213]] his beard, [[H8222]] nor [[H3808]] washed [[H3526]] his clothes, [[H899]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] the king [[H4428]] departed [[H1980]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] he came [[H935]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 25
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] he was come [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] to meet [[H7125]] the king, [[H4428]] that the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto him, Wherefore [[H4100]] wentest [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] thou with [[H5973]] me, Mephibosheth? [[H4648]]

### 26
And he answered, [[H559]] My lord, [[H113]] O king, [[H4428]] my servant [[H5650]] deceived [[H7411]] me: for [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] said, [[H559]] I will saddle [[H2280]] me an ass, [[H2543]] that I may ride [[H7392]] thereon, [[H5921]] and go [[H1980]] to [[H854]] the king; [[H4428]] because [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] lame. [[H6455]]

### 27
And he hath slandered [[H7270]] thy servant [[H5650]] unto [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king; [[H4428]] but my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] as an angel [[H4397]] of God: [[H430]] do [[H6213]] therefore good [[H2896]] in thine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] my father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] were [[H1961]] but [[H3808]] dead [[H4194]] men [[H376]] before my lord [[H113]] the king: [[H4428]] yet didst thou set [[H7896]] thy servant [[H5650]] among them that did eat [[H398]] at thine own table. [[H7979]] What [[H4100]] right [[H6666]] therefore have [[H3426]] I yet [[H5750]] to cry [[H2199]] any more [[H5750]] unto [[H413]] the king? [[H4428]]

### 29
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto him, Why [[H4100]] speakest [[H1696]] thou any more [[H5750]] of thy matters? [[H1697]] I have said, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] and Ziba [[H6717]] divide [[H2505]] the land. [[H7704]]

### 30
And Mephibosheth [[H4648]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Yea, [[H1571]] let him take [[H3947]] all, [[H3605]] forasmuch [[H310]] as [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] is come again [[H935]] in peace [[H7965]] unto [[H413]] his own house. [[H1004]]

### 31
And Barzillai [[H1271]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] came down [[H3381]] from Rogelim, [[H7274]] and went over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] with [[H854]] the king, [[H4428]] to conduct [[H7971]]  him over [[H853]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 32
Now Barzillai [[H1271]] was a very [[H3966]] aged [[H2204]] man, fourscore [[H8084]] years [[H8141]] old: [[H1121]] and he [[H1931]]  had provided [[H853]] the king [[H4428]] of sustenance [[H3557]] while he lay [[H7871]] at Mahanaim; [[H4266]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] man. [[H376]]

### 33
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Barzillai, [[H1271]] Come [[H5674]] thou [[H859]] over with me, [[H854]] and I will feed [[H3557]] thee with me in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 34
And Barzillai [[H1271]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] How [[H4100]] long [[H3117]] have I to live, [[H2416]] that [[H3588]] I should go up [[H5927]] with [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] unto Jerusalem? [[H3389]]

### 35
I [[H595]] this day [[H3117]] fourscore [[H8084]] years [[H8141]] old: [[H1121]] can I discern [[H3045]] between [[H996]] good [[H2896]] and evil? [[H7451]] can [[H518]] thy servant [[H5650]] taste [[H2938]] what [[H834]] I eat [[H398]] or what [[H834]] I drink? [[H8354]] can [[H518]] I hear [[H8085]] any more [[H5750]] the voice [[H6963]] of singing men [[H7891]] and singing women? [[H7891]] wherefore [[H4100]] then should thy servant [[H5650]] be [[H1961]] yet [[H5750]] a burden [[H4853]] unto [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king? [[H4428]]

### 36
Thy servant [[H5650]] will go [[H5674]] a little way [[H4592]]  over [[H853]] Jordan [[H3383]] with [[H854]] the king: [[H4428]] and why [[H4100]] should the king [[H4428]] recompense [[H1580]] it me with such [[H2063]] a reward? [[H1578]]

### 37
Let thy servant, [[H5650]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] turn back again, [[H7725]] that I may die [[H4191]] in mine own city, [[H5892]] by [[H5973]] the grave [[H6913]] of my father [[H1]] and of my mother. [[H517]] But behold [[H2009]] thy servant [[H5650]] Chimham; [[H3643]] let him go over [[H5674]] with [[H5973]] my lord [[H113]] the king; [[H4428]] and do [[H6213]]  to him [[H853]] what [[H834]] shall seem [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] unto thee. [[H2896]]

### 38
And the king [[H4428]] answered, [[H559]] Chimham [[H3643]] shall go over [[H5674]] with [[H854]] me, and I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]]  to him [[H853]] that which shall seem [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] unto thee: and whatsoever [[H834]] thou shalt require [[H977]] of [[H5921]] me, will I do [[H6213]] for thee. [[H6213]]

### 39
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] went over [[H5674]] Jordan. [[H3383]] And when the king [[H4428]] was come over, [[H5674]] the king [[H4428]] kissed [[H5401]] Barzillai, [[H1271]] and blessed [[H1288]] him; and he returned [[H7725]] unto his own place. [[H4725]]

### 40
Then the king [[H4428]] went on [[H5674]] to Gilgal, [[H1537]] and Chimham [[H3643]] went on [[H5674]] with [[H5973]] him: and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] conducted [[H5674]] the king, [[H4428]] and also [[H1571]] half [[H2677]] the people [[H5971]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 41
And, behold, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Why [[H4069]] have our brethren [[H251]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] stolen thee away, [[H1589]] and have brought [[H5674]] the king, [[H4428]] and his household, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] David's [[H1732]] men [[H376]] with [[H5973]]  him, over [[H853]] Jordan? [[H3383]]

### 42
And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] answered [[H6030]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Because [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] near of kin [[H7138]] to [[H413]] us: wherefore [[H4100]] then be ye angry [[H2734]] for [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] matter? [[H1697]] have we eaten [[H398]] at all [[H398]] of [[H4480]] the king's [[H4428]] or [[H518]] hath he given [[H5375]] us any gift? [[H5379]]

### 43
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] answered [[H6030]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and said, [[H559]] We have ten [[H6235]] parts [[H3027]] in the king, [[H4428]] and we [[H589]] have also [[H1571]] more in David [[H1732]] than [[H4480]] ye: why [[H4069]] then did ye despise [[H7043]] us, that our advice [[H1697]] should not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] first [[H7223]] had in bringing back [[H7725]] our king? [[H4428]] And the words [[H1697]] of the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] were fiercer [[H7185]] than the words [[H1697]] of the men [[H376]] of Israel. [[H3478]]
