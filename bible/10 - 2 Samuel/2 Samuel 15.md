### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H310]]  this, [[H3651]] that Absalom [[H53]] prepared [[H6213]] him chariots [[H4818]] and horses, [[H5483]] and fifty [[H2572]] men [[H376]] to run [[H7323]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 2
And Absalom [[H53]] rose up early, [[H7925]] and stood [[H5975]] beside [[H3027]] the way [[H1870]] of the gate: [[H8179]] and it was [[H1961]] that when any [[H3605]] man [[H376]] that [[H834]] had [[H1961]] a controversy [[H7379]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] for judgment, [[H4941]] then Absalom [[H53]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] him, and said, [[H559]] Of [[H2088]] what [[H335]] city [[H5892]] thou? [[H859]] And he said, [[H559]] Thy servant [[H5650]] of one [[H259]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
And Absalom [[H53]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, See, [[H7200]] thy matters [[H1697]] good [[H2896]] and right; [[H5228]] but no [[H369]] man of the king [[H4428]] to hear [[H8085]] thee. [[H8085]]

### 4
Absalom [[H53]] said [[H559]] moreover, Oh that [[H4310]] I were made [[H7760]] judge [[H8199]] in the land, [[H776]] that every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] which [[H834]] hath [[H1961]] any suit [[H7379]] or cause [[H4941]] might come [[H935]] unto [[H5921]] me, and I would do him justice! [[H6663]]

### 5
And it was [[H1961]] that when any man [[H376]] came nigh [[H7126]] to do him obeisance, [[H7812]] he put forth [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] and took [[H2388]] him, and kissed [[H5401]] him. [[H5401]]

### 6
And on this [[H2088]] manner [[H1697]] did [[H6213]] Absalom [[H53]] to all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] for judgment: [[H4941]] so Absalom [[H53]] stole [[H1589]] the hearts [[H3820]] of the men [[H376]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after [[H7093]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] that Absalom [[H53]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] let me go [[H1980]] and pay [[H7999]] my vow, [[H5088]] which [[H834]] I have vowed [[H5087]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] in Hebron. [[H2275]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] vowed [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] while I abode [[H3427]] at Geshur [[H1650]] in Syria, [[H758]] saying, [[H559]] If [[H518]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall bring me again [[H7725]] indeed to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] then I will serve [[H5647]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto him, Go [[H1980]] in peace. [[H7965]] So he arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Hebron. [[H2275]]

### 10
But Absalom [[H53]] sent [[H7971]] spies [[H7270]] throughout all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] As soon as ye hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] then ye shall say, [[H559]] Absalom [[H53]] reigneth [[H4427]] in Hebron. [[H2275]]

### 11
And with [[H854]] Absalom [[H53]] went [[H1980]] two hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] out of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] called; [[H7121]] and they went [[H1980]] in their simplicity, [[H8537]] and they knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 12
And Absalom [[H53]] sent [[H7971]]  for [[H853]] Ahithophel [[H302]] the Gilonite, [[H1526]] David's [[H1732]] counseller, [[H3289]] from his city, [[H5892]] from Giloh, [[H1542]] while he offered [[H2076]] sacrifices. [[H2077]] And the conspiracy [[H7195]] was [[H1961]] strong; [[H533]] for the people [[H5971]] increased [[H7227]] continually [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 13
And there came [[H935]] a messenger [[H5046]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] The hearts [[H3820]] of the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] are [[H1961]] after [[H310]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 14
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him at Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Arise, [[H6965]] and let us flee; [[H1272]] for [[H3588]] we shall [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] escape [[H6413]] from [[H6440]] Absalom: [[H53]] make speed [[H4116]] to depart, [[H1980]] lest [[H6435]] he overtake [[H5381]] us suddenly, [[H4116]] and bring [[H5080]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H5921]] us, and smite [[H5221]] the city [[H5892]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 15
And the king's [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Behold, [[H2009]] thy servants [[H5650]] whatsoever [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] shall appoint. [[H977]]

### 16
And the king [[H4428]] went forth, [[H3318]] and all [[H3605]] his household [[H1004]] after [[H7272]] him. And the king [[H4428]] left [[H5800]] ten [[H6235]] women, [[H802]] concubines, [[H6370]] to keep [[H8104]] the house. [[H1004]]

### 17
And the king [[H4428]] went forth, [[H3318]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] after [[H7272]] him, and tarried [[H5975]] in a place [[H1004]] that was far off. [[H4801]]

### 18
And all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] passed on [[H5674]] beside [[H3027]] him; and all [[H3605]] the Cherethites, [[H3774]] and all [[H3605]] the Pelethites, [[H6432]] and all [[H3605]] the Gittites, [[H1663]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] which [[H834]] came [[H935]] after [[H7272]] him from Gath, [[H1661]] passed on [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 19
Then said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] to [[H413]] Ittai [[H863]] the Gittite, [[H1663]] Wherefore [[H4100]] goest [[H1980]] thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] with [[H854]] us? return [[H7725]] to thy place, [[H4725]] and abide [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the king: [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a stranger, [[H5237]] and also [[H1571]] an exile. [[H1540]]

### 20
Whereas thou camest [[H935]] yesterday, [[H8543]] should I this day [[H3117]] make thee go up [[H3212]] and down [[H5128]] with [[H5973]] us? seeing I [[H589]] go [[H1980]] whither [[H5921]] I [[H589]] may, thou, [[H1980]] return [[H7725]] and take back [[H7725]] thy brethren: [[H251]] mercy [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] with thee. [[H5973]]

### 21
And Ittai [[H863]] answered [[H6030]] the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] and my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] liveth, [[H2416]] surely [[H3588]] in what [[H834]] place [[H4725]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] shall be, [[H1961]] whether [[H518]] in death [[H4194]] or [[H518]] life, [[H2416]] even [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] also will thy servant [[H5650]] be. [[H1961]]

### 22
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ittai, [[H863]] Go [[H1980]] and pass over. [[H5674]] And Ittai [[H863]] the Gittite [[H1663]] passed over, [[H5674]] and all [[H3605]] his men, [[H376]] and all [[H3605]] the little ones [[H2945]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 23
And all [[H3605]] the country [[H776]] wept [[H1058]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice, [[H6963]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] passed over: [[H5674]] the king [[H4428]] also himself passed over [[H5674]] the brook [[H5158]] Kidron, [[H6939]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] passed over, [[H5674]] toward [[H6440]] the way [[H1870]]  of [[H853]] the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 24
And lo [[H2009]] Zadok [[H6659]] also, [[H1571]] and all [[H3605]] the Levites [[H3881]] with [[H854]] him, bearing [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of God: [[H430]] and they set down [[H3332]] the ark [[H727]] of God; [[H430]] and Abiathar [[H54]] went up, [[H5927]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] had done [[H8552]] passing [[H5674]] out of [[H4480]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 25
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto Zadok, [[H6659]] Carry back [[H7725]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] into the city: [[H5892]] if [[H518]] I shall find [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] he will bring me again, [[H7725]] and shew [[H7200]] me it, and his habitation: [[H5116]]

### 26
But if [[H518]] he thus [[H3541]] say, [[H559]] I have no [[H3808]] delight [[H2654]] in thee; behold, [[H2005]] I, let him do [[H6213]] to me as [[H834]] seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] unto him. [[H2896]]

### 27
The king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] also unto [[H413]] Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] thou [[H859]] a seer? [[H7200]] return [[H7725]] into the city [[H5892]] in peace, [[H7965]] and your two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] you, Ahimaaz [[H290]] thy son, [[H1121]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Abiathar. [[H54]]

### 28
See, [[H7200]] I [[H595]] will tarry [[H4102]] in the plain [[H5679]] of the wilderness, [[H4057]] until [[H5704]] there come [[H935]] word [[H1697]] from [[H5973]] you to certify [[H5046]] me. [[H5046]]

### 29
Zadok [[H6659]] therefore and Abiathar [[H54]] carried [[H7725]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] again to Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and they tarried [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]]

### 30
And David [[H1732]] went up [[H5927]] by the ascent [[H4608]] of Olivet, [[H2132]] and wept [[H1058]] as he went up, [[H5927]] and had his head [[H7218]] covered, [[H2645]] and he [[H1931]] went [[H1980]] barefoot: [[H3182]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him covered [[H2645]] every man [[H376]] his head, [[H7218]] and they went up, [[H5927]] weeping [[H1058]] as they went up. [[H5927]]

### 31
And told [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Ahithophel [[H302]] among the conspirators [[H7194]] with [[H5973]] Absalom. [[H53]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] O Lord, [[H3068]] I pray thee, [[H4994]]  turn [[H853]] the counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel [[H302]] into foolishness. [[H5528]]

### 32
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that David [[H1732]] was come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the top [[H7218]] where [[H834]] he worshipped [[H7812]] God, [[H430]] behold, [[H2009]] Hushai [[H2365]] the Archite [[H757]] came to meet [[H7125]] him with his coat [[H3801]] rent, [[H7167]] and earth [[H127]] upon [[H5921]] his head: [[H7218]]

### 33
Unto whom David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou passest on [[H5674]] with [[H854]] me, then thou shalt be [[H1961]] a burden [[H4853]] unto [[H5921]] me: [[H5921]]

### 34
But if [[H518]] thou return [[H7725]] to the city, [[H5892]] and say [[H559]] unto Absalom, [[H53]] I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] thy servant, [[H5650]] O king; [[H4428]] I [[H589]] thy father's [[H1]] servant [[H5650]] hitherto, [[H227]] so I [[H589]] now [[H6258]] also thy servant: [[H5650]] then mayest thou for me defeat [[H6565]] the counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel. [[H302]]

### 35
And not [[H3808]] there [[H8033]] with [[H5973]] thee Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar [[H54]] the priests? [[H3548]] therefore it shall be, [[H1961]] what [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] soever [[H834]] thou shalt hear [[H8085]] out of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] thou shalt tell [[H5046]] to Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar [[H54]] the priests. [[H3548]]

### 36
Behold, [[H2009]] there [[H8033]] with [[H5973]] them their two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] Ahimaaz [[H290]] Zadok's [[H6659]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] Abiathar's [[H54]] and by them [[H3027]] ye shall send [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] me every [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] ye can hear. [[H8085]]

### 37
So Hushai [[H2365]] David's [[H1732]] friend [[H7463]] came [[H935]] into the city, [[H5892]] and Absalom [[H53]] came [[H935]] into Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
