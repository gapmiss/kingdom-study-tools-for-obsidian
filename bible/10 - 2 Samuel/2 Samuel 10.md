### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after this, [[H310]] that the king [[H4428]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] died, [[H4191]] and Hanun [[H2586]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 2
Then said [[H559]] David, [[H1732]] I will shew [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] unto [[H5973]] Hanun [[H2586]] the son [[H1121]] of Nahash, [[H5176]] as [[H834]] his father [[H1]] shewed [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] unto me. [[H5978]] And David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] to comfort [[H5162]] him by the hand [[H3027]] of his servants [[H5650]] for [[H413]] his father. [[H1]] And David's [[H1732]] servants [[H5650]] came [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 3
And the princes [[H8269]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Hanun [[H2586]] their lord, [[H113]] Thinkest [[H5869]] thou that David [[H1732]] doth honour [[H3513]] thy father, [[H1]] that [[H3588]] he hath sent [[H7971]] comforters [[H5162]] unto thee? hath not [[H3808]] David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] his servants [[H5650]] unto [[H413]] thee, to [[H5668]] search [[H2713]] the city, [[H5892]] and to spy it out, [[H7270]] and to overthrow [[H2015]] it? [[H2015]]

### 4
Wherefore Hanun [[H2586]] took [[H3947]] David's [[H1732]] servants, [[H5650]] and shaved off [[H1548]]  the [[H853]] one half [[H2677]] of their beards, [[H2206]] and cut off [[H3772]] their garments [[H4063]] in the middle, [[H2677]] to [[H5704]] their buttocks, [[H8357]] and sent them away. [[H7971]]

### 5
When they told [[H5046]] unto David, [[H1732]] he sent [[H7971]] to meet [[H7125]] them, because [[H3588]] the men [[H582]] were [[H1961]] greatly [[H3966]] ashamed: [[H3637]] and the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Tarry [[H3427]] at Jericho [[H3405]] until [[H5704]] your beards [[H2206]] be grown, [[H6779]] and return. [[H7725]]

### 6
And when the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they stank [[H887]] before David, [[H1732]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] sent [[H7971]] and hired [[H7936]] the Syrians [[H758]] of Beth-rehob, [[H1050]] and the Syrians [[H758]] of Zoba, [[H6678]] twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] footmen, [[H7273]] and of king [[H4428]] Maacah [[H4601]] a thousand [[H505]] men, [[H376]] and of Ish-tob [[H8147]] twelve [[H6240]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 7
And when David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] of he sent [[H7971]] Joab, [[H3097]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of the mighty men. [[H1368]]

### 8
And the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] came out, [[H3318]] and put the battle [[H4421]] in array [[H6186]] at the entering in [[H6607]] of the gate: [[H8179]] and the Syrians [[H758]] of Zoba, [[H6678]] and of Rehob, [[H7340]] and Ish-tob, [[H2897]] and Maacah, [[H4601]] by themselves [[H905]] in the field. [[H7704]]

### 9
When Joab [[H3097]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the front [[H6440]] of the battle [[H4421]] was [[H1961]] against [[H413]] him before [[H6440]] and behind, [[H268]] he chose [[H977]] of all [[H3605]] the choice [[H977]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and put in array [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the Syrians: [[H758]]

### 10
And the rest [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] he delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Abishai [[H52]] his brother, [[H251]] that he might put in array [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 11
And he said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] the Syrians [[H758]] be too strong [[H2388]] for [[H4480]] me, then thou shalt [[H1961]] help [[H3444]] me: but if [[H518]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] be too strong [[H2388]] for [[H4480]] thee, then I will come [[H1980]] and help [[H3467]] thee. [[H3467]]

### 12
Be of good courage, [[H2388]] and let us play the men [[H2388]] for [[H1157]] our people, [[H5971]] and for [[H1157]] the cities [[H5892]] of our God: [[H430]] and the Lord [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] that which seemeth [[H5869]] him good. [[H2896]]

### 13
And Joab [[H3097]] drew nigh, [[H5066]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him, unto the battle [[H4421]] against the Syrians: [[H758]] and they fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 14
And when the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Syrians [[H758]] were fled, [[H5127]] then fled [[H5127]] they also before [[H6440]] Abishai, [[H52]] and entered [[H935]] into the city. [[H5892]] So Joab [[H3097]] returned [[H7725]] from [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and came [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 15
And when the Syrians [[H758]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they were smitten [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] they gathered themselves [[H622]] together. [[H3162]]

### 16
And Hadarezer [[H1928]] sent, [[H7971]] and brought out [[H3318]] the Syrians [[H758]] that [[H834]] beyond [[H5676]] the river: [[H5104]] and they came [[H935]] to Helam; [[H2431]] and Shobach [[H7731]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] of Hadarezer [[H1928]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 17
And when it was told [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] he gathered together, [[H622]] all Israel [[H3478]] and passed over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and came [[H935]] to Helam. [[H2431]] And the Syrians [[H758]] set themselves in array [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] David, [[H1732]] and fought [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 18
And the Syrians [[H758]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Israel; [[H3478]] and David [[H1732]] slew [[H2026]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] chariots [[H7393]] of the Syrians, [[H758]] and forty [[H705]] thousand [[H505]] horsemen, [[H6571]] and smote [[H5221]] Shobach [[H7731]] the captain [[H8269]] of their host, [[H6635]] who died [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]]

### 19
And when all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] to Hadarezer [[H1928]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they were smitten [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] they made peace [[H7999]] with [[H854]] Israel, [[H3478]] and served [[H5647]] them. So the Syrians [[H758]] feared [[H3372]] to help [[H3467]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] any more. [[H5750]]
