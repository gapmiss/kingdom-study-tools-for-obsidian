### 1
Now Joab [[H3097]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] perceived [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the king's [[H4428]] heart [[H3820]] toward [[H5921]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 2
And Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] to Tekoah, [[H8620]] and fetched [[H3947]] thence [[H8033]] a wise [[H2450]] woman, [[H802]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, I pray thee, [[H4994]] feign thyself to be a mourner, [[H56]] and put on [[H3847]] now [[H4994]] mourning [[H60]] apparel, [[H899]] and anoint [[H5480]] not [[H408]] thyself with oil, [[H8081]] but be [[H1961]] as a woman [[H802]] that [[H2088]] had a long [[H7227]] time [[H3117]] mourned [[H56]] for [[H5921]] the dead: [[H4191]]

### 3
And come [[H935]] to the king, [[H4428]] and speak [[H1696]] on [[H413]] this [[H2088]] manner [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] him. So Joab [[H3097]] put [[H7760]] the words [[H1697]] in her mouth. [[H6310]]

### 4
And when the woman [[H802]] of Tekoah [[H8621]] spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] she fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] her face [[H639]] to the ground, [[H776]] and did obeisance, [[H7812]] and said, [[H559]] Help, [[H3467]] O king. [[H4428]]

### 5
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto her, What [[H4100]] aileth thee? And she answered, [[H559]] I [[H589]] indeed [[H61]] a widow [[H490]] woman, [[H802]] and mine husband [[H376]] is dead. [[H4191]]

### 6
And thy handmaid [[H8198]] had two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] and they two [[H8147]] strove together [[H5327]] in the field, [[H7704]] and none [[H369]] to part [[H5337]] them, but the one [[H259]] smote [[H5221]] the other, [[H259]] and slew [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 7
And, behold, [[H2009]] the whole [[H3605]] family [[H4940]] is risen [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] thine handmaid, [[H8198]] and they said, [[H559]] Deliver [[H5414]] him that smote [[H5221]] his brother, [[H251]] that we may kill [[H4191]] him, for the life [[H5315]] of his brother [[H251]] whom [[H834]] he slew; [[H2026]] and we will destroy [[H8045]] the heir [[H3423]] also: [[H1571]] and so they shall quench [[H3518]] my coal [[H1513]] which [[H834]] is left, [[H7760]] and shall not [[H1115]] leave [[H7604]] to my husband [[H376]] name [[H8034]] nor remainder [[H7611]] upon [[H6440]] the earth. [[H127]]

### 8
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the woman, [[H802]] Go [[H1980]] to thine house, [[H1004]] and I [[H589]] will give charge [[H6680]] concerning [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 9
And the woman [[H802]] of Tekoah [[H8621]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] My lord, [[H113]] O king, [[H4428]] the iniquity [[H5771]] on [[H5921]] me, and on [[H5921]] my father's [[H1]] house: [[H1004]] and the king [[H4428]] and his throne [[H3678]] guiltless. [[H5355]]

### 10
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Whosoever saith [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee, bring [[H935]] him to [[H413]] me, and he shall not [[H3808]] touch [[H5060]] thee any more. [[H3254]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] she, I pray thee, [[H4994]] let the king [[H4428]] remember [[H2142]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] that thou wouldest not [[H3808]] suffer the revengers [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] to destroy [[H7843]] any more, [[H7235]] lest they destroy [[H8045]] my son. [[H1121]] And he said, [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] there shall not [[H518]] one hair [[H8185]] of thy son [[H1121]] fall [[H5307]] to the earth. [[H776]]

### 12
Then the woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] Let thine handmaid, [[H8198]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] speak [[H1696]] word [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king. [[H4428]] And he said, [[H559]] Say on. [[H1696]]

### 13
And the woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] then hast thou thought [[H2803]] such [[H2063]] a thing against [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of God? [[H430]] for the king [[H4428]] doth speak [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] as one which is faulty, [[H818]] in that the king [[H4428]] doth not [[H1115]] fetch home again [[H7725]] his banished. [[H5080]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] we must needs [[H4191]] die, [[H4191]] and as water [[H4325]] spilt [[H5064]] on the ground, [[H776]] which [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be gathered up again; [[H622]] neither [[H3808]] doth God [[H430]] respect [[H5375]] person: [[H5315]] yet doth he devise [[H2803]] means, [[H4284]] that his banished [[H5080]] be not expelled [[H5080]] from [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 15
Now [[H6258]] therefore that [[H834]] I am come [[H935]] to speak [[H1696]]  of [[H853]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] because [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] have made me afraid: [[H3372]] and thy handmaid [[H8198]] said, [[H559]] I will now [[H4994]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the king; [[H4428]] it may be [[H194]] that the king [[H4428]] will perform [[H6213]] the request [[H1697]] of his handmaid. [[H519]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] will hear, [[H8085]] to deliver [[H5337]] his handmaid [[H519]] out of the hand [[H3709]] of the man [[H376]] destroy [[H8045]] me and my son [[H1121]] together [[H3162]] out of the inheritance [[H5159]] of God. [[H430]]

### 17
Then thine handmaid [[H8198]] said, [[H559]] The word [[H1697]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] shall now [[H4994]] be [[H1961]] comfortable: [[H4496]] for [[H3588]] as an angel [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] so [[H3651]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] to discern [[H8085]] good [[H2896]] and bad: [[H7451]] therefore the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 18
Then the king [[H4428]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the woman, [[H802]] Hide [[H3582]] not [[H408]] from [[H4480]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] shall ask [[H7592]] thee. And the woman [[H802]] said, [[H559]] Let my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] now [[H4994]] speak. [[H1696]]

### 19
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] the hand [[H3027]] of Joab [[H3097]] with [[H854]] thee in all [[H3605]] this? [[H2063]] And the woman [[H802]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] none can [[H786]] turn [[H518]] to the right hand [[H3231]] or to the left [[H8041]] from ought [[H3605]] that [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] hath spoken: [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] thy servant [[H5650]] Joab, [[H3097]] he [[H1931]] bade [[H6680]] me, and he [[H1931]] put [[H7760]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of thine handmaid: [[H8198]]

### 20
To [[H5668]] fetch about [[H5437]] this form [[H6440]] of speech [[H1697]] hath thy servant [[H5650]] Joab [[H3097]] done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing: [[H1697]] and my lord [[H113]] wise, [[H2450]] according to the wisdom [[H2451]] of an angel [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] to know [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 21
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I have done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing: [[H1697]] go [[H1980]] therefore, bring [[H7725]] the young man [[H5288]] Absalom [[H53]] again. [[H53]]

### 22
And Joab [[H3097]] fell [[H5307]] to the ground [[H776]] on [[H413]] his face, [[H6440]] and bowed himself, [[H7812]] and thanked [[H1288]] the king: [[H4428]] and Joab [[H3097]] said, [[H559]] To day [[H3117]] thy servant [[H5650]] knoweth [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] my lord, [[H113]] O king, [[H4428]] in that [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] hath fulfilled [[H6213]] the request [[H1697]] of his servant. [[H5650]]

### 23
So Joab [[H3097]] arose [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Geshur, [[H1650]] and brought [[H935]] Absalom [[H53]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 24
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Let him turn [[H5437]] to [[H413]] his own house, [[H1004]] and let him not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face. [[H6440]] So Absalom [[H53]] returned [[H5437]] to [[H413]] his own house, [[H1004]] and saw [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] the king's [[H4428]] face. [[H6440]]

### 25
But in all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] there was [[H1961]] none [[H376]] to be so much [[H3966]] praised [[H1984]] as Absalom [[H53]] for his beauty: [[H3303]] from the sole [[H3709]] of his foot [[H7272]] even to [[H5704]] the crown of his head [[H6936]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] blemish [[H3971]] in him. [[H3971]]

### 26
And when he polled [[H1548]] his head, [[H7218]] (for it was [[H1961]] at every year's [[H3117]] end [[H7093]] that [[H834]] he polled [[H1548]] because [[H3588]] was heavy [[H3513]] on [[H5921]] him, therefore he polled [[H1548]] it:) he weighed [[H8254]] the hair [[H8181]] of his head [[H7218]] at two hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] after the king's [[H4428]] weight. [[H68]]

### 27
And unto Absalom [[H53]] there were born [[H3205]] three [[H7969]] sons, [[H1121]] and one [[H259]] daughter, [[H1323]] whose name [[H8034]] Tamar: [[H8559]] she [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] a woman [[H802]] of a fair [[H3303]] countenance. [[H4758]]

### 28
So Absalom [[H53]] dwelt [[H3427]] two full [[H3117]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and saw [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] the king's [[H4428]] face. [[H6440]]

### 29
Therefore Absalom [[H53]] sent [[H7971]] for [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] to have sent [[H7971]] him to [[H413]] the king; [[H4428]] but he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] him: and when he sent again [[H7971]] the second time, [[H8145]] he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] come. [[H935]]

### 30
Therefore he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] See, [[H7200]] Joab's [[H3097]] field [[H2513]] is near [[H413]] mine, [[H3027]] and he hath barley [[H8184]] there; [[H8033]] go [[H1980]] and set [[H3341]] it on fire. [[H784]] And Absalom's [[H53]] servants [[H5650]] set [[H3341]] the field [[H2513]] on fire. [[H784]]

### 31
Then Joab [[H3097]] arose, [[H6965]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Absalom [[H53]] unto house, [[H1004]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Wherefore [[H4100]] have thy servants [[H5650]] set [[H3341]] my field [[H2513]] on fire? [[H784]]

### 32
And Absalom [[H53]] answered [[H559]] Joab, [[H3097]] Behold, [[H2009]] I sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] thee, saying, [[H559]] Come [[H935]] hither, [[H2008]] that I may send [[H7971]] thee to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] to say, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] am I [[H589]] come [[H935]] from Geshur? [[H1650]] good [[H2896]] for me there [[H8033]] still: [[H5750]] now [[H6258]] therefore let me see [[H7200]] the king's [[H4428]] face; [[H6440]] and if [[H518]] there be [[H3426]] iniquity [[H5771]] in me, let him kill [[H4191]] me. [[H4191]]

### 33
So Joab [[H3097]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and told [[H5046]] him: and when he had called [[H7121]] for [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] and bowed [[H7812]] himself on [[H5921]] his face [[H639]] to the ground [[H776]] before [[H6440]] the king: [[H4428]] and the king [[H4428]] kissed [[H5401]] Absalom. [[H53]]
