### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] sat [[H3427]] in his house, [[H1004]] and the Lord [[H3068]] had given him rest [[H5117]] round about [[H5439]] from all [[H3605]] his enemies; [[H341]]

### 2
That the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] See [[H7200]] now, [[H4994]] I [[H595]] dwell [[H3427]] in an house [[H1004]] of cedar, [[H730]] but the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] dwelleth [[H3427]] within [[H8432]] curtains. [[H3407]]

### 3
And Nathan [[H5416]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Go, [[H1980]] do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in thine heart; [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 4
And it came to pass [[H1961]] that [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] that the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Nathan, [[H5416]] saying, [[H559]]

### 5
Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] my servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Shalt thou [[H859]] build [[H1129]] me an house [[H1004]] for me to dwell in? [[H3427]]

### 6
Whereas [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] dwelt [[H3427]] in house [[H1004]] since the time [[H3117]] that I brought up [[H5927]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] even to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] but have [[H1961]] walked [[H1980]] in a tent [[H168]] and in a tabernacle. [[H4908]]

### 7
In all [[H3605]] wherein [[H834]] I have walked [[H1980]] with all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] spake [[H1696]] I a word [[H1697]] with [[H854]] any [[H259]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] to feed [[H7462]] my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] build [[H1129]] ye not [[H3808]] me an house [[H1004]] of cedar? [[H730]]

### 8
Now [[H6258]] therefore [[H3541]] so shalt thou say [[H559]] unto my servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] I [[H589]] took [[H3947]] thee from [[H4480]] the sheepcote, [[H5116]] from following [[H310]] the sheep, [[H6629]] to be [[H1961]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] my people, [[H5971]] over [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]]

### 9
And I was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee whithersoever [[H3605]] thou wentest, [[H1980]] and have cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] thine enemies [[H341]] out of thy sight, [[H6440]] and have made [[H6213]] thee a great [[H1419]] name, [[H8034]] like unto the name [[H8034]] of the great [[H1419]] that [[H834]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
Moreover I will appoint [[H7760]] a place [[H4725]] for my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and will plant [[H5193]] them, that they may dwell [[H7931]] in a place [[H8478]] of their own, and move [[H7264]] no [[H3808]] more; [[H5750]] neither [[H3808]] shall the children [[H1121]] of wickedness [[H5766]] afflict [[H6031]] them any more, [[H3254]] as [[H834]] beforetime, [[H7223]]

### 11
And as since [[H4480]] the time [[H3117]] that [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] judges [[H8199]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and have caused thee to rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] thine enemies. [[H341]] Also the Lord [[H3068]] telleth [[H5046]] thee that [[H3588]] he will make [[H6213]] thee an house. [[H1004]]

### 12
And when [[H3588]] thy days [[H3117]] be fulfilled, [[H4390]] and thou shalt sleep [[H7901]] with [[H854]] thy fathers, [[H1]] I will set up [[H6965]] thy seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] thee, which [[H834]] shall proceed [[H3318]] out of thy bowels, [[H4578]] and I will establish [[H3559]] his kingdom. [[H4467]]

### 13
He [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for my name, [[H8034]] and I will stablish [[H3559]] the throne [[H3678]] of his kingdom [[H4467]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 14
I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] his father, [[H1]] and he [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] my son. [[H1121]] If [[H834]] he commit iniquity, [[H5753]] I will chasten [[H3198]] him with the rod [[H7626]] of men, [[H376]] and with the stripes [[H5061]] of the children [[H1121]] of men: [[H120]]

### 15
But my mercy [[H2617]] shall not [[H3808]] depart away [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] him, as [[H834]] I took [[H5493]] from [[H5973]] Saul, [[H7586]] whom [[H834]] I put away [[H5493]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 16
And thine house [[H1004]] and thy kingdom [[H4467]] shall be established [[H539]] for [[H5704]] ever [[H5769]] before [[H6440]] thee: thy throne [[H3678]] shall be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 17
According to all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] and according to all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] vision, [[H2384]] so [[H3651]] did Nathan [[H5416]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] David. [[H1732]]

### 18
Then went [[H935]] king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] in, and sat [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] I, [[H595]] O Lord [[H136]] God? [[H3069]] and what [[H4310]] my house, [[H1004]] that [[H3588]] thou hast brought [[H935]] me hitherto? [[H1988]]

### 19
And this [[H2063]] was yet [[H5750]] a small thing [[H6994]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] O Lord [[H136]] God; [[H3068]] but thou hast spoken [[H1696]] also [[H1571]] of [[H413]] thy servant's [[H5650]] house [[H1004]] for a great while to come. [[H7350]] And this [[H2063]] the manner [[H8452]] of man, [[H120]] O Lord [[H136]] God? [[H3068]]

### 20
And what [[H4100]] can David [[H1732]] say [[H1696]] more [[H3254]] unto [[H413]] thee? for thou, [[H859]] Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] knowest [[H3045]] thy servant. [[H5650]]

### 21
For thy word's [[H1697]] sake, [[H5668]] and according to thine own heart, [[H3820]] hast thou done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2063]] great things, [[H1420]]  to make [[H853]] thy servant [[H5650]] know [[H3045]]

### 22
Wherefore [[H5921]] thou art great, [[H1431]] O Lord [[H430]] God: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] none [[H369]] like thee, [[H3644]] neither [[H369]] God [[H430]] beside [[H2108]] thee, according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] we have heard [[H8085]] with our ears. [[H241]]

### 23
And what [[H4310]] one [[H259]] nation [[H1471]] in the earth [[H776]] like thy people, [[H5971]] like Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] God [[H430]] went [[H1980]] to redeem [[H6299]] for a people [[H5971]] to himself, and to make [[H7760]] him a name, [[H8034]] and to do [[H6213]] for you great things [[H1420]] and terrible, [[H3372]] for thy land, [[H776]] before [[H6440]] thy people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] thou redeemedst [[H6299]] to thee from Egypt, [[H4714]] the nations [[H1471]] and their gods? [[H430]]

### 24
For thou hast confirmed [[H3559]]  to thyself [[H853]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] a people [[H5971]] unto thee for [[H5704]] ever: [[H5769]] and thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H3068]] art become [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]]

### 25
And now, [[H6258]] O Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] thy servant, [[H5650]] and concerning [[H5921]] his house, [[H1004]] establish [[H6965]] for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] and do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] thou hast said. [[H1696]]

### 26
And let thy name [[H8034]] be magnified [[H1431]] for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] over [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] and let the house [[H1004]] of thy servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] O Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] hast revealed [[H1540]] to thy servant, [[H5650]] saying, [[H559]] I will build [[H1129]] thee an house: [[H1004]] therefore [[H5921]] hath thy servant [[H5650]] found [[H4672]]  in [[H853]] his heart [[H3820]] to pray [[H6419]] this [[H2063]] prayer [[H8605]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 28
And now, [[H6258]] O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] thou [[H859]] that [[H1931]] God, [[H430]] and thy words [[H1697]] be [[H1961]] true, [[H571]] and thou hast promised [[H1696]] this [[H2063]] goodness [[H2896]] unto [[H413]] thy servant: [[H5650]]

### 29
Therefore now [[H6258]] let it please [[H2974]] thee to bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] that it may continue [[H1961]] for ever [[H5769]] before [[H6440]] thee: for [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] hast spoken [[H1696]] and with thy blessing [[H1293]] let the house [[H1004]] of thy servant [[H5650]] be blessed [[H1288]] for ever.
