### 1
And David [[H1732]] numbered [[H6485]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, and set [[H7760]] captains [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and captains [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] over [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] sent forth [[H7971]] a third part [[H7992]]  of [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] under the hand [[H3027]] of Joab, [[H3097]] and a third part [[H7992]] under the hand [[H3027]] of Abishai [[H52]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] Joab's [[H3097]] brother, [[H251]] and a third part [[H7992]] under the hand [[H3027]] of Ittai [[H863]] the Gittite. [[H1663]] And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] I will surely [[H3318]] go forth [[H3318]] with [[H5973]] you myself [[H589]] also. [[H1571]]

### 3
But the people [[H5971]] answered, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] go forth: [[H3318]] for [[H3588]] if [[H518]] we flee [[H5127]] away, [[H5127]] they will not [[H3808]] care [[H7760]] for [[H413]] us; neither [[H3808]] if [[H518]] half [[H2677]] of us die, [[H4191]] will they care [[H7760]] for [[H413]] us: but [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] worth [[H3644]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] of us: therefore now [[H6258]] better [[H2896]] that [[H3588]] thou succour [[H5826]] us out of the city. [[H5892]]

### 4
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, What [[H834]] seemeth [[H5869]] you best [[H3190]] I will do. [[H6213]] And the king [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] side, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] came out [[H3318]] by hundreds [[H3967]] and by thousands. [[H505]]

### 5
And the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Joab [[H3097]] and Abishai [[H52]] and Ittai, [[H863]] saying, [[H559]] gently [[H328]] for my sake with the young man, [[H5288]] with Absalom. [[H53]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] when the king [[H4428]]  gave [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the captains [[H8269]] charge [[H6680]] concerning [[H1697]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 6
So the people [[H5971]] went out [[H3318]] into the field [[H7704]] against [[H7125]] Israel: [[H3478]] and the battle [[H4421]] was [[H1961]] in the wood [[H3293]] of Ephraim; [[H669]]

### 7
Where [[H8033]] the people [[H5971]] of Israel [[H3478]] were slain [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] the servants [[H5650]] of David, [[H1732]] and there was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] a great [[H1419]] slaughter [[H4046]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] of twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]]

### 8
For the battle [[H4421]] was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] scattered [[H6327]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] the country: [[H776]] and the wood [[H3293]] devoured [[H398]] more [[H7235]] people [[H5971]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] than the sword [[H2719]] devoured. [[H398]]

### 9
And Absalom [[H53]] met [[H7122]] the servants [[H6440]] of David. [[H1732]] And Absalom [[H53]] rode [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] a mule, [[H6505]] and the mule [[H6505]] went [[H935]] under [[H8478]] the thick boughs [[H7730]] of a great [[H1419]] oak, [[H424]] and his head [[H7218]] caught hold [[H2388]] of the oak, [[H424]] and he was taken up [[H5414]] between [[H996]] the heaven [[H8064]] and the earth; [[H776]] and the mule [[H6505]] that [[H834]] under [[H8478]] him went away. [[H5674]]

### 10
And a certain [[H259]] man [[H376]] saw [[H7200]] and told [[H5046]] Joab, [[H3097]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I saw [[H7200]] Absalom [[H53]] hanged [[H8518]] in an oak. [[H424]]

### 11
And Joab [[H3097]] said [[H559]] unto the man [[H376]] that told [[H5046]] him, And, behold, [[H2009]] thou sawest [[H7200]] and why [[H4069]] didst thou not [[H3808]] smite [[H5221]] him there [[H8033]] to the ground? [[H776]] and I would have given [[H5414]] thee ten [[H6235]] of silver, [[H3701]] and a [[H259]] girdle. [[H2290]]

### 12
And the man [[H376]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] Though [[H3863]] I [[H595]] should receive [[H8254]] a thousand [[H505]] of silver [[H3701]] in [[H5921]] mine hand, [[H3709]] would I not [[H3808]] put forth [[H7971]] mine hand [[H3027]] against [[H413]] the king's [[H4428]] son: [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] in our hearing [[H241]] the king [[H4428]] charged [[H6680]] thee and Abishai [[H52]] and Ittai, [[H863]] saying, [[H559]] Beware [[H8104]] that none the young man [[H5288]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 13
Otherwise [[H176]] I should have wrought [[H6213]] falsehood [[H8267]] against mine own life: [[H5315]] for there is no matter [[H1697]] hid [[H3582]] from [[H4480]] the king, [[H4428]] and thou thyself [[H859]] wouldest have set thyself [[H3320]] against [[H5048]]

### 14
Then said [[H559]] Joab, [[H3097]] I may not [[H3808]] tarry [[H3176]] thus [[H3651]] with thee. [[H6440]] And he took [[H3947]] three [[H7969]] darts [[H7626]] in his hand, [[H3709]] and thrust [[H8628]] them through the heart [[H3820]] of Absalom, [[H53]] while [[H5750]] he yet alive [[H2416]] in the midst [[H3820]] of the oak. [[H424]]

### 15
And ten [[H6235]] young men [[H5288]] that bare [[H5375]] Joab's [[H3097]] armour [[H3627]] compassed about [[H5437]] and smote [[H5221]] Absalom, [[H53]] and slew [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 16
And Joab [[H3097]] blew [[H8628]] the trumpet, [[H7782]] and the people [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] from pursuing [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] Joab [[H3097]] held back [[H2820]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 17
And they took [[H3947]] Absalom, [[H53]] and cast [[H7993]] him into [[H413]] a great [[H1419]] pit [[H6354]] in the wood, [[H3293]] and laid [[H5324]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] heap [[H1530]] of stones [[H68]] upon [[H5921]] him: and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] fled [[H5127]] every one [[H376]] to his tent. [[H168]]

### 18
Now Absalom [[H53]] in his lifetime [[H2416]] had taken [[H3947]] and reared up [[H5324]]  for himself [[H853]] a pillar, [[H4678]] which [[H834]] in the king's [[H4428]] dale: [[H6010]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] I have no [[H369]] son [[H1121]] to [[H5668]] keep my name [[H8034]] in remembrance: [[H2142]] and he called [[H7121]] the pillar [[H4678]] after [[H5921]] his own name: [[H8034]] and it is called [[H7121]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] Absalom's [[H53]] place. [[H3027]]

### 19
Then said [[H559]] Ahimaaz [[H290]] the son [[H1121]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] Let me now [[H4994]] run, [[H7323]] and bear [[H1319]] the king [[H4428]] tidings, how that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath avenged [[H8199]] him of his enemies. [[H3027]]

### 20
And Joab [[H3097]] said [[H559]] unto him, Thou [[H376]] shalt not [[H3808]] bear tidings [[H1309]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] but thou shalt bear tidings [[H1319]] another [[H312]] day: [[H3117]] but this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] thou shalt bear no tidings, [[H1319]] because [[H3588]] the king's [[H4428]] son [[H1121]] is dead. [[H4191]]

### 21
Then said [[H559]] Joab [[H3097]] to Cushi, [[H3569]] Go [[H1980]] tell [[H5046]] the king [[H4428]] what [[H834]] thou hast seen. [[H7200]] And Cushi [[H3569]] bowed himself [[H7812]] unto Joab, [[H3097]] and ran. [[H7323]]

### 22
Then said [[H559]] Ahimaaz [[H290]] the son [[H1121]] of Zadok [[H6659]] yet [[H5750]] again [[H3254]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] But howsoever, [[H4100]] let me, I [[H589]] pray [[H4994]] thee, also [[H1571]] run [[H7323]] after [[H310]] Cushi. [[H3569]] And Joab [[H3097]] said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] wilt thou [[H859]] run, [[H7323]] my son, [[H1121]] seeing that thou hast no [[H369]] tidings [[H1309]] ready? [[H4672]]

### 23
But howsoever, [[H1961]] let me run. [[H7323]] And he said [[H559]] unto him, Run. [[H7323]] Then Ahimaaz [[H290]] ran [[H7323]] by the way [[H1870]] of the plain, [[H3603]] and overran [[H5674]] Cushi. [[H3569]]

### 24
And David [[H1732]] sat [[H3427]] between [[H996]] the two [[H8147]] gates: [[H8179]] and the watchman [[H6822]] went up [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the roof [[H1406]] over the gate [[H8179]] unto [[H413]] the wall, [[H2346]] and lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and looked, [[H7200]] and behold [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] running [[H7323]] alone. [[H905]]

### 25
And the watchman [[H6822]] cried, [[H7121]] and told [[H5046]] the king. [[H4428]] And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] he alone, [[H905]] tidings [[H1309]] in his mouth. [[H6310]] And he came [[H1980]] apace, [[H1980]] and drew near. [[H7131]]

### 26
And the watchman [[H6822]] saw [[H7200]] another [[H312]] man [[H376]] running: [[H7323]] and the watchman [[H6822]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the porter, [[H7778]] and said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] man [[H376]] running [[H7323]] alone. [[H905]] And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] He [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] bringeth tidings. [[H1319]]

### 27
And the watchman [[H6822]] said, [[H559]] Me [[H589]] thinketh [[H7200]] the running [[H4794]] of the foremost [[H7223]] is like the running [[H4794]] of Ahimaaz [[H290]] the son [[H1121]] of Zadok. [[H6659]] And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] He [[H2088]] a good [[H2896]] man, [[H376]] and cometh [[H935]] with good [[H2896]] tidings. [[H1309]]

### 28
And Ahimaaz [[H290]] called, [[H7121]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] All is well. [[H7965]] And he fell down [[H7812]] to the earth [[H776]] upon his face [[H639]] before the king, [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] hath delivered up [[H5462]] the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] lifted up [[H5375]] their hand [[H3027]] against my lord [[H113]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 29
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] the young man [[H5288]] Absalom [[H53]] safe? [[H7965]] Is [[H5288]] And Ahimaaz [[H290]] answered, [[H559]] When Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] the king's [[H4428]] servant, [[H5650]] and thy servant, [[H5650]] I saw [[H7200]] a great [[H1419]] tumult, [[H1995]] but I knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] what [[H4100]]

### 30
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] Turn aside, [[H5437]] stand [[H3320]] here. [[H3541]] And he turned aside, [[H5437]] and stood still. [[H5975]]

### 31
And, behold, [[H2009]] Cushi [[H3569]] came; [[H935]] and Cushi [[H3569]] said, [[H559]] Tidings, [[H1319]] my lord [[H113]] the king: [[H4428]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath avenged [[H8199]] thee this day [[H3117]] of all [[H3605]] them [[H3027]] that rose up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 32
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Cushi, [[H3569]] the young man [[H5288]] Absalom [[H53]] safe? [[H7965]] And Cushi [[H3569]] answered, [[H559]] The enemies [[H341]] of my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] rise [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] thee to do hurt, [[H7451]] be [[H1961]] as young man [[H5288]]

### 33
And the king [[H4428]] was much moved, [[H7264]] and went up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] the chamber [[H5944]] over the gate, [[H8179]] and wept: [[H1058]] and as he went, [[H1980]] thus [[H3541]] he said, [[H559]] O my son [[H1121]] Absalom, [[H53]] my son, [[H1121]] my son [[H1121]] Absalom! [[H53]] would God [[H4310]] I [[H589]] had died [[H4191]] for [[H8478]] thee, [[H5414]] O Absalom, [[H53]] my son, [[H1121]] my son! [[H1121]]
