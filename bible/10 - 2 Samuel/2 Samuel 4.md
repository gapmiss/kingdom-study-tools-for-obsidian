### 2
And Saul's [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] had [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] captains [[H8269]] of bands: [[H1416]] the name [[H8034]] of the one [[H259]] Baanah, [[H1196]] and the name [[H8034]] of the other [[H8145]] Rechab, [[H7394]] the sons [[H1121]] of Rimmon [[H7417]] a Beerothite, [[H886]] of the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin: [[H1144]] (for [[H3588]] Beeroth [[H881]] also [[H1571]] was reckoned [[H2803]] to [[H5921]] Benjamin: [[H1144]]

### 3
And the Beerothites [[H886]] fled [[H1272]] to Gittaim, [[H1664]] and were [[H1961]] sojourners [[H1481]] there [[H8033]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day.) [[H3117]]

### 4
And Jonathan, [[H3083]] Saul's [[H7586]] son, [[H1121]] had a son [[H1121]] lame [[H5223]] of feet. [[H7272]] He was [[H1961]] five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when the tidings [[H8052]] came [[H935]] of Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] out of Jezreel, [[H3157]] and his nurse [[H539]] took him up, [[H5375]] and fled: [[H5127]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] as she made haste [[H2648]] to flee, [[H5127]] that he fell, [[H5307]] and became lame. [[H6452]] And his name [[H8034]] Mephibosheth. [[H4648]]

### 5
And the sons [[H1121]] of Rimmon [[H7417]] the Beerothite, [[H886]] Rechab [[H7394]] and Baanah, [[H1196]] went, [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] about the heat [[H2527]] of the day [[H3117]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Ish-bosheth, [[H378]] who [[H1931]] lay [[H7901]]  on [[H853]] a bed [[H4904]] at noon. [[H6672]]

### 6
And they came thither [[H935]] into [[H5704]] the midst [[H8432]] of the house, [[H1004]] they would have fetched [[H3947]] wheat; [[H2406]] and they smote [[H5221]] him under [[H413]] the fifth [[H2570]] and Rechab [[H7394]] and Baanah [[H1196]] his brother [[H251]] escaped. [[H4422]]

### 7
For when they came [[H935]] into the house, [[H1004]] he [[H1931]] lay [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] his bed [[H4296]] in his bedchamber, [[H2315]] and they smote [[H5221]] him, and slew [[H4191]] him, and beheaded [[H5493]] him, and took [[H3947]] his head, [[H7218]] and gat them away [[H1980]] through [[H1870]] the plain [[H6160]] all [[H3605]] night. [[H3915]]

### 8
And they brought [[H935]] the head [[H7218]] of Ish-bosheth [[H378]] unto [[H413]] David [[H1732]] to Hebron, [[H2275]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Behold [[H2009]] the head [[H7218]] of Ish-bosheth [[H378]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] thine enemy, [[H341]] which [[H834]] sought [[H1245]] thy life; [[H5315]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath [[H5414]] avenged [[H5360]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and of his seed. [[H2233]]

### 9
And David [[H1732]] answered [[H6030]] Rechab [[H7394]] and Baanah [[H1196]] his brother, [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of Rimmon [[H7417]] the Beerothite, [[H886]] and said [[H559]] unto them, the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] hath redeemed [[H6299]] my soul [[H5315]] out of all adversity, [[H6869]]

### 10
When [[H3588]] one told [[H5046]] me, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] Saul [[H7586]] is dead, [[H4191]] thinking [[H5869]] to have [[H1961]] brought good tidings, [[H1319]] I took hold [[H270]] of him, and slew [[H2026]] him in Ziklag, [[H6860]] who [[H834]] that I would have given [[H5414]] him a reward for his tidings: [[H1309]]

### 11
How much more, [[H637]] when [[H3588]] wicked [[H7563]] men [[H376]] have slain [[H2026]] a righteous [[H6662]] person [[H376]] in his own house [[H1004]] upon [[H5921]] his bed? [[H4904]] shall I not [[H3808]] therefore now [[H6258]] require [[H1245]] his blood [[H1818]] of your hand, [[H3027]] and take you away [[H1197]] from [[H4480]] the earth? [[H776]]

### 12
And David [[H1732]] commanded [[H6680]] his young men, [[H5288]] and they slew [[H2026]] them, and cut off [[H7112]] their hands [[H3027]] and their feet, [[H7272]] and hanged up [[H8518]] over [[H5921]] the pool [[H1295]] in Hebron. [[H2275]] But they took [[H3947]] the head [[H7218]] of Ish-bosheth, [[H378]] and buried [[H6912]] in the sepulchre [[H6913]] of Abner [[H74]] in Hebron. [[H2275]]
