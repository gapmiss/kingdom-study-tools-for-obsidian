### 1
And when David [[H1732]] was a little [[H4592]] past [[H5674]] the top [[H7218]] behold, [[H2009]] Ziba [[H6717]] the servant [[H5288]] of Mephibosheth [[H4648]] met [[H7125]] him, with a couple [[H6776]] of asses [[H2543]] saddled, [[H2280]] and upon [[H5921]] them two hundred [[H3967]] of bread, [[H3899]] and an hundred [[H3967]] bunches of raisins, [[H6778]] and an hundred [[H3967]] of summer fruits, [[H7019]] and a bottle [[H5035]] of wine. [[H3196]]

### 2
And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Ziba, [[H6717]] What [[H4100]] meanest thou by these? [[H428]] And Ziba [[H6717]] said, [[H559]] The asses [[H2543]] for the king's [[H4428]] household [[H1004]] to ride on; [[H7392]] and the bread [[H3899]] and summer fruit [[H7019]] for the young men [[H5288]] to eat; [[H398]] and the wine, [[H3196]] that such as be faint [[H3287]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] may drink. [[H8354]]

### 3
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] And where [[H346]] thy master's [[H113]] son? [[H1121]] And Ziba [[H6717]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Behold, [[H2009]] he abideth [[H3427]] at Jerusalem: [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] To day [[H3117]] shall the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] restore [[H7725]]  me [[H853]] the kingdom [[H4468]] of my father. [[H1]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] to Ziba, [[H6717]] Behold, [[H2009]] thine all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] unto Mephibosheth. [[H4648]] And Ziba [[H6717]] said, [[H559]] I humbly beseech [[H7812]] thee I may find [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] my lord, [[H113]] O king. [[H4428]]

### 5
And when king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Bahurim, [[H980]] behold, [[H2009]] thence [[H8033]] came out [[H3318]] a man [[H376]] of the family [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of Saul, [[H7586]] whose name [[H8034]] Shimei, [[H8096]] the son [[H1121]] of Gera: [[H1617]] he came forth, [[H3318]] and cursed [[H7043]] still as he came. [[H3318]]

### 6
And he cast [[H5619]] stones [[H68]]  at [[H853]] David, [[H1732]] and at all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] of king [[H4428]] David: [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] the mighty men [[H1368]] on his right hand [[H3225]] and on his left. [[H8040]]

### 7
And thus [[H3541]] said [[H559]] Shimei [[H8096]] when he cursed, [[H7043]] Come out, [[H3318]] come out, [[H3318]] thou bloody [[H1818]] man, [[H376]] and thou man [[H376]] of Belial: [[H1100]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] hath returned [[H7725]] upon [[H5921]] thee all [[H3605]] the blood [[H1818]] of the house [[H1004]] of Saul, [[H7586]] in whose [[H834]] stead [[H8478]] thou hast reigned; [[H4427]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] the kingdom [[H4410]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Absalom [[H53]] thy son: [[H1121]] and, behold, [[H2005]] thou in thy mischief, [[H7451]] because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a bloody [[H1818]] man. [[H376]]

### 9
Then said [[H559]] Abishai [[H52]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] Why [[H4100]] should this [[H2088]] dead [[H4191]] dog [[H3611]] curse [[H7043]] my lord [[H113]] the king? [[H4428]] let me go over, [[H5674]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and take off [[H5493]] his head. [[H7218]]

### 10
And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] have I to do with you, ye sons [[H1121]] of Zeruiah? [[H6870]] so [[H3588]] let him curse, [[H7043]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H559]] unto him, Curse [[H7043]] David. [[H1732]] Who [[H4310]] shall then say, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4069]] hast thou done so? [[H6213]]

### 11
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abishai, [[H52]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5650]] Behold, [[H2009]] my son, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] came forth [[H3318]] of my bowels, [[H4578]] seeketh [[H1245]] my life: [[H5315]] how much more [[H637]] now [[H6258]] Benjamite [[H1145]] let him alone, [[H3240]] and let him curse; [[H7043]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath bidden [[H559]] him. [[H559]]

### 12
It may be [[H194]] that the Lord [[H3068]] will look [[H7200]] on mine affliction, [[H6040]] and that the Lord [[H3068]] will requite [[H7725]] me good [[H2896]] for [[H8478]] his cursing [[H7045]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 13
And as David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] by the way, [[H1870]] Shimei [[H8096]] went along [[H1980]] on the hill's [[H2022]] side [[H6763]] over against [[H5980]] him, and cursed [[H7043]] as he went, [[H1980]] and threw [[H5619]] stones [[H68]] at [[H5980]] him, and cast [[H6080]] dust. [[H6083]]

### 14
And the king, [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, came [[H935]] weary, [[H5889]] and refreshed themselves [[H5314]] there. [[H8033]]

### 15
And Absalom, [[H53]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and Ahithophel [[H302]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 16
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Hushai [[H2365]] the Archite, [[H757]] David's [[H1732]] friend, [[H7463]] was come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] that Hushai [[H2365]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] God save [[H2421]] the king, [[H4428]] God save [[H2421]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 17
And Absalom [[H53]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hushai, [[H2365]] this [[H2088]] thy kindness [[H2617]] to thy friend? [[H7453]] why [[H4100]] wentest [[H1980]] thou not [[H3808]] with [[H854]] thy friend? [[H7453]]

### 18
And Hushai [[H2365]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] whom [[H834]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] choose, [[H977]] his will I be, [[H1961]] and with [[H854]] him will I abide. [[H3427]]

### 19
And again, [[H8145]] whom [[H4310]] should I [[H589]] serve? [[H5647]] not [[H3808]] in the presence [[H6440]] of his son? [[H1121]] as [[H834]] I have served [[H5647]] in thy father's [[H1]] presence, [[H6440]] so [[H3651]] will I be [[H1961]] in thy presence. [[H6440]]

### 20
Then said [[H559]] Absalom [[H53]] to [[H413]] Ahithophel, [[H302]] Give [[H3051]] counsel [[H6098]] among you what [[H4100]] we shall do. [[H6213]]

### 21
And Ahithophel [[H302]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] Go in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thy father's [[H1]] concubines, [[H6370]] which [[H834]] he hath left [[H3240]] to keep [[H8104]] the house; [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] shall hear [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] thou art abhorred [[H887]] of [[H854]] thy father: [[H1]] then shall the hands [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] thee be strong. [[H2388]]

### 22
So they spread [[H5186]] Absalom [[H53]] a tent [[H168]] upon [[H5921]] the top [[H1406]] of the house; and Absalom [[H53]] went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] his father's [[H1]] concubines [[H6370]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 23
And the counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel, [[H302]] which [[H834]] he counselled [[H3289]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] as [[H834]] if a man had inquired [[H7592]] at the oracle [[H1697]] of God: [[H430]] so [[H3651]] all [[H3605]] the counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel [[H302]] both [[H1571]] with David [[H1732]] and [[H1571]] with Absalom.
