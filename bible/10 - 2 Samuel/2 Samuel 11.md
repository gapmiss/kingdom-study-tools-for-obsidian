### 1
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] after the year [[H8141]] was expired, [[H8666]] at the time [[H6256]] when kings [[H4428]] go forth [[H3318]] that David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] Joab, [[H3097]] and his servants [[H5650]] with [[H5973]] him, and all [[H3605]] Israel; [[H3478]] and they destroyed [[H7843]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and besieged [[H6696]] Rabbah. [[H7237]] But David [[H1732]] tarried still [[H3427]] at Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 2
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in an eveningtide, [[H6153]] that David [[H1732]] arose [[H6965]] from off [[H5921]] his bed, [[H4904]] and walked [[H1980]] upon [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] of the king's [[H4428]] house: [[H1004]] and from [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] he saw [[H7200]] a woman [[H802]] washing [[H7364]] herself; and the woman [[H802]] very [[H3966]] beautiful [[H2896]] to look upon. [[H4758]]

### 3
David [[H1732]] And sent [[H7971]] and inquired [[H1875]] after the woman. [[H802]] And said, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] this [[H2063]] Bath-sheba, [[H1339]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Eliam, [[H463]] the wife [[H802]] of Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite? [[H2850]]

### 4
And David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers, [[H4397]] and took [[H3947]] her; and she came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] him, and he lay [[H7901]] with her; [[H5973]] for she [[H1931]] was purified [[H6942]] from her uncleanness: [[H2932]] and she returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] her house. [[H1004]]

### 5
And the woman [[H802]] conceived, [[H2029]] and sent [[H7971]] and told [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] and said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] with child. [[H2030]]

### 6
And David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] Send [[H7971]]  me [[H853]] Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite. [[H2850]] And Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] Uriah [[H223]] to [[H413]] David. [[H1732]]

### 7
And when Uriah [[H223]] was come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] him, David [[H1732]] demanded [[H7592]] how Joab [[H3097]] did, [[H7965]] and how the people [[H5971]] did, [[H7965]] and how the war [[H4421]] prospered. [[H7965]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Uriah, [[H223]] Go down [[H3381]] to thy house, [[H1004]] and wash [[H7364]] thy feet. [[H7272]] And Uriah [[H223]] departed [[H3318]] out [[H3318]] of the king's [[H4428]] house, [[H1004]] and there followed [[H310]] him a mess [[H4864]] from the king. [[H4428]]

### 9
But Uriah [[H223]] slept [[H7901]] at the door [[H6607]] of the king's [[H4428]] house [[H1004]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] of his lord, [[H113]] and went [[H3381]] not [[H3808]] down to [[H413]] his house. [[H1004]]

### 10
And when they had told [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Uriah [[H223]] went not down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Uriah, [[H223]] Camest [[H935]] thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] from journey? [[H1870]] why [[H4069]] didst thou not [[H3808]] go down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] thine house? [[H1004]]

### 11
And Uriah [[H223]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] The ark, [[H727]] and Israel, [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] abide [[H3427]] in tents; [[H5521]] and my lord [[H113]] Joab, [[H3097]] and the servants [[H5650]] of my lord, [[H113]] are encamped [[H2583]] in [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] fields; [[H7704]] shall I [[H589]] then go [[H935]] into [[H413]] mine house, [[H1004]] to eat [[H398]] and to drink, [[H8354]] and to lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] my wife? [[H802]] thou livest, [[H2416]] and thy soul [[H5315]] liveth, [[H2416]] I will not do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 12
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Uriah, [[H223]] Tarry [[H3427]] here [[H2088]] to day [[H3117]] also, [[H1571]] and to morrow [[H4279]] I will let thee depart. [[H7971]] So Uriah [[H223]] abode [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and the morrow. [[H4283]]

### 13
And when David [[H1732]] had called [[H7121]] him, he did eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] before [[H6440]] him; and he made him drunk: [[H7937]] and at even [[H6153]] he went out [[H3318]] to lie [[H7901]] on his bed [[H4904]] with [[H5973]] the servants [[H5650]] of his lord, [[H113]] but went [[H3381]] not [[H3808]] down to [[H413]] his house. [[H1004]]

### 14
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the morning, [[H1242]] that David [[H1732]] wrote [[H3789]] a letter [[H5612]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] and sent [[H7971]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Uriah. [[H223]]

### 15
And he wrote [[H3789]] in the letter, [[H5612]] saying, [[H559]] Set [[H3051]]  ye [[H853]] Uriah [[H223]] in [[H413]] the forefront [[H6440]] of the hottest [[H2389]] battle, [[H4421]] and retire [[H7725]] ye from [[H310]] him, that he may be smitten, [[H5221]] and die. [[H4191]]

### 16
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when Joab [[H3097]] observed [[H8104]] the city, [[H5892]] that he assigned [[H5414]] Uriah [[H223]] unto [[H413]] a place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] valiant [[H2428]] men [[H376]]

### 17
And the men [[H582]] of the city [[H5892]] went out, [[H3318]] and fought [[H3898]] with [[H854]] Joab: [[H3097]] and there fell [[H5307]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] of the servants [[H5650]] of David; [[H1732]] and Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] died [[H4191]] also. [[H1571]]

### 18
Then Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] and told [[H5046]] David [[H1732]] all [[H3605]] the things [[H1697]] concerning the war; [[H4421]]

### 19
And charged [[H6680]] the messenger, [[H4397]] saying, [[H559]] When thou hast made an end [[H3615]] of telling [[H1696]] the matters [[H1697]] of the war [[H4421]] unto [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]]

### 20
And if [[H518]] so be [[H1961]] that the king's [[H4428]] wrath [[H2534]] arise, [[H5927]] and he say [[H559]] unto thee, Wherefore [[H4069]] approached ye so nigh [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] when ye did fight? [[H3898]] knew [[H3045]] ye not [[H3808]] that [[H834]] they would shoot [[H3384]] from [[H5921]] the wall? [[H2346]]

### 21
Who [[H4310]] smote [[H5221]] Abimelech [[H40]] the son [[H1121]] of Jerubbesheth? [[H3380]] did not [[H3808]] a woman [[H802]] cast [[H7993]] a piece [[H6400]] of a millstone [[H7393]] upon [[H5921]] him from [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] that he died [[H4191]] in Thebez? [[H8405]] why [[H4100]] went ye nigh [[H5066]] the wall? [[H2346]] then say [[H559]] thou, Thy servant [[H5650]] Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] is dead [[H4191]] also. [[H1571]]

### 22
So the messenger [[H4397]] went, [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] and shewed [[H5046]] David [[H1732]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Joab [[H3097]] had sent [[H7971]] him for. [[H7971]]

### 23
And the messenger [[H4397]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Surely [[H3588]] the men [[H376]] prevailed [[H1396]] against [[H5921]] us, and came out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] us into the field, [[H7704]] and we were [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] them even unto [[H5704]] the entering [[H6607]] of the gate. [[H8179]]

### 24
the shooters [[H3384]] And shot [[H3384]] from off [[H5921]] the wall [[H2346]] upon [[H413]] thy servants; [[H5650]] and of the king's [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] be dead, [[H4191]] and thy servant [[H5650]] Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] is dead [[H4191]] also. [[H1571]]

### 25
Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the messenger, [[H4397]] Thus [[H3541]] shalt thou say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] Let not [[H408]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] displease [[H3415]] thee, for [[H3588]] the sword [[H2719]] devoureth [[H398]] one [[H2088]] as well as another: [[H2090]] make thy battle [[H4421]] more strong [[H2388]] against [[H413]] the city, [[H5892]] and overthrow [[H2040]] it: and encourage [[H2388]] thou him. [[H2388]]

### 26
And when the wife [[H802]] of Uriah [[H223]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Uriah [[H223]] her husband [[H376]] was dead, [[H4191]] she mourned [[H5594]] for [[H5921]] her husband. [[H1167]]

### 27
And when the mourning [[H60]] was past, [[H5674]] David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] and fetched [[H622]] her to [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] and she became [[H1961]] his wife, [[H802]] and bare [[H3205]] him a son. [[H1121]] But the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had done [[H6213]] displeased [[H3415]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
