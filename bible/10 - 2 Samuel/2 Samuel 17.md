### 1
Moreover Ahithophel [[H302]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] Let me now [[H4994]] choose out [[H977]] twelve [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] men, [[H376]] and I will arise [[H6965]] and pursue [[H7291]] after [[H310]] David [[H1732]] this night: [[H3915]]

### 2
And I will come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] him while he [[H1931]] weary [[H3023]] and weak [[H7504]] handed, [[H3027]] and will make him afraid: [[H2729]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him shall flee; [[H5127]] and I will smite [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] only: [[H905]]

### 3
And I will bring back [[H7725]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] thee: the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] thou [[H859]] seekest [[H1245]] as if all [[H3605]] returned: [[H7725]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] shall be [[H1961]] in peace. [[H7965]]

### 4
And the saying [[H1697]] pleased [[H3474]] Absalom [[H53]] well, [[H5869]] and all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Then said [[H559]] Absalom, [[H53]] Call [[H7121]] now [[H4994]] Hushai [[H2365]] the Archite [[H757]] also, [[H1571]] and let us hear [[H8085]] likewise [[H1571]] what [[H4100]] he [[H1931]] saith. [[H6310]]

### 6
And when Hushai [[H2365]] was come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] Absalom [[H53]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, saying, [[H559]] Ahithophel [[H302]] hath spoken [[H1696]] after this [[H2088]] manner: [[H1697]] shall we do [[H6213]] his saying? [[H1697]] if [[H518]] not; [[H369]] speak [[H1696]] thou. [[H859]]

### 7
And Hushai [[H2365]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] The counsel [[H6098]] that [[H834]] Ahithophel [[H302]] hath given [[H3289]] not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] at this [[H2063]] time. [[H6471]]

### 8
For, said [[H559]] Hushai, [[H2365]] thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] thy father [[H1]] and his men, [[H376]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] mighty men, [[H1368]] and they [[H1992]] chafed [[H4751]] in their minds, [[H5315]] as a bear [[H1677]] robbed [[H7909]] of her whelps in the field: [[H7704]] and thy father [[H1]] a man [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] and will not [[H3808]] lodge [[H3885]] with [[H854]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 9
Behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] is hid [[H2244]] now [[H6258]] in some [[H259]] pit, [[H6354]] or [[H176]] in some [[H259]] place: [[H4725]] and it will come to pass, [[H1961]] when some of them be overthrown [[H5307]] at the first, [[H8462]] that whosoever [[H8085]] heareth [[H8085]] it will say, [[H559]] There is [[H1961]] a slaughter [[H4046]] among the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] follow [[H310]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 10
And he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] valiant, [[H1121]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3820]] as the heart [[H3820]] of a lion, [[H738]] shall utterly [[H4549]] melt: [[H4549]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] knoweth [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thy father [[H1]] a mighty man, [[H1368]] and which [[H834]] with [[H854]] him valiant [[H2428]] men. [[H1121]]

### 11
Therefore [[H3588]] I counsel [[H3289]] that all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] be generally [[H622]] gathered [[H622]] unto [[H5921]] thee, from Dan [[H1835]] even to [[H5704]] Beer-sheba, [[H884]] as the sand [[H2344]] that [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] for multitude; [[H7230]] and that thou go [[H1980]] to battle [[H7128]] in thine own person. [[H6440]]

### 12
So shall we come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] him in some [[H259]] place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he shall be found, [[H4672]] and we will light [[H5117]] upon [[H5921]] him as [[H834]] the dew [[H2919]] falleth [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] the ground: [[H127]] and of him and of all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him there shall not [[H3808]] be left [[H3498]] so much as [[H1571]] one. [[H259]]

### 13
Moreover, if [[H518]] he be gotten [[H622]] into [[H413]] a city, [[H5892]] then shall all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] bring [[H5375]] ropes [[H2256]] to [[H413]] that [[H1931]] city, [[H5892]] and we will draw [[H5498]] it into [[H5704]] the river, [[H5158]] until [[H5704]] there be not [[H3808]] one small [[H1571]] stone [[H6872]] found [[H4672]] there. [[H8033]]

### 14
And Absalom [[H53]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] The counsel [[H6098]] of Hushai [[H2365]] the Archite [[H757]] better [[H2896]] than the counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel. [[H302]] For the Lord [[H3068]] had appointed [[H6680]] to defeat [[H6565]] the good [[H2896]] counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel, [[H302]] to the intent [[H5668]] that the Lord [[H3068]] might bring [[H935]] evil [[H7451]] upon [[H413]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 15
Then said [[H559]] Hushai [[H2365]] unto [[H413]] Zadok [[H6659]] and to [[H413]] Abiathar [[H54]] the priests, [[H3548]] Thus [[H2063]] and thus [[H2063]] did Ahithophel [[H302]] counsel [[H3289]] Absalom [[H53]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and thus [[H2063]] and thus [[H2063]] have I [[H589]] counselled. [[H3289]]

### 16
Now [[H6258]] therefore send [[H7971]] quickly, [[H4120]] and tell [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Lodge [[H3885]] not [[H408]] this night [[H3915]] in the plains [[H6160]] of the wilderness, [[H4057]] but [[H1571]] speedily [[H5674]] pass over; [[H5674]] lest [[H6435]] the king [[H4428]] be swallowed up, [[H1104]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 17
Now Jonathan [[H3083]] and Ahimaaz [[H290]] stayed [[H5975]] by En-rogel; [[H5883]] for [[H3588]] they might [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] be seen [[H7200]] to come [[H935]] into the city: [[H5892]] and a wench [[H8198]] went [[H1980]] and told [[H5046]] them; and they [[H1992]] went [[H1980]] and told [[H5046]] king [[H4428]] David. [[H1732]]

### 18
Nevertheless a lad [[H5288]] saw [[H7200]] them, and told [[H5046]] Absalom: [[H53]] but they went [[H1980]] both [[H8147]] of them away quickly, [[H4120]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] a man's [[H376]] house [[H1004]] in Bahurim, [[H980]] which had a well [[H875]] in his court; [[H2691]] whither [[H8033]] they went down. [[H3381]]

### 19
And the woman [[H802]] took [[H3947]] and spread [[H6566]] a covering [[H4539]] over [[H5921]] the well's [[H875]] mouth, [[H6440]] and spread [[H7849]] ground corn [[H7383]] thereon; [[H5921]] and the thing [[H1697]] was not [[H3808]] known. [[H3045]]

### 20
And when Absalom's [[H53]] servants [[H5650]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] to the house, [[H1004]] they said, [[H559]] Where [[H346]] Ahimaaz [[H290]] and Jonathan? [[H3083]] And the woman [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto them, They be gone over [[H5674]] the brook [[H4323]] of water. [[H4325]] And when they had sought [[H1245]] and could not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] they returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 21
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] after [[H310]] they were departed, [[H1980]] that they came up [[H5927]] out of the well, [[H875]] and went [[H1980]] and told [[H5046]] king [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Arise, [[H6965]] and pass quickly [[H4120]] over [[H5674]] the water: [[H4325]] for [[H3588]] thus [[H3602]] hath Ahithophel [[H302]] counselled [[H3289]] against [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 22
Then David [[H1732]] arose, [[H6965]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, and they passed over [[H5674]] Jordan: [[H3383]] by [[H5704]] the morning [[H1242]] light [[H216]] there lacked [[H5737]] not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of them that [[H834]] was not [[H3808]] gone over [[H5674]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 23
And when Ahithophel [[H302]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his counsel [[H6098]] was not [[H3808]] followed, [[H6213]] he saddled [[H2280]] ass, [[H2543]] and arose, [[H6965]] and gat [[H3212]] him home to [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] to [[H413]] his city, [[H5892]]  and put [[H413]] his household [[H1004]] in order, [[H6680]] and hanged himself, [[H2614]] and died, [[H4191]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the sepulchre [[H6913]] of his father. [[H1]]

### 24
Then David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to Mahanaim. [[H4266]] And Absalom [[H53]] passed over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 25
And Absalom [[H53]] made [[H7760]] Amasa [[H6021]] captain [[H5921]] of the host [[H6635]] instead [[H8478]] of Joab: [[H3097]] which Amasa [[H6021]] a man's [[H376]] son, [[H1121]] whose name [[H8034]] Ithra [[H3501]] an Israelite, [[H3481]] that [[H834]] went in [[H935]] to [[H413]] Abigail [[H26]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Nahash, [[H5176]] sister [[H269]] to Zeruiah [[H6870]] Joab's [[H3097]] mother. [[H517]]

### 26
So Israel [[H3478]] and Absalom [[H53]] pitched [[H2583]] in the land [[H776]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 27
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when David [[H1732]] was come [[H935]] to Mahanaim, [[H4266]] that Shobi [[H7629]] the son [[H1121]] of Nahash [[H5176]] of Rabbah [[H7237]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and Machir [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Ammiel [[H5988]] of Lo-debar, [[H3810]] and Barzillai [[H1271]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] of Rogelim, [[H7274]]

### 28
Brought [[H5066]] beds, [[H4904]] and basons, [[H5592]] and earthen [[H3335]] vessels, [[H3627]] and wheat, [[H2406]] and barley, [[H8184]] and flour, [[H7058]] and parched [[H7039]] and beans, [[H6321]] and lentiles, [[H5742]] and parched [[H7039]]

### 29
And honey, [[H1706]] and butter, [[H2529]] and sheep, [[H6629]] and cheese [[H8194]] of kine, [[H1241]] for David, [[H1732]] and for the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, to eat: [[H398]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] The people [[H5971]] hungry, [[H7457]] and weary, [[H5889]] and thirsty, [[H6771]] in the wilderness.
