### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] Nathan [[H5416]] unto [[H413]] David. [[H1732]] And he came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] him, and said [[H559]] unto him, There were [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] men [[H582]] in one [[H259]] city; [[H5892]] the one [[H259]] rich, [[H6223]] and the other [[H259]] poor. [[H7326]]

### 2
The rich [[H6223]] had [[H1961]] exceeding [[H3966]] many [[H7235]] flocks [[H6629]] and herds: [[H1241]]

### 3
But the poor [[H7326]] had nothing, [[H369]] save [[H3588]] one [[H259]] little [[H6996]] ewe lamb, [[H3535]] which [[H834]] he had [[H1961]] bought [[H7069]] and nourished up: [[H2421]] and it grew up [[H1431]] together [[H3162]] with [[H5973]] him, and with [[H5973]] his children; [[H1121]] it did eat [[H398]] of his own meat, [[H6595]] and drank [[H8354]] of his own cup, [[H3563]] and lay [[H7901]] in his bosom, [[H2436]] and was unto him as a daughter. [[H1323]]

### 4
And there came [[H935]] a traveller [[H1982]] unto the rich [[H6223]] man, [[H376]] and he spared [[H2550]] to take [[H3947]] of his own flock [[H6629]] and of his own herd, [[H1241]] to dress [[H6213]] for the wayfaring man [[H732]] that was come [[H935]] unto him; but took [[H3947]] the poor [[H7326]] man's [[H376]] lamb, [[H3535]] and dressed [[H6213]] it for the man [[H376]] that was come [[H935]] to [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 5
And David's [[H1732]] anger [[H639]] was greatly [[H3966]] kindled [[H2734]] against the man; [[H376]] and he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Nathan, [[H5416]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] the man [[H376]] that hath done [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] shall surely [[H1121]] die: [[H4194]]

### 6
And he shall restore [[H7999]] the lamb [[H3535]] fourfold, [[H706]] because [[H6118]] he did [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] and because [[H834]] he had no [[H3808]] pity. [[H2550]]

### 7
And Nathan [[H5416]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Thou [[H859]] the man. [[H376]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I [[H595]] anointed [[H4886]] thee king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and I [[H595]] delivered [[H5337]] thee out of the hand [[H3027]] of Saul; [[H7586]]

### 8
And I gave [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] thy master's [[H113]] house, [[H1004]] and thy master's [[H113]] wives [[H802]] into thy bosom, [[H2436]] and gave [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and of Judah; [[H3063]] and if [[H518]] too little, [[H4592]] I would moreover have given [[H3254]] unto thee such [[H2007]] and such things. [[H2007]]

### 9
Wherefore [[H4069]] hast thou despised [[H959]] the commandment [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in his sight? [[H5869]] thou hast killed [[H5221]] Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and hast taken [[H3947]] his wife [[H802]] thy wife, [[H802]] and hast slain [[H2026]] him with the sword [[H2719]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 10
Now [[H6258]] therefore the sword [[H2719]] shall never [[H5704]] depart [[H5493]] from thine house; [[H1004]] because [[H6118]] thou hast despised [[H959]] me, and hast taken [[H3947]] the wife [[H802]] of Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] to be [[H1961]] thy wife. [[H802]]

### 11
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will raise up [[H6965]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] thee out of thine own house, [[H1004]] and I will take [[H3947]] thy wives [[H802]] before thine eyes, [[H5869]] and give [[H5414]] unto thy neighbour, [[H7453]] and he shall lie [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] thy wives [[H802]] in the sight [[H5869]] of this [[H2063]] sun. [[H8121]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] didst [[H6213]] secretly: [[H5643]] but I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and before [[H5048]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 13
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Nathan, [[H5416]] I have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord. [[H3068]] And Nathan [[H5416]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] The Lord [[H3068]] also [[H1571]] hath put away [[H5674]] thy sin; [[H2403]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 14
Howbeit, [[H657]] because [[H3588]] by this [[H2088]] deed [[H1697]] thou hast given great occasion [[H5006]] to the enemies [[H341]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to blaspheme, [[H5006]] the child [[H1121]] also [[H1571]] born [[H3209]] unto thee shall surely [[H4191]] die. [[H4191]]

### 15
And Nathan [[H5416]] departed [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] his house. [[H1004]] And the Lord [[H3068]] struck [[H5062]] the child [[H3206]] that [[H834]] Uriah's [[H223]] wife [[H802]] bare [[H3205]] unto David, [[H1732]] and it was very sick. [[H605]]

### 16
David [[H1732]] therefore besought [[H1245]] God [[H430]] for [[H1157]] the child; [[H5288]] and David [[H1732]] fasted, [[H6684]] and went in, [[H935]] and lay [[H7901]] all night [[H3885]] upon the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
And the elders [[H2205]] of his house [[H1004]] arose, [[H6965]] to [[H5921]] him, to raise him up [[H6965]] from [[H4480]] the earth: [[H776]] but he would [[H14]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] did he eat [[H1262]] bread [[H3899]] with [[H854]] them. [[H854]]

### 18
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] that the child [[H3206]] died. [[H4191]] And the servants [[H5650]] of David [[H1732]] feared [[H3372]] to tell [[H5046]] him that [[H3588]] the child [[H3206]] was dead: [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] while the child [[H3206]] was [[H1961]] yet alive, [[H2416]] we spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, and he would not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto our voice: [[H6963]] how [[H349]] will he then himself, [[H6213]] vex [[H7451]] if we tell [[H559]] him that the child [[H3206]] is dead? [[H4191]]

### 19
But when David [[H1732]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his servants [[H5650]] whispered, [[H3907]] David [[H1732]] perceived [[H995]] that [[H3588]] the child [[H3206]] was dead: [[H4191]] therefore David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] Is the child [[H3206]] dead? [[H4191]] And they said, [[H559]] He is dead. [[H4191]]

### 20
Then David [[H1732]] arose [[H6965]] from the earth, [[H776]] and washed, [[H7364]] and anointed [[H5480]] and changed [[H2498]] his apparel, [[H8071]] and came [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and worshipped: [[H7812]] then he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] his own house; [[H1004]] and when he required, [[H7592]] they set [[H7760]] bread [[H3899]] before him, and he did eat. [[H398]]

### 21
Then said [[H559]] his servants [[H5650]] unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] thing [[H1697]] this [[H2088]] that [[H834]] thou hast done? [[H6213]] thou didst fast [[H6684]] and weep [[H1058]] for the child, [[H3206]] alive; [[H2416]] but when [[H834]] the child [[H3206]] was dead, [[H4191]] thou didst rise [[H6965]] and eat [[H398]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 22
And he said, [[H559]] While the child [[H3206]] was yet [[H5750]] alive, [[H2416]] I fasted [[H6684]] and wept: [[H1058]] for [[H3588]] I said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] can tell [[H3045]] God [[H3068]] will be gracious [[H2603]] to me, that the child [[H3206]] may live? [[H2416]]

### 23
But now [[H6258]] he is dead, [[H4191]] wherefore [[H4100]] should I [[H589]] fast? [[H6684]] can [[H3201]] I bring him back again? [[H7725]] I [[H589]] shall go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] him, but he [[H1931]] shall not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 24
And David [[H1732]] comforted [[H5162]] Bath-sheba [[H1339]] his wife, [[H802]] and went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her, [[H413]] and lay [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] her: and she bare [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and he called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Solomon: [[H8010]] and the Lord [[H3068]] loved [[H157]] him. [[H157]]

### 25
And he sent [[H7971]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet; [[H5030]] and he called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Jedidiah, [[H3041]] because [[H5668]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 26
And Joab [[H3097]] fought [[H3898]] against Rabbah [[H7237]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and took [[H3920]] the royal [[H4410]] city. [[H5892]]

### 27
And Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and said, [[H559]] I have fought [[H3898]] against Rabbah, [[H7237]] and [[H1571]] have taken [[H3920]] the city [[H5892]] of waters. [[H4325]]

### 28
Now [[H6258]] therefore gather together, [[H622]] the rest [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] and encamp [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] the city, [[H5892]] and take [[H3920]] it: lest [[H6435]] I [[H589]] take [[H3920]] the city, [[H5892]] and it be called [[H7121]] after [[H5921]] my name. [[H8034]]

### 29
And David [[H1732]] gathered together, [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] and went [[H1980]] to Rabbah, [[H7237]] and fought [[H3898]] against it, and took [[H3920]] it. [[H3920]]

### 30
And he took [[H3947]] their king's [[H4428]] crown [[H5850]] from off [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] the weight [[H4948]] whereof a talent [[H3603]] of gold [[H2091]] with the precious [[H3368]] stones: [[H68]] and it was [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] David's [[H1732]] head. [[H7218]] And he brought forth [[H3318]] the spoil [[H7998]] of the city [[H5892]] in great [[H3966]] abundance. [[H7235]]

### 31
And he brought forth [[H3318]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] therein, and put [[H7760]] under saws, [[H4050]] and under harrows [[H2757]] of iron, [[H1270]] and under axes [[H4037]] of iron, [[H1270]] and made them pass through [[H5674]] the brickkiln: [[H4404]] and thus [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] he unto all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]] So David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] unto Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
