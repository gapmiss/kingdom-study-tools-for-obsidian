### 1
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fifth [[G3991]] angel [[G32]] sounded, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] a star [[G792]] fall [[G4098]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] to him [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] key [[G2807]] the [[G3588]] of [[G12]] bottomless [[G12]] pit. [[G5421]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] bottomless [[G12]] pit; [[G5421]] and [[G2532]] there arose [[G305]] a smoke [[G2586]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] pit, [[G5421]] as [[G5613]] the smoke [[G2586]] of a great [[G3173]] furnace; [[G2575]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] air [[G109]] were darkened [[G4654]] by reason of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] smoke [[G2586]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5421]] pit. [[G5421]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] there came [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] smoke [[G2586]] locusts [[G200]] upon [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] unto them [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] power, [[G1849]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] scorpions [[G4651]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] have [[G2192]] power. [[G1849]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] it was commanded [[G4483]] them [[G846]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] they should [[G91]] hurt [[G91]] the [[G3588]] grass [[G5528]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] neither [[G3761]] any [[G3956]] green thing, [[G5515]] neither [[G3761]] any [[G3956]] tree; [[G1186]] but [[G1487]] only [[G3441]] those [[G3748]] men [[G444]] which [[G3748]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] the of [[G3588]] seal [[G4973]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1909]] their [[G846]] foreheads. [[G3359]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] to them [[G846]] it was given [[G1325]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] they should [[G615]] kill [[G615]] them, [[G846]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] they should be tormented [[G928]] five [[G4002]] months: [[G3376]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] torment [[G929]] as [[G5613]] the torment [[G929]] of a scorpion, [[G4651]] when [[G3752]] he striketh [[G3817]] a man. [[G444]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] shall [[G2212]] men [[G444]] seek [[G2212]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2147]] find [[G2147]] it; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] shall desire [[G1937]] to die, [[G599]] and [[G2532]] death shall [[G2288]] flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] them. [[G846]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] shapes [[G3667]] the [[G3588]] of [[G200]] locusts [[G200]] like unto [[G3664]] horses [[G2462]] prepared [[G2090]] unto [[G1519]] battle; [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] heads [[G2776]] as it were [[G5613]] crowns [[G4735]] like [[G3664]] gold, [[G5557]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] faces [[G4383]] as [[G5613]] the faces [[G4383]] of men. [[G444]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] they had [[G2192]] hair [[G2359]] as [[G5613]] the hair [[G2359]] of women, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] teeth [[G3599]] were [[G2258]] as [[G5613]] of lions. [[G3023]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] they had [[G2192]] breastplates, [[G2382]] as it were [[G5613]] breastplates [[G2382]] of iron; [[G4603]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sound [[G5456]] of their [[G846]] wings [[G4420]] as [[G5613]] the sound [[G5456]] of chariots [[G716]] of many [[G4183]] horses [[G2462]] running [[G5143]] to [[G1519]] battle. [[G4171]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] they had [[G2192]] tails [[G3769]] like unto [[G3664]] scorpions, [[G4651]] and [[G2532]] there were [[G2258]] stings [[G2759]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] tails: [[G3769]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] power [[G1849]] to hurt [[G91]] men [[G444]] five [[G4002]] months. [[G3376]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] they had [[G2192]] a king [[G935]] over [[G1909]] them, [[G848]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] the [[G3588]] of bottomless [[G12]] pit, [[G12]] whose [[G846]] name [[G3686]] in the Hebrew tongue [[G1447]] Abaddon, [[G3]] but [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Greek tongue [[G1673]] hath [[G2192]] name [[G3686]] Apollyon. [[G623]]

### 12
One [[G1520]] woe [[G3759]] is past; [[G565]] behold, [[G2400]] there come [[G2064]] two [[G1417]] woes [[G3759]] more [[G2089]] hereafter. [[G3326]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] angel [[G32]] sounded, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a [[G1520]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] horns [[G2768]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5552]] golden [[G5552]] altar [[G2379]] which [[G3588]] is before [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]]

### 14
Saying [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1623]] sixth [[G1623]] angel [[G32]] which [[G3739]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] trumpet, [[G4536]] Loose [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] angels [[G32]] which [[G3588]] are bound [[G1210]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] river [[G4215]] Euphrates. [[G2166]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] angels [[G32]] were loosed, [[G3089]] which [[G3588]] were prepared [[G2090]] for [[G1519]]  an [[G3588]] hour, [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] a day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] a month, [[G3376]] and [[G2532]] a year, [[G1763]] for to [[G2443]] slay [[G615]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] of [[G444]] men. [[G444]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of the army [[G4753]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2461]] horsemen [[G2461]] two [[G1417]] hundred thousand [[G3461]] thousand: [[G3461]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of them. [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] thus [[G3779]] I saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] horses [[G2462]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] vision, [[G3706]] and [[G2532]] them that [[G3588]] sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] having [[G2192]] breastplates [[G2382]] of fire, [[G4447]] and [[G2532]] of jacinth, [[G5191]] and [[G2532]] brimstone: [[G2306]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] heads [[G2776]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2462]] horses [[G2462]] as [[G5613]] the heads [[G2776]] of lions; [[G3023]] and [[G2532]] out of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] mouths [[G4750]] issued [[G1607]] fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] smoke [[G2586]] and [[G2532]] brimstone. [[G2303]]

### 18
By [[G5259]] these [[G5130]] three [[G5140]] was [[G615]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] of [[G444]] men [[G444]] killed, [[G615]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] smoke, [[G2586]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] brimstone, [[G2303]] which [[G3588]] issued [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] mouths. [[G4750]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] their [[G846]] power [[G1849]] is [[G1526]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] tails: [[G3769]] for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] tails [[G3769]] like unto [[G3664]] serpents, [[G3789]] and had [[G2192]] heads, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] them [[G846]] they do hurt. [[G91]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] the [[G3588]] of [[G444]] men [[G444]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] were [[G615]] killed [[G615]] by [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] plagues [[G4127]] yet [[G3777]] repented [[G3340]] not [[G3777]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of their [[G846]] hands, [[G5495]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] they should [[G4352]] worship [[G4352]] devils, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] idols [[G1497]] of [[G5552]] gold, [[G5552]] and [[G2532]] silver, [[G693]] and [[G2532]] brass, [[G5470]] and [[G2532]] stone, [[G3035]] and [[G2532]] of [[G3585]] wood: [[G3585]] which [[G3739]] neither [[G3777]] can [[G1410]] see, [[G991]] nor [[G3777]] hear, [[G191]] nor [[G3777]] walk: [[G4043]]

### 21
Neither [[G3756]]  they [[G2532]] repented [[G3340]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] murders, [[G5408]] nor [[G3777]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] sorceries, [[G5331]] nor [[G3777]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] fornication, [[G4202]] nor [[G3777]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] thefts. [[G2809]]
