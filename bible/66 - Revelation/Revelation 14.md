### 1
And [[G2532]] I looked, [[G1492]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] a Lamb [[G721]] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] Sion, [[G4622]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] an hundred [[G1540]] forty [[G5062]] four [[G5064]] thousand, [[G5505]] having [[G2192]] his [[G846]] Father's [[G3962]] name [[G3686]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1909]] their [[G846]] foreheads. [[G3359]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] as [[G5613]] the voice [[G5456]] of many [[G4183]] waters, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] the voice [[G5456]] of a great [[G3173]] thunder: [[G1027]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] the voice [[G5456]] of harpers [[G2790]] harping [[G2789]] with [[G1722]] their [[G846]] harps: [[G2788]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] they sung [[G103]] as it were [[G5613]] a new [[G2537]] song [[G5603]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] beasts, [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders: [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] could [[G1410]] learn [[G3129]] that [[G1487]] song [[G5603]] but [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] hundred [[G1540]] forty [[G5062]] four [[G5064]] thousand, [[G5505]] which [[G3588]] were redeemed [[G59]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 4
These [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] they which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] were [[G3435]] defiled [[G3435]] with [[G3326]] women; [[G1135]] for [[G1063]] they are [[G1526]] virgins. [[G3933]] These [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] they which [[G3588]] follow [[G190]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] whithersoever [[G3699]] he goeth. [[G5217]] These [[G3778]] were redeemed [[G59]] from [[G575]]  among [[G3588]] men, [[G444]] the firstfruits [[G536]]  unto [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G721]] Lamb. [[G721]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] mouth was [[G4750]] found [[G2147]] no [[G3756]] guile: [[G1388]] for [[G1063]] they are [[G1526]] without fault [[G299]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] fly [[G4072]] in [[G1722]] the midst of heaven, [[G3321]] having [[G2192]] the everlasting [[G166]] gospel [[G2098]] to preach [[G2097]] them [[G3588]] unto that [[G2730]] dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] to every [[G3956]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kindred, [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] tongue, [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] people, [[G2992]]

### 7
Saying [[G3004]] with [[G1722]] a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] Fear [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] to him; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] of his [[G846]] judgment is [[G2920]] come: [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] worship [[G4352]] him [[G3588]] that made [[G4160]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] the [[G4077]] fountains [[G4077]] of waters. [[G5204]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] there followed [[G190]] another [[G243]] angel, [[G32]] saying, [[G3004]] Babylon [[G897]] is fallen, [[G4098]] is fallen, [[G4098]] that great [[G3173]] city, [[G4172]] because [[G3754]] she made [[G4222]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] drink [[G4222]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2372]] wrath [[G2372]] of her [[G846]] fornication. [[G4202]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] the third [[G5154]] angel [[G32]] followed [[G190]] them, [[G846]] saying [[G3004]] with [[G1722]] a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] image, [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] receive [[G2983]] mark [[G5480]] in [[G1909]] his [[G846]] forehead, [[G3359]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1909]] his [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]]

### 10
The same [[G846]] shall drink [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2372]] wrath [[G2372]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] is poured out [[G2767]] without mixture [[G194]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] of his [[G846]] indignation; [[G3709]] and [[G2532]] he shall be tormented [[G928]] with [[G1722]] fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] brimstone [[G2303]] in the presence [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] of [[G40]] holy [[G40]] angels, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] in the presence of [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lamb: [[G721]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] smoke [[G2586]] of [[G929]] their [[G846]] torment [[G929]] ascendeth up [[G305]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and ever: [[G165]] and [[G2532]] they have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] rest [[G372]] day [[G2250]] nor [[G2532]] night, [[G3571]] who [[G3588]] worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] image, [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G5100]] receiveth [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] mark [[G5480]] of [[G3686]] his [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

### 12
Here [[G5602]] is [[G2076]] the patience [[G5281]] the [[G3588]] of [[G40]] saints: [[G40]] here [[G5602]] they [[G3588]] that keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] commandments [[G1785]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] saying [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Write, [[G1125]] Blessed [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] which [[G3588]] die [[G599]] in [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] from henceforth: [[G534]] Yea, [[G3483]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] that [[G2443]] they may rest [[G373]] from [[G1537]] their [[G846]] labours; [[G2873]] and [[G1161]] their [[G846]] works [[G2041]] do follow [[G190]] them. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] I looked, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] behold [[G2400]] a white [[G3022]] cloud, [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] sat [[G2521]] like unto [[G3664]] the Son [[G5207]] of man, [[G444]] having [[G2192]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] head [[G2776]] a [[G3588]] golden [[G5552]] crown, [[G4735]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] a [[G3588]] sharp [[G3691]] sickle. [[G1407]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] came [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] crying [[G2896]] with [[G1722]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] him [[G3588]] to that [[G2521]] sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cloud, [[G3507]] Thrust in [[G3992]] thy [[G4675]] sickle, [[G1407]] and [[G2532]] reap: [[G2325]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] time is [[G5610]] come [[G2064]] for thee [[G4671]] to reap; [[G2325]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] harvest [[G2326]] the [[G3588]] of is [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] ripe. [[G3583]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] thrust [[G906]] in [[G846]] his [[G846]] sickle [[G1407]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] was reaped. [[G2325]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] came [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] he [[G846]] also [[G2532]] having [[G2192]] a sharp [[G3691]] sickle. [[G1407]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] came [[G1831]] out from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] which had [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] fire; [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] cried [[G5455]] with a loud [[G3173]] cry [[G2906]] him that [[G3588]] to [[G2192]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] sharp [[G3691]] sickle, [[G1407]] saying, [[G3004]] Thrust in [[G3992]] thy [[G4675]] sharp [[G3691]] sickle, [[G1407]] and [[G2532]] gather [[G5166]] the [[G3588]] clusters [[G1009]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3588]] vine [[G288]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth; [[G1093]] for [[G3754]] her [[G846]] grapes [[G4718]] are fully ripe. [[G187]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] thrust in [[G906]] his [[G846]] sickle [[G1407]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] gathered [[G5166]] the [[G3588]] vine [[G288]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] winepress [[G3025]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2372]] wrath [[G2372]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winepress [[G3025]] was trodden [[G3961]] without [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] blood [[G129]] came [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] winepress, [[G3025]] even unto [[G891]] the [[G3588]] horse [[G2462]] bridles, [[G5469]] by the space of [[G575]] a thousand [[G5507]] six hundred [[G1812]] furlongs.
