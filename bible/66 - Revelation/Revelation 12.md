### 1
And [[G2532]] there appeared [[G3700]] a great [[G3173]] wonder [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] heaven; [[G3772]] a woman [[G1135]] clothed with [[G4016]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] under [[G5270]] her [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] her [[G846]] head [[G2776]] a [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of twelve [[G1427]] stars: [[G792]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] she being [[G2192]] with [[G1722]] child [[G1064]] cried, [[G2896]] travailing in birth, [[G5605]] and [[G2532]] pained [[G928]] to be delivered. [[G5088]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] there appeared [[G3700]] another [[G243]] wonder [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] heaven; [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] behold [[G2400]] a great [[G3173]] red [[G4450]] dragon, [[G1404]] having [[G2192]] seven [[G2033]] heads [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] ten [[G1176]] horns, [[G2768]] and [[G2532]] seven [[G2033]] crowns [[G1238]] upon [[G1909]] his [[G846]] heads. [[G2776]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] tail [[G3769]] drew [[G4951]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G792]] stars [[G792]] of [[G3772]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] did cast [[G906]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] which [[G3588]] was ready [[G3195]] to be delivered, [[G5088]] for [[G2443]] to devour [[G2719]] her [[G846]] child [[G5043]] as soon as [[G3752]] it was born. [[G5088]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] she brought forth [[G5088]] a man [[G730]] child, [[G5207]] who [[G3739]] was to [[G3195]] rule [[G4165]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] with [[G1722]] a rod [[G4464]] of iron: [[G4603]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] child was caught [[G5043]] up [[G726]] unto [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] throne. [[G2362]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] fled [[G5343]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] where [[G3699]] she hath [[G2192]] a place [[G5117]] prepared [[G2090]] of [[G575]] God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] they should feed [[G5142]] her [[G846]] there [[G1563]] a thousand [[G5507]] two hundred [[G1250]] threescore [[G1835]] days. [[G2250]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] there was [[G1096]] war [[G4171]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] Michael [[G3413]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] angels [[G32]] fought [[G4170]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] dragon; [[G1404]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] fought [[G4170]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] angels, [[G32]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] prevailed [[G2480]] not; [[G3756]] neither [[G3777]] was [[G2147]] their [[G846]] place [[G5117]] found [[G2147]] any more [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] dragon [[G1404]] was cast out, [[G906]] that [[G3588]] old [[G744]] serpent, [[G3789]] called [[G2564]] the [[G3588]] Devil, [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] Satan, [[G4567]] which [[G3588]] deceiveth [[G4105]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world: [[G3625]] he was cast out [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] angels [[G32]] were cast out [[G906]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] saying [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] Now [[G737]] is come [[G1096]] salvation, [[G4991]] and [[G2532]] strength, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of our [[G2257]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1849]] of his [[G846]] Christ: [[G5547]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] accuser [[G2725]] of our [[G2257]] brethren [[G80]] is cast down, [[G2598]] which [[G3588]] accused [[G2723]] them [[G846]] before [[G1799]] our [[G2257]] God [[G2316]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night. [[G3571]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] overcame [[G3528]] him [[G846]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G721]] Lamb, [[G721]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of their [[G846]] testimony; [[G3141]] and [[G2532]] they loved [[G25]] not [[G3756]] their [[G846]] lives [[G5590]] unto [[G891]] the death. [[G2288]]

### 12
Therefore [[G1223]] rejoice, [[G2165]] heavens, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] ye [[G3588]] that dwell [[G4637]] in [[G1722]] them. [[G846]] Woe [[G3759]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2730]] inhabiters [[G2730]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea! [[G2281]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] is come down [[G2597]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] having [[G2192]] great [[G3173]] wrath, [[G2372]] because [[G3754]] he knoweth that [[G1492]] he hath [[G2192]] but a short [[G3641]] time. [[G2540]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he was cast [[G906]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] he persecuted [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] which [[G3748]] brought forth [[G5088]] the [[G3588]] man [[G730]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1135]] woman [[G1135]] were given [[G1325]] two [[G1417]] wings [[G4420]] a [[G3588]] of [[G3173]] great [[G3173]] eagle, [[G105]] that [[G2443]] she might fly [[G4072]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] into [[G1519]] her [[G846]] place, [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] she is nourished [[G5142]] for [[G1563]] a time, [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] times, [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] half [[G2255]] a time, [[G2540]] from [[G575]] the face [[G4383]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3789]] serpent. [[G3789]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] serpent [[G3789]] cast out [[G906]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] water [[G5204]] as [[G5613]] a flood [[G4215]] after [[G3694]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] that [[G2443]] he might cause [[G4160]] her [[G3778]] to be carried away of the flood. [[G4216]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] helped [[G997]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] opened [[G455]] her [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] swallowed up [[G2666]] the [[G3588]] flood [[G4215]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] cast out [[G906]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mouth. [[G4750]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] was wroth [[G3710]] with [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] went [[G565]] to make [[G4160]] war [[G4171]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] remnant [[G3062]] of her [[G846]] seed, [[G4690]] which [[G3588]] keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] commandments [[G1785]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ.
