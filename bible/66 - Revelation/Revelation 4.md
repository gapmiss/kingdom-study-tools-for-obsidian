### 1
After [[G3326]] this [[G5023]] I looked, [[G1492]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a door [[G2374]] opened [[G455]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] voice [[G5456]] which [[G3739]] I heard [[G191]] as it were [[G5613]] of a trumpet [[G4536]] talking [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] me; [[G1700]] which said, [[G3004]] Come up [[G305]] hither, [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] I will shew [[G1166]] thee [[G4671]] things [[G5023]] which [[G3739]] must [[G1163]] be [[G1096]] hereafter. [[G3326]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] I was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the spirit: [[G4151]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a throne [[G2362]] was set [[G2749]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne. [[G2362]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] was [[G2258]] to look upon [[G3706]] like [[G3664]] a jasper [[G2393]] and [[G2532]] a sardine [[G4555]] stone: [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] a rainbow [[G2463]] round about [[G2943]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] in sight [[G3706]] like unto [[G3664]] an emerald. [[G4664]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] round about [[G2943]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] four [[G5064]] and [[G2532]] twenty [[G1501]] seats: [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] seats [[G2362]] I saw [[G1492]] four [[G5064]] and [[G2532]] twenty [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] sitting, [[G2521]] clothed [[G4016]] in [[G1722]] white [[G3022]] raiment; [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] they had [[G2192]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] heads [[G2776]] crowns [[G4735]] of gold. [[G5552]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] proceeded [[G1607]] lightnings [[G796]] and [[G2532]] thunderings [[G1027]] and [[G2532]] voices: [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] seven [[G2033]] lamps [[G2985]] of fire [[G4442]] burning [[G2545]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] which [[G3739]] are [[G1526]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] Spirits [[G4151]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] a sea [[G2281]] of glass [[G5193]] like unto [[G3664]] crystal: [[G2930]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2362]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] round about [[G2945]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] four [[G5064]] beasts [[G2226]] full of [[G1073]] eyes [[G3788]] before [[G1715]] and [[G2532]] behind. [[G3693]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] beast [[G2226]] like [[G3664]] a lion, [[G3023]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] beast [[G2226]] like [[G3664]] a calf, [[G3448]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] beast [[G2226]] had [[G2192]] a [[G3588]] face [[G4383]] as [[G5613]] a man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] beast [[G2226]] like [[G3664]] a flying [[G4072]] eagle. [[G105]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] the four [[G5064]] beasts [[G2226]] had [[G2192]] each [[G303]] of them [[G1438]] six [[G1803]] wings [[G4420]] about [[G2943]] and [[G2532]] full [[G1073]] of eyes [[G3788]] within: [[G2081]] and [[G2532]]  they [[G2192]] rest [[G372]] not [[G3756]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night, [[G3571]] saying, [[G3004]] Holy, [[G40]] holy, [[G40]] holy, [[G40]] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty, [[G3841]] which [[G3588]] was, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] is, [[G5607]] and [[G2532]] is to come. [[G2064]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] those [[G3588]] beasts [[G2226]] give [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honour [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] thanks [[G2169]] him [[G3588]] to that [[G2521]] sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] who [[G3588]] liveth [[G2198]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever, [[G165]]

### 10
The [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] and [[G2532]] twenty [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] fall down [[G4098]] before [[G1799]] him [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] worship [[G4352]] him [[G3588]] that liveth [[G2198]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever, [[G165]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] their [[G846]] crowns [[G4735]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 11
Thou art [[G1488]] worthy, [[G514]] O Lord, [[G2962]] to receive [[G2983]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honour [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] power: [[G1411]] for [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] hast created [[G2936]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] thy [[G4675]] pleasure they [[G2307]] are [[G1526]] and [[G2532]] were created.
