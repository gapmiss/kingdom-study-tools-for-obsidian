### 1
the [[G3588]] Unto [[G32]] angel [[G32]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2179]] of [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] Ephesus [[G2179]] he [[G3588]] write; [[G1125]] These things [[G3592]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] that holdeth [[G2902]] seven [[G2033]] stars [[G792]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] right hand, [[G1188]] who [[G3588]] walketh [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3087]] seven [[G2033]] golden [[G5552]] candlesticks; [[G3087]]

### 2
I know [[G1492]] thy [[G4675]] works, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] labour, [[G2873]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] patience, [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] how [[G3754]] thou canst [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] bear [[G941]] them which are evil: [[G2556]] and [[G2532]] thou hast tried [[G3985]] them which say [[G5335]] they are [[G1511]] apostles, [[G652]] and [[G2532]] are [[G1526]] not, [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] hast found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] liars: [[G5571]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] hast borne, [[G941]] and [[G2532]] hast [[G2192]] patience, [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] for sake [[G1223]] my [[G3450]] name's [[G3686]] hast laboured, [[G2872]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] hast [[G2577]] fainted. [[G2577]]

### 4
Nevertheless [[G235]] I have [[G2192]] against [[G2596]] thee, [[G4675]] because [[G3754]] thou hast left [[G863]] thy [[G4675]] first [[G4413]] love. [[G26]]

### 5
Remember [[G3421]] therefore [[G3767]] from whence [[G4159]] thou art fallen, [[G1601]] and [[G2532]] repent, [[G3340]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] works; [[G2041]] or else [[G1487]] I will come [[G2064]] unto thee [[G4671]] quickly, [[G5034]] and [[G2532]] will remove [[G2795]] thy [[G4675]] candlestick [[G3087]] out [[G1537]] of [[G5117]] his [[G846]] place, [[G5117]] except [[G1437]] thou repent. [[G3340]]

### 6
But [[G235]] this [[G5124]] thou hast, [[G2192]] that [[G3754]] thou hatest [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] deeds [[G2041]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3531]] Nicolaitans, [[G3531]] which [[G3739]] I also [[G2504]] hate. [[G3404]]

### 7
He [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1577]] churches; [[G1577]] To that [[G3528]] him [[G846]] overcometh [[G3528]] will I give [[G1325]] to eat [[G5315]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G3586]] of [[G2222]] life, [[G2222]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3857]] paradise [[G3857]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G32]] angel [[G32]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] church [[G1577]] in Smyrna [[G4668]] write; [[G1125]] These things [[G3592]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last, [[G2078]] which [[G3739]] was [[G1096]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] is alive; [[G2198]]

### 9
I know [[G1492]] thy [[G4675]] works, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] tribulation, [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] poverty, [[G4432]] (but [[G1161]] thou art [[G1488]] rich) [[G4145]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] blasphemy [[G3588]]  of them which [[G988]] say [[G3004]] they [[G1438]] are [[G1511]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] are [[G1526]] not, [[G3756]] but [[G235]] the synagogue [[G4864]] of [[G4567]] Satan. [[G4567]]

### 10
Fear [[G5399]] none [[G3367]] of those things which [[G3739]] thou shalt [[G3195]] suffer: [[G3958]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] shall [[G3195]] cast [[G906]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] into [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] that [[G2443]] ye may be tried; [[G3985]] and [[G2532]] ye shall have [[G2192]] tribulation [[G2347]] ten [[G1176]] days: [[G2250]] be thou [[G1096]] faithful [[G4103]] unto [[G891]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] I will give [[G1325]] thee [[G4671]] a [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of [[G2222]] life. [[G2222]]

### 11
He [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1577]] churches; [[G1577]] He [[G3588]] that overcometh [[G3528]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G91]] hurt [[G91]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] death. [[G2288]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to of [[G32]] angel [[G32]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Pergamos [[G4010]] write; [[G1125]] These things [[G3592]] saith [[G3004]] he [[G3588]] which hath [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] sharp [[G3691]] sword [[G4501]] with two edges; [[G1366]]

### 13
I know [[G1492]] thy [[G4675]] works, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] where [[G4226]] thou dwellest, [[G2730]] where [[G3699]] Satan's [[G4567]] seat [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] thou holdest fast [[G2902]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] hast [[G720]] denied [[G720]] my [[G3450]] faith, [[G4102]] even [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] those [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] wherein [[G1722]] Antipas [[G493]] my [[G3450]] faithful [[G4103]] martyr, [[G3144]] who [[G3739]] was slain [[G615]] among [[G3844]] you, [[G5213]] where [[G3699]] Satan [[G4567]] dwelleth. [[G2730]]

### 14
But [[G235]] I have [[G2192]] a few things [[G3641]] against [[G2596]] thee, [[G4675]] because [[G3754]] thou hast [[G2192]] there [[G1563]] them that hold [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] doctrine [[G1322]] of Balaam, [[G903]] who [[G3739]] taught [[G1321]] Balac [[G904]] cast [[G906]] to a of to things sacrificed unto to commit [[G4203]] stumblingblock [[G4625]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] Israel, [[G2474]] eat [[G5315]] idols, [[G1494]] and [[G2532]] fornication. [[G4203]]

### 15
So [[G3779]] hast [[G2192]] thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] them that hold [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] doctrine [[G1322]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3531]] Nicolaitans, [[G3531]] which thing [[G3739]] I hate. [[G3404]]

### 16
Repent; [[G3340]] or [[G1487]] else [[G3361]] I will come [[G2064]] unto thee [[G4671]] quickly, [[G5035]] and [[G2532]] will fight [[G4170]] against [[G3326]] them [[G846]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sword [[G4501]] of [[G4750]] my [[G3450]] mouth. [[G4750]]

### 17
He [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1577]] churches; [[G1577]] To him [[G3588]] that overcometh [[G3528]] will I give [[G1325]] to eat [[G5315]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] hidden [[G2928]] manna, [[G3131]] and [[G2532]] will give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] a [[G5586]] white [[G3022]] stone, [[G5586]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G5586]] a [[G3686]] new [[G2537]] name [[G3686]] written, [[G1125]] which [[G3739]] no man [[G3762]] knoweth [[G1097]] saving [[G1487]] he [[G3588]] that receiveth [[G2983]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unto of [[G32]] angel [[G32]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] the [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Thyatira [[G2363]] write; [[G1125]] These things [[G3592]] saith [[G3004]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] hath [[G2192]] his [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] like unto [[G5613]] a flame [[G5395]] of fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] like [[G3664]] fine brass; [[G5474]]

### 19
I know [[G1492]] thy [[G4675]] works, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] charity, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] service, [[G1248]] and [[G2532]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] patience, [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] works; [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] more [[G4119]] the [[G3588]] than [[G4413]] first. [[G4413]]

### 20
Notwithstanding [[G235]] I have [[G2192]] a few things [[G3641]] against [[G2596]] thee, [[G4675]] because [[G3754]] thou sufferest [[G1439]] that [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] Jezebel, [[G2403]] which calleth [[G3004]] herself [[G1438]] a prophetess, [[G4398]] to teach [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] to seduce [[G4105]] my [[G1699]] servants [[G1401]] to commit fornication, [[G4203]] and [[G2532]] to eat [[G5315]] things sacrificed unto idols. [[G1494]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] I gave [[G1325]] her [[G846]] space [[G5550]] to [[G2443]] repent [[G3340]] of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] fornication; [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] she repented [[G3340]] not. [[G3756]]

### 22
Behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] will cast [[G906]] her [[G846]] into [[G1519]] a bed, [[G2825]] and [[G2532]] them that commit adultery [[G3431]] with [[G3326]] her [[G846]] into [[G1519]] great [[G3173]] tribulation, [[G2347]] except [[G1437]] they repent [[G3340]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] deeds. [[G2041]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] I will kill [[G615]] her [[G846]] children [[G5043]] with [[G1722]] death; [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] shall know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] he [[G3588]] which [[G3588]] searcheth [[G2045]] the reins [[G3510]] and [[G2532]] hearts: [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] I will give [[G1325]] unto [[G5213]] every one of [[G1538]] you [[G5213]] according to [[G2596]] your [[G5216]] works. [[G2041]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] unto you [[G5213]] I say, [[G3004]] and [[G2532]] unto the rest [[G3062]] in [[G1722]] Thyatira, [[G2363]] as many as [[G3745]] have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] doctrine, [[G1322]] and [[G2532]] which [[G3748]] not [[G3756]] have [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] depths [[G899]] of [[G4567]] Satan, [[G4567]] as [[G5613]] they speak; [[G3004]] I will put [[G906]] upon [[G1909]] you [[G5209]] none [[G3756]] other [[G243]] burden. [[G922]]

### 25
But [[G4133]] that which [[G3739]] ye have [[G2192]] hold fast [[G2902]] till [[G891]] I [[G2240]] come. [[G2240]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that overcometh, [[G3528]] and [[G2532]] keepeth [[G5083]] my [[G3450]] works [[G2041]] unto [[G891]] the end, [[G5056]] to him [[G846]] will I give [[G1325]] power [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] nations: [[G1484]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] he shall rule [[G4165]] them [[G846]] with [[G1722]] a rod [[G4464]] of iron; [[G4603]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] vessels [[G4632]] of a [[G2764]] potter [[G2764]] shall they be broken to shivers: [[G4937]] even as [[G5613]] I [[G2504]] received [[G2983]] of [[G3844]] my [[G3450]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] I will give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] morning [[G4407]] star. [[G792]]

### 29
He [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1577]] churches. [[G1577]]
