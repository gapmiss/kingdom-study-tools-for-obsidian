### 1
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] an angel [[G32]] come down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] having [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] key [[G2807]] the bottomless [[G3588]] of [[G12]] pit [[G12]] and [[G2532]] a great [[G3173]] chain [[G254]] in [[G1909]] his [[G846]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he laid hold on [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] dragon, [[G1404]] that old [[G744]] serpent, [[G3789]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the Devil, [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] Satan, [[G4567]] and [[G2532]] bound [[G1210]] him [[G846]] a thousand [[G5507]] years, [[G2094]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the bottomless pit, [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] shut up, [[G2808]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] set a seal [[G4972]] upon [[G1883]] him, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he should deceive [[G4105]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] no [[G3361]] more, [[G2089]] till [[G891]] the [[G3588]] thousand [[G5507]] years [[G2094]] should be fulfilled: [[G5055]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] that [[G5023]] he [[G846]] must be [[G1163]] loosed [[G3089]] a little [[G3398]] season. [[G5550]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] thrones, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] they sat [[G2523]] upon [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] judgment [[G2917]] was given [[G1325]] unto them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] souls [[G5590]] them [[G3588]] of that were [[G3990]] beheaded [[G3990]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] witness [[G3141]] of Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] which [[G3748]] not [[G3756]] had [[G4352]] worshipped [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] neither [[G3777]] his [[G846]] image, [[G1504]] neither [[G2532]] had received [[G2983]] mark [[G5480]] upon [[G1909]] their [[G846]] foreheads, [[G3359]] or [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] their [[G846]] hands; [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] they lived [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] reigned [[G936]] with [[G3326]] Christ [[G5547]] a [[G3588]] thousand [[G5507]] years. [[G2094]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3498]] dead [[G3498]] lived again [[G326]] not [[G3756]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] thousand [[G5507]] years [[G2094]] were finished. [[G5055]] This [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] resurrection. [[G386]]

### 6
Blessed [[G3107]] and [[G2532]] holy [[G40]] he that [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] part [[G3313]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] resurrection: [[G386]] on [[G1909]] such [[G5130]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] death [[G2288]] hath [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] power, [[G1849]] but [[G235]] they shall be [[G2071]] priests [[G2409]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of [[G5547]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] shall reign [[G936]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] a thousand [[G5507]] years. [[G2094]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] thousand [[G5507]] years [[G2094]] are expired, [[G5055]] Satan [[G4567]] shall be loosed [[G3089]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] prison, [[G5438]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] shall go out [[G1831]] to deceive [[G4105]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] which [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] quarters [[G1137]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] Gog [[G1136]] and [[G2532]] Magog, [[G3098]] to gather together [[G4863]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] battle: [[G4171]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of whom [[G3739]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sand [[G285]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] they went up [[G305]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] breadth [[G4114]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] compassed about, [[G2944]] the [[G3588]] camp [[G3925]] the [[G3588]] of [[G40]] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] beloved [[G25]] city: [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] fire [[G4442]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] out of [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] devoured [[G2719]] them. [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] that [[G3588]] deceived [[G4105]] them [[G846]] was cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] of [[G4442]] fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] brimstone, [[G2303]] where [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] the false [[G3588]] prophet [[G5578]] and [[G2532]] shall be tormented [[G928]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever. [[G165]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] a great [[G3173]] white [[G3022]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] him [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] it, [[G846]] from [[G575]] whose [[G3739]] face [[G4383]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] fled away; [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] there was found [[G2147]] no [[G3756]] place [[G5117]] for them. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great, [[G3173]] stand [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the books [[G975]] were opened: [[G455]] and [[G2532]] another [[G243]] book [[G975]] was opened, [[G455]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] of [[G2222]] life: [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] were judged [[G2919]] out of [[G1537]] those things [[G3588]] which were written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] books, [[G975]] according to [[G2596]] their [[G846]] works. [[G2041]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea gave [[G2281]] up [[G1325]] which [[G3588]] the dead [[G3498]] were in [[G1722]] it; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] hell [[G86]] delivered up [[G1325]] the dead [[G3498]] which [[G3588]] were in [[G1722]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they were judged [[G2919]] every man [[G1538]] according to [[G2596]] their [[G846]] works. [[G2041]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] hell [[G86]] were cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] of [[G4442]] fire. [[G4442]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] death. [[G2288]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G5100]] not [[G3756]] was [[G2147]] found [[G2147]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] book [[G976]] of was [[G2222]] life [[G2222]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] of [[G4442]] fire. [[G4442]]
