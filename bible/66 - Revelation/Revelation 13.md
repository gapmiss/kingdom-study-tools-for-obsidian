### 1
And [[G2532]] I stood [[G2476]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sand [[G285]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] a beast [[G2342]] rise up [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] having [[G2192]] seven [[G2033]] heads [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] ten [[G1176]] horns, [[G2768]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] his [[G846]] horns [[G2768]] ten [[G1176]] crowns, [[G1238]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] his [[G846]] heads [[G2776]] the name [[G3686]] of blasphemy. [[G988]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] which [[G3739]] I saw [[G1492]] was [[G2258]] like unto [[G3664]] a leopard, [[G3917]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] were [[G5613]] as [[G5613]] of a bear, [[G715]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] as [[G5613]] the mouth [[G4750]] of a lion: [[G3023]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] gave [[G1325]] him [[G846]] his [[G846]] power, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] seat, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] authority. [[G1849]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] one [[G1520]] of his [[G846]] heads as it [[G2776]] were [[G5613]] wounded [[G4969]] to [[G1519]] death; [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] deadly [[G2288]] wound [[G4127]] was healed: [[G2323]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] world [[G1093]] wondered [[G2296]] after [[G3694]] the [[G3588]] beast. [[G2342]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] they worshipped [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] which [[G3739]] gave [[G1325]] power [[G1849]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2342]] beast: [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] they worshipped [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] saying, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] like unto [[G3664]] the [[G3588]] beast? [[G2342]] who [[G5101]] is able [[G1410]] to make war [[G4170]] with [[G3326]] him? [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] there was given [[G1325]] unto him [[G846]] a mouth [[G4750]] speaking [[G2980]] great things [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] blasphemies; [[G988]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1849]] was given [[G1325]] unto him [[G846]] to continue [[G4160]] forty [[G5062]] two [[G1417]] months. [[G3376]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] he opened [[G455]] his [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] in [[G1519]] blasphemy [[G988]] against [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] to blaspheme [[G987]] his [[G846]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] tabernacle, [[G4633]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] that dwell [[G4637]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] it was given [[G1325]] unto him [[G846]] to make [[G4160]] war [[G4171]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] to overcome [[G3528]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1849]] was given [[G1325]] him [[G846]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] kindreds, [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] tongues, [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] nations. [[G1484]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] shall worship [[G4352]] him, [[G846]] whose [[G3739]] names [[G3686]] not [[G3756]] are [[G1125]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] book [[G976]] of [[G2222]] life [[G2222]] the [[G3588]] of [[G721]] Lamb [[G721]] slain [[G4969]] from [[G575]] the foundation [[G2602]] of the world. [[G2889]]

### 9
If [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] have [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 10
He [[G5100]] that [[G1487]] leadeth into [[G4863]] captivity [[G161]] shall go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] captivity: [[G161]] he [[G5100]] that [[G1487]] killeth [[G615]] with [[G1722]] the sword [[G3162]] must [[G1163]] be [[G846]] killed [[G615]] with [[G1722]] the sword. [[G3162]] Here [[G5602]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] patience [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] faith of [[G4102]] the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] I beheld [[G1492]] another [[G243]] beast [[G2342]] coming up [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] he had [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] horns [[G2768]] like [[G3664]] a lamb, [[G721]] and [[G2532]] he spake [[G2980]] as [[G5613]] a dragon. [[G1404]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] he exerciseth [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] power of [[G1849]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] beast [[G2342]] before [[G1799]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] causeth [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] which dwell [[G2730]] therein [[G1722]] to [[G2443]] worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] beast, [[G2342]] whose [[G3739]] deadly was [[G2288]] wound [[G4127]] healed. [[G2323]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he doeth [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] wonders, [[G4592]] so [[G2443]] that [[G2532]] he maketh [[G4160]] fire [[G4442]] come down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] in the sight [[G1799]] of [[G444]] men, [[G444]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] deceiveth [[G4105]] them [[G3588]] that dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] by [[G1223]] those [[G3588]] miracles [[G4592]] which [[G3739]] he [[G846]] had power [[G1325]] to do [[G4160]] in the sight of [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] beast; [[G2342]] saying [[G3004]] them [[G3588]] to that [[G2730]] dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] that they should make [[G4160]] an image [[G1504]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2342]] beast, [[G2342]] which [[G3739]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] wound [[G4127]]  by a [[G3588]] sword, [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] did live. [[G2198]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] had power [[G1325]] to give [[G1325]] life [[G4151]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1504]] image [[G1504]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast, [[G2342]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] image [[G1504]] should [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast [[G2342]] both [[G2532]] speak, [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] cause [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] as many [[G3745]] as [[G302]] not [[G3361]] would [[G4352]] worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] image [[G1504]] the [[G3588]] of should be [[G2342]] beast [[G2342]] killed. [[G615]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he causeth [[G4160]] all, [[G3956]] both [[G2532]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great, [[G3173]] rich [[G4145]] and [[G2532]] poor, [[G4434]] free [[G1658]] and [[G2532]] bond, [[G1401]] to [[G2443]] receive [[G1325]] a mark [[G5480]] in [[G1909]] their [[G846]] right [[G1188]] hand, [[G5495]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1909]] their [[G846]] foreheads: [[G3359]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] no [[G3361]] man [[G5100]] might [[G1410]] buy [[G59]] or [[G2228]] sell, [[G4453]] save [[G1487]] he that [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] mark, [[G5480]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast, [[G2342]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of his [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

### 18
Here [[G5602]] is [[G2076]] wisdom. [[G4678]] Let him [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] understanding [[G3563]] count [[G5585]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast: [[G2342]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] the number [[G706]] of a man; [[G444]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] number [[G706]] Six hundred threescore six.
