### 1
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] I heard [[G191]] a great [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] of much [[G4183]] people [[G3793]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] saying, [[G3004]] Alleluia; [[G239]] Salvation, [[G4991]] and [[G2532]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honour, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] power, [[G1411]] unto the Lord [[G2962]] our [[G2257]] God: [[G2316]]

### 2
For [[G3754]] true [[G228]] and [[G2532]] righteous [[G1342]] his [[G846]] judgments: [[G2920]] for [[G3754]] he hath judged [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] whore, [[G4204]] which [[G3748]] did corrupt [[G5351]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] with [[G1722]] her [[G846]] fornication, [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] hath avenged [[G1556]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of his [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] at [[G1537]] her [[G846]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] again [[G1208]] they said, [[G2046]] Alleluia. [[G239]] And [[G2532]] her [[G846]] smoke rose [[G2586]] up [[G305]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever. [[G165]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] four [[G5064]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] twenty [[G1501]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] four [[G5064]] beasts [[G2226]] fell down [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] worshipped [[G4352]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3588]] sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] saying, [[G3004]] Amen; [[G281]] Alleluia. [[G239]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] came out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] saying, [[G3004]] Praise [[G134]] our [[G2257]] God, [[G2316]] all [[G3956]] ye his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] ye that [[G3588]] fear [[G5399]] him, [[G846]] both [[G2532]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great. [[G3173]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] as it were [[G5613]] the voice [[G5456]] of a great [[G4183]] multitude, [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] the voice [[G5456]] of many [[G4183]] waters, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] the voice [[G5456]] of mighty [[G2478]] thunderings, [[G1027]] saying, [[G3004]] Alleluia: [[G239]] for [[G3754]] the Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] omnipotent [[G3841]] reigneth. [[G936]]

### 7
Let us be glad [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] rejoice, [[G21]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] honour [[G1391]] to him: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] marriage [[G1062]] the [[G3588]] of [[G721]] Lamb [[G721]] is come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] hath made ready. [[G2090]] herself [[G1438]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] to her [[G846]] was granted [[G1325]] that [[G2443]] she should be arrayed [[G4016]] in fine linen, [[G1039]] clean [[G2513]] and [[G2532]] white: [[G2986]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] fine linen [[G1039]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1345]] of saints. [[G40]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Write, [[G1125]] Blessed [[G3107]] they which [[G3588]] are called [[G2564]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] marriage [[G1062]] supper [[G1173]] the [[G3588]] of [[G721]] Lamb. [[G721]] And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] These [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] the [[G3588]] true [[G228]] sayings [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] I fell [[G4098]] at [[G1715]] his [[G846]] feet to [[G4228]] worship [[G4352]] him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] See [[G3708]] not: [[G3361]] I am [[G1510]] thy [[G4675]] fellowservant, [[G4889]] and [[G2532]] of thy [[G4675]] brethren [[G80]] that [[G3588]] have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of [[G2424]] Jesus: [[G2424]] worship [[G4352]] God: [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of [[G4394]] prophecy. [[G4394]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] heaven [[G3772]] opened, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] behold [[G2400]] a white [[G3022]] horse; [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] sat [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] him [[G846]] called [[G2564]] Faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] True, [[G228]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] righteousness [[G1343]] he doth judge [[G2919]] and [[G2532]] make war. [[G4170]]

### 12
His [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] as [[G5613]] a flame [[G5395]] of fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] head [[G2776]] many [[G4183]] crowns; [[G1238]] and [[G1161]] he had [[G2192]] a name [[G3686]] written, [[G1125]] that [[G3739]] no man [[G3762]] knew, [[G1492]] but [[G1487]] he himself. [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he clothed with [[G4016]] a vesture [[G2440]] dipped [[G911]] in blood: [[G129]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] name is [[G3686]] called [[G2564]] The [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] armies [[G4753]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] followed [[G190]] him [[G846]] upon [[G1909]] white [[G3022]] horses, [[G2462]] clothed in [[G1746]] fine linen, [[G1039]] white [[G3022]] and [[G2532]] clean. [[G2513]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] goeth [[G1607]] a sharp [[G3691]] sword, [[G4501]] that [[G2443]] with [[G1722]] it [[G846]] he should smite [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] nations: [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] shall rule [[G4165]] them [[G846]] with [[G1722]] a rod [[G4464]] of iron: [[G4603]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] treadeth [[G3961]] the [[G3588]] winepress [[G3631]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2372]] fierceness [[G2372]] and [[G2532]] wrath [[G3709]] of [[G3841]] Almighty [[G3841]] God. [[G2316]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he hath [[G2192]] on [[G1909]] vesture [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] thigh [[G3382]] a [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] written, [[G1125]] KING [[G935]] OF KINGS, [[G935]] AND [[G2532]] LORD [[G2962]] OF LORDS. [[G2962]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] an [[G1520]] angel [[G32]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sun; [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] he cried [[G2896]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] saying [[G3004]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] fowls that [[G3732]] fly [[G4072]] in [[G1722]] the midst of heaven, [[G3321]] Come [[G1205]] and [[G2532]] gather yourselves together [[G4863]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] supper of [[G1173]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] God; [[G2316]]

### 18
That [[G2443]] ye may eat [[G5315]] the flesh [[G4561]] of kings, [[G935]] and [[G2532]] the flesh [[G4561]] of captains, [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] the flesh [[G4561]] of mighty men, [[G2478]] and [[G2532]] the flesh [[G4561]] of horses, [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] of that [[G2521]] sit [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the flesh [[G4561]] of all [[G3956]] free [[G1658]] and [[G2532]] bond, [[G1401]] both [[G2532]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great. [[G3173]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] armies, [[G4753]] gathered together [[G4863]] to make [[G4160]] war [[G4171]] against [[G3326]] him [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] horse, [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] against [[G3326]] his [[G846]] army. [[G4753]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] was taken, [[G4084]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] him [[G5127]] that [[G3588]] false prophet [[G5578]] wrought [[G4160]] miracles [[G4592]] before [[G1799]] him, [[G846]] with [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] he deceived [[G4105]] them [[G3588]] that [[G3588]] had received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] mark [[G5480]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] that [[G3588]] worshipped [[G4352]] his [[G846]] image. [[G1504]] These [[G3588]] both [[G1417]] were cast [[G906]] alive [[G2198]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3041]] lake [[G3041]] of [[G4442]] fire [[G4442]] burning [[G2545]] with [[G1722]] brimstone. [[G2303]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] remnant [[G3062]] were slain [[G615]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sword [[G4501]] him [[G3588]] of that [[G2521]] sat [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] horse, [[G2462]] which [[G3588]] proceeded [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mouth: [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] fowls [[G3732]] were filled [[G5526]] with [[G1537]] their [[G846]] flesh.
