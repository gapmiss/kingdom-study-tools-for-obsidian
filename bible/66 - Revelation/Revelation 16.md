### 1
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a great [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] saying [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2033]] seven [[G2033]] angels, [[G32]] Go your ways, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] pour out [[G1632]] the [[G3588]] vials [[G5357]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2372]] wrath [[G2372]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] upon [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] went, [[G565]] and [[G2532]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] vial [[G5357]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] there fell [[G1096]] a noisome [[G2556]] and [[G2532]] grievous [[G4190]] sore [[G1668]] upon [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] men [[G444]] which [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] mark [[G5480]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] which worshipped [[G4352]] his [[G846]] image. [[G1504]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] angel [[G32]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] vial [[G5357]] upon [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] it became [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] the blood [[G129]] of a dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] living [[G2198]] soul [[G5590]] died [[G599]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] angel [[G32]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] vial [[G5357]] upon [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] rivers [[G4215]] and [[G2532]] fountains [[G4077]] of [[G5204]] waters; [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] they became [[G1096]] blood. [[G129]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5204]] waters [[G5204]] say, [[G3004]] Thou art [[G1488]] righteous, [[G1342]] O Lord, [[G2962]] which [[G3588]] art, [[G5607]] and [[G2532]] wast, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] shalt be, [[G3741]] because [[G3754]] thou hast judged [[G2919]] thus. [[G5023]]

### 6
For [[G3754]] they have shed [[G1632]] the blood [[G129]] of saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] thou hast given [[G1325]] them [[G846]] blood [[G129]] to drink; [[G4095]] for [[G1063]] they are [[G1526]] worthy. [[G514]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] another [[G243]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] say, [[G3004]] Even so, [[G3483]] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty, [[G3841]] true [[G228]] and [[G2532]] righteous [[G1342]] thy [[G4675]] judgments. [[G2920]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] angel [[G32]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] vial [[G5357]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sun; [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] was given [[G1325]] power to [[G2739]] unto him [[G846]] scorch [[G2739]] men [[G444]] with [[G1722]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] men [[G444]] were scorched [[G2739]] with great [[G3173]] heat, [[G2738]] and [[G2532]] blasphemed [[G987]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] these [[G3778]] plagues: [[G4127]] and [[G2532]] they repented [[G3340]] not [[G3756]] to give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fifth [[G3991]] angel [[G32]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] vial [[G5357]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] seat [[G2362]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast; [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] was [[G1096]] full of darkness; [[G4656]] and [[G2532]] they gnawed [[G3145]] their [[G846]] tongues [[G1100]] for [[G1537]] pain, [[G4192]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] blasphemed [[G987]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G3772]] heaven [[G3772]] because [[G1537]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] pains [[G4192]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] sores, [[G1668]] and [[G2532]] repented [[G3340]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] deeds. [[G2041]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] angel [[G32]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] vial [[G5357]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] river [[G4215]] Euphrates; [[G2166]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] thereof [[G846]] was dried up, [[G3583]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] the [[G3588]] of [[G935]] kings [[G935]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] east [[G395]] might be prepared. [[G2090]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] three [[G5140]] unclean [[G169]] spirits [[G4151]] like [[G3664]] frogs [[G944]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1404]] dragon, [[G1404]] and [[G2532]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] the [[G3588]] of false [[G5578]] prophet. [[G5578]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] they are [[G1526]] the spirits [[G4151]] of devils, [[G1142]] working [[G4160]] miracles, [[G4592]] go forth [[G1607]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3625]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G3625]] gather [[G4863]] to [[G846]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] battle [[G4171]] of that [[G1565]] great [[G3173]] day [[G2250]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] Almighty. [[G3841]]

### 15
Behold, [[G2400]] I come [[G2064]] as [[G5613]] a thief. [[G2812]] Blessed [[G3107]] he [[G3588]] that watcheth, [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] keepeth [[G5083]] his [[G846]] garments, [[G2440]] lest [[G2443]] he walk [[G4043]] naked, [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] they see [[G991]] his [[G846]] shame. [[G808]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he gathered together [[G4863]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]]  place [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] in the Hebrew tongue [[G1447]] Armageddon. [[G717]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] angel [[G32]] poured out [[G1632]] his [[G846]] vial [[G5357]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] air; [[G109]] and [[G2532]] there came [[G1831]] a great [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] out [[G575]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3485]] temple [[G3485]] of [[G3772]] heaven, [[G3772]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] saying, [[G3004]] It is done. [[G1096]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] there were [[G1096]] voices, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] thunders, [[G1027]] and [[G2532]] lightnings; [[G796]] and [[G2532]] there was [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] earthquake, [[G4578]] such as [[G3634]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] since [[G575]] men [[G444]] were [[G1096]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] so mighty [[G5082]] an earthquake, [[G4578]] so [[G3779]] great. [[G3173]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city was [[G4172]] divided [[G1096]] into [[G1519]] three [[G5140]] parts, [[G3313]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cities [[G4172]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] nations [[G1484]] fell: [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] Babylon [[G897]] came in remembrance [[G3415]] before [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] to give [[G1325]] unto her [[G846]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3631]] wine [[G3631]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2372]] fierceness [[G2372]] of his [[G846]] wrath. [[G3709]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] island [[G3520]] fled away, [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] the mountains [[G3735]] not [[G3756]] were [[G2147]] found. [[G2147]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] there fell [[G2597]] upon [[G1909]] men [[G444]] a great [[G3173]] hail [[G5464]] out of [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] about [[G5613]] the weight of a talent: [[G5006]] and [[G2532]] men [[G444]] blasphemed [[G987]] God [[G2316]] because of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] plague [[G4127]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5464]] hail; [[G5464]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] plague [[G4127]] thereof [[G846]] was [[G2076]] exceeding [[G4970]] great.
