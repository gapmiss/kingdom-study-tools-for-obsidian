### 1
And [[G2532]] there was given [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] a reed [[G2563]] like unto [[G3664]] a rod: [[G4464]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] stood, [[G2476]] saying, [[G3004]] Rise, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] measure [[G3354]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] and [[G2532]] them that [[G3588]] worship [[G4352]] therein. [[G1722]]

### 2
But [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] court [[G833]] which is [[G3588]] without [[G1855]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] leave [[G1544]] out, [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] measure [[G3354]] it [[G846]] not; [[G3361]] for [[G3754]] it is given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1484]] Gentiles: [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city shall they tread under [[G4172]] foot [[G3961]] forty [[G5062]] two [[G1417]] months. [[G3376]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] I will give [[G1325]] unto [[G1417]] my [[G3450]] two [[G1417]] witnesses, [[G3144]] and [[G2532]] they shall prophesy [[G4395]] a thousand [[G5507]] two hundred [[G1250]] threescore [[G1835]] days, [[G2250]] clothed [[G4016]] in sackcloth. [[G4526]]

### 4
These [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] olive trees, [[G1636]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] candlesticks [[G3087]] standing [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] will [[G2309]] hurt [[G91]] them, [[G846]] fire [[G4442]] proceedeth [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] devoureth [[G2719]] their [[G846]] enemies: [[G2190]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] will [[G2309]] hurt [[G91]] them, [[G846]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] in this manner [[G3779]] be killed. [[G615]]

### 6
These [[G3778]] have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to shut [[G2808]] heaven, [[G3772]] that [[G2443]] it rain [[G1026]] not [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] the days [[G2250]] of their [[G846]] prophecy: [[G4394]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] waters [[G5204]] to turn [[G4762]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] blood, [[G129]] and [[G2532]] to smite [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] with all [[G3956]] plagues, [[G4127]] as often [[G3740]] as [[G1437]] they will. [[G2309]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] they shall have finished [[G5055]] their [[G846]] testimony, [[G3141]] the [[G3588]] beast that [[G2342]] ascendeth [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the bottomless [[G3588]] pit [[G12]] shall make [[G4160]] war [[G4171]] against [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] shall overcome [[G3528]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] kill [[G615]] them. [[G846]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] their [[G846]]  dead [[G3588]] bodies [[G4430]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] street [[G4113]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3173]] great [[G3173]] city, [[G4172]] which [[G3748]] spiritually [[G4153]] is called [[G2564]] Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] Egypt, [[G125]] where [[G3699]] also [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] was crucified. [[G4717]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] they of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] kindreds [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] tongues [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] nations [[G1484]] shall see [[G991]] their [[G846]]  dead [[G3588]] bodies [[G4430]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] an half, [[G2255]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G863]] suffer [[G863]] their [[G846]]  dead [[G3588]] bodies to be [[G4430]] put [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] graves. [[G3418]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that dwell [[G2730]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] shall rejoice [[G5463]] over [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] make merry, [[G2165]] and [[G2532]] shall send [[G3992]] gifts [[G1435]] one to another; [[G240]] because [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] two [[G1417]] prophets [[G4396]] tormented [[G928]] them [[G3588]] that dwelt [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] an half [[G2255]] the Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G1537]] life [[G2222]]  from [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they stood [[G2476]] upon [[G1909]] their [[G846]] feet; [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] fear [[G5401]] fell [[G4098]] upon [[G1909]] them [[G3588]] which saw [[G2334]] them. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] they heard [[G191]] a great [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] saying [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Come up [[G305]] hither. [[G5602]] And [[G2532]] they ascended up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] in [[G1722]]  a [[G3588]] cloud; [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] enemies [[G2190]] beheld [[G2334]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] the same [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]] was there [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] earthquake, [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] tenth part [[G1182]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city [[G4172]] fell, [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] earthquake were [[G4578]] slain [[G615]] of [[G3686]] men [[G444]] seven [[G2033]] thousand: [[G5505]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] remnant [[G3062]] were [[G1096]] affrighted, [[G1719]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] of [[G3772]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 14
The [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] woe [[G3759]] is past; [[G565]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] woe [[G3759]] cometh [[G2064]] quickly. [[G5035]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] angel [[G32]] sounded; [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] there were [[G1096]] great [[G3173]] voices [[G5456]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] kingdoms [[G932]] this [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world [[G2889]] are become [[G1096]] of our [[G2257]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] of his [[G846]] Christ; [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] he shall reign [[G936]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever. [[G165]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] and [[G2532]] twenty [[G1501]] elders, [[G4245]] which sat [[G2521]] before [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] seats, [[G2362]] fell [[G4098]] upon [[G1909]] their [[G846]] faces, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] worshipped [[G4352]] God, [[G2316]]

### 17
Saying, [[G3004]] We give [[G2168]] thee [[G4671]] thanks, [[G2168]] O Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty, [[G3841]] which art, [[G5607]] and [[G2532]] wast, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] art to come; [[G2064]] because [[G3754]] thou hast taken to thee [[G2983]] thy [[G4675]] great [[G3173]] power, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] hast reigned. [[G936]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] were angry, [[G3710]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] wrath is [[G3709]] come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] time of [[G2540]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] that they should be judged, [[G2919]] and [[G2532]] that thou shouldest give [[G1325]] reward [[G3408]] unto thy [[G4675]] servants [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G40]] saints, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] them [[G3588]] that fear [[G5399]] thy [[G4675]] name, [[G3686]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great; [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] shouldest destroy [[G1311]] them [[G3588]] which destroy [[G1311]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] was opened [[G455]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] there was seen [[G3700]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] temple [[G3485]] the [[G3588]] ark [[G2787]] of his [[G846]] testament: [[G1242]] and [[G2532]] there were [[G1096]] lightnings, [[G796]] and [[G2532]] voices, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] thunderings, [[G1027]] and [[G2532]] an earthquake, [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] hail.
