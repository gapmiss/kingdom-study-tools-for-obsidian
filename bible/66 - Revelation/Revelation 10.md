### 1
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] another [[G243]] mighty [[G2478]] angel [[G32]] come down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] clothed with [[G4016]] a cloud: [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] a rainbow [[G2463]] upon [[G1909]]  his [[G3588]] head, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] face [[G4383]] as it were [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] as [[G5613]] pillars [[G4769]] of fire: [[G4442]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he had [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hand little [[G5495]] a [[G3588]] book [[G974]] open: [[G455]] and [[G2532]] he set [[G5087]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] foot [[G4228]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G1161]] left [[G2176]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] cried [[G2896]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] as [[G5618]] a lion [[G3023]] roareth: [[G3455]] and [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he had cried, [[G2896]] seven [[G2033]] thunders [[G1027]] uttered [[G2980]] their [[G1438]] voices. [[G5456]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] thunders [[G1027]] had uttered [[G2980]] their [[G1438]] voices, [[G5456]] I was about [[G3195]] to write: [[G1125]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] saying [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Seal up [[G4972]] those things which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] thunders [[G1027]] uttered, [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] write [[G1125]] them [[G5023]] not. [[G3361]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] which [[G3739]] I saw [[G1492]] stand [[G2476]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] lifted up [[G142]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] sware [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] him that [[G3588]] liveth [[G2198]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever, [[G165]] who [[G3739]] created [[G2936]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the things that [[G3588]] therein are, [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the things that [[G3588]] therein are, [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] the things which [[G3588]] are therein, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] there should be [[G2071]] time [[G5550]] no [[G3756]] longer: [[G2089]]

### 7
But [[G235]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] of of [[G5456]] voice [[G5456]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] angel, [[G32]] when [[G3752]] he shall begin [[G3195]] to sound, [[G4537]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] should be finished, [[G5055]] as [[G5613]] he hath declared [[G2097]] to his [[G1438]] servants [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] which [[G3739]] I heard [[G191]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] spake [[G2980]] unto [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] again, [[G3825]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] Go [[G5217]] take [[G2983]] the little [[G3588]] book [[G974]] which [[G3588]] is open [[G455]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] of the angel [[G32]] which [[G3588]] standeth [[G2476]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] I went [[G565]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] angel, [[G32]] and said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Give [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] the [[G3588]] little book. [[G974]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Take [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] eat up; [[G2719]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] it shall make [[G4087]] thy [[G4675]]  belly bitter, [[G3588]] but [[G235]] it shall be [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] mouth [[G4750]] sweet [[G1099]] as [[G5613]] honey. [[G3192]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] I took [[G2983]] the little [[G3588]] book [[G974]] out [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] of [[G32]] angel's [[G32]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] ate up; [[G2719]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] it was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] mouth [[G4750]] sweet [[G1099]] as [[G5613]] honey: [[G3192]] and [[G2532]] as soon as [[G3753]] I had eaten [[G5315]] it, [[G846]] my [[G3450]] belly [[G2836]] was bitter. [[G4087]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Thou [[G4571]] must [[G1163]] prophesy [[G4395]] again [[G3825]] before [[G1909]] many [[G4183]] peoples, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] nations, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] tongues, [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] kings. [[G935]]
