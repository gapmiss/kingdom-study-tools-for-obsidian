### 1
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] I saw [[G1492]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] come down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] having [[G2192]] great [[G3173]] power; [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth was [[G1093]] lightened [[G5461]] with [[G1537]] his [[G846]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he cried [[G2896]] mightily [[G2479]] with [[G1722]] a strong [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] saying, [[G3004]] Babylon [[G897]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] is fallen, [[G4098]] is fallen, [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] is become [[G1096]] the habitation [[G2732]] of devils, [[G1142]] and [[G2532]] the hold [[G5438]] of every [[G3956]] foul [[G169]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] a cage [[G5438]] of every [[G3956]] unclean [[G169]] and [[G2532]] hateful [[G3404]] bird. [[G3732]]

### 3
For [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] have drunk [[G4095]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2372]] wrath [[G2372]] of her [[G846]] fornication, [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of have committed [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] fornication [[G4203]] with [[G3326]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] merchants [[G1713]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] are waxed rich [[G4147]] through [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] abundance [[G1411]] of [[G4764]] her [[G846]] delicacies. [[G4764]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] another [[G243]] voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] saying, [[G3004]] Come [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] her, [[G846]] my [[G3450]] people, [[G2992]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] ye be [[G4790]] partakers [[G4790]] of her [[G846]] sins, [[G266]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] ye receive [[G2983]] not [[G3361]] of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] plagues. [[G4127]]

### 5
For [[G3754]] her [[G846]] sins [[G266]] have reached [[G190]] unto [[G891]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] hath remembered [[G3421]] her [[G846]] iniquities. [[G92]]

### 6
Reward [[G591]] her [[G846]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] she [[G846]] rewarded [[G591]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] double [[G1363]] unto her [[G846]] double [[G1362]] according to [[G2596]] her [[G846]] works: [[G2041]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] which [[G3739]] filled [[G2767]] she hath [[G2767]] fill [[G2767]] to her [[G846]] double. [[G1362]]

### 7
How much [[G3745]] she hath glorified [[G1392]] herself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] lived deliciously, [[G4763]] so much [[G5118]] torment [[G929]] and [[G2532]] sorrow [[G3997]] give [[G1325]] her: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] she saith [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] I sit [[G2521]] a queen, [[G938]] and [[G2532]] am [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] widow, [[G5503]] and [[G2532]] shall see [[G1492]] no [[G3756]] sorrow. [[G3997]]

### 8
Therefore [[G1223]] shall [[G2240]] her [[G846]] plagues [[G4127]] come [[G2240]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] day, [[G2250]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] mourning, [[G3997]] and [[G2532]] famine; [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] she shall be utterly burned [[G2618]] with [[G1722]] fire: [[G4442]] for [[G3754]] strong [[G2478]] the Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] judgeth [[G2919]] her. [[G846]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] who [[G3588]] have committed fornication [[G4203]] and [[G2532]] lived deliciously [[G4763]] with [[G3326]] her, [[G846]] shall bewail [[G2799]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] lament [[G2875]] for [[G1909]] her, [[G846]] when [[G3752]] they shall see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] smoke [[G2586]] of her [[G846]] burning, [[G4451]]

### 10
Standing [[G2476]] afar [[G3113]] off [[G575]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] fear [[G5401]] of her [[G846]] torment, [[G929]] saying, [[G3004]] Alas, [[G3759]] alas, [[G3759]] that [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] city [[G4172]] Babylon, [[G897]] that [[G3588]] mighty [[G2478]] city! [[G4172]] for [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] is thy [[G4675]] judgment [[G2920]] come. [[G2064]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] merchants [[G1713]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] shall weep [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] mourn [[G3996]] over [[G1909]] her; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] no man [[G3762]] buyeth [[G59]] their [[G846]] merchandise [[G1117]] any more: [[G3765]]

### 12
The merchandise [[G1117]] of gold, [[G5557]] and [[G2532]] silver, [[G696]] and [[G2532]] precious [[G5093]] stones, [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] of pearls, [[G3135]] and [[G2532]] fine linen, [[G1040]] and [[G2532]] purple, [[G4209]] and [[G2532]] silk, [[G4596]] and [[G2532]] scarlet, [[G2847]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] thyine [[G2367]] wood, [[G3586]] and [[G2532]] all manner [[G3956]] vessels [[G4632]] of ivory, [[G1661]] and [[G2532]] all manner [[G3956]] vessels [[G4632]] of [[G1537]] most precious [[G5093]] wood, [[G3586]] and [[G2532]] of brass, [[G5475]] and [[G2532]] iron, [[G4604]] and [[G2532]] marble, [[G3139]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] cinnamon, [[G2792]] and [[G2532]] odours, [[G2368]] and [[G2532]] ointments, [[G3464]] and [[G2532]] frankincense, [[G3030]] and [[G2532]] wine, [[G3631]] and [[G2532]] oil, [[G1637]] and [[G2532]] fine flour, [[G4585]] and [[G2532]] wheat, [[G4621]] and [[G2532]] beasts, [[G2934]] and [[G2532]] sheep, [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] horses, [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] chariots, [[G4480]] and [[G2532]] slaves, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] souls [[G5590]] of men. [[G444]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fruits [[G3703]] that thy [[G4675]] soul [[G5590]] lusted after [[G1939]] are departed [[G565]] from [[G575]] thee, [[G4675]] and [[G2532]] all things [[G3956]] which were dainty [[G3045]] and [[G2532]] goodly [[G2986]] are departed [[G565]] from [[G575]] thee, [[G4675]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt find [[G2147]] them [[G846]] no more [[G3765]]  at all.

### 15
The [[G3588]] merchants [[G1713]] of these things, [[G5130]] which [[G3588]] were made rich [[G4147]] by [[G575]] her, [[G846]] shall stand [[G2476]] afar [[G3113]] off [[G575]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] fear [[G5401]] of her [[G846]] torment, [[G929]] weeping [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] wailing, [[G3996]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Alas, [[G3759]] alas, [[G3759]] that great [[G3173]] city, [[G4172]] that was clothed [[G4016]] in fine linen, [[G1039]] and [[G2532]] purple, [[G4210]] and [[G2532]] scarlet, [[G2847]] and [[G2532]] decked [[G5558]] with [[G1722]] gold, [[G5557]] and [[G2532]] precious [[G5093]] stones, [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] pearls! [[G3135]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] in one [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] so great [[G5118]] riches [[G4149]] is come to nought.

[[G5094]] for [[G3754]] in one [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] is she made desolate. [[G2049]]

### 20
Rejoice [[G2165]] over [[G1909]] her, [[G846]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] holy [[G40]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] prophets; [[G4396]] for [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] hath [[G2919]] avenged [[G2917]] you [[G5216]] on [[G1537]] her. [[G846]]

### 21

[[G3361]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] the voice [[G5456]] of harpers, [[G2790]] and [[G2532]] musicians, [[G3451]] and [[G2532]] of pipers, [[G834]] and [[G2532]] trumpeters, [[G4538]] shall be heard [[G191]] no [[G3756]] more [[G2089]]  at all [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] thee; [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3956]] craftsman, [[G5079]] of whatsoever [[G3956]] craft [[G5078]] shall be found [[G2147]] any [[G3756]] more [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] thee; [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] the sound [[G5456]] of a millstone [[G3458]] shall be heard [[G191]] no [[G3756]] more [[G2089]]  at all [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] thee; [[G4671]]

[[G4105]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] was found [[G2147]] the blood [[G129]] of prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] of saints, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] of all [[G3956]] that were slain [[G4969]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]
