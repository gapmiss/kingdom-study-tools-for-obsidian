After [[G3326]] this [[G5023]] I beheld, [[G1492]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] a great [[G4183]] multitude, [[G3793]] which [[G3739]] no [[G3762]] man [[G846]] could [[G1410]] number, [[G705]] of [[G1537]] all [[G3956]] nations, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kindreds, [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] tongues, [[G1100]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lamb, [[G721]] clothed [[G4016]] with white [[G3022]] robes, [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] palms [[G5404]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hands; [[G5495]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] cried [[G2896]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] saying, [[G3004]] Salvation [[G4991]] to our [[G2257]] God [[G2316]] which [[G3588]] sitteth [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G721]] Lamb. [[G721]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] stood [[G2476]] round about [[G2945]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] beasts, [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] fell [[G4098]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] faces, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] worshipped [[G4352]] God, [[G2316]]

### 12
Saying, [[G3004]] Amen: [[G281]] Blessing, [[G2129]] and [[G2532]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] wisdom, [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] thanksgiving, [[G2169]] and [[G2532]] honour, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] power, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] might, [[G2479]] unto our [[G2257]] God for [[G2316]] ever [[G3588]] and ever. [[G1519]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] answered, [[G611]] saying [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] What are these [[G3778]] which [[G5101]] are [[G1526]] arrayed [[G4016]] in white [[G3022]] robes? [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] whence they? [[G4159]] came [[G2064]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] I said [[G2046]] unto him, [[G846]] Sir, [[G2962]] thou [[G4771]] knowest. [[G1492]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] to me, [[G3427]] These [[G3778]] are [[G1526]] they which [[G3588]] came [[G2064]] out [[G1537]] of [[G3173]] great [[G3173]] tribulation, [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] have washed [[G4150]] their [[G846]] robes, [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] made white [[G3021]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G721]] Lamb. [[G721]]

### 15
Therefore [[G1223]] are they [[G1526]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] serve [[G3000]] him [[G846]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] temple: [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that sitteth [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] shall dwell [[G4637]] among [[G1909]] them. [[G846]]

### 16
They shall hunger [[G3983]] no [[G3756]] more, [[G2089]] neither [[G3761]] thirst [[G1372]] any [[G3361]] more; [[G2089]] neither [[G3761]] shall [[G4098]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] light [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] nor [[G3761]] any [[G3956]] heat. [[G2738]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G303]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2362]] throne [[G2362]] shall feed [[G4165]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] shall lead [[G3594]] them [[G846]] unto [[G1909]] living [[G2198]] fountains [[G4077]] of waters: [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] shall wipe away [[G1813]] all [[G3956]] tears [[G1144]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]]
