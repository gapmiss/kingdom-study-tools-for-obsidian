### 1
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] a new [[G2537]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] a new [[G2537]] earth: [[G1093]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] earth [[G1093]] were passed away; [[G3928]] and [[G2532]] there was [[G2076]] no [[G3756]] more [[G2089]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] John [[G2491]] saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city, [[G4172]] new [[G2537]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] coming down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] out of [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] prepared [[G2090]] as [[G5613]] a bride [[G3565]] adorned [[G2885]] for her [[G846]] husband. [[G435]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a great [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] out of [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] saying, [[G3004]] Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle [[G4633]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] with [[G3326]] men, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] he will dwell [[G4637]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] shall be [[G2071]] his [[G846]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] himself [[G846]] shall be [[G2071]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] their [[G846]] God. [[G2316]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] shall wipe away [[G1813]] all [[G3956]] tears [[G1144]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] eyes; [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] there shall be [[G2071]] no [[G3756]] more [[G2089]] death, [[G2288]] neither [[G3777]] sorrow, [[G3997]] nor [[G3777]] crying, [[G2906]] neither [[G3777]] shall there be [[G2071]] any more [[G2089]] pain: [[G4192]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] former things [[G4413]] are passed away. [[G565]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] said, [[G2036]] Behold, [[G2400]] I make [[G4160]] all things [[G3956]] new. [[G2537]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Write: [[G1125]] for [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] words [[G3056]] are [[G1526]] true [[G228]] and [[G2532]] faithful. [[G4103]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto me, [[G3427]] It is done. [[G1096]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Alpha [[G1]] and [[G2532]] Omega, [[G5598]] the [[G3588]] beginning [[G746]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] end. [[G5056]] I [[G1473]] will give [[G1325]] him [[G3588]] unto that is [[G1372]] athirst [[G1372]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fountain [[G4077]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5204]] water [[G5204]] of [[G2222]] life [[G2222]] freely. [[G1432]]

### 7
He [[G3588]] that overcometh [[G3528]] shall inherit [[G2816]] all things; [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] I will be [[G2071]] his [[G846]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] shall be [[G2071]] my [[G3427]] son. [[G5207]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] the fearful, [[G1169]] and [[G2532]] unbelieving, [[G571]] and [[G2532]] the abominable, [[G948]] and [[G2532]] murderers, [[G5406]] and [[G2532]] whoremongers, [[G4205]] and [[G2532]] sorcerers, [[G5332]] and [[G2532]] idolaters, [[G1496]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] liars, [[G5571]] shall have their [[G846]] part [[G3313]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] which [[G3588]] burneth [[G2545]] with fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] brimstone: [[G2303]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the second [[G1208]] death. [[G2288]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] there came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me [[G3165]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2033]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] which had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] vials [[G5357]] full [[G1073]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2033]] seven [[G2033]] last [[G2078]] plagues, [[G4127]] and [[G2532]] talked [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] me, [[G1700]] saying, [[G3004]] Come hither, [[G1204]] I will shew [[G1166]] thee [[G4671]] the [[G3588]] bride, [[G3565]] the [[G3588]] Lamb's [[G721]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] he carried away [[G667]] me [[G3165]] in [[G1722]] the spirit [[G4151]] to [[G1909]] a great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] high [[G5308]] mountain, [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] shewed [[G1166]] me [[G3427]] that great [[G3173]] city, [[G4172]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] descending [[G2597]] out of [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] from [[G575]] God, [[G2316]]

### 11
Having [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] light [[G5458]] like unto [[G3664]] a stone [[G3037]] most precious, [[G5093]] even like [[G5613]] a jasper [[G2393]] stone, [[G3037]] clear as crystal; [[G2929]]

### 12
And [[G5037]] had [[G2192]] a wall [[G5038]] great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] high, [[G5308]] had [[G2192]] twelve [[G1427]] gates, [[G4440]] and [[G2532]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] gates [[G4440]] twelve [[G1427]] angels, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] names [[G3686]] written thereon, [[G1924]] which [[G3739]] are [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve [[G1427]] tribes [[G5443]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] children [[G5207]] of Israel: [[G2474]]

### 13
On [[G575]] the east [[G395]] three [[G5140]] gates; [[G4440]] on [[G575]] the north [[G1005]] three [[G5140]] gates; [[G4440]] on [[G575]] the south [[G3558]] three [[G5140]] gates; [[G4440]] and on [[G575]] the west [[G1424]] three [[G5140]] gates. [[G4440]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wall [[G5038]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city [[G4172]] had [[G2192]] twelve [[G1427]] foundations, [[G2310]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] them [[G846]] the names [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve [[G1427]] apostles [[G652]] the [[G3588]] of [[G721]] Lamb. [[G721]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that talked [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] had [[G2192]] a golden [[G5552]] reed [[G2563]] to [[G2443]] measure [[G3354]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gates [[G4440]] thereof, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wall [[G5038]] thereof. [[G846]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] lieth [[G2749]] foursquare, [[G5068]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] length [[G3372]] is [[G2076]] as large [[G5118]] as [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] breadth: [[G4114]] and [[G2532]] he measured [[G3354]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] with the [[G3588]] reed, [[G2563]] twelve [[G1427]] thousand [[G5505]] furlongs. [[G4712]] The [[G3588]] length [[G3372]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] breadth [[G4114]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] height [[G5311]] of it [[G846]] are [[G2076]] equal. [[G2470]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he measured [[G3354]] the [[G3588]] wall [[G5038]] thereof, [[G846]] an hundred [[G1540]] forty [[G5062]] four [[G5064]] cubits, [[G4083]] the measure [[G3358]] of a man, [[G444]] that [[G3739]] is, [[G2076]] of the angel. [[G32]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] building [[G1739]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5038]] wall [[G5038]] of it [[G846]] was [[G2258]] jasper: [[G2393]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] pure [[G2513]] gold, [[G5553]] like unto [[G3664]] clear [[G2513]] glass. [[G5194]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] foundations [[G2310]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5038]] wall [[G5038]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city [[G4172]] garnished [[G2885]] with all manner [[G3956]] of precious [[G5093]] stones.

[[G271]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] gates [[G4440]] twelve [[G1427]] pearls; [[G3135]] every [[G1538]] several [[G303]] gate [[G4440]] was [[G2258]] of [[G1537]] one [[G1520]] pearl: [[G3135]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] street [[G4113]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city [[G4172]] pure [[G2513]] gold, [[G5553]] as it were [[G5613]] transparent [[G1307]] glass. [[G5194]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] no [[G3756]] temple [[G3485]] therein: [[G1722]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty [[G3841]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] are [[G2076]] the temple [[G3485]] of it. [[G846]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] had [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2246]] sun, [[G2246]] neither [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4582]] moon, [[G4582]] to [[G2443]] shine [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] it: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] did lighten [[G5461]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] the [[G3588]] light [[G3088]] thereof. [[G846]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] them [[G3588]] of which are [[G4982]] saved [[G4982]] shall walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of it: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] do bring [[G5342]] their [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honour [[G5092]] into [[G1519]] it. [[G846]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gates [[G4440]] of it [[G846]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G2808]] shut [[G2808]]  at all [[G3361]] by day: [[G2250]] for [[G1063]] there shall be [[G2071]] no [[G3756]] night [[G3571]] there. [[G1563]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] they shall bring [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honour [[G5092]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] nations [[G1484]] into [[G1519]] it. [[G846]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] in no wise [[G3756]] there shall [[G1525]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] it [[G846]] any thing [[G3956]] that defileth, [[G2840]] neither [[G2532]] worketh [[G4160]] abomination, [[G946]] or [[G2532]] a lie: [[G5579]] but [[G1487]] they [[G3588]] which are written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Lamb's [[G721]] book [[G975]] of [[G2222]] life.
