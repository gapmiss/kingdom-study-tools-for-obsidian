### 1
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he had opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] seventh [[G1442]] seal, [[G4973]] there was [[G1096]] silence [[G4602]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] about [[G5613]] the space of half an hour. [[G2256]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] which [[G3739]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] to them [[G846]] were given [[G1325]] seven [[G2033]] trumpets. [[G4536]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] stood [[G2476]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] having [[G2192]] a golden [[G5552]] censer; [[G3031]] and [[G2532]] there was given [[G1325]] unto him [[G846]] much [[G4183]] incense, [[G2368]] that [[G2443]] he should offer [[G1325]] with the [[G3588]] prayers of [[G4335]] all [[G3956]] saints [[G40]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] golden [[G5552]] altar [[G2379]] which [[G3588]] was [[G1799]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne. [[G2362]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] smoke [[G2586]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2368]] incense, [[G2368]] with the [[G3588]] prayers of [[G4335]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] ascended up [[G305]] before [[G1799]] God out [[G2316]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] angel's [[G32]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] censer, [[G3031]] and [[G2532]] filled [[G1072]] it [[G846]] with [[G4442]] fire [[G4442]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] there were [[G1096]] voices, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] thunderings, [[G1027]] and [[G2532]] lightnings, [[G796]] and [[G2532]] an earthquake. [[G4578]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] which had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] trumpets [[G4536]] prepared [[G2090]] themselves [[G1438]] to [[G2443]] sound. [[G4537]]

### 7
The [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] angel [[G32]] sounded, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] there followed [[G1096]] hail [[G5464]] and [[G2532]] fire [[G4442]] mingled [[G3396]] with blood, [[G129]] and [[G2532]] they were cast [[G906]] upon [[G1519]] the of [[G3588]] earth: [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] trees [[G1186]] was burnt up, [[G2618]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] green [[G5515]] grass [[G5528]] was burnt up. [[G2618]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] angel [[G32]] sounded, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] as it were [[G5613]] a great [[G3173]] mountain [[G3735]] burning [[G2545]] with fire [[G4442]] was cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea: [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2281]] sea [[G2281]] became [[G1096]] blood; [[G129]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2938]] creatures [[G2938]] which [[G3588]] were in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2192]] had [[G2192]] life, [[G5590]] died; [[G599]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4143]] ships [[G4143]] were destroyed. [[G1311]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] angel [[G32]] sounded, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] there fell [[G4098]] a great [[G3173]] star [[G792]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] burning [[G2545]] as it were [[G5613]] a lamp, [[G2985]] and [[G2532]] it fell [[G4098]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4215]] rivers, [[G4215]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] fountains [[G4077]] of waters; [[G5204]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] the [[G3588]] of [[G792]] star [[G792]] is called [[G3004]] Wormwood: [[G894]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5204]] waters [[G5204]] became [[G1096]] wormwood; [[G894]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] men [[G444]] died [[G599]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] waters, [[G5204]] because [[G3754]] they were made bitter. [[G4087]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] angel [[G32]] sounded, [[G4537]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2246]] sun [[G2246]] was smitten, [[G4141]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4582]] moon, [[G4582]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] the [[G3588]] of [[G792]] stars; [[G792]] so as [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] of them [[G846]] was darkened, [[G4654]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] shone for [[G5316]] not [[G3361]] a [[G3588]] third part [[G5154]] of it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] likewise. [[G3668]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] I beheld, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] an [[G1520]] angel [[G32]] flying [[G4072]] through [[G1722]] the midst of heaven, [[G3321]] saying [[G3004]] with [[G5456]] a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] Woe, [[G3759]] woe, [[G3759]] woe, [[G3759]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2730]] inhabiters [[G2730]] of [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] by reason [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3062]] other [[G3062]] voices [[G5456]] the [[G3588]] of of [[G4536]] trumpet [[G4536]] the [[G3588]] three [[G5140]] angels, [[G32]] which [[G3588]] are yet [[G3195]] to sound!
