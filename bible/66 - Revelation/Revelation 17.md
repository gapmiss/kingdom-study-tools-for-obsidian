### 1
And [[G2532]] there came [[G2064]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] which [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] vials, [[G5357]] and [[G2532]] talked [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] me, [[G1700]] saying [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Come hither; [[G1204]] I will shew [[G1166]] unto thee [[G4671]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2917]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3173]] great [[G3173]] whore [[G4204]] that [[G3588]] sitteth [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] many [[G4183]] waters: [[G5204]]

### 2
With [[G3326]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of have committed [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] fornication, [[G4203]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] inhabitants [[G2730]] the [[G3588]] of have been made [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] drunk [[G3184]] with [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] of her [[G846]] fornication. [[G4202]]

### 3
So [[G2532]] he carried away [[G667]] me [[G3165]] in [[G1722]] the spirit [[G4151]] into [[G1519]] the wilderness: [[G2048]] and [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] a woman [[G1135]] sit [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] a scarlet coloured [[G2847]] beast, [[G2342]] full [[G1073]] of names [[G3686]] of blasphemy, [[G988]] having [[G2192]] seven [[G2033]] heads [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] ten [[G1176]] horns. [[G2768]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] woman in [[G1135]] was [[G2258]] arrayed [[G4016]] purple [[G4209]] and [[G2532]] scarlet colour, [[G2847]] and [[G2532]] decked [[G5558]] with gold [[G5557]] and [[G2532]] precious [[G5093]] stones [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] pearls, [[G3135]] having [[G2192]] a golden [[G5552]] cup [[G4221]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] full [[G1073]] of abominations [[G946]] and [[G2532]] filthiness [[G168]] of her [[G846]] fornication: [[G4202]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] her [[G846]] forehead [[G3359]] a name [[G3686]] written, [[G1125]] MYSTERY, [[G3466]] BABYLON [[G897]] THE [[G3588]] GREAT, [[G3173]] THE [[G3588]] MOTHER [[G3384]] OF [[G4204]] HARLOTS [[G4204]] AND [[G2532]] ABOMINATIONS [[G946]] THE [[G3588]] OF [[G1093]] EARTH. [[G1093]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] drunken [[G3184]] with [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] blood of [[G129]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3144]] martyrs [[G3144]] of Jesus: [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] when I saw [[G1492]] her, [[G846]] I wondered [[G2296]] with great [[G3173]] admiration. [[G2295]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] said unto [[G2036]] me, [[G3427]] Wherefore [[G1302]] didst thou marvel? [[G2296]] I [[G1473]] will tell [[G2046]] thee [[G4671]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1135]] woman, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2342]] beast [[G2342]] carrieth [[G941]] her, [[G846]] which [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] heads [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] ten [[G1176]] horns. [[G2768]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] that [[G3739]] thou sawest [[G1492]] was, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] not; [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] shall [[G3195]] ascend [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] bottomless pit, [[G12]] and [[G2532]] go [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] perdition: [[G684]] and [[G2532]] they that [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] shall wonder, [[G2296]] whose [[G3739]] names [[G3686]] not [[G3756]] were [[G1125]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] book [[G975]] of life [[G2222]] from [[G575]] the foundation [[G2602]] of the world, [[G2889]] when they behold [[G991]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] that [[G3739]] was, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] not, [[G3756]] and yet [[G2539]] is. [[G2076]]

### 9
And here [[G5602]] the [[G3588]] mind [[G3563]] which [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] wisdom. [[G4678]] The [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] heads [[G2776]] are [[G1526]] seven [[G2033]] mountains, [[G3735]] on [[G1909]] which [[G846]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] sitteth. [[G2521]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] there are [[G1526]] seven [[G2033]] kings: [[G935]] five [[G4002]] are fallen, [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] is, [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] is not yet [[G3768]] come; [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] he [[G846]] cometh, [[G2064]] he must [[G1163]] continue [[G3306]] a short space. [[G3641]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] that [[G3739]] was, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] not, [[G3756]] even [[G2532]] he [[G846]] is [[G2076]] the eighth, [[G3590]] and [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] seven, [[G2033]] and [[G2532]] goeth [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] perdition. [[G684]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ten [[G1176]] horns [[G2768]] which [[G3739]] thou sawest [[G1492]] are [[G1526]] ten [[G1176]] kings, [[G935]] which [[G3748]] have received [[G2983]] no as yet; [[G3768]] kingdom [[G932]] but [[G235]] receive [[G2983]] power [[G1849]] as [[G5613]] kings [[G935]] one [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] beast. [[G2342]]

### 13
These [[G3778]] have [[G2192]] one [[G1520]] mind, [[G1106]] and [[G2532]] shall give [[G1239]] their [[G1438]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] strength unto [[G1849]] the [[G3588]] beast. [[G2342]]

### 14
These [[G3778]] shall make war [[G4170]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Lamb, [[G721]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] shall overcome [[G3528]] them: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] Lord [[G2962]] of lords, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] King [[G935]] of kings: [[G935]] and [[G2532]] they that are [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] called, [[G2822]] and [[G2532]] chosen, [[G1588]] and [[G2532]] faithful. [[G4103]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he saith [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] The [[G3588]] waters [[G5204]] which [[G3739]] thou sawest, [[G1492]] where [[G3757]] the [[G3588]] whore [[G4204]] sitteth, [[G2521]] are [[G1526]] peoples, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] multitudes, [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] nations, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] tongues. [[G1100]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ten [[G1176]] horns [[G2768]] which [[G3739]] thou sawest [[G1492]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] these [[G3778]] shall hate [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] whore, [[G4204]] and [[G2532]] shall make [[G4160]] her [[G846]] desolate [[G2049]] and [[G2532]] naked, [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] shall eat [[G5315]] her [[G846]] flesh, [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] burn [[G2618]] her [[G846]] with [[G1722]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] hath put [[G1325]] in [[G1519]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] to fulfil [[G4160]] his [[G846]] will, [[G1106]] and [[G2532]] to agree, [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] their [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2342]] beast, [[G2342]] until [[G891]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] of shall be [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] fulfilled. [[G5055]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] which [[G3739]] thou sawest [[G1492]] is [[G2076]] that great [[G3173]] city, [[G4172]] which [[G2192]] reigneth [[G932]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth. [[G1093]]
