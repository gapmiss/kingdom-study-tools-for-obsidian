### 1
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] another [[G243]] sign [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] marvellous, [[G2298]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] having [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] last [[G2078]] plagues; [[G4127]] for [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] them [[G846]] is filled up [[G5055]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G2372]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] as it were [[G5613]] a sea [[G2281]] of glass [[G5193]] mingled [[G3396]] with fire: [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] them that [[G3588]] had gotten the victory [[G3528]] over [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] over [[G1537]] his [[G846]] image, [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] over [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mark, [[G5480]] over [[G1537]] the of [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of his [[G846]] name, [[G3686]] stand [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea of [[G2281]] glass, [[G5193]] having [[G2192]] the harps [[G2788]] God. [[G2316]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] they sing [[G103]] the [[G3588]] song [[G5603]] of Moses [[G3475]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] song [[G5603]] the [[G3588]] of [[G721]] Lamb, [[G721]] saying, [[G3004]] Great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] marvellous [[G2298]] thy [[G4675]] works, [[G2041]] Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] Almighty; [[G3841]] just [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] true [[G228]] thy [[G4675]] ways, [[G3598]] thou King [[G935]] of [[G40]] saints. [[G40]]

### 4
Who [[G5101]] shall [[G5399]] not [[G3361]] fear [[G5399]] thee, [[G4571]] O Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] glorify [[G1392]] thy [[G4675]] name? [[G3686]] for [[G3754]] only [[G3441]] holy: [[G3741]] for [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] shall come [[G2240]] and [[G2532]] worship [[G4352]] before [[G1799]] thee; [[G4675]] for [[G3754]] thy [[G4675]] judgments are made [[G1345]] manifest. [[G5319]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] that [[G5023]] I looked, [[G1492]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4633]] tabernacle [[G4633]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3142]] testimony [[G3142]] in [[G1722]] heaven was [[G3772]] opened: [[G455]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] came [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] having [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] plagues, [[G4127]] clothed in [[G1746]] pure [[G2513]] and [[G2532]] white [[G2986]] linen, [[G3043]] and [[G2532]] having their [[G4012]] breasts [[G4738]] girded [[G4024]] with golden [[G5552]] girdles. [[G2223]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] beasts [[G2226]] gave [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2033]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] seven [[G2033]] golden [[G5552]] vials [[G5357]] full [[G1073]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2372]] wrath [[G2372]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] who liveth [[G2198]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever. [[G165]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] was filled [[G1072]] with smoke [[G2586]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] power; [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] was able [[G1410]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] till [[G891]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] plagues [[G4127]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2033]] seven [[G2033]] angels [[G32]] were fulfilled.
