### 3
Blessed [[G3107]] he [[G3588]] that readeth, [[G314]] and [[G2532]] they that hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]]  of this [[G3588]] prophecy, [[G4394]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G5083]] those things which are written [[G1125]] therein: [[G1722]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] at hand. [[G1451]]

### 4
John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1577]] seven [[G2033]] churches [[G1577]] which [[G3588]] are [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Asia: [[G773]] Grace [[G5485]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] peace, [[G1515]] from [[G575]] him [[G3588]] which [[G3588]] is, [[G5607]] and [[G2532]] which [[G3588]] was, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] which [[G3588]] is to come; [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] Spirits [[G4151]] which [[G3739]] are [[G2076]] before [[G1799]] his [[G846]] throne; [[G2362]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] from [[G575]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] witness, [[G3144]] the [[G3588]] first begotten [[G4416]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G935]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth. [[G1093]] him [[G3588]] Unto that [[G25]] loved [[G25]] us, [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] washed [[G3068]] us [[G2248]] from [[G575]] our [[G2257]] sins [[G266]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] blood, [[G129]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] hath made [[G4160]] us [[G2248]] kings [[G935]] and [[G2532]] priests [[G2409]] unto [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] Father; [[G3962]] to him [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] dominion [[G2904]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G3588]]  and ever. [[G3588]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 7
Behold, [[G2400]] he cometh [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] clouds; [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] eye [[G3788]] shall see [[G3700]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they which [[G3748]] pierced [[G1574]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] kindreds [[G5443]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth [[G1093]] shall wail [[G2875]] because of [[G1909]] him. [[G846]] Even so, [[G3483]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 8
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Alpha [[G1]] and [[G2532]] Omega, [[G5598]] the [[G3588]] beginning [[G746]] and [[G2532]] the ending, [[G5056]] saith [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] which [[G3588]] is, [[G5607]] and [[G2532]] which [[G3588]] was, [[G2258]] and [[G2532]] which [[G3588]] is to come, [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] Almighty. [[G3841]]

### 9
I [[G1473]] John, [[G2491]] who am [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] brother, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] companion [[G4791]] in [[G1722]] tribulation, [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] and [[G2532]] patience [[G5281]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] isle [[G3520]] that is [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] Patmos, [[G3963]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 10
I was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the Spirit [[G4151]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Lord's [[G2960]] day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] heard [[G191]] behind [[G3694]] me [[G3450]] a [[G5456]] great [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] as [[G5613]] of a trumpet, [[G4536]]

### 11
Saying, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Alpha [[G1]] and [[G2532]] Omega, [[G5598]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last: [[G2078]] and, [[G2532]] What [[G3739]] thou seest, [[G991]] write [[G1125]] in [[G1519]] a book, [[G975]] and [[G2532]] send [[G3992]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1577]] seven [[G2033]] churches [[G1577]] which [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] Asia; [[G773]] unto [[G1519]] Ephesus, [[G2181]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] Smyrna, [[G4667]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] Pergamos, [[G4010]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] Thyatira, [[G2363]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] Sardis, [[G4554]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] Philadelphia, [[G5359]] and [[G2532]] unto [[G1519]] Laodicea. [[G2993]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] I turned [[G1994]] to see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] that [[G3748]] spake [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] me. [[G1700]] And [[G2532]] being turned, [[G1994]] I saw [[G1492]] seven [[G2033]] golden [[G5552]] candlesticks; [[G3087]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3087]] seven [[G2033]] candlesticks [[G3087]] like [[G3664]] unto the [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of man, [[G444]] clothed [[G1746]] with a garment down to the [[G4158]] foot, [[G4158]] and [[G2532]] girt [[G4024]] about [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] paps [[G3149]] with a [[G2223]] golden [[G5552]] girdle. [[G2223]]

### 14
His [[G846]] head [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] hairs [[G2359]] white [[G3022]] like [[G5616]] wool, [[G2053]] white [[G3022]] as [[G5613]] as [[G5613]] snow; [[G5510]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] as [[G5613]] a flame [[G5395]] of fire; [[G4442]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] like [[G3664]] unto fine [[G5474]] brass, [[G5474]] as if [[G5613]] they burned [[G4448]] in [[G1722]] a furnace; [[G2575]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] voice [[G5456]] as [[G5613]] the sound [[G5456]] of [[G5204]] many [[G4183]] waters. [[G5204]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he had [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] seven [[G2033]] stars: [[G792]] and [[G2532]] out [[G1537]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] went [[G1607]] a [[G4501]] sharp [[G3691]] twoedged [[G1366]] sword: [[G4501]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] countenance [[G3799]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] shineth [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] strength. [[G1411]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] I saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] I fell [[G4098]] at [[G4314]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] as [[G5613]] dead. [[G3498]] And [[G2532]] he laid [[G2007]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] upon [[G1909]] me, [[G1691]] saying [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Fear [[G5399]] not; [[G3361]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last: [[G2078]]

### 18
I he [[G3588]] that liveth, [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] was [[G1096]] dead; [[G3498]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] I am [[G1510]] alive [[G2198]] for [[G1519]] evermore, [[G165]] Amen; [[G281]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] keys [[G2807]] of hell [[G86]] and [[G2532]] of [[G2288]] death. [[G2288]]

### 19
Write [[G1125]] the things which [[G3739]] thou hast seen, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] the things which [[G3739]] are, [[G1526]] and [[G2532]] the things which [[G3739]] shall [[G3195]] be [[G1096]] hereafter; [[G3326]]

### 20
The [[G3588]] mystery of [[G3466]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] stars [[G792]] which [[G3739]] thou sawest [[G1492]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] right hand, [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] golden [[G5552]] candlesticks. [[G3087]] The [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] stars [[G792]] are [[G1526]] the angels [[G32]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1577]] seven [[G2033]] churches: [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] candlesticks [[G3087]] which [[G3739]] thou sawest [[G1492]] are [[G1526]] seven [[G2033]] the [[G1577]] churches.
