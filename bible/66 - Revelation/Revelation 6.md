### 1
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] opened [[G455]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] seals, [[G4973]] and [[G2532]] I heard, [[G191]] as it were [[G5613]] the noise [[G5456]] of thunder, [[G1027]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] beasts [[G2226]] saying, [[G3004]] Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G991]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] I saw, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] behold [[G2400]] a white [[G3022]] horse: [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] had [[G2192]] a bow; [[G5115]] and [[G2532]] a crown [[G4735]] was given [[G1325]] unto him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he went forth [[G1831]] conquering, [[G3528]] and [[G2532]] to [[G2443]] conquer. [[G3528]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he had opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] seal, [[G4973]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] beast [[G2226]] say, [[G3004]] Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G991]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] there went out [[G1831]] another [[G243]] horse [[G2462]] red: [[G4450]] and [[G2532]] was given [[G1325]] to him [[G846]] that sat [[G2521]] thereon [[G1909]]  to [[G846]] take [[G2983]] peace [[G1515]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] they should kill [[G4969]] one another: [[G240]] and [[G2532]] there was given [[G1325]] unto him [[G846]] a great [[G3173]] sword. [[G3162]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he had opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] seal, [[G4973]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] beast [[G2226]] say, [[G3004]] Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G991]] And [[G2532]] I beheld, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] lo [[G2400]] a black [[G3189]] horse; [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] him [[G846]] had [[G2192]] a pair of balances [[G2218]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5064]] four [[G5064]] beasts [[G2226]] say, [[G3004]] A measure [[G5518]] of wheat [[G4621]] for a penny, [[G1220]] and [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] measures [[G5518]] of barley [[G2915]] for a penny; [[G1220]] and [[G2532]] thou hurt [[G91]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] oil [[G1637]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wine. [[G3631]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he had opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] seal, [[G4973]] I heard [[G191]] the voice [[G5456]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5067]] fourth [[G5067]] beast [[G2226]] say, [[G3004]] Come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G991]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] I looked, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] behold [[G2400]] a pale [[G5515]] horse: [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] that [[G3588]] sat [[G2521]] on [[G1883]] him [[G846]]  was [[G3588]] Death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] Hell [[G86]] followed [[G190]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] power [[G1849]] was given [[G1325]] unto them [[G846]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] fourth part [[G5067]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] to kill [[G615]] with [[G1722]] sword, [[G4501]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] hunger, [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] with [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] beasts [[G2342]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he had opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] fifth [[G3991]] seal, [[G4973]] I saw [[G1492]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] the [[G3588]] souls [[G5590]] them [[G3588]] of that were [[G4969]] slain [[G4969]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] which [[G3739]] they held: [[G2192]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] they cried [[G2896]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] saying, [[G3004]] How [[G2193]] long, [[G4219]]  O [[G3588]] Lord, [[G1203]] holy [[G40]] and [[G2532]] true, [[G228]] dost thou judge [[G2919]] not [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] avenge [[G1556]] our [[G2257]] blood [[G129]] on [[G575]] them that dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth? [[G1093]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] white [[G3022]] robes [[G4749]] were given [[G1325]] unto every one of them; [[G1538]] and [[G2532]] it was said [[G4483]] unto them, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they should rest [[G373]] yet [[G2089]] for a little [[G3398]] season, [[G5550]] until [[G2193]] their [[G846]] fellowservants [[G4889]] also [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] brethren, [[G80]] that [[G3588]] should be [[G3195]] killed [[G615]] as [[G5613]] they [[G846]] should be [[G4137]] fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] I beheld [[G1492]] when [[G3753]] he had opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] seal, [[G4973]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] there was [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] earthquake; [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] became [[G1096]] black [[G3189]] as [[G5613]] sackcloth [[G4526]] of hair, [[G5155]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] became [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] blood; [[G129]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] stars [[G792]] of [[G3772]] heaven [[G3772]] fell [[G4098]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] even as [[G5613]] a fig tree [[G4808]] casteth [[G906]] her [[G846]]  untimely [[G3588]] figs, [[G3653]] when she is shaken [[G4579]] of [[G5259]] a mighty [[G3173]] wind. [[G417]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the heaven [[G3772]] departed [[G673]] as [[G5613]] a scroll [[G975]] when it is rolled together; [[G1507]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] mountain [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] island [[G3520]] were moved [[G2795]] out [[G1537]] of their [[G846]] places. [[G5117]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1093]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the great [[G3588]] men, [[G3175]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rich men, [[G4145]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief captains, [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mighty men, [[G1415]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] bondman, [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] free man, [[G1658]] hid [[G2928]] themselves [[G1438]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] dens [[G4693]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] rocks [[G4073]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3735]] mountains; [[G3735]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3735]] mountains [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] rocks, [[G4073]] Fall [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] us, [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] hide [[G2928]] us [[G2248]] from [[G575]] the face [[G4383]] him [[G3588]] of that [[G2521]] sitteth [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] the [[G3588]] of [[G721]] Lamb: [[G721]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] day is [[G3709]]  of [[G2250]] his [[G846]] wrath [[G3709]] come; [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] shall be able [[G1410]] to stand? [[G2476]]
