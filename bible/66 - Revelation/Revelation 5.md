### 1
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] right hand [[G1188]] him [[G3588]] of that [[G2521]] sat [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] a book [[G975]] written [[G1125]] within [[G2081]] and [[G2532]] on the backside, [[G3693]] sealed [[G2696]] with seven [[G2033]] seals. [[G4973]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G1492]] a strong [[G2478]] angel [[G32]] proclaiming [[G2784]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] worthy [[G514]] to open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] and [[G2532]] to loose [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] seals [[G4973]] thereof? [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] nor [[G3761]] in [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] neither [[G3761]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] was able [[G1410]] to open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] neither [[G3761]] to look [[G991]] thereon. [[G846]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] wept [[G2799]] much, [[G4183]] because [[G3754]] no man [[G3762]] was found [[G2147]] worthy [[G514]] to open [[G455]] and [[G2532]] to read [[G314]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] neither [[G3777]] to look [[G991]] thereon. [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] saith [[G3004]] unto me, [[G3427]] Weep [[G2799]] not: [[G3361]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Lion [[G3023]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tribe [[G5443]] of Juda, [[G2448]] the [[G3588]] Root [[G4491]] of David, [[G1138]] hath prevailed [[G3528]] to open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] and [[G2532]] to loose [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] seals [[G4973]] thereof. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] I beheld, [[G1492]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2362]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5064]] four [[G5064]] beasts, [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4245]] elders, [[G4245]] stood [[G2476]] a Lamb [[G721]] as [[G5613]] it had been slain, [[G4969]] having [[G2192]] seven [[G2033]] horns [[G2768]] and [[G2532]] seven [[G2033]] eyes, [[G3788]] which [[G3739]] are [[G1526]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] Spirits [[G4151]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] sent forth [[G649]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] book [[G975]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] right hand [[G1188]] him [[G3588]] of that [[G2521]] sat [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne. [[G2362]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he had taken [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] beasts [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] four [[G5064]] twenty [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] fell down [[G4098]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lamb, [[G721]] having [[G2192]] every one of them [[G1538]] harps, [[G2788]] and [[G2532]] golden [[G5552]] vials [[G5357]] full [[G1073]] of odours, [[G2368]] which [[G3739]] are [[G1526]] the [[G3588]] prayers [[G4335]] of [[G40]] saints. [[G40]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] they sung [[G103]] a new [[G2537]] song, [[G5603]] saying, [[G3004]] Thou art [[G1488]] worthy [[G514]] to take [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] and [[G2532]] to open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] seals [[G4973]] thereof: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] thou wast slain, [[G4969]] and [[G2532]] hast redeemed [[G59]] us [[G2248]] to [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] by [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] blood [[G129]] out of [[G1537]] every [[G3956]] kindred, [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] tongue, [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] nation; [[G1484]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] hast made [[G4160]] us [[G2248]] unto our [[G2257]] God [[G2316]] kings [[G935]] and [[G2532]] priests: [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] we shall reign [[G936]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] I beheld, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] the voice [[G5456]] of many [[G4183]] angels [[G32]] round about [[G2943]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] beasts [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders: [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of them [[G846]] was [[G2258]] ten thousand times [[G3461]] ten thousand, [[G3461]] and [[G2532]] thousands [[G5505]] of thousands; [[G5505]]

### 12
Saying [[G3004]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] Worthy [[G514]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] that [[G3588]] was slain [[G4969]] to receive [[G2983]] power, [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] riches, [[G4149]] and [[G2532]] wisdom, [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] strength, [[G2479]] and [[G2532]] honour, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] blessing. [[G2129]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] creature [[G2938]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] such as [[G3739]] are [[G2076]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] heard I [[G191]] saying, [[G3004]] Blessing, [[G2129]] and [[G2532]] honour, [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] power, [[G2904]] him that [[G3588]] unto [[G2521]] sitteth [[G2521]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G721]] Lamb [[G721]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever. [[G165]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] beasts [[G2226]] said, [[G3004]] Amen. [[G281]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] twenty [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] fell down [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] worshipped [[G4352]] him that liveth [[G2198]] for [[G1519]] ever [[G165]] and [[G165]] ever. [[G165]]
