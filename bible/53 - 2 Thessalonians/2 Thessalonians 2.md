### 1
Now [[G1161]] we beseech [[G2065]] you, [[G5209]] brethren, [[G80]] by [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] gathering together [[G1997]] unto [[G1909]] him, [[G846]]

### 2
That [[G1519]] ye [[G5209]] be [[G4531]] not [[G3361]] soon [[G5030]] shaken [[G4531]] in [[G575]] mind, [[G3563]] or [[G3383]] be troubled, [[G2360]] neither [[G3383]] by [[G1223]] spirit, [[G4151]] nor [[G3383]] by [[G1223]] word, [[G3056]] nor [[G3383]] by [[G1223]] letter [[G1992]] as [[G5613]] from [[G1223]] us, [[G2257]] as [[G5613]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of is at [[G5547]] Christ [[G5547]] hand. [[G1764]]

### 3
no [[G3361]] Let [[G1818]] man [[G5100]] deceive [[G1818]] you [[G5209]] by [[G2596]] any [[G3367]] means: [[G5158]] for [[G3754]] except [[G1437]] there come [[G2064]] a falling [[G3588]] away [[G646]] first, [[G4412]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3588]] man [[G444]]  of [[G3588]] sin [[G266]] be revealed, [[G601]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of [[G684]] perdition; [[G684]]

### 4
Who [[G3588]] opposeth [[G480]] and [[G2532]] exalteth himself [[G5229]] above [[G1909]] all that [[G3956]] is called [[G3004]] God, [[G2316]] or [[G2228]] that is worshipped; [[G4574]] so that [[G5620]] he [[G846]] as [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] sitteth [[G2523]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of God, [[G2316]] shewing [[G584]] himself [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] God. [[G2316]]

### 5
Remember ye [[G3421]] not, [[G3756]] that, [[G3754]] when I was [[G5607]] yet [[G2089]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] I told [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] these things? [[G5023]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] ye know [[G1492]] what withholdeth [[G2722]] that [[G1519]] he [[G846]] might be revealed [[G601]] in [[G1722]] his [[G1438]] time. [[G2540]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of [[G458]] iniquity [[G458]] already [[G2235]] doth [[G1754]] work: [[G1754]] only [[G3440]] he [[G3588]] who [[G2722]] now [[G737]] letteth [[G2722]] until [[G2193]] he be taken [[G1096]] out of [[G1537]] the way. [[G3319]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall be [[G601]] that Wicked [[G459]] revealed, [[G601]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] shall consume [[G355]] with the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of his [[G846]] mouth, [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] shall destroy [[G2673]] with the [[G3588]] brightness [[G2015]] of his [[G846]] coming: [[G3952]]

### 9
whose [[G3739]] coming [[G3952]] is [[G2076]] after [[G2596]] the working [[G1753]]  of [[G3588]] Satan [[G4567]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] lying [[G5579]] wonders, [[G5059]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] deceivableness [[G539]] of [[G93]] unrighteousness [[G93]] in [[G1722]] them that [[G3588]] perish; [[G622]] because [[G473]]  they [[G3739]] received [[G1209]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] the [[G3588]] of [[G225]] truth, [[G225]] that [[G1519]] they [[G846]] might be saved. [[G4982]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] for cause [[G1223]] this [[G5124]] God [[G2316]] shall send [[G3992]] them [[G846]] strong [[G1753]] delusion, [[G4106]] that [[G1519]] they [[G846]] should believe [[G4100]]  a [[G3588]] lie: [[G5579]]

### 12
That [[G2443]] they might be [[G2919]] all [[G3956]] damned [[G2919]] who believed [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] but [[G235]] had pleasure [[G2106]] in [[G1722]] unrighteousness. [[G93]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] are bound [[G3784]] to give thanks [[G2168]] alway [[G3842]] to [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] for [[G4012]] you, [[G5216]] brethren [[G80]] beloved [[G25]] of [[G5259]] the Lord, [[G2962]] because [[G3754]] hath [[G138]] God [[G2316]] from [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] chosen [[G138]] you [[G5209]] to [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] through [[G1722]] sanctification [[G38]] of the Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] belief [[G4102]] of the truth: [[G225]]

### 14
Whereunto [[G1519]] he called [[G2564]] you [[G5209]] by [[G1223]] our [[G2257]] gospel, [[G2098]] to [[G1519]] the obtaining [[G4047]] of the glory [[G1391]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 15
Therefore, [[G686]] brethren, [[G80]] stand fast, [[G4739]] and [[G2532]] hold [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] traditions [[G3862]] which [[G3739]] ye have been taught, [[G1321]] whether [[G1535]] by [[G1223]] word, [[G3056]] or [[G1535]] our [[G2257]] epistle. [[G1992]]

### 16
Now [[G1161]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] himself, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] God, [[G2316]] even [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] Father, [[G3962]] which hath loved [[G25]] us, [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] hath given [[G1325]] everlasting [[G166]] consolation [[G3874]] and [[G2532]] good [[G18]] hope [[G1680]] through [[G1722]] grace, [[G5485]]

### 17
Comfort [[G3870]] your [[G5216]] hearts, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] stablish [[G4741]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] work. [[G2041]]
