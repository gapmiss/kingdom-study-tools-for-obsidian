### 1
Finally, [[G3063]] brethren, [[G80]] pray [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] us, [[G2257]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] may have course, [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] be glorified, [[G1392]] even [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] with [[G4314]] you: [[G5209]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] we may be delivered [[G4506]] from [[G575]] unreasonable [[G824]] and [[G2532]] wicked [[G4190]] men: [[G444]] for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] have not [[G3756]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 3
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G2076]] faithful, [[G4103]] who [[G3739]] shall stablish [[G4741]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G5442]] from [[G575]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] we have confidence [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] the Lord [[G2962]] touching [[G1909]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G3754]] both [[G2532]] ye [[G4160]] do [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] will do [[G4160]] the things which [[G3739]] we command [[G3853]] you. [[G5213]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] direct [[G2720]] your [[G5216]] hearts [[G2588]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] the patient [[G3588]] waiting [[G5281]] for Christ. [[G5547]]

### 6
Now [[G1161]] we command [[G3853]] you, [[G5213]] brethren, [[G80]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] that yourselves [[G4724]] ye [[G5209]] withdraw [[G4724]] from [[G575]] every [[G3956]] brother [[G80]] that walketh [[G4043]] disorderly, [[G814]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] which [[G3739]] he received [[G3880]] of [[G3844]] us. [[G2257]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] yourselves [[G846]] know [[G1492]] how [[G4459]] ye ought [[G1163]] to follow [[G3401]] us: [[G2248]] for [[G3754]] we behaved ourselves disorderly [[G812]] not [[G3756]] among [[G1722]] you; [[G5213]]

### 8
Neither [[G3761]] did we eat [[G5315]] any [[G3844]] man's [[G5100]] bread [[G740]] for nought; [[G1432]] but [[G235]] wrought [[G2038]] with [[G1722]] labour [[G2873]] and [[G2532]] travail [[G3449]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day, [[G2250]] that [[G4314]] we might be to [[G1912]] not [[G3361]] chargeable [[G1912]] any [[G5100]] of you: [[G5216]]

### 9
Not [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] we have [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] power, [[G1849]] but [[G235]] to [[G2443]] make [[G1325]] ourselves [[G1438]] an ensample [[G5179]] unto you [[G5213]] to [[G1519]] follow [[G3401]] us. [[G2248]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] we were [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] this [[G5124]] we commanded [[G3853]] you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] work, [[G2038]] neither [[G3366]] should he eat. [[G2068]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] we hear [[G191]] some [[G5100]] that there are which [[G4043]] walk [[G4043]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] disorderly, [[G814]] working [[G2038]] not at all, [[G3367]] but [[G235]] are busybodies. [[G4020]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] them [[G3588]] that are such [[G5108]] we command [[G3853]] and [[G2532]] exhort [[G3870]] by [[G1223]] our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] with [[G3326]] quietness [[G2271]] they work, [[G2038]] and eat [[G2068]] their own [[G1438]] bread. [[G740]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] ye, [[G5210]] brethren, [[G80]] not [[G3361]] be [[G1573]] weary [[G1573]] in well doing. [[G2569]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] any man [[G5100]] obey [[G5219]] not [[G3756]] our [[G2257]] word [[G3056]] by [[G1223]]  this [[G3588]] epistle, [[G1992]] note [[G4593]] that man, [[G5126]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3361]] have with [[G4874]] company [[G4874]] him, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he may be ashamed. [[G1788]]

### 15
Yet [[G2532]] count [[G2233]] not [[G3361]] as [[G5613]] an enemy, [[G2190]] but [[G235]] admonish [[G3560]] as [[G5613]] a brother. [[G80]]

### 16
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] of [[G1515]] peace [[G1515]] himself [[G846]] give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] peace [[G1515]] always [[G1223]] by [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] means. [[G5158]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]]

### 17
The [[G3588]] salutation of [[G783]] Paul [[G3972]] with mine own [[G1699]] hand, [[G5495]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] the token [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] epistle: [[G1992]] so [[G3779]] I write. [[G1125]]

### 18
The [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G2257]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] all. [[G3956]] Amen. [[G281]]
