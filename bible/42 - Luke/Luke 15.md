### 1
Then [[G1161]] drew near [[G1448]] unto him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] for to hear [[G191]] him. [[G846]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] murmured, [[G1234]] saying, [[G3004]] This man [[G3778]] receiveth [[G4327]] sinners, [[G268]] and [[G2532]] eateth [[G4906]] with [[G846]] them. [[G846]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] he spake [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 4
What [[G5101]] man [[G444]] of [[G1537]] you, [[G5216]] having [[G2192]] an hundred [[G1540]] sheep, [[G4263]] if [[G2532]] he lose [[G622]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] not [[G3756]] doth [[G2641]] leave [[G2641]] the [[G3588]] ninety and nine [[G1768]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] after [[G1909]] that which [[G3588]] is lost, [[G622]] until [[G2193]] he find [[G2147]] it? [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when he hath found [[G2147]] he layeth [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] his [[G1438]] shoulders, [[G5606]] rejoicing. [[G5463]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] when he cometh [[G2064]] home, [[G3624]] he calleth together [[G4779]] friends [[G5384]] and [[G2532]] neighbours, [[G1069]] saying [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Rejoice with [[G4796]] me; [[G3427]] for [[G3754]] I have found [[G2147]] my [[G3450]] sheep [[G4263]] which [[G3588]] was lost. [[G622]]

### 7
I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] likewise [[G3779]] joy [[G5479]] shall be [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] over [[G1909]] one [[G1520]] sinner [[G268]] that repenteth, [[G3340]] more than [[G2228]] over [[G1909]] ninety and nine [[G1768]] just persons, [[G1342]] which [[G3748]] need [[G5532]] no [[G3756]] repentance. [[G3341]]

### 8
Either [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] woman [[G1135]] having [[G2192]] ten [[G1176]] pieces of silver, [[G1406]] if [[G1437]] she lose [[G622]] one [[G1520]] piece, [[G1406]] not [[G3780]] doth [[G681]] light [[G681]] a candle, [[G3088]] and [[G2532]] sweep [[G4563]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] seek [[G2212]] diligently [[G1960]] till [[G2193]] she find [[G2147]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when she hath found [[G2147]] she calleth [[G4779]] friends [[G5384]] and [[G2532]] neighbours [[G1069]] together, [[G4779]] saying, [[G3004]] Rejoice with [[G4796]] me; [[G3427]] for [[G3754]] I have found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] piece [[G1406]] which [[G3739]] I had lost. [[G622]]

### 10
Likewise, [[G3779]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] there is [[G1096]] joy [[G5479]] in the presence of [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] over [[G1909]] one [[G1520]] sinner [[G268]] that repenteth. [[G3340]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] he said, [[G2036]] A certain [[G5100]] man [[G444]] had [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] sons: [[G5207]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] younger [[G3501]] of them [[G846]] said [[G2036]] to [[G3962]] father, [[G3962]] Father, [[G3962]] give [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] the portion [[G3313]] of [[G3776]] goods [[G3776]] that [[G3588]] falleth [[G1911]] And [[G2532]] he divided [[G1244]] unto them [[G846]] living. [[G979]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] many [[G4183]] days [[G2250]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] younger [[G3501]] son [[G5207]] gathered together, [[G4863]] all [[G537]] and took his journey [[G589]] into [[G1519]] a far [[G3117]] country, [[G5561]] and [[G2532]] there [[G1563]] wasted [[G1287]] his [[G846]] substance [[G3776]] with riotous [[G811]] living. [[G2198]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] when he [[G846]] had spent [[G1159]] all, [[G3956]] there arose [[G1096]] a mighty [[G2478]] famine [[G3042]] in [[G2596]] that [[G1565]] land; [[G5561]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] began [[G756]] to be in want. [[G5302]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he went [[G4198]] and joined himself [[G2853]] to [[G1520]] a [[G3588]] citizen [[G4177]] of that [[G1565]] country; [[G5561]] and [[G2532]] he sent [[G3992]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] fields [[G68]] to feed [[G1006]] swine. [[G5519]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he would fain [[G1937]] have filled [[G1072]] his [[G846]] belly [[G2836]] with [[G575]] the [[G3588]] husks [[G2769]] that [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] swine [[G5519]] did eat: [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] gave [[G1325]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] when he came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] himself, [[G1438]] he said, [[G2036]] How many [[G4214]] hired servants [[G3407]] of my [[G3450]] father's [[G3962]] have bread [[G740]] enough and to spare, [[G4052]] and [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] perish [[G622]] with hunger! [[G3042]]

### 18
I will arise [[G450]] and go [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] my [[G3450]] father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] will say [[G2046]] unto him, [[G846]] Father, [[G3962]] I have sinned [[G264]] against [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] before [[G1799]] thee, [[G4675]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] am [[G1510]] no more [[G3765]] worthy [[G514]] to be called [[G2564]] thy [[G4675]] son: [[G5207]] make [[G4160]] me [[G3165]] as [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] of thy [[G4675]] hired [[G3407]] servants. [[G3407]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] he arose, [[G450]] and came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] his [[G1438]] father. [[G3962]] But [[G1161]] when he [[G846]] was [[G568]] yet [[G2089]] a great way off, [[G3112]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] had compassion, [[G4697]] and [[G2532]] ran, [[G5143]] and fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] neck, [[G5137]] and [[G2532]] kissed [[G2705]] him. [[G846]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Father, [[G3962]] I have sinned [[G264]] against [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1799]] thy [[G4675]] sight, [[G1799]] and [[G2532]] am [[G1510]] no more [[G3765]] worthy [[G514]] to be called [[G2564]] thy [[G4675]] son. [[G5207]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] Bring forth [[G1627]] the [[G3588]] best [[G4413]] robe, [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] put on [[G1746]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] put [[G1325]] a ring [[G1146]] on [[G1519]] his [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] shoes [[G5266]] on [[G1519]] feet: [[G4228]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] bring hither [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] fatted [[G4618]] calf, [[G3448]] and kill [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] let us eat, [[G5315]] and be merry: [[G2165]]

### 24
For [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] my [[G3450]] son [[G5207]] was [[G2258]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] is alive again; [[G326]] he was [[G2258]] lost, [[G622]] and [[G2532]] is found. [[G2147]] And [[G2532]] they began [[G756]] to be merry. [[G2165]]

### 25
Now [[G1161]] his [[G846]] elder [[G4245]] son [[G5207]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the field: [[G68]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] he came [[G2064]] and drew nigh [[G1448]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3614]] house, [[G3614]] he heard [[G191]] musick [[G4858]] and [[G2532]] dancing. [[G5525]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] he called [[G4341]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3816]] servants, [[G3816]] and asked [[G4441]] what [[G5101]] these things [[G5023]] meant. [[G1498]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thy [[G4675]] brother [[G80]] is come; [[G2240]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] father [[G3962]] hath killed [[G2380]] the [[G3588]] fatted [[G4618]] calf, [[G3448]] because [[G3754]] he hath received [[G618]] him [[G846]] safe and sound. [[G5198]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] he was angry, [[G3710]] and [[G2532]] would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] go in: [[G1525]] therefore [[G3767]] came out, [[G1831]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] and intreated [[G3870]] him. [[G846]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] to father, [[G3962]] Lo, [[G2400]] these many [[G5118]] years [[G2094]] do I serve [[G1398]] thee, [[G4671]] neither [[G2532]] transgressed I [[G3928]] at any time [[G3763]] thy [[G4675]] commandment: [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] never [[G3763]] yet thou [[G1325]] gavest [[G1325]] me [[G1698]] a kid, [[G2056]] that [[G2443]] I might make merry [[G2165]] with [[G3326]] my [[G3450]] friends: [[G5384]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] as soon as [[G3753]] this [[G3778]] thy [[G4675]] son [[G5207]] was come, [[G2064]] which [[G3588]] hath devoured [[G2719]] thy [[G4675]] living [[G979]] with [[G3326]] harlots, [[G4204]] thou hast killed [[G2380]] for him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] fatted [[G4618]] calf. [[G3448]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Son, [[G5043]] thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] ever [[G3842]] with [[G3326]] me, [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] I have [[G1699]] is [[G2076]] thine. [[G4674]]

### 32
It was meet [[G1163]] that we should make merry, [[G2165]] and [[G2532]] be glad: [[G5463]] for [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] thy [[G4675]] brother [[G80]] was [[G2258]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] is alive again; [[G326]] and [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] lost, [[G622]] and [[G2532]] is found. [[G2147]]
