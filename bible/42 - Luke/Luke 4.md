### 1
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] being full [[G4134]] of the Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] returned [[G5290]] from [[G575]] Jordan, [[G2446]] and [[G2532]] was led [[G71]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]]

### 2
forty [[G5062]] Being [[G3985]] days [[G2250]] tempted [[G3985]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]] And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] he did [[G5315]] eat [[G5315]] nothing: [[G3762]] and [[G2532]] when they [[G846]] were ended, [[G4931]] afterward [[G5305]] he [[G3983]] hungered. [[G3983]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] thou be [[G1488]] the Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] command [[G2036]] this [[G5129]] stone [[G3037]] that [[G2443]] it be made [[G1096]] bread. [[G740]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] It is written, [[G1125]] That [[G3754]] man [[G444]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G2198]] live [[G2198]] by [[G1909]] bread [[G740]] alone, [[G3441]] but [[G235]] by [[G1909]] every [[G3956]] word [[G4487]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] taking up [[G321]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] an [[G3735]] high [[G5308]] mountain, [[G3735]] shewed [[G1166]] unto him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] kingdoms [[G932]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3625]] world [[G3625]] in [[G1722]] a moment [[G4743]] of time. [[G5550]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] All [[G537]] this [[G3778]] power [[G1849]] will I give [[G1325]] thee, [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of them: [[G846]] for that [[G3754]] is delivered [[G3860]] unto me; [[G1698]] and [[G2532]] to whomsoever [[G1437]] I will [[G2309]] I give [[G1325]] it. [[G846]]

### 7
If [[G1437]] thou [[G4771]] therefore [[G3767]] wilt worship [[G4352]] me, [[G3450]] all [[G3956]] shall be [[G2071]] thine. [[G4675]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Get thee [[G5217]] behind [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] Satan: [[G4567]] for [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] Thou shalt worship [[G4352]] the Lord [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] him [[G846]] only [[G3441]] shalt thou serve. [[G3000]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] set [[G2476]] him [[G846]] on [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] pinnacle [[G4419]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2411]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] thou be [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] cast [[G906]] thyself [[G4572]] down [[G2736]] from hence: [[G1782]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] it is written, [[G1125]] his [[G846]] He shall give [[G1781]] angels [[G32]] charge [[G1781]] over [[G4012]] thee, [[G4675]] to keep [[G1314]] thee: [[G4571]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] hands [[G5495]] they shall bear up, [[G142]] thee [[G4571]] lest at any time [[G3379]] thou dash [[G4350]] thy [[G4675]] foot [[G4228]] against [[G4314]] a stone. [[G3037]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] It is said, [[G2046]] not [[G3756]] Thou shalt [[G1598]] tempt [[G1598]] the Lord [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] God. [[G2316]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] when had [[G4931]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] ended [[G4931]] all [[G3956]] the temptation, [[G3986]] he departed [[G868]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] for [[G891]] a season. [[G2540]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] returned [[G5290]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4151]] Spirit [[G4151]] into [[G1519]] Galilee: [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] there went out [[G1831]] a fame [[G5345]] of [[G4012]] him [[G846]] through [[G2596]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] region round about. [[G4066]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues, [[G4864]] being glorified [[G1392]] of [[G5259]] all. [[G3956]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Nazareth, [[G3478]] where [[G3757]] he had been [[G2258]] brought up: [[G5142]] and, [[G2532]] as [[G2596]] his [[G846]] custom was, [[G1486]] he went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath [[G4521]] day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] stood up [[G450]] for to read. [[G314]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] there was delivered [[G1929]] unto him [[G846]] the book [[G975]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophet [[G4396]] Esaias. [[G2268]] And [[G2532]] when he had opened [[G380]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] he found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3757]] it was [[G2258]] written, [[G1125]]

### 18
The Spirit [[G4151]] of the Lord [[G2962]] upon [[G1909]] me, [[G1691]] because [[G3739]] he hath [[G5548]] anointed [[G5548]] me [[G3165]] to preach the gospel [[G2097]] to the poor; [[G4434]] he hath sent [[G649]] me [[G3165]] to heal [[G2390]] the [[G3588]] brokenhearted, [[G4937]] to preach [[G2784]] deliverance [[G859]] to the captives, [[G164]] and [[G2532]] recovering of sight [[G309]] to the blind, [[G5185]] to set [[G649]] at [[G1722]] liberty [[G859]] them that are bruised, [[G2352]]

### 19
To preach [[G2784]] the acceptable [[G1184]] year [[G1763]] of the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] he closed [[G4428]] the [[G3588]] book, [[G975]] and he gave again [[G591]] the [[G3588]] to [[G5257]] minister, [[G5257]] and sat down. [[G2523]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] of all them [[G3956]] that were in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] were [[G2258]] fastened [[G816]] on [[G846]] him. [[G846]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] he began [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] This day [[G4594]] is [[G4137]] this [[G3778]] scripture [[G1124]] fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] ears. [[G3775]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] bare [[G3140]] him [[G846]] witness, [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] wondered [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] gracious [[G5485]] words [[G3056]] which [[G3588]] proceeded [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mouth. [[G4750]] And [[G2532]] they said, [[G3004]] Is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] Joseph's [[G2501]] son? [[G5207]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] surely [[G3843]] Ye will [[G2046]] say [[G2046]] unto me [[G3427]] this [[G3778]] proverb, [[G3850]] Physician, [[G2395]] heal [[G2323]] thyself: [[G4572]] whatsoever [[G3745]] we have heard [[G191]] done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] do [[G4160]] also [[G2532]] here [[G5602]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] country. [[G3968]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] he said, [[G2036]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] No [[G3762]] prophet [[G4396]] is [[G2076]] accepted [[G1184]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] country. [[G3968]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] of [[G1909]] a truth, [[G225]] many [[G4183]] widows [[G5503]] were [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] Israel [[G2474]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of Elias, [[G2243]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] was shut up [[G2808]] three [[G5140]] years [[G2094]] and [[G2532]] six [[G1803]] months, [[G3376]] when [[G5613]] great [[G3173]] famine [[G3042]] was [[G1096]] throughout [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] land; [[G1093]]

### 26
But [[G2532]] unto [[G4314]] none [[G3762]] of them [[G846]] was [[G3992]] Elias [[G2243]] sent, [[G3992]] save [[G3361]] unto [[G1519]] Sarepta, [[G4558]] of Sidon, [[G4605]] unto [[G4314]] a woman [[G1135]] a widow. [[G5503]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] lepers [[G3015]] were [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] Israel [[G2474]] in the time [[G1909]] of Eliseus [[G1666]] the [[G3588]] prophet; [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] none [[G3762]] of them [[G846]] was cleansed, [[G2511]] saving [[G3361]] Naaman [[G3497]] the [[G3588]] Syrian. [[G4948]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] all they [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] when they heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] were filled [[G4130]] with wrath, [[G2372]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] rose up, [[G450]] and thrust [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] led [[G71]] him [[G846]] unto [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] brow [[G3790]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3735]] hill [[G3735]] whereon [[G1909]] their [[G846]] city [[G4172]] was built, [[G3618]] that [[G1519]] they might cast down headlong. [[G2630]] him [[G846]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] he [[G846]] passing [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] the midst [[G3319]] of them [[G846]] went his way, [[G4198]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] came down [[G2718]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] a city [[G4172]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] taught [[G2258]] them [[G846]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath days. [[G4521]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] they were astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] doctrine: [[G1322]] for [[G3754]] his [[G846]] word [[G3056]] was [[G2258]] with [[G1722]] power. [[G1849]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] there was [[G2258]] a man, [[G444]] which had [[G2192]] a spirit [[G4151]] of an unclean [[G169]] devil, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] cried out [[G349]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]]

### 34
Saying, [[G3004]] Let alone; [[G1436]] what [[G5101]] have we to do [[G2254]] with thee, [[G4671]] Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth? [[G3479]] art thou come [[G2064]] to destroy [[G622]] us? [[G2248]] I know [[G1492]] thee [[G4571]] who [[G5101]] thou art; [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] Holy One [[G40]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] rebuked [[G2008]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Hold thy peace, [[G5392]] and [[G2532]] come out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] him. [[G846]] And when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1140]] had thrown [[G4496]] him [[G846]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] midst, [[G3319]] he came [[G1831]] out of [[G575]] him, [[G846]] and hurt [[G984]] him [[G846]] not. [[G3367]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] they were [[G1096]] all [[G3956]] amazed, [[G2285]] and [[G2532]] spake [[G4814]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] a [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] this! [[G3778]] for [[G3754]] with [[G1722]] authority [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1411]] he commandeth [[G2004]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they come out. [[G1831]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] the fame [[G2279]] of [[G4012]] him [[G846]] went out [[G1607]] into [[G1519]] every [[G3956]] place [[G5117]] the [[G3588]] of country round [[G4066]] about. [[G4066]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] he arose [[G450]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] Simon's [[G4613]] house. [[G3614]] And [[G1161]] Simon's [[G4613]] wife's mother [[G3994]] was [[G2258]] taken with [[G4912]] a great [[G3173]] fever; [[G4446]] and [[G2532]] they besought [[G2065]] him [[G846]] for [[G4012]] her. [[G846]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] he stood [[G2186]] over [[G1883]] her, [[G846]] and rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] fever; [[G4446]] and [[G2532]] it left [[G863]] her: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] immediately [[G3916]] she arose [[G450]] and ministered [[G1247]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 40
Now when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] was setting, [[G1416]] all [[G3956]] they that [[G3745]] had [[G2192]] any sick [[G770]] with divers [[G4164]] diseases [[G3554]] brought [[G71]] them [[G846]] unto [[G4314]] him; [[G846]] and [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] laid on [[G2007]] his hands [[G5495]] every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of them, [[G846]] and healed [[G2323]] them. [[G846]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] devils [[G1140]] also [[G2532]] came out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] many, [[G4183]] crying out, [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] Christ [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]] And [[G2532]] he rebuking [[G2008]] suffered [[G1439]] them [[G846]] not [[G3756]] to speak: [[G2980]] for [[G3754]] they knew [[G1492]] that he [[G846]] was [[G1511]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 42
And [[G1161]] when it was [[G1096]] day, [[G2250]] he departed [[G1831]] and went [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] a desert [[G2048]] place: [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] sought [[G2212]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] unto [[G2193]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] stayed [[G2722]] him, [[G846]] that he should not [[G3361]] depart [[G4198]] from [[G575]] them. [[G846]]

### 43
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] I [[G3165]] must [[G1163]] preach [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] to other [[G2087]] cities [[G4172]] also: [[G2532]] for [[G3754]] therefore [[G1519]] am I [[G649]] sent. [[G649]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] he preached [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] of Galilee. [[G1056]]
