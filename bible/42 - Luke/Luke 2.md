And [[G1161]] it came to pass [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] that there went out [[G1831]] a decree [[G1378]] from [[G3844]] Caesar [[G2541]] Augustus, [[G828]] that all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] world [[G3625]] should be taxed. [[G583]]

### 2
this [[G3778]] taxing [[G582]] first [[G4413]] was when [[G1096]] made [[G1096]] Cyrenius [[G2958]] was governor [[G2230]] of Syria.) [[G4947]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] went [[G4198]] to be taxed, [[G583]] every one [[G1538]] into [[G1519]] his own [[G2398]] city. [[G4172]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] Joseph [[G2501]] also [[G1161]] went up [[G305]] from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] out of [[G1537]] the city [[G4172]] of Nazareth, [[G3478]] into [[G1519]] Judaea, [[G2449]] unto [[G1519]] the city [[G4172]] of David, [[G1138]] which [[G3748]] is called [[G2564]] Bethlehem; [[G965]] (because [[G1223]] he [[G846]] was [[G1511]] of [[G1537]] the house [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] lineage [[G3965]] of David:) [[G1138]]

### 5
To be taxed [[G583]] with [[G4862]] Mary [[G3137]] his [[G846]] espoused [[G3423]] wife, [[G1135]] being [[G5607]] great with child. [[G1471]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] so it was, [[G1096]] that, while [[G1722]] they [[G846]] were [[G1511]] there, [[G1563]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] were accomplished [[G4130]] that she [[G846]] should be delivered. [[G5088]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] she brought forth [[G5088]] her [[G846]] firstborn [[G4416]] son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] wrapped in swaddling clothes, [[G4683]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G347]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] manger; [[G5336]] because [[G1360]] there was [[G2258]] no [[G3756]] room [[G5117]] for them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] inn. [[G2646]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] there were [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] country [[G5561]] shepherds [[G4166]] abiding in the field, [[G63]] keeping [[G5442]] watch [[G5438]] over [[G1909]] their [[G846]] flock [[G4167]] by night. [[G3571]]

### 9
And, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] the angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] came upon [[G2186]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the glory [[G1391]] of the Lord [[G2962]] shone round about [[G4034]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they were [[G5399]] sore [[G3173]] afraid. [[G5399]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Fear [[G5399]] not: [[G3361]] for, [[G1063]] behold, [[G2400]] I bring good tidings [[G2097]] you [[G5213]] of [[G5479]] great [[G3173]] joy, [[G5479]] which [[G3748]] shall be [[G2071]] all [[G3956]] to [[G2992]] people. [[G2992]]

### 11
For [[G3754]] unto you [[G5213]] is born [[G5088]] this day [[G4594]] in [[G1722]] the city [[G4172]] of David [[G1138]] a Saviour, [[G4990]] which [[G3739]] is [[G2076]] Christ [[G5547]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] a [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] unto you; [[G5213]] Ye shall find [[G2147]] the babe [[G1025]] wrapped in swaddling clothes, [[G4683]] lying [[G2749]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] manger. [[G5336]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] suddenly [[G1810]] there was [[G1096]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] a multitude [[G4128]] of the heavenly [[G3770]] host [[G4756]] praising [[G134]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 14
Glory [[G1391]] to God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] the highest, [[G5310]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] peace, [[G1515]] good will [[G2107]] toward [[G1722]] men. [[G444]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] were gone away [[G565]] from [[G575]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] the [[G3588]] shepherds [[G4166]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] Let us [[G1330]] now [[G1211]] go [[G1330]] even unto [[G2193]] Bethlehem, [[G965]] and [[G2532]] see [[G1492]] this [[G5124]] thing [[G4487]] which is come to pass, [[G1096]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath made known [[G1107]] unto us. [[G2254]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] with haste, [[G4692]] and [[G2532]] found [[G429]] Mary, [[G3137]] and [[G2532]] Joseph, [[G2501]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] babe [[G1025]] lying [[G2749]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] manger. [[G5336]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] when they had seen [[G1492]] they made known [[G1232]] abroad [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G4487]] which was told [[G2980]] them [[G846]] concerning [[G4012]] this [[G5127]] child. [[G3813]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] they that heard [[G191]] wondered [[G2296]] at [[G4012]] those things which [[G3588]] were told [[G2980]] them [[G846]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] shepherds. [[G4166]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] kept [[G4933]] all [[G3956]] these [[G5023]] things, [[G4487]] and pondered [[G4820]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] shepherds [[G4166]] returned, [[G1994]] glorifying [[G1392]] and [[G2532]] praising [[G134]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the things that [[G3739]] they had heard [[G191]] and [[G2532]] seen, [[G1492]] as [[G2531]] it was told [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] them. [[G846]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] eight [[G3638]] days [[G2250]] were accomplished [[G4130]] the [[G3588]] for [[G4059]] circumcising [[G4059]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3813]] child, [[G3813]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] was called [[G2564]] JESUS, [[G2424]] which was so named [[G2564]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] before [[G4253]] he [[G846]] was conceived [[G4815]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] womb. [[G2836]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of [[G2512]] her [[G846]] purification [[G2512]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of Moses [[G3475]] were accomplished, [[G4130]] they brought [[G321]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] to present [[G3936]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2962]] Lord; [[G2962]]

### 23
(As [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the law [[G3551]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] Every [[G3956]] male [[G730]] that openeth [[G1272]] the womb [[G3388]] shall be called [[G2564]] holy [[G40]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2962]] Lord;) [[G2962]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] to offer [[G1325]] a sacrifice [[G2378]] according to [[G2596]] that which is said [[G2046]] in [[G1722]] the law [[G3551]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] A pair [[G2201]] of turtledoves, [[G5167]] or [[G2228]] two [[G1417]] young [[G3502]] pigeons. [[G4058]]

### 25
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there was [[G2258]] a man [[G444]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] whose [[G3739]] name [[G3686]] Simeon; [[G4826]] and [[G2532]] the same [[G3778]] man [[G444]] just [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] devout, [[G2126]] waiting [[G4327]] for the [[G3874]] consolation [[G3874]] of Israel: [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] was [[G2258]] upon [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] it was [[G2258]] revealed [[G5537]] unto him [[G846]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] not [[G3361]] that he should [[G1492]] see [[G1492]] death, [[G2288]] before [[G4250]] he had seen [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Lord's [[G2962]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple: [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] when [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] parents [[G1118]] brought in [[G1521]] the [[G3588]] child [[G3813]] Jesus, [[G2424]] to do [[G4160]] for [[G4012]] him [[G846]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] custom [[G1480]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law, [[G3551]]

### 28
Then [[G2532]] took up [[G1209]] he [[G846]] him [[G846]] in [[G1519]] his [[G846]] arms, [[G43]] and [[G2532]] blessed [[G2127]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]]

### 29
Lord, [[G1203]] now [[G3568]] lettest thou [[G630]] thy [[G4675]] servant [[G1401]] depart [[G630]] in [[G1722]] peace, [[G1515]] according to [[G2596]] thy [[G4675]] word: [[G4487]]

### 30
For [[G3754]] mine [[G3450]] eyes [[G3788]] have seen [[G1492]] thy [[G4675]] salvation, [[G4992]]

### 31
Which [[G3739]] thou hast prepared [[G2090]] before [[G2596]] the face [[G4383]] of all [[G3956]] people; [[G2992]]

### 32
A light [[G5457]] to [[G1519]] lighten [[G602]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] the glory [[G1391]] of [[G2992]] thy [[G4675]] people [[G2992]] Israel. [[G2474]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] Joseph [[G2501]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] marvelled [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] those [[G3588]] things which were spoken [[G2980]] of [[G4012]] him. [[G846]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] Simeon [[G4826]] blessed [[G2127]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] Mary [[G3137]] his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] Behold, [[G2400]] this [[G3778]] is set [[G2749]] for [[G1519]] the fall [[G4431]] and [[G2532]] rising again [[G386]] of many [[G4183]] in [[G1722]] Israel; [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] a sign [[G4592]] which shall be spoken against; [[G483]]

### 35
(Yea, [[G1161]] a sword [[G4501]] shall pierce through [[G1330]] thy [[G4675]] own [[G846]] soul [[G5590]] also,) [[G2532]] that [[G3704]] the thoughts [[G1261]] of [[G1537]] many [[G4183]] hearts [[G2588]] may be revealed. [[G601]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] there was [[G2258]] one Anna, [[G451]] a prophetess, [[G4398]] the daughter [[G2364]] of Phanuel, [[G5323]] of [[G1537]] the tribe [[G5443]] of Aser: [[G768]] she [[G846]] was [[G4260]] of a age, [[G4183]] great [[G4183]] and had lived [[G2198]] with [[G3326]] an husband [[G435]] seven [[G2033]] years [[G2094]] from [[G575]] her [[G846]] virginity; [[G3932]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] she [[G846]] a widow [[G5503]] about [[G5613]] of [[G2094]] fourscore [[G3589]] and four [[G5064]] years, [[G2094]] which [[G3739]] departed [[G868]] not [[G3756]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] but served [[G3000]] with fastings [[G3521]] and [[G2532]] prayers [[G1162]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day. [[G2250]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] she [[G3778]] coming [[G2186]] in gave likewise [[G437]] that [[G846]] instant [[G5610]] thanks [[G437]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] spake [[G2980]] of [[G4012]] him [[G846]] to all [[G3956]] them that [[G3588]] looked for [[G4327]] redemption [[G3085]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] when [[G5613]] they had performed [[G5055]] all things [[G537]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] they returned [[G5290]] into [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] to [[G1519]] their own [[G846]] city [[G4172]] Nazareth. [[G3478]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] child [[G3813]] grew, [[G837]] and [[G2532]] waxed strong [[G2901]] in spirit, [[G4151]] filled [[G4137]] with wisdom: [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] the grace [[G5485]] of God [[G2316]] was [[G2258]] upon [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 41
Now [[G2532]] his [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] every [[G2596]] year [[G2094]] the [[G3588]] at [[G1859]] feast [[G1859]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3957]] passover. [[G3957]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] he was [[G1096]] twelve [[G1427]] years old, [[G2094]] they [[G846]] went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] after [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] custom [[G1485]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1859]] feast. [[G1859]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] when they had fulfilled [[G5048]] the [[G3588]] days, [[G2250]] as [[G1722]] they [[G846]] returned, [[G5290]] the [[G3588]] child [[G3816]] Jesus [[G2424]] tarried behind [[G5278]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem; [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] Joseph [[G2501]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] knew [[G1097]] not [[G3756]]

### 44
But [[G1161]] they, supposing [[G3543]] him [[G846]] to have been [[G1511]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] company, [[G4923]] went [[G2064]] a day's [[G2250]] journey; [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] they sought [[G327]] him [[G846]] among [[G1722]] kinsfolk [[G4773]] and [[G2532]] acquaintance. [[G1110]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] when they found [[G2147]] him [[G846]] not, [[G3361]] they turned back again [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] seeking [[G2212]] him. [[G846]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] they found [[G2147]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] sitting [[G2516]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1320]] doctors, [[G1320]] both [[G2532]] hearing [[G191]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] asking questions. [[G1905]] them [[G846]]

### 47
And [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] that heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] were astonished [[G1839]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] understanding [[G4907]] and [[G2532]] answers. [[G612]]

### 48
And [[G2532]] when they saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] they were amazed: [[G1605]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Son, [[G5043]] why [[G5101]] hast thou [[G4160]] thus [[G3779]] dealt [[G4160]] with us? [[G2254]] behold, [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] father [[G3962]] and I [[G2504]] have sought [[G2212]] thee [[G4571]] sorrowing. [[G3600]]

### 49
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] How [[G5101]] is it that [[G3754]] ye sought [[G2212]] me? [[G3165]] wist ye [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] I [[G3165]] must [[G1163]] be [[G1511]] about [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] Father's [[G3962]] business? [[G3588]]

### 50
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] understood [[G4920]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] saying [[G4487]] which [[G3739]] he spake [[G2980]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 51
And [[G2532]] he went down [[G2597]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Nazareth, [[G3478]] and [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] subject unto [[G5293]] them: [[G846]] but [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] kept [[G1301]] all [[G3956]] these [[G5023]] sayings [[G4487]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]]

### 52
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] increased [[G4298]] in wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] stature, [[G2244]] and [[G2532]] in favour [[G5485]] with [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] man. [[G444]]
