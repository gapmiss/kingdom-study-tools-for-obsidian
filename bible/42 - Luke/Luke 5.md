### 1
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that, as [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] pressed upon [[G1945]] him [[G846]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God, [[G2316]] he [[G846]] stood [[G2258]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] of Gennesaret, [[G1082]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] two [[G1417]] ships [[G4143]] standing [[G2476]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] lake: [[G3041]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] fishermen [[G231]] were gone out [[G576]] of [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and were washing [[G637]] nets. [[G1350]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] he entered [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4143]] ships, [[G4143]] which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] Simon's, [[G4613]] and prayed [[G2065]] him [[G846]] that he would thrust out [[G1877]] a little [[G3641]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]] And [[G2532]] he sat down, [[G2523]] and taught [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]]

### 4
Now [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] he had left [[G3973]] speaking, [[G2980]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] Simon, [[G4613]] Launch out [[G1877]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] deep, [[G899]] and [[G2532]] let down [[G5465]] your [[G5216]] nets [[G1350]] for [[G1519]] a draught. [[G61]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] Simon [[G4613]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1988]] we have toiled [[G2872]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] night, [[G3571]] and have taken [[G2983]] nothing: [[G3762]] nevertheless [[G1161]] at [[G1909]] thy [[G4675]] word [[G4487]] I will let down [[G5465]] the [[G3588]] net. [[G1350]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] when they had [[G4160]] done, [[G4160]] they inclosed [[G4788]] a great [[G4183]] multitude [[G4128]] of fishes: [[G2486]] and [[G1161]] their [[G846]] net [[G1350]] brake. [[G1284]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] they beckoned [[G2656]] unto partners, [[G3353]] which [[G3588]] were in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] ship, [[G4143]] that they should come [[G2064]] and help [[G4815]] them. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] they came, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] filled [[G4130]] both [[G297]] the [[G3588]] ships, [[G4143]] so that [[G5620]] they [[G846]] began to sink. [[G1036]]

### 8
When [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] saw [[G1492]] he fell down at [[G4363]] Jesus' [[G2424]] knees, [[G1119]] saying, [[G3004]] Depart [[G1831]] from [[G575]] me; [[G1700]] for [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] a sinful [[G268]] man, [[G435]] O Lord. [[G2962]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] he [[G846]] was astonished, [[G2285]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] were with [[G4862]] him, [[G846]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] draught [[G61]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2486]] fishes [[G2486]] which [[G3739]] they had taken: [[G4815]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] so [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] the sons [[G5207]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] which [[G3739]] were [[G2258]] partners [[G2844]] with Simon. [[G4613]] And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] Simon, [[G4613]] Fear [[G5399]] not; [[G3361]] from [[G575]] henceforth [[G3568]] thou shalt [[G2071]] catch [[G2221]] men. [[G444]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] when they had brought [[G2609]] their [[G3588]] ships [[G4143]] to [[G1909]] land, [[G1093]] they forsook [[G863]] all, [[G537]] and followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] when [[G1722]] he [[G846]] was [[G1511]] in [[G1722]] a certain [[G1520]] city, [[G4172]] behold [[G2400]] a man [[G435]] full [[G4134]] of leprosy: [[G3014]] who [[G2532]] seeing [[G1492]] Jesus [[G2424]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] face, [[G4383]] and besought [[G1189]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1437]] thou wilt, [[G2309]] thou canst [[G1410]] me [[G3165]] make [[G2511]] clean. [[G2511]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he put forth [[G1614]] hand, [[G5495]] and touched [[G680]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G2036]] I will: [[G2309]] be thou clean. [[G2511]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] leprosy [[G3014]] departed [[G565]] from [[G575]] him. [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] charged [[G3853]] him [[G846]] to tell [[G2036]] no man: [[G3367]] but [[G235]] go, [[G565]] and shew [[G1166]] thyself [[G4572]] the [[G3588]] to [[G2409]] priest, [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] offer [[G4374]] for [[G4012]] thy [[G4675]] cleansing, [[G2512]] according as [[G2531]] Moses [[G3475]] commanded, [[G4367]] for [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] so much the more [[G3123]] went there [[G1330]] a [[G3588]] fame [[G3056]] abroad [[G1330]] of [[G4012]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] multitudes [[G3793]] came together [[G4905]] to hear, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] to be healed [[G2323]] by [[G5259]] him [[G846]] of [[G575]] their [[G846]] infirmities. [[G769]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] he [[G846]] withdrew [[G5298]] himself [[G846]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] and [[G2532]] prayed. [[G4336]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] it came to pass [[G1096]] on [[G1722]] a certain [[G1520]] day, [[G2250]] as [[G2532]] he [[G846]] was [[G2258]] teaching, [[G1321]] that [[G2532]] there were [[G2258]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] doctors of the law [[G3547]] sitting by, [[G2521]] which [[G3739]] were [[G2258]] come [[G2064]] out of [[G1537]] every [[G3956]] town [[G2968]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Jerusalem: [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] the power [[G1411]] of the Lord [[G2962]] was [[G2258]] to [[G1519]] heal [[G2390]] them. [[G846]]

### 18
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] men [[G435]] brought [[G5342]] in [[G1909]] a bed [[G2825]] a man [[G444]] which [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] taken with a palsy: [[G3886]] and [[G2532]] they sought [[G2212]] to bring in, [[G1533]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to lay [[G5087]] before [[G1799]] him. [[G846]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] when they could [[G2147]] find [[G2147]] by [[G1223]] what [[G4169]] they might bring in [[G1533]] him [[G846]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] multitude, [[G3793]] they went [[G305]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetop, [[G1430]] and let [[G2524]] him [[G846]] down [[G2524]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] tiling [[G2766]] with [[G4862]] couch [[G2826]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] midst [[G3319]] before [[G1715]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] when he saw [[G1492]] their [[G846]] faith, [[G4102]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Man, [[G444]] thy [[G4675]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven [[G863]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] began [[G756]] to reason, [[G1260]] saying, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] this [[G3778]] which [[G3739]] speaketh [[G2980]] blasphemies? [[G988]] Who [[G5101]] can [[G1410]] forgive [[G863]] sins, [[G266]] but [[G3361]] God [[G2316]] alone? [[G3441]]

### 22
But when [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] perceived [[G1921]] their [[G846]] thoughts, [[G1261]] he answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] reason ye [[G1260]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] hearts? [[G2588]]

### 23
Whether [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] easier, [[G2123]] to say, [[G2036]] Thy [[G4675]] sins [[G266]] be forgiven [[G863]] thee; [[G4671]] or [[G2228]] to say, [[G2036]] Rise up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] walk? [[G4043]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] that [[G2443]] ye may know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] hath [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] upon [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] to forgive [[G863]] sins, [[G266]] (he said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto sick of the [[G3886]] palsy,) [[G3886]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Arise, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] thy [[G4675]] couch, [[G2826]] and go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] thine [[G4675]] house. [[G3624]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G3916]] he rose up [[G450]] before [[G1799]] them, [[G846]] and took up [[G142]] that [[G3739]] whereon [[G1909]] he lay, [[G2621]] and departed [[G565]] to [[G1519]] his own [[G846]] house, [[G3624]] glorifying [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] they were [[G2983]] all [[G537]] amazed, [[G1611]] and [[G2532]] they glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] were filled [[G4130]] with fear, [[G5401]] saying, [[G3004]] We have seen [[G1492]] strange things [[G3861]] to day. [[G4594]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] he went forth, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2300]] a publican, [[G5057]] named [[G3686]] Levi, [[G3018]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] receipt of custom: [[G5058]] and [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] he left [[G2641]] all, [[G537]] rose up, [[G450]] and followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] Levi [[G3018]] made [[G4160]] him [[G846]] a great [[G3173]] feast [[G1403]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] house: [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] there was [[G2258]] a great [[G4183]] company [[G3793]] of publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] of others [[G243]] that [[G3739]] sat down [[G2621]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]]

### 30
But [[G2532]] their [[G846]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] murmured [[G1111]] against [[G4314]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] saying, [[G3004]] Why [[G1302]] do ye eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] with [[G3326]] publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners? [[G268]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] They [[G3588]] are [[G2192]] that [[G5198]] whole [[G5198]] need [[G5532]] not [[G3756]] a physician; [[G2395]] but [[G235]] they [[G3588]] that are [[G2192]] sick. [[G2560]]

### 32
I came [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] to call [[G2564]] the righteous, [[G1342]] but [[G235]] sinners [[G268]] to [[G1519]] repentance. [[G3341]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Why do [[G1302]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] of John [[G2491]] fast [[G3522]] often, [[G4437]] and [[G2532]] make [[G4160]] prayers, [[G1162]] and [[G2532]] likewise [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees; [[G5330]] but [[G1161]] thine [[G4674]] eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink? [[G4095]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Can ye [[G1410]] make [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] bridechamber [[G3567]] fast, [[G3522]] while [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] is [[G2076]] with [[G3326]] them? [[G846]]

### 35
But [[G1161]] the days [[G2250]] will come, [[G2064]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] shall be taken away [[G522]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and then [[G5119]] shall they fast [[G3522]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days. [[G2250]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] he spake [[G3004]] also [[G2532]] a parable [[G3850]] unto [[G4314]] them; [[G846]] No man [[G3762]] putteth [[G1911]] a piece [[G1915]] of a new [[G2537]] garment [[G2440]] upon [[G1909]] an old; [[G3820]] if [[G1487]] otherwise, [[G3361]] then [[G1161]] both [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] maketh a rent, [[G4977]] and [[G2532]] the piece [[G1915]] that [[G3588]] was out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] agreeth [[G4856]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] with [[G3820]] old. [[G3820]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] putteth [[G906]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] old [[G3820]] bottles; [[G779]] else [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] will burst [[G4486]] the [[G3588]] bottles, [[G779]] and [[G2532]] be [[G846]] spilled, [[G1632]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] bottles [[G779]] shall perish. [[G622]]

### 38
But [[G235]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] must be put [[G992]] into [[G1519]] new [[G2537]] bottles; [[G779]] and [[G2532]] both [[G297]] are preserved. [[G4933]]

### 39
No man [[G3762]] also [[G2532]] having drunk [[G4095]] old [[G3820]] straightway [[G2112]] desireth [[G2309]] new: [[G3501]] for [[G1063]] he saith, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] is [[G2076]] better. [[G5543]]
