### 1
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G537]] multitude [[G4128]] of them [[G846]] arose, [[G450]] and led [[G71]] him [[G846]] unto [[G1909]] Pilate. [[G4091]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] they began [[G756]] to accuse [[G2723]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] We found [[G2147]] this [[G5126]] perverting [[G1294]] the [[G3588]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] forbidding [[G2967]] to give [[G1325]] tribute [[G5411]] to Caesar, [[G2541]] saying [[G3004]] that he himself [[G1438]] is [[G1511]] Christ [[G5547]] a King. [[G935]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of [[G2453]] the [[G3588]] Jews? [[G2453]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] him [[G846]] and said, [[G5346]] Thou [[G4771]] sayest [[G3004]]

### 4
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] Pilate [[G4091]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] I find [[G2147]] no [[G3762]] fault [[G158]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] man. [[G444]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] were the more fierce, [[G2001]] saying, [[G3004]] He stirreth up [[G383]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] teaching [[G1321]] throughout [[G2596]] all [[G3650]] Jewry, [[G2449]] beginning [[G756]] from [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] to [[G2193]] this place. [[G5602]]

### 6
When [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] heard [[G191]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] he asked [[G1905]] whether [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] were [[G2076]] a Galilaean. [[G1057]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] as soon as he knew [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] he belonged [[G2076]] unto Herod's [[G2264]] jurisdiction, [[G1849]] he sent [[G375]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] Herod, [[G2264]] who himself [[G846]] also [[G2532]] was [[G5607]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] at [[G1722]] that [[G3778]] time. [[G2250]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] when [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] saw [[G1492]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he was [[G5463]] exceeding [[G3029]] glad: [[G5463]] for [[G1063]] he was [[G2258]] desirous [[G2309]] to see [[G1492]] him [[G846]] of [[G1537]] a long [[G2425]] because [[G1223]] he [[G3588]] had heard [[G191]] many things [[G4183]] of [[G4012]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he hoped [[G1679]] to have seen [[G1492]] some [[G5100]] miracle [[G4592]] done [[G1096]] by [[G5259]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
Then [[G1161]] he [[G846]] questioned [[G1905]] with him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] many [[G2425]] words; [[G3056]] but [[G1161]] he answered [[G611]] him [[G846]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] stood [[G2476]] vehemently [[G2159]] and [[G2723]] accused [[G2723]] him. [[G846]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] with [[G4862]] his [[G846]] men of [[G4753]] war [[G4753]] set at nought, [[G1848]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] mocked [[G1702]] and arrayed [[G4016]] him [[G846]] in a gorgeous [[G2986]] robe, [[G2066]] and sent again [[G375]] him [[G846]] to Pilate. [[G4091]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] the same [[G846]] day [[G2250]] Pilate [[G4091]] and [[G2532]] Herod [[G2264]] were made [[G1096]] friends [[G5384]] together: [[G3326]] for [[G1063]] before [[G4391]] they were [[G5607]] at [[G1722]] enmity [[G2189]] between [[G4314]] themselves. [[G1438]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] Pilate, [[G4091]] when he had called together [[G4779]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]]

### 14
Said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Ye have brought [[G4374]] this [[G5126]] man [[G444]] unto me, [[G3427]] as [[G5613]] one that perverteth [[G654]] the [[G3588]] people: [[G2992]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] I, [[G1473]] having examined [[G350]] before [[G1799]] you, [[G5216]] have found [[G2147]] no [[G3762]] fault [[G158]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] man [[G444]] touching those things whereof [[G3739]] ye accuse [[G2723]] him: [[G846]]

### 15
No, [[G235]] nor yet [[G3761]] Herod: [[G2264]] for [[G1063]] I sent [[G375]] you [[G5209]] to [[G4314]] him; [[G846]] and, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] nothing [[G3762]] worthy [[G514]] of death [[G2288]] is [[G2076]] done [[G4238]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 16
I will [[G3811]] therefore [[G3767]] chastise [[G3811]] him, [[G846]] and release [[G630]]

### 17
(For [[G1161]] of necessity [[G318]] he must [[G2192]] release [[G630]] one [[G1520]] unto them [[G846]] at [[G2596]] the feast.) [[G1859]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] they cried out [[G349]] all at once, [[G3826]] saying, [[G3004]] Away with [[G142]] this [[G5126]] and [[G1161]] release [[G630]] unto us [[G2254]] Barabbas: [[G912]]

### 19
(Who [[G3748]] for [[G1223]] a certain [[G5100]] sedition [[G4714]] made [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] for murder, [[G5408]] was [[G2258]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison.) [[G5438]]

### 20
Pilate [[G4091]] therefore, [[G3767]] willing [[G2309]] to release [[G630]] Jesus, [[G2424]] spake [[G4377]] again to them. [[G3825]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] cried, [[G2019]] saying, [[G3004]] Crucify [[G4717]] crucify [[G4717]] him. [[G846]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] the third time, [[G5154]] Why, [[G5101]] what [[G1063]] evil [[G2556]] hath [[G4160]] he [[G3778]] done? [[G4160]] I have found [[G2147]] no [[G3762]] cause [[G158]] of death [[G2288]] in [[G1722]] him: [[G846]] I will [[G3811]] therefore [[G3767]] chastise [[G3811]] him, [[G846]] and let go. [[G630]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] were instant [[G1945]] with loud [[G3173]] voices, [[G5456]] requiring [[G154]] he [[G846]] that might be [[G4717]] crucified. [[G4717]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] voices [[G5456]] of them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of chief [[G749]] priests [[G749]] prevailed. [[G2729]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] gave sentence [[G1948]] that it should be [[G1096]] as they [[G846]] required. [[G155]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] he released [[G630]] unto them [[G846]] him that [[G3588]] for [[G1223]] sedition [[G4714]] and [[G2532]] murder [[G5408]] was cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] whom [[G3739]] they had desired; [[G154]] but [[G1161]] he delivered [[G3860]] Jesus [[G2424]] to their [[G846]] will. [[G2307]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] they led away, [[G520]] him [[G846]] they laid hold upon [[G1949]] one [[G5100]] Simon, [[G4613]] a Cyrenian, [[G2956]] coming out [[G2064]] of [[G575]] the country, [[G68]] and they [[G2007]] on him [[G846]] laid [[G2007]] the [[G3588]] cross, [[G4716]] that he might bear [[G5342]] after [[G3693]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] there followed [[G190]] him [[G846]] a great [[G4183]] company [[G4128]] of [[G2992]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] of women, [[G1135]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] bewailed [[G2875]] and [[G2532]] lamented [[G2354]] him. [[G846]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] turning [[G4762]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] Daughters [[G2364]] of Jerusalem, [[G2419]] weep [[G2799]] not [[G3361]] for [[G1909]] me, [[G1691]] but [[G4133]] weep [[G2799]] for [[G1909]] yourselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1909]] your [[G5216]] children. [[G5043]]

### 29
For, [[G3754]] behold, [[G2400]] the days [[G2250]] are coming, [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] they shall say, [[G2046]] Blessed [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] barren, [[G4723]] and [[G2532]] the wombs [[G2836]] that [[G3739]] never [[G3756]] bare, [[G1080]] and [[G2532]] the paps [[G3149]] which [[G3739]] never [[G3756]] gave suck. [[G2337]]

### 30
Then [[G5119]] shall they begin [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3735]] mountains, [[G3735]] Fall [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] us; [[G2248]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] to [[G1015]] hills, [[G1015]] Cover [[G2572]] us. [[G2248]]

### 31
For [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] they do [[G4160]] these things [[G5023]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] green [[G5200]] tree, [[G3586]] what [[G5101]] shall be done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] dry? [[G3584]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] there were [[G71]] also [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] other, [[G2087]] malefactors, [[G2557]] led [[G71]] with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] to be put to death. [[G337]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] they were come [[G565]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] place, [[G5117]] which [[G3588]] is called [[G2564]] Calvary, [[G2898]] there [[G1563]] they crucified [[G4717]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] malefactors, [[G2557]] one [[G3739]] on [[G1537]] the right hand, [[G1188]] and [[G1161]] the other [[G3739]] on [[G1537]] the left. [[G710]]

### 34
Then [[G1161]] said [[G3004]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Father, [[G3962]] forgive [[G863]] them; [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G5101]] they do. [[G4160]] And [[G1161]] they parted [[G1266]] his [[G846]] raiment, [[G2440]] and cast [[G906]] lots. [[G2819]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] stood [[G2476]] beholding. [[G2334]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] also [[G2532]] with [[G4862]] them [[G846]] derided [[G1592]] saying, [[G3004]] He saved [[G4982]] others; [[G243]] let him save [[G4982]] himself, [[G1438]] if [[G1487]] he [[G3778]] be [[G2076]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] chosen [[G1588]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] also [[G2532]] mocked [[G1702]] him, [[G846]] coming to [[G4334]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] offering him [[G4374]] vinegar, [[G3690]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1487]] thou [[G4771]] be [[G1488]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews, [[G2453]] save [[G4982]] thyself. [[G4572]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] a superscription [[G1923]] also [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] written [[G1125]] over [[G1909]] him [[G846]] in letters [[G1121]] of Greek, [[G1673]] and [[G2532]] Latin, [[G4513]] and [[G2532]] Hebrew, [[G1444]] THIS [[G3778]] IS [[G2076]] THE [[G3588]] KING [[G935]] THE [[G3588]] OF [[G2453]] JEWS. [[G2453]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] of [[G2557]] the [[G3588]] malefactors [[G2557]] which were hanged [[G2910]] railed [[G987]] on [[G846]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1487]] thou [[G4771]] be [[G1488]] Christ, [[G5547]] save [[G4982]] thyself [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] us. [[G2248]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] answering [[G611]] rebuked [[G2008]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] not [[G3761]] Dost [[G5399]] thou [[G4771]] fear [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] seeing [[G3754]] thou art [[G1488]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] condemnation? [[G2917]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] we [[G2249]] indeed [[G3303]] justly; [[G1346]] for [[G1063]] we receive [[G618]] the due reward [[G514]]  of [[G3739]] our deeds: [[G4238]] but [[G1161]] this man [[G3778]] hath done [[G4238]] nothing [[G3762]] amiss. [[G824]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Lord, [[G2962]] remember [[G3415]] me [[G3450]] when [[G3752]] thou comest [[G2064]] into [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] kingdom. [[G932]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] To day [[G4594]] shalt thou be [[G2071]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] in [[G1722]] paradise. [[G3857]]

### 44
And [[G1161]] it was [[G2258]] about [[G5616]] the sixth [[G1623]] hour, [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] there was [[G1096]] a darkness [[G4655]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] until [[G2193]] the ninth [[G1766]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] was darkened, [[G4654]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] veil [[G2665]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3485]] temple [[G3485]] was rent [[G4977]] in the midst. [[G3319]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] when [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] had cried [[G5455]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] he said, [[G2036]] Father, [[G3962]] into [[G1519]] thy [[G4675]] hands [[G5495]] I commend [[G3908]] my [[G3450]] spirit: [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] having said [[G2036]] thus, [[G5023]] he gave up the ghost. [[G1606]]

### 47
Now [[G1161]] when [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] saw [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] was done, [[G1096]] he glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] saying, [[G3004]] Certainly [[G3689]] this [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] a righteous [[G1342]] man. [[G444]]

### 48
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] that came together [[G4836]] to [[G1909]] that [[G3778]] sight, [[G2335]] beholding [[G2334]] the things which [[G3588]] were done, [[G1096]] smote [[G5180]] their [[G1438]] breasts, [[G4738]] and returned. [[G5290]]

### 49
And [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] acquaintance, [[G1110]] and [[G2532]] the women [[G1135]] that [[G3588]] followed [[G4870]] him [[G846]] from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] stood [[G2476]] afar off, [[G3113]] beholding [[G3708]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 50
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Joseph, [[G2501]] a counseller; [[G1010]] a good [[G18]] man, [[G435]] and [[G2532]] a just: [[G1342]]

### 51
(The same [[G3778]] had [[G2258]] not [[G3756]] consented [[G4784]] to [[G1012]] the [[G3588]] counsel [[G1012]] and [[G2532]] deed [[G4234]] of them;) [[G846]] of [[G575]] Arimathaea, [[G707]] a city [[G4172]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews: [[G2453]] who [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] himself [[G846]] waited for [[G4327]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 52
This [[G3778]] went [[G4334]] unto [[G4091]] Pilate, [[G4091]] and begged [[G154]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of [[G2424]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 53
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] took it down, [[G2507]] and wrapped [[G1794]] it [[G846]] in linen, [[G4616]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a sepulchre [[G3418]] that was hewn in stone, [[G2991]] wherein [[G3757]] never [[G3756]] man [[G3762]] before [[G3764]] was [[G2258]] laid. [[G2749]]

### 54
And [[G2532]] that day [[G2250]] was [[G2258]] the preparation, [[G3904]] and [[G2532]] the sabbath [[G4521]] drew on. [[G2020]]

### 55
And [[G1161]] the women [[G1135]] also, [[G2532]] which [[G3748]] came [[G4905]] with him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] Galilee, [[G1056]] followed after, [[G2628]] and beheld [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] how [[G5613]] his [[G846]] body [[G4983]] was laid. [[G5087]]

### 56
And [[G1161]] they returned, [[G5290]] and prepared [[G2090]] spices [[G759]] and [[G2532]] ointments; [[G3464]] and [[G2532]] rested [[G2270]] the [[G3588]] day [[G4521]] sabbath [[G4521]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] commandment. [[G1785]]
