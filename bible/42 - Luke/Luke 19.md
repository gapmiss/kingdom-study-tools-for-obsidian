### 1
And [[G2532]] entered [[G1525]] and passed [[G1330]] through [[G2410]] Jericho. [[G2410]]

### 2
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Zacchaeus, [[G2195]] which [[G846]] was [[G2258]] the chief among the publicans, [[G754]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] rich. [[G4145]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he sought [[G2212]] to see [[G1492]] Jesus [[G2424]] who [[G5101]] he was; [[G2076]] and [[G2532]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] for [[G575]] the [[G3588]] press, [[G3793]] because [[G3754]] he was [[G2258]] little [[G3398]] of [[G2244]] stature. [[G2244]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] he ran [[G4390]] before, [[G1715]] and climbed up [[G305]] into [[G1909]] a sycomore tree [[G4809]] to [[G2443]] see [[G1492]] him: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] he was [[G3195]] to pass [[G1330]] that [[G1565]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when [[G5613]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] place, [[G5117]] he looked up, [[G308]] and saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Zacchaeus, [[G2195]] make haste, [[G4692]] and come down; [[G2597]] for [[G1063]] to day [[G4594]] I [[G3165]] must [[G1163]] abide [[G3306]] at [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] house. [[G3624]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] he made haste, [[G4692]] and came down, [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] received [[G5264]] him [[G846]] joyfully. [[G5463]]

### 7
And when [[G2532]] they saw [[G1492]] they all [[G537]] murmured, [[G1234]] saying, [[G3004]] That [[G3754]] he was gone [[G1525]] to be guest [[G2647]] with [[G3844]] a man [[G435]] that is a sinner. [[G268]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] Zacchaeus [[G2195]] stood, [[G2476]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord; [[G2962]] Behold, [[G2400]] Lord, [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] half [[G2255]] of my [[G3450]] goods [[G5224]] I give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4434]] poor; [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] any thing [[G5100]] I have taken by false [[G4811]] from any man [[G5100]] accusation, [[G4811]] I restore [[G591]] fourfold. [[G5073]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] This day [[G4594]] is salvation [[G4991]] come [[G1096]] to this [[G5129]] house, [[G3624]] forsomuch [[G3754]] as [[G2530]] he [[G846]] also [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] a son [[G5207]] of Abraham. [[G11]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] is come [[G2064]] to seek [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] to save [[G4982]] that which [[G3588]] was lost. [[G622]]

### 11
And as [[G1161]] they [[G846]] heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] he added [[G4369]] and spake [[G2036]] a parable, [[G3850]] because [[G1223]] he [[G846]] was [[G1511]] nigh [[G1451]] to [[G2419]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and because [[G2532]] they [[G846]] thought [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] should [[G3195]] immediately [[G3916]] appear. [[G398]]

### 12
He said [[G2036]] therefore, [[G3767]] A certain [[G5100]] nobleman [[G2104]] went [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] a far [[G3117]] country [[G5561]] to receive [[G2983]] for himself [[G1438]] a kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] to return. [[G5290]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] he called [[G2564]] his [[G1438]] ten [[G1176]] servants, [[G1401]] and delivered [[G1325]] them [[G846]] ten [[G1176]] pounds, [[G3414]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Occupy [[G4231]] till [[G2193]] I come. [[G2064]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] his [[G846]] citizens [[G4177]] hated [[G3404]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] a message [[G4242]] after [[G3694]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] We will have [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] this [[G5126]] to reign [[G936]] over [[G1909]] us. [[G2248]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that when [[G1722]] he was [[G846]] returned, [[G1880]] having received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] kingdom, [[G932]] then [[G2532]] he commanded [[G2036]] these [[G5128]] servants [[G1401]] to be called [[G5455]] unto him, [[G846]] to whom [[G3739]] he had given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] money, [[G694]] that [[G2443]] he might know [[G1097]] how much [[G5101]] every man [[G5101]] had gained by trading. [[G1281]]

### 16
Then [[G1161]] came [[G3854]] the [[G3588]] first, [[G4413]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] pound [[G3414]] hath gained [[G4333]] ten [[G1176]] pounds. [[G3414]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Well, [[G2095]] thou good [[G18]] servant: [[G1401]] because [[G3754]] thou hast been [[G1096]] faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] a very little, [[G1646]] have [[G2192]] thou [[G2468]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1883]] ten [[G1176]] cities. [[G4172]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] came, [[G2064]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] pound [[G3414]] hath gained [[G4160]] five [[G4002]] pounds. [[G3414]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] likewise [[G2532]] to him, [[G5129]] Be [[G1096]] thou [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] over [[G1883]] five [[G4002]] cities. [[G4172]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] another [[G2087]] came, [[G2064]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] behold, [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] pound, [[G3414]] which [[G3739]] I have [[G2192]] kept laid up [[G606]] in [[G1722]] a napkin: [[G4676]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] I feared [[G5399]] thee, [[G4571]] because [[G3754]] thou art [[G1488]] an austere [[G840]] man: [[G444]] thou takest up [[G142]] that [[G3739]] thou layedst down, [[G5087]] not [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] reapest [[G2325]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] thou didst [[G4687]] sow. [[G4687]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] he saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Out of [[G1537]] thine own [[G4675]] mouth [[G4750]] will I judge [[G2919]] thee, [[G4571]] wicked [[G4190]] servant. [[G1401]] Thou knewest [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] was [[G1510]] an austere [[G840]] man, [[G444]] taking up [[G142]] that [[G3739]] I laid down, [[G5087]] not [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] reaping [[G2325]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] I did [[G4687]] sow: [[G4687]]

### 23
Wherefore [[G1302]] then [[G2532]] thou [[G1325]] gavest [[G1325]] not [[G3756]] my [[G3450]] money [[G694]] into [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] bank, [[G5132]] that at [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] coming [[G2064]] I [[G302]] might have required [[G4238]] mine own [[G846]] with [[G4862]] usury? [[G5110]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them that [[G3588]] stood by, [[G3936]] Take [[G142]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] pound, [[G3414]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] to him that [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] ten [[G1176]] pounds. [[G3414]]

### 25
(And [[G2532]] they said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] he hath [[G2192]] ten [[G1176]] pounds.) [[G3414]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] unto every one [[G3956]] which [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] shall be given; [[G1325]] and [[G1161]] from [[G575]] him [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] not, [[G3361]] even [[G2532]] that [[G3739]] he hath [[G2192]] shall be taken away [[G142]] from [[G575]] him. [[G846]]

### 27
But [[G4133]] those [[G1565]] mine [[G3450]] enemies, [[G2190]] which [[G3588]] would [[G2309]] not [[G3361]] that I [[G3165]] should reign [[G936]] over [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] bring [[G71]] hither, [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] slay [[G2695]] before [[G1715]] me. [[G3450]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] when he had [[G2036]] thus [[G5023]] spoken, [[G2036]] he went [[G4198]] before, [[G1715]] ascending up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] when [[G5613]] he was come nigh [[G1448]] to [[G1519]] Bethphage [[G967]] and [[G2532]] Bethany, [[G963]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] called [[G2564]] of Olives, [[G1636]] he sent [[G649]] two [[G1417]] of his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 30
Saying, [[G2036]] Go ye [[G5217]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] over against [[G2713]] in [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] at your entering [[G1531]] ye shall find [[G2147]] a colt [[G4454]] tied, [[G1210]] whereon [[G1909]] yet never [[G4455]] man [[G444]] sat: [[G2523]] loose [[G3089]] him, [[G846]] and bring [[G71]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] any man [[G5100]] ask [[G2065]] you, [[G5209]] Why [[G1302]] do ye loose [[G3089]] thus [[G3779]] shall ye say [[G2046]] unto him, [[G846]] Because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] of him. [[G846]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] they that [[G3588]] were sent went [[G649]] their way, [[G565]] and found [[G2147]] even as [[G2531]] he had said [[G2036]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] as they [[G846]] were loosing [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] colt, [[G4454]] the [[G3588]] owners [[G2962]] thereof [[G846]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] loose ye [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] colt? [[G4454]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] hath [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] of him. [[G846]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] they brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] Jesus: [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] they cast [[G1977]] their [[G1438]] garments [[G2440]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] colt, [[G4454]] and they set thereon. [[G1913]] Jesus [[G2424]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] as he [[G846]] went, [[G4198]] they spread [[G5291]] their [[G846]] clothes [[G2440]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] when he [[G846]] was come nigh, [[G1448]] even now [[G2235]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] descent [[G2600]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3735]] mount [[G3735]] of Olives, [[G1636]] the whole [[G537]] multitude [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3101]] disciples [[G3101]] began [[G756]] to rejoice [[G5463]] and praise [[G134]] God [[G2316]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] for [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] the mighty works [[G1411]] that [[G3739]] they had seen; [[G1492]]

### 38
Saying, [[G3004]] Blessed [[G2127]] the King [[G935]] that [[G3588]] cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of the Lord: [[G2962]] peace [[G1515]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] in [[G1722]] the highest. [[G5310]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] from [[G575]] among [[G3793]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] rebuke [[G2008]] thy [[G4675]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] he answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] that, [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] these [[G3778]] should hold their peace, [[G4623]] the [[G3588]] stones [[G3037]] would immediately cry out. [[G2896]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] when [[G5613]] he was come near, [[G1448]] he beheld [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and wept [[G2799]] over [[G1909]] it, [[G846]]

### 42
Saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1487]] thou hadst known, [[G1097]] even [[G2532]] thou, [[G4771]] at [[G2532]] least [[G1065]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] thy [[G4675]] day, [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] things [[G3588]] unto [[G4314]] thy [[G4675]] peace! [[G1515]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] they are hid [[G2928]] from [[G575]] thine [[G4675]] eyes. [[G3788]]

### 43
For [[G3754]] the days [[G2250]] shall come [[G2240]] upon [[G1909]] thee, [[G4571]] that [[G2532]] thine [[G4675]] enemies [[G2190]] shall cast [[G4016]] a trench [[G5482]] about thee, [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] compass round, [[G4033]] thee [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] keep in [[G4912]] thee [[G4571]] on every side, [[G3840]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] shall lay even with the ground, [[G1474]] thee [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] children [[G5043]] within [[G1722]] thee; [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] they shall [[G863]] leave [[G863]] in [[G1722]] thee [[G4671]] one stone [[G3037]] upon [[G1909]] another; [[G3037]] because [[G473]] thou knewest [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] of thy [[G4675]] visitation. [[G1984]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] he went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and began [[G756]] to cast out [[G1544]] them that [[G3588]] sold [[G4453]] therein, [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] them that bought; [[G59]]

### 46
Saying [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] It is written, [[G1125]] My [[G3450]] house [[G3624]] is [[G2076]] the house [[G3624]] of prayer: [[G4335]] but [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] have made [[G4160]] it [[G846]] a den [[G4693]] of thieves. [[G3027]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] he [[G2258]] taught [[G1321]] daily [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]] But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief [[G749]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief [[G4413]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] sought [[G2212]] to destroy [[G622]] him, [[G846]]

### 48
And [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] could [[G2147]] find [[G2147]] what [[G5101]] they might do: [[G4160]] for [[G1063]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] were very attentive [[G1582]] to hear [[G191]] him. [[G846]]
