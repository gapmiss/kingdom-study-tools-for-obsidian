### 1
Now [[G1161]] when [[G1893]] he had ended [[G4137]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] sayings [[G4487]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] audience [[G189]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people, [[G2992]] he entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] Capernaum. [[G2584]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] centurion's [[G1543]] servant, [[G1401]] who [[G3739]] was [[G2258]] dear [[G1784]] unto him, [[G846]] was [[G2192]] sick, [[G2560]] and ready [[G3195]] to die. [[G5053]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] when he heard [[G191]] of [[G4012]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] the elders [[G4245]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2453]] Jews, [[G2453]] beseeching [[G2065]] him [[G846]] that [[G3704]] he would come [[G2064]] and heal [[G1295]] his [[G846]] servant. [[G1401]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] when [[G3854]] came [[G3854]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] they besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] instantly, [[G4709]] saying, [[G3004]] That [[G3754]] he was [[G2076]] worthy [[G514]] for whom [[G3739]] he should do [[G3930]] this: [[G5124]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] he loveth [[G25]] our [[G2257]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] hath built [[G3618]] us [[G2254]] a [[G3588]] synagogue. [[G4864]]

### 6
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G4198]] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]] And [[G1161]] when he [[G846]] was [[G568]] now [[G2235]] not [[G3756]] far [[G3112]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] sent [[G3992]] friends [[G5384]] to [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] trouble thyself: [[G4660]] not [[G3361]] for [[G1063]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] that [[G2443]] thou shouldest enter [[G1525]] under [[G5259]] my [[G3450]] roof: [[G4721]]

### 7
Wherefore [[G1352]] neither [[G3761]] myself [[G1683]] thought I [[G515]] worthy [[G515]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] thee: [[G4571]] but [[G235]] say [[G2036]] in a word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] servant [[G3816]] shall be healed. [[G2390]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] also [[G2532]] am [[G1510]] a man [[G444]] set [[G5021]] under [[G5259]] authority, [[G1849]] having [[G2192]] under [[G5259]] me [[G1683]] soldiers, [[G4757]] and [[G2532]] I say [[G3004]] unto one, [[G5129]] Go, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] he goeth; [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] to another, [[G243]] Come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] he cometh; [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] to my [[G3450]] servant, [[G1401]] Do [[G4160]] this, [[G5124]] and [[G2532]] he doeth [[G4160]]

### 9
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] he marvelled [[G2296]] at him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] turned him about, [[G4762]] and said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3793]] people [[G3793]] that followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] not no, [[G3761]] I have found [[G2147]] so great [[G5118]] faith, [[G4102]] not [[G3761]] in [[G1722]] Israel. [[G2474]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] they that were sent, [[G3992]] returning [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3624]] found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] whole [[G5198]] that had been sick. [[G770]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] it came to pass [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] day after, [[G1836]] that he went [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] a city [[G4172]] called [[G2564]] Nain; [[G3484]] and [[G2532]] many [[G2425]] of his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] went with [[G4848]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] much [[G4183]] people. [[G3793]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] he came nigh [[G1448]] the [[G3588]] to [[G4439]] gate [[G4439]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city, [[G4172]] behold, [[G2400]] there was out, [[G1580]] a dead man [[G2348]] carried [[G1580]] the only [[G3439]] son [[G5207]] of his [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] she [[G846]] was [[G2258]] a widow: [[G5503]] and [[G2532]] much [[G2425]] people [[G3793]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city [[G4172]] was [[G2258]] with [[G4862]] her. [[G846]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] when [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] saw [[G1492]] her, [[G846]] he had compassion [[G4697]] on [[G1909]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Weep [[G2799]] not. [[G3361]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] he came [[G4334]] and touched [[G680]] the [[G3588]] bier: [[G4673]] and [[G1161]] they that bare [[G941]] stood still. [[G2476]] And [[G2532]] he said, [[G2036]] Young man, [[G3495]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Arise. [[G1453]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he that was dead [[G3498]] sat up, [[G339]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to speak. [[G2980]] And [[G2532]] he delivered [[G1325]] him [[G846]] to his [[G846]] mother. [[G3384]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] there came [[G2983]] a fear [[G5401]] on all: [[G537]] and [[G2532]] they glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] saying, [[G3004]] That [[G3754]] a great [[G3173]] prophet [[G4396]] is risen up [[G1453]] among [[G1722]] us; [[G2254]] and, [[G2532]] That [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] hath visited [[G1980]] his [[G846]] people. [[G2992]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] rumour [[G3056]] of [[G4012]] him [[G846]] went forth [[G1831]] throughout [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] throughout [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] region round about. [[G4066]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] of John [[G2491]] shewed [[G518]] him [[G846]] of [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] these things. [[G5130]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] calling [[G4341]] two [[G1417]] of his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] sent [[G3992]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] saying, [[G3004]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] he that should come? [[G2064]] or [[G2228]] look we [[G4328]] for another? [[G243]]

### 20
When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] were come [[G3854]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] they said, [[G2036]] John [[G2491]] Baptist [[G910]] hath sent [[G649]] us [[G2248]] unto [[G4314]] thee, [[G4571]] saying, [[G3004]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] he that should come? [[G2064]] or [[G2228]] look we [[G4328]] for another? [[G243]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] that [[G3588]] same [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] he cured [[G2323]] many [[G4183]] of [[G575]] infirmities [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] plagues, [[G3148]] and [[G2532]] of evil [[G4190]] spirits; [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] unto many [[G4183]] blind [[G5185]] he gave [[G5483]] sight. [[G991]]

### 22
Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Go your way, [[G4198]] and tell [[G518]] John [[G2491]] what things [[G3739]] ye have seen [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] heard; [[G191]] how that [[G3754]] the blind [[G5185]] see, [[G308]] the lame [[G5560]] walk, [[G4043]] the lepers [[G3015]] are cleansed, [[G2511]] the deaf [[G2974]] hear, [[G191]] the dead [[G3498]] are raised, [[G1453]] to the poor [[G4434]] the gospel is preached. [[G2097]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] blessed [[G3107]] is [[G2076]] whosoever [[G3739]] not [[G3361]] shall be [[G4624]] offended [[G4624]] in [[G1722]] me. [[G1698]]

### 24
And when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] messengers [[G32]] of John [[G2491]] were departed, [[G565]] he began [[G756]] to speak [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] concerning [[G4012]] John, [[G2491]] What [[G5101]] went ye out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] for to see? [[G2300]] A reed [[G2563]] shaken [[G4531]] with [[G5259]] the wind? [[G417]]

### 25
But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] went ye out [[G1831]] for to see? [[G1492]] A man [[G444]] clothed [[G294]] in [[G1722]] soft [[G3120]] raiment? [[G2440]] Behold, [[G2400]] they which [[G3588]] are [[G1722]] gorgeously [[G1741]] apparelled, [[G2441]] and [[G2532]] live [[G5225]] delicately, [[G5172]] are [[G1526]] in [[G1722]] kings' courts. [[G933]]

### 26
But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] went ye out [[G1831]] for to see? [[G1492]] A prophet? [[G4396]] Yea, [[G3483]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] much more than [[G4054]] a prophet. [[G4396]]

### 27
This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] of [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] it is written, [[G1125]] Behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] send [[G649]] my [[G3450]] messenger [[G32]] before [[G4253]] thy [[G4675]] face, [[G4383]] which [[G3739]] shall prepare [[G2680]] thy [[G4675]] way [[G3598]] before [[G1715]] thee. [[G4675]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Among [[G1722]] those that are born [[G1084]] of women [[G1135]] there is [[G2076]] not [[G3762]] a greater than [[G3187]] prophet [[G4396]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist: [[G910]] but [[G1161]] he that is least [[G3398]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] greater than [[G3187]] he. [[G846]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] that heard [[G191]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] publicans, [[G5057]] justified [[G1344]] God, [[G2316]] being baptized [[G907]] the [[G3588]] with [[G908]] baptism [[G908]] of John. [[G2491]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] lawyers [[G3544]] rejected [[G114]] the [[G3588]] counsel [[G1012]] of God [[G2316]] against [[G1519]] themselves, [[G1438]] not [[G3361]] being [[G907]] baptized [[G907]] of [[G5259]] him. [[G846]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said, [[G2036]] Whereunto [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] shall I liken [[G3666]] the [[G3588]] men [[G444]] of this [[G3778]] generation? [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] to what [[G5101]] are they [[G1526]] like? [[G3664]]

### 32
They are [[G1526]] like [[G3664]] unto [[G3813]] children [[G3813]] sitting [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplace, [[G58]] and [[G2532]] calling [[G4377]] one to another, [[G240]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] We have piped [[G832]] unto you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G3738]] danced; [[G3738]] we have mourned [[G2354]] to you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G2799]] wept. [[G2799]]

### 33
For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G910]] came [[G2064]] neither [[G3383]] eating [[G2068]] bread [[G740]] nor [[G3383]] drinking [[G4095]] wine; [[G3631]] and [[G2532]] ye say, [[G3004]] He hath [[G2192]] a devil. [[G1140]]

### 34
The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is come [[G2064]] eating [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinking; [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] ye say, [[G3004]] Behold [[G2400]] a gluttonous [[G5314]] man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] a winebibber, [[G3630]] a friend [[G5384]] of publicans [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners! [[G268]]

### 35
But [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] is justified [[G1344]] of [[G575]] all [[G3956]] her [[G846]] children. [[G5043]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] desired [[G2065]] him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he would eat [[G5315]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] he went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Pharisee's [[G5330]] house, [[G3614]] and sat down to meat. [[G347]]

### 37
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a woman [[G1135]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] which [[G3748]] was [[G2258]] a sinner, [[G268]] when she knew [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] sat at meat [[G345]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Pharisee's [[G5330]] house, [[G3614]] brought [[G2865]] an alabaster box [[G211]] of ointment, [[G3464]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] stood [[G2476]] at [[G3844]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] behind [[G3694]] weeping, [[G2799]] and began [[G756]] to wash [[G1026]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] with tears, [[G1144]] and [[G2532]] did wipe [[G1591]] the [[G3588]] with [[G2359]] hairs [[G2359]] of her [[G846]] head, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] kissed [[G2705]] his [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] anointed [[G218]] the [[G3588]] with [[G3464]] ointment. [[G3464]]

### 39
Now [[G1161]] when [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] Pharisee [[G5330]] which [[G3588]] had bidden [[G2564]] him [[G846]] saw [[G1492]] he spake [[G3004]] within [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] saying, [[G2036]] This man, [[G3778]] if [[G1487]] he were [[G2258]] a prophet, [[G4396]] would have known [[G1097]] who [[G5101]] and [[G2532]] what manner [[G4217]] of woman [[G1135]] that [[G3748]] toucheth [[G680]] him: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] she is [[G2076]] a sinner. [[G268]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Simon, [[G4613]] I have [[G2192]] somewhat [[G5100]] to say [[G2036]] unto thee. [[G4671]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] saith, [[G5346]] Master, [[G1320]] say on. [[G2036]]

### 41
There was which had [[G2258]] a certain [[G5100]] creditor [[G1157]] two [[G1417]] debtors: [[G5533]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] owed [[G3784]] five hundred [[G4001]] pence, [[G1220]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] fifty. [[G4004]]

### 42
And [[G1161]] when [[G2192]] they [[G846]] had [[G2192]] nothing [[G3361]] to pay, [[G591]] he frankly forgave [[G5483]] them both. [[G297]] Tell me [[G2036]] therefore, [[G3767]] which [[G5101]] of them [[G846]] will love [[G25]] him [[G846]] most? [[G4119]]

### 43
Simon [[G4613]] answered [[G611]] and [[G1161]] said, [[G2036]] I suppose [[G5274]] that [[G3754]] to whom [[G3739]] he forgave [[G5483]] most. [[G4119]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] rightly [[G3723]] Thou hast [[G2919]] judged. [[G2919]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] he turned [[G4762]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] and said [[G5346]] unto Simon, [[G4613]] Seest thou [[G991]] this [[G3778]] woman? [[G1135]] I entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] thine [[G4675]] house, [[G3614]] thou gavest me [[G1325]] no [[G3756]] water [[G5204]] for [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] feet: [[G4228]] but [[G1161]] she [[G846]] hath washed [[G1026]] my [[G3450]] feet [[G4228]] with tears, [[G1144]] and [[G2532]] wiped [[G1591]] the [[G3588]] with [[G2359]] hairs [[G2359]] of her [[G846]] head. [[G2776]]

### 45
Thou gavest [[G1325]] me [[G3427]] no [[G3756]] kiss: [[G5370]] but [[G1161]] this woman [[G846]] since [[G575]] the time [[G3739]] I came in [[G1525]] not [[G3756]] hath [[G1257]] ceased [[G1257]] to kiss [[G2705]] my [[G3450]] feet. [[G4228]]

### 46
My [[G3450]] head [[G2776]] with oil [[G1637]] not [[G3756]] thou didst [[G218]] anoint: [[G218]] but [[G1161]] this woman [[G846]] hath anointed [[G218]] my [[G3450]] feet [[G4228]] with ointment. [[G3464]]

### 47
Wherefore [[G3739]] I say [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Her [[G846]] sins, [[G266]] which [[G3588]] are many, [[G4183]] are forgiven; [[G863]] for [[G3754]] she loved [[G25]] much: [[G4183]] but [[G1161]] to whom [[G3739]] little [[G3641]] is forgiven, [[G863]] loveth [[G25]] little. [[G3641]]

### 48
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Thy [[G4675]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven. [[G863]]

### 49
And [[G2532]] they [[G756]] that [[G3588]] sat at meat with him [[G4873]] began [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] within [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] Who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] this [[G3778]] that [[G3739]] forgiveth [[G863]] sins [[G266]] also? [[G2532]]

### 50
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] Thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] hath saved [[G4982]] thee; [[G4571]] go [[G4198]] in [[G1519]] peace. [[G1515]]
