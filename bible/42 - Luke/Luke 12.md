### 1
In [[G1722]] the mean time, [[G3739]] when there were gathered together [[G1996]] an innumerable multitude [[G3461]] of people, [[G3793]] insomuch that [[G5620]] they trode [[G2662]] one upon another, [[G240]] he began [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] first of all, [[G4412]] Beware [[G4337]] ye [[G1438]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] leaven [[G2219]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] which [[G3748]] is [[G2076]] hypocrisy. [[G5272]]

### 2
For [[G1161]] there is [[G2076]] nothing [[G3762]] covered, [[G4780]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G601]] revealed; [[G601]] neither [[G2532]] hid, [[G2927]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G1097]] known. [[G1097]]

### 3
Therefore [[G473]] whatsoever [[G3745]] ye have spoken [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] darkness [[G4653]] shall be heard [[G191]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light; [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] that which [[G3739]] ye have spoken [[G2980]] in [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] ear [[G3775]] in [[G1722]] closets [[G5009]] shall be proclaimed [[G2784]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetops. [[G1430]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you [[G5213]] my [[G3450]] friends, [[G5384]] not [[G3361]] Be [[G5399]] afraid [[G5399]] of [[G575]] them [[G3588]] that kill [[G615]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] that [[G5023]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] more [[G4053]] that [[G5100]] they can do. [[G4160]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] I will forewarn [[G5263]] you [[G5213]] whom [[G5101]] ye shall fear: [[G5399]] Fear [[G5399]] him, which [[G3588]] after [[G3326]] he [[G3588]] hath killed [[G615]] hath [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to cast [[G1685]] into [[G1519]] hell; [[G1067]] yea, [[G3483]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Fear [[G5399]] him. [[G5126]]

### 6
not [[G3780]] Are [[G4453]] five [[G4002]] sparrows [[G4765]] sold [[G4453]] for [[G787]] two [[G1417]] farthings, [[G787]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] is [[G2076]] forgotten [[G1950]] before [[G1799]] God? [[G2316]]

### 7
But [[G235]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] very hairs [[G2359]] of [[G2776]] your [[G5216]] head [[G2776]] all [[G3956]] are [[G705]] numbered. [[G705]] Fear [[G5399]] not [[G3361]] therefore: [[G3767]] ye are of more value [[G1308]] many [[G4183]] than [[G4765]] sparrows. [[G4765]]

### 8
Also [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Whosoever [[G3956]] shall [[G3670]] confess [[G3670]] me [[G1698]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] shall [[G3670]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] also [[G2532]] confess [[G3670]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] that denieth [[G720]] me [[G3165]] before [[G1799]] men [[G444]] shall be denied [[G533]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3956]] shall speak [[G2046]] a word [[G3056]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man, [[G444]] it shall be forgiven [[G863]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] unto him that blasphemeth [[G987]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] not [[G3756]] it shall be [[G863]] forgiven. [[G863]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] they bring [[G4374]] you [[G5209]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] magistrates, [[G746]] and [[G2532]] powers, [[G1849]] no [[G3361]] take ye [[G3309]] thought [[G3309]] how [[G4459]] or [[G2228]] what thing [[G5101]] ye shall answer, [[G626]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] ye shall say: [[G2036]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] shall teach [[G1321]] you [[G5209]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] what [[G3739]] ye ought [[G1163]] to say. [[G2036]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] company [[G3793]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] speak [[G2036]] to [[G80]] my [[G3450]] brother, [[G80]] that he divide [[G3307]] the [[G3588]] inheritance [[G2817]] with [[G3326]] me. [[G1700]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Man, [[G444]] who [[G5101]] made [[G2525]] me [[G3165]] a judge [[G1348]] or [[G2228]] a divider [[G3312]] over [[G1909]] you? [[G5209]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Take heed, [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] beware [[G5442]] of [[G575]] covetousness: [[G4124]] for [[G3754]] a man's [[G5100]] life [[G2222]] consisteth [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] abundance [[G4052]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] things which [[G5224]] he [[G846]] possesseth. [[G5224]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] he spake [[G2036]] a parable [[G3850]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] ground [[G5561]] of a certain [[G5100]] rich [[G4145]] man [[G444]] brought forth plentifully: [[G2164]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he thought [[G1260]] within [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] shall I do, [[G4160]] because [[G3754]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] room where [[G4226]] to bestow [[G4863]] my [[G3450]] fruits? [[G2590]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] he said, [[G2036]] This [[G5124]] will I do: [[G4160]] I will pull down [[G2507]] my [[G3450]] barns, [[G596]] and [[G2532]] build [[G3618]] greater; [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] there [[G1563]] will I bestow [[G4863]] all [[G3956]] my [[G3450]] fruits [[G1081]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] goods. [[G18]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] I will say [[G2046]] to [[G5590]] my [[G3450]] soul, [[G5590]] Soul, [[G5590]] thou hast [[G2192]] much [[G4183]] goods [[G18]] laid up [[G2749]] for [[G1519]] many [[G4183]] years; [[G2094]] take thine ease, [[G373]] eat, [[G5315]] drink, [[G4095]] be merry. [[G2165]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] fool, [[G878]] this [[G3778]] night [[G3571]] thy [[G4675]] soul [[G5590]] shall be required [[G523]] of [[G575]] thee: [[G4675]] then [[G1161]] whose [[G5101]] those things [[G3739]] shall be, [[G2071]] which [[G3739]] thou hast provided? [[G2090]]

### 21
So [[G3779]] he [[G3588]] that layeth up treasure [[G2343]] for himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] is [[G4147]] rich [[G4147]] toward [[G1519]] God. [[G2316]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Therefore [[G1223]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] no [[G3361]] Take [[G3309]] thought [[G3309]] for [[G5590]] your [[G5216]] life, [[G5590]] what [[G5101]] ye shall eat; [[G5315]] neither [[G3366]] the [[G3588]] for [[G4983]] body, [[G4983]] what [[G5101]] ye shall put on. [[G1746]]

### 23
The [[G3588]] life [[G5590]] is [[G2076]] more than than [[G4119]] meat, [[G5160]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] raiment. [[G1742]]

### 24
Consider [[G2657]] the [[G3588]] ravens: [[G2876]] for [[G3754]] neither [[G3756]] they [[G4687]] sow [[G4687]] nor [[G3761]] reap; [[G2325]] which [[G3739]] neither [[G3756]] have [[G2076]] storehouse [[G5009]] nor [[G3761]] barn; [[G596]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] feedeth [[G5142]] them: [[G846]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G1308]] better [[G1308]] the [[G3588]] than [[G4071]] fowls? [[G4071]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] with taking thought [[G3309]] can [[G1410]] add [[G4369]] to [[G1909]] his [[G846]] stature [[G2244]] one [[G1520]] cubit? [[G4083]]

### 26
If [[G1487]] then [[G3767]] ye be to do [[G1410]] not [[G3777]] able [[G1410]] that thing which is least, [[G1646]] why [[G5101]] take ye thought [[G3309]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] rest? [[G3062]]

### 27
Consider [[G2657]] the [[G3588]] lilies [[G2918]] how [[G4459]] they grow: [[G837]] they toil [[G2872]] not, [[G3756]] they spin [[G3514]] not; [[G3761]] and yet [[G1161]] I say that [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Solomon [[G4672]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] not [[G3761]] was [[G4016]] arrayed [[G4016]] like [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] of these. [[G5130]]

### 28
If [[G1487]] then [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] so [[G3779]] clothe [[G294]] the [[G3588]] grass, [[G5528]] which is [[G5607]] to day [[G4594]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] field, [[G68]] and [[G2532]] to morrow [[G839]] is cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the oven; [[G2823]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] you, [[G5209]] O ye of little faith? [[G3640]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] seek [[G2212]] not [[G3361]] ye [[G5210]] what [[G5101]] ye shall eat, [[G5315]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] ye shall drink, [[G4095]] neither [[G2532]] be ye of doubtful [[G3349]] mind. [[G3349]]

### 30
For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] the [[G3588]] do seek [[G1934]] nations [[G1484]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2889]] world [[G2889]] after: [[G1934]] and [[G1161]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] knoweth [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] ye have need [[G5535]] of these things. [[G5130]]

### 31
But rather [[G4133]] seek ye [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] shall be added [[G4369]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 32
Fear [[G5399]] not, [[G3361]] little [[G3398]] flock; [[G4168]] for [[G3754]] it is good [[G2106]] your [[G5216]] Father's [[G3962]] pleasure [[G2106]] to give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] kingdom. [[G932]]

### 33
Sell [[G4453]] that [[G3588]] ye [[G5216]] have, [[G5224]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] alms; [[G1654]] provide [[G4160]] yourselves [[G1438]] bags [[G905]] which wax old, [[G3822]] not [[G3361]] a treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] that faileth not, [[G413]] where [[G3699]] no [[G3756]] thief [[G2812]] approacheth, [[G1448]] neither [[G3761]] moth [[G4597]] corrupteth. [[G1311]]

### 34
For [[G1063]] where [[G3699]] your [[G5216]] treasure [[G2344]] is, [[G2076]] there [[G1563]] your [[G5216]] will [[G2071]] heart [[G2588]] be [[G2071]] also. [[G2532]]

### 35
Let [[G2077]] your [[G5216]] loins [[G3751]] be [[G2077]] girded about, [[G4024]] and [[G2532]] lights [[G3088]] burning; [[G2545]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] ye yourselves [[G5210]] like [[G3664]] unto [[G444]] men [[G444]] that wait for [[G4327]] their [[G1438]] lord, [[G2962]] when [[G4219]] he will return [[G360]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] wedding; [[G1062]] that [[G2443]] when he cometh [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] knocketh, [[G2925]] they may open [[G455]] unto him [[G846]] immediately. [[G2112]]

### 37
Blessed [[G3107]] those [[G1565]] servants, [[G1401]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] when he cometh [[G2064]] shall find [[G2147]] watching: [[G1127]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] he shall gird himself, [[G4024]] and [[G2532]] make to sit down to meat, [[G347]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] will come forth [[G3928]] and serve [[G1247]] them. [[G846]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] he shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] watch, [[G5438]] or [[G2532]] come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] watch, [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] so, [[G3779]] blessed [[G3107]] are [[G1526]] those [[G1565]] servants. [[G1401]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] this [[G5124]] know, [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] goodman of the house [[G3617]] had known [[G1492]] what [[G4169]] hour [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] thief [[G2812]] would come, [[G2064]] he would have watched, [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] have [[G302]] suffered [[G863]] his [[G846]] house [[G3624]] to be broken through. [[G1358]]

### 40
Be [[G1096]] ye [[G5210]] therefore [[G3767]] ready [[G2092]] also: [[G2532]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] cometh [[G2064]] at an hour [[G5610]] when [[G3739]] ye think [[G1380]] not. [[G3756]]

### 41
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] speakest thou [[G3004]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] unto [[G4314]] us, [[G2248]] or [[G2228]] even [[G2532]] to [[G4314]] all? [[G3956]]

### 42
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said, [[G2036]] Who [[G5101]] then [[G687]] is [[G2076]] that [[G3623]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] wise [[G5429]] steward, [[G3623]] whom [[G3739]] lord [[G2962]] shall make ruler [[G2525]] over [[G1909]] his [[G846]] household, [[G2322]] to give [[G1325]] portion of meat [[G4620]] in [[G1722]] due season? [[G2540]]

### 43
Blessed [[G3107]] that [[G1565]] servant, [[G1401]] whom [[G3739]] his [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] when he cometh [[G2064]] shall find [[G2147]] so [[G3779]] doing. [[G4160]]

### 44
Of a truth [[G230]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] he will make [[G2525]] him [[G846]] ruler [[G2525]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] that [[G5224]] he [[G846]] hath. [[G5224]]

### 45
But and [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] say [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] My [[G3450]] lord [[G2962]] delayeth [[G5549]] his coming; [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] shall begin [[G756]] to beat [[G5180]] the [[G3588]] menservants [[G3816]] and [[G2532]] maidens, [[G3814]] and [[G5037]] to eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] to be drunken; [[G3182]]

### 46
The [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] of [[G1401]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] will come [[G2240]] in [[G1722]] a day [[G2250]] when [[G3739]] he looketh for [[G4328]] not [[G3756]] and [[G2532]] at [[G1722]] an hour [[G5610]] when [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] he is [[G1097]] aware, [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] will cut in sunder, [[G1371]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] will appoint him [[G5087]] his [[G846]] portion [[G3313]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] unbelievers. [[G571]]

### 47
And [[G1161]] that [[G1565]] servant, [[G1401]] which [[G3588]] knew [[G1097]] his [[G1438]] lord's [[G2962]] will, [[G2307]] and [[G2532]] prepared [[G2090]] not [[G3361]] neither [[G3366]] did [[G4160]] according to [[G4314]] his [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] shall be beaten [[G1194]] with many [[G4183]]

### 48
But [[G1161]] he that knew [[G1097]] not, [[G3361]] and did commit [[G4160]] things worthy [[G514]] of stripes, [[G4127]] shall be beaten [[G1194]] with few [[G3641]] For [[G1161]] unto whomsoever [[G3956]] much [[G4183]] given, [[G1325]] is [[G846]] of [[G3844]] him [[G846]] much [[G4183]] shall be [[G2212]] required: [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] to whom [[G3739]] men have committed [[G3908]] much, [[G4183]] of him [[G846]] they will ask [[G154]] the more. [[G4053]]

### 49
I am come [[G2064]] to send [[G906]] fire [[G4442]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] will I, [[G2309]] if [[G1487]] already [[G2235]] it be [[G381]] kindled? [[G381]]

### 50
But [[G1161]] I have [[G2192]] a baptism [[G908]] to be baptized with; [[G907]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] am I straitened [[G4912]] till [[G2193]] it [[G3739]] be accomplished! [[G5055]]

### 51
Suppose ye [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] I am come [[G3854]] to give [[G1325]] peace [[G1515]] on [[G1722]] earth? [[G1093]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G5213]] Nay; [[G3780]] but [[G235]] rather [[G2228]] division: [[G1267]]

### 52
