### 1
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] on [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] of those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] as he [[G846]] taught [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] preached the gospel, [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] came upon [[G2186]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] spake [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Tell [[G2036]] us, [[G2254]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] doest thou [[G4160]] these things? [[G5023]] or [[G2228]] who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] he that [[G3588]] gave [[G1325]] thee [[G4671]] this [[G3778]] authority? [[G1849]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] he answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] I will [[G2065]] also [[G2504]] ask [[G2065]] you [[G5209]] one [[G1520]] thing; [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] answer [[G2036]] me: [[G3427]]

### 4
The [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] of John, [[G2491]] was it [[G2258]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] or [[G2228]] of [[G1537]] men? [[G444]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] reasoned [[G4817]] with [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] saying, [[G3004]] If [[G1437]] we shall say, [[G2036]] From [[G1537]] heaven; [[G3772]] he will say, [[G2046]] Why [[G1302]] then [[G3767]] believed ye [[G4100]] him [[G846]] not? [[G3756]]

### 6
But and [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] we say, [[G2036]] Of [[G1537]] men; [[G444]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] will stone [[G2642]] us: [[G2248]] for [[G1063]] be persuaded that [[G3982]] they [[G1511]] John [[G2491]] was [[G1511]] a prophet. [[G4396]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] they answered, [[G611]] not [[G3361]] that they could [[G1492]] tell [[G1492]] whence [[G4159]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Neither [[G3761]] tell [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] you [[G5213]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I do [[G4160]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 9
Then [[G1161]] began he [[G756]] to speak [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] this [[G3778]] parable; [[G3850]] A [[G3588]] certain [[G5100]] man [[G444]] planted [[G5452]] a vineyard, [[G290]] and [[G2532]] let forth [[G1554]] it [[G846]] to husbandmen, [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] went into a far country [[G589]] for a long [[G2425]] time. [[G5550]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] at [[G1722]] the season [[G2540]] he sent [[G649]] a servant [[G1401]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] husbandmen, [[G1092]] that [[G2443]] they should give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] the [[G3588]] of [[G290]] vineyard: [[G290]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] husbandmen [[G1092]] beat [[G1194]] him, [[G846]] and sent away [[G1821]] empty. [[G2756]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] again [[G4369]] he sent [[G3992]] another [[G2087]] servant: [[G1401]] and [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] beat [[G1194]] him also, [[G2548]] and [[G2532]] entreated shamefully, [[G818]] and sent away [[G1821]] empty. [[G2756]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] again [[G4369]] he sent [[G3992]] a third: [[G5154]] and [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] wounded [[G5135]] him [[G5126]] also, and [[G2532]] cast out. [[G1544]]

### 13
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] of [[G290]] vineyard, [[G290]] What [[G5101]] shall I do? [[G4160]] I will send [[G3992]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] son: [[G5207]] it may be [[G2481]] they will reverence [[G1788]] when they see [[G1492]] him. [[G5126]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G1092]] husbandmen [[G1092]] saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] they reasoned [[G1260]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] heir: [[G2818]] come, [[G1205]] let us kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] inheritance [[G2817]] may be [[G1096]] ours. [[G2257]]

### 15
So [[G2532]] they cast [[G1544]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] vineyard, [[G290]] and killed [[G615]] What [[G5101]] therefore [[G3767]] shall [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] of [[G290]] vineyard [[G290]] do [[G4160]] unto them? [[G846]]

### 16
He shall come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] destroy [[G622]] these [[G5128]] husbandmen, [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] shall give [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] to others. [[G243]] And [[G1161]] when [[G1161]] they heard [[G191]] they said, [[G2036]] God forbid. [[G1096]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] beheld [[G1689]] them, [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] this [[G5124]] then [[G3767]] that [[G3588]] is written, [[G1125]] The stone [[G3037]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] builders [[G3618]] rejected, [[G593]] the same [[G3778]] is become [[G1096]] the [[G1519]] head [[G2776]] of the corner? [[G1137]]

### 18
Whosoever [[G3956]] shall [[G4098]] fall [[G4098]] upon [[G1909]] that [[G1565]] stone [[G3037]] shall be broken; [[G4917]] but [[G1161]] on [[G1909]] whomsoever [[G3739]] it shall fall, [[G4098]] it will grind to powder. [[G3039]] him [[G846]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] the same [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] sought [[G2212]] to lay [[G1911]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people: [[G2992]] for [[G1063]] they perceived [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] he had spoken [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] against [[G4314]] them. [[G846]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] they watched [[G3906]] and sent forth [[G649]] spies, [[G1455]] which should feign [[G5271]] themselves [[G1438]] just men, [[G1342]] that that so [[G2443]] they might take hold [[G1949]] of his [[G846]] words, [[G3056]] they [[G3588]] might deliver [[G3860]] him [[G846]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] power [[G746]] and [[G2532]] authority [[G1849]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2232]] governor. [[G2232]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] they asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] thou sayest [[G3004]] and [[G2532]] teachest [[G1321]] rightly, [[G3723]] neither [[G2532]] thou [[G2983]] acceptest [[G2983]] the person [[G4383]] but [[G235]] teachest [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] truly: [[G1909]]

### 22
Is it lawful [[G1832]] for us [[G2254]] to give [[G1325]] tribute [[G5411]] unto Caesar, [[G2541]] or [[G2228]] no? [[G3756]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] he perceived [[G2657]] their [[G846]] craftiness, [[G3834]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] tempt ye [[G3985]] me? [[G3165]]

### 24
Shew [[G1925]] me [[G3427]] a penny. [[G1220]] Whose [[G5101]] image [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] superscription [[G1923]] hath it? [[G2192]] They answered [[G611]] and [[G1161]] said, [[G2036]] Caesar's. [[G2541]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Render [[G591]] therefore [[G5106]] unto Caesar [[G2541]] the things [[G3588]] which be Caesar's, [[G2541]] and [[G2532]] unto God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] things [[G3588]] which [[G3588]] be God's. [[G2316]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] they could [[G2480]] not [[G3756]] take hold of [[G1949]] his [[G846]] words [[G4487]] before [[G1726]] the [[G3588]] people: [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] they marvelled [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] answer, [[G612]] and held their peace. [[G4601]]

### 27
Then [[G1161]] came to [[G4334]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4523]] Sadducees, [[G4523]] which [[G3588]] deny that [[G483]] there is [[G1511]] any [[G3361]] resurrection; [[G386]] and they asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]]

### 28
Saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] Moses [[G3475]] wrote [[G1125]] unto us, [[G2254]] If [[G1437]] any man's [[G5100]] brother [[G80]] die, [[G599]] having [[G2192]] a wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3778]] die [[G599]] without children, [[G815]] that [[G2443]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] should take [[G2983]] his [[G3588]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] raise up [[G1817]] seed [[G4690]] unto his [[G846]] brother. [[G80]]

### 29
There were [[G2258]] therefore [[G3767]] seven [[G2033]] brethren: [[G80]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] took [[G2983]] a wife, [[G1135]] and died [[G599]] without children. [[G815]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] took [[G2983]] her [[G3588]] to wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3778]] died [[G599]] childless. [[G815]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] took [[G2983]] her; [[G846]] and [[G1161]] in like manner [[G5615]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] also: [[G2532]] and they left [[G2641]] no [[G3756]] children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] died. [[G599]]

### 32
Last [[G5305]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] died [[G599]] also. [[G2532]]

### 33
Therefore [[G3767]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] whose [[G5101]] wife [[G1135]] of them [[G846]] is she? [[G1096]] for [[G1063]] seven [[G2033]] had [[G2192]] her [[G846]] to wife. [[G1135]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of this [[G5127]] world [[G165]] marry, [[G1060]] and [[G2532]] are given in marriage: [[G1548]]

### 35
But [[G1161]] they which [[G3588]] shall be accounted worthy [[G2661]] to obtain [[G5177]] that [[G1565]] world, [[G165]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] neither [[G3777]] marry, [[G1060]] nor [[G3777]] are given in marriage: [[G1548]]

### 36
Neither [[G3777]] can [[G1410]] they die [[G599]] any more: [[G2089]] for [[G1063]] they are [[G1526]] equal unto the angels; [[G2465]] and [[G2532]] are [[G1526]] the children [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] being [[G5607]] the children [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G386]] resurrection. [[G386]]

### 37
Now [[G1161]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] are raised, [[G1453]] even [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] shewed [[G3377]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] bush, [[G942]] when [[G5613]] he calleth [[G3004]] the Lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jacob. [[G2384]]

### 38
For [[G1161]] he is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] a God [[G2316]] of the dead, [[G3498]] but [[G235]] of the living: [[G2198]] for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] live [[G2198]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 39
Then [[G1161]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1122]] scribes [[G1122]] answering [[G611]] said, [[G2036]] Master, [[G1320]] well [[G2573]] thou hast [[G2036]] said. [[G2036]]

### 40
And after that [[G1161]] they durst [[G5111]] not [[G3765]] ask [[G1905]] him [[G846]] any [[G3762]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] How [[G4459]] say they [[G3004]] that [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] is [[G1511]] David's [[G1138]] son? [[G5207]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] David [[G1138]] himself [[G846]] saith [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] the book [[G976]] of Psalms, [[G5568]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] unto my [[G3450]] Lord, [[G2962]] Sit thou [[G2521]] on [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] right hand, [[G1188]]

### 43
Till [[G2193]] I make [[G5087]] thine [[G4675]] enemies [[G2190]] thy [[G4675]] footstool. [[G5286]]

### 44
David [[G1138]] therefore [[G3767]] calleth [[G2564]] him [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G4459]] is he [[G2076]] then [[G2532]] his [[G846]] son? [[G5207]]

### 45
Then [[G1161]] in the audience [[G191]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] he said [[G2036]] unto his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 46
Beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] scribes, [[G1122]] which [[G3588]] desire [[G2309]] to walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] long robes, [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] love [[G5368]] greetings [[G783]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] markets, [[G58]] and [[G2532]] the highest seats [[G4410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] the chief rooms [[G4411]] at [[G1722]] feasts; [[G1173]]

### 47
Which [[G3739]] devour [[G2719]] widows' [[G5503]] houses, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] for a shew [[G4392]] long [[G3117]] make [[G4336]] prayers: [[G4336]] the same [[G3778]] shall receive [[G2983]] greater [[G4053]] damnation. [[G2917]]
