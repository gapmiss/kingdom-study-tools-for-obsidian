### 1
There [[G1161]] were present [[G3918]] at [[G1722]] that [[G846]] season [[G2540]] some [[G5100]] that told [[G518]] him [[G846]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Galilaeans, [[G1057]] whose [[G3739]] blood [[G129]] Pilate [[G4091]] had mingled [[G3396]] with [[G3326]] their [[G846]] sacrifices. [[G2378]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Suppose ye [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] Galilaeans [[G1057]] were [[G1096]] sinners [[G268]] above [[G3844]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Galilaeans, [[G1057]] because [[G3754]] they suffered [[G3958]] such things? [[G5108]]

### 3
I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G5213]] Nay: [[G3780]] but, [[G235]] except [[G1437]] ye repent, [[G3340]] all [[G3956]] ye shall [[G622]] likewise [[G5615]] perish. [[G622]]

### 4
Or [[G2228]] those [[G1565]] eighteen, [[G1176]] upon [[G1909]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] tower [[G4444]] in [[G1722]] Siloam [[G4611]] fell, [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] slew [[G615]] them, [[G846]] think ye [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] they [[G3778]] were [[G1096]] sinners [[G3781]] above [[G3844]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] that [[G3588]] dwelt [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem? [[G2419]]

### 5
I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G5213]] Nay: [[G3780]] but, [[G235]] except [[G1437]] ye repent, [[G3340]] all [[G3956]] ye shall [[G622]] likewise [[G3668]] perish. [[G622]]

### 6
He spake [[G3004]] also [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] parable; [[G3850]] A [[G3588]] certain [[G5100]] had [[G2192]] a fig tree [[G4808]] planted [[G5452]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] vineyard; [[G290]] and [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] and sought [[G2212]] fruit [[G2590]] thereon, [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] none. [[G3756]]

### 7
Then [[G1161]] said he [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] dresser of his vineyard, [[G289]] Behold, [[G2400]] these three [[G5140]] years [[G2094]] I come [[G2064]] seeking [[G2212]] fruit [[G2590]] on [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] fig tree, [[G4808]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] none: [[G3756]] cut down; [[G1581]] it [[G846]] why [[G2444]] cumbereth it [[G2673]] the [[G3588]] ground? [[G1093]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answering [[G611]] said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] let [[G863]] it [[G846]] alone [[G863]] this [[G5124]] year [[G2094]] also, [[G2532]] till [[G2193]] I shall dig [[G4626]] about [[G4012]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] dung [[G2874]]

### 9
And if [[G2579]] it [[G3303]] bear [[G4160]] fruit, [[G2590]] and [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] not, [[G3361]] after that [[G3195]] thou shalt cut down. [[G1581]] it [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] he was [[G2258]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4864]] synagogues [[G4864]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath. [[G4521]]

### 11
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there was [[G2258]] a woman [[G1135]] which had [[G2192]] a spirit [[G4151]] of infirmity [[G769]] eighteen [[G1176]] years, [[G2094]] and [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] bowed together, [[G4794]] and [[G2532]] could [[G1410]] in [[G1519]] no [[G3361]] wise [[G3838]] lift up [[G352]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] when [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G1492]] her, [[G846]] he called [[G4377]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Woman, [[G1135]] thou art loosed [[G630]] from thine [[G4675]] infirmity. [[G769]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] he laid [[G2007]] hands [[G5495]] on her: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G3916]] she was made straight, [[G461]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] ruler of the synagogue [[G752]] answered [[G611]] with indignation, [[G23]] because [[G3754]] that [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] had healed [[G2323]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] day, [[G4521]] and said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3793]] people, [[G3793]] There are [[G1526]] six [[G1803]] days [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] which men [[G3739]] ought [[G1163]] to work: [[G2038]] in [[G1722]] them [[G3778]] therefore [[G3767]] come [[G2064]] and be healed, [[G2323]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] on [[G4521]] sabbath [[G4521]] day. [[G2250]]

### 15
The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] then [[G3767]] answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] hypocrite, [[G5273]] not [[G3756]] doth [[G3089]] each one [[G1538]] of you [[G5216]] the [[G3588]] on [[G4521]] sabbath [[G4521]] loose [[G3089]] his [[G846]] ox [[G1016]] or [[G2228]] ass [[G3688]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] stall, [[G5336]] and [[G2532]] lead away [[G520]] to watering? [[G4222]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] ought [[G1163]] not [[G3756]] this woman, [[G3778]] being [[G5607]] a daughter [[G2364]] of Abraham, [[G11]] whom [[G3739]] Satan [[G4567]] hath bound, [[G1210]] lo, [[G2400]] these eighteen [[G1176]] years, [[G2094]] be loosed [[G3089]] from [[G575]] this [[G5127]] bond [[G1199]] the [[G3588]] on [[G4521]] sabbath [[G4521]] day? [[G2250]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] when he [[G846]] had said [[G3004]] these things, [[G5023]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] adversaries [[G480]] were ashamed: [[G2617]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] rejoiced [[G5463]] for [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] glorious [[G1741]] things [[G3588]] that [[G3588]] were done [[G1096]] by [[G5259]] him. [[G846]]

### 18
Then [[G1161]] said he, [[G3004]] Unto what [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] like? [[G3664]] and [[G2532]] whereunto [[G5101]] shall I resemble [[G3666]] it? [[G846]]

### 19
It is [[G2076]] like [[G3664]] a grain [[G2848]] of mustard seed, [[G4615]] which [[G3739]] a man [[G444]] took, [[G2983]] and cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] his [[G1438]] garden; [[G2779]] and [[G2532]] it grew, [[G837]] and [[G2532]] waxed [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] tree; [[G1186]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fowls [[G4071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] air [[G3772]] lodged [[G2681]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] branches [[G2798]] of it. [[G846]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] he said, [[G2036]] Whereunto [[G5101]] shall I liken [[G3666]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God? [[G2316]]

### 21
It is [[G2076]] like [[G3664]] leaven, [[G2219]] which [[G3739]] a woman [[G1135]] took [[G2983]] and hid [[G1470]] in [[G1519]] three [[G5140]] measures [[G4568]] of meal, [[G224]] till [[G2193]] the whole [[G3650]] was leavened. [[G2220]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] he went [[G1279]] through [[G2596]] the cities [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] villages, [[G2968]] teaching, [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] journeying [[G4197]] toward [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 23
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] one [[G5100]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] are there [[G1487]] few [[G3641]] that [[G3588]] be saved? [[G4982]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]]

### 24
Strive [[G75]] to enter in [[G1525]] at [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] strait [[G4728]] gate: [[G4439]] for [[G3754]] many, [[G4183]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] will seek [[G2212]] to enter in, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G2480]] able. [[G2480]]

### 25
When once [[G3739]]  is [[G302]] the [[G3588]] master of the house [[G3617]] risen up, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] hath shut to [[G608]] the [[G3588]] door, [[G2374]] and [[G2532]] ye begin [[G756]] to stand [[G2476]] without, [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] to knock [[G2925]] at [[G575]] the [[G3588]] door, [[G2374]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] open [[G455]] unto us; [[G2254]] and [[G2532]] he shall answer [[G611]] and say [[G2046]] unto you, [[G5213]] I know [[G1492]] you [[G5209]] not [[G3756]] whence [[G4159]] ye are: [[G2075]]

### 26
Then [[G5119]] shall ye begin [[G756]] to say, [[G3004]] We have eaten [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drunk [[G4095]] in thy [[G4675]] presence, [[G1799]] and [[G2532]] thou hast taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] our [[G2257]] streets. [[G4113]]

### 27
But [[G2532]] he shall say, [[G2046]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G5213]] I know [[G1492]] you [[G5209]] not [[G3756]] whence [[G4159]] ye are; [[G2075]] depart [[G868]] from [[G575]] me, [[G1700]] all [[G3956]] workers [[G2040]] of [[G93]] iniquity. [[G93]]

### 28
There [[G1563]] shall be [[G2071]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of [[G3599]] teeth, [[G3599]] when [[G3752]] ye shall see [[G3700]] Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] Jacob, [[G2384]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] you [[G5209]] thrust [[G1544]] out. [[G1854]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] they shall come [[G2240]] from [[G575]] the east, [[G395]] and [[G2532]] the west, [[G1424]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] the north, [[G1005]] and [[G2532]] the south, [[G3558]] and [[G2532]] shall sit down [[G347]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 30
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there are [[G1526]] last [[G2078]] which [[G3739]] shall be [[G2071]] first, [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] there are [[G1526]] first [[G4413]] which [[G3739]] shall be [[G2071]] last. [[G2078]]

### 31
The [[G1722]] same [[G846]] day [[G2250]] there came [[G4334]] certain [[G5100]] of the Pharisees, [[G5330]] saying [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Get thee out, [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] depart [[G4198]] hence: [[G1782]] for [[G3754]] Herod [[G2264]] will [[G2309]] kill [[G615]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Go ye, [[G4198]] and tell [[G2036]] that [[G3778]] fox, [[G258]] Behold, [[G2400]] I cast out [[G1544]] devils, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] I do [[G2005]] cures [[G2392]] to day [[G4594]] and [[G2532]] to morrow, [[G839]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] I shall be perfected. [[G5048]]

### 33
Nevertheless [[G4133]] I [[G3165]] must [[G1163]] walk [[G4198]] to day, [[G4594]] and [[G2532]] to morrow, [[G839]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] following: [[G2192]] for [[G3754]] it cannot be [[G1735]] that a prophet [[G4396]] perish [[G622]] out of [[G1854]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 34
O Jerusalem, [[G2419]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] which [[G3588]] killest [[G615]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] stonest [[G3036]] them that [[G3588]] are sent [[G649]] unto [[G4314]] thee; [[G846]] how often [[G4212]] would [[G2309]] I have gathered together, [[G1996]] thy [[G4675]] children [[G5043]] as [[G3739]] a hen [[G3733]] her [[G1438]] brood [[G3555]] under [[G5259]] wings, [[G4420]] and [[G2532]] ye would [[G2309]] not! [[G3756]]

### 35
Behold, [[G2400]] your [[G5216]] house [[G3624]] is left [[G863]] unto you [[G5213]] desolate: [[G2048]] and [[G1161]] verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Ye shall [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] see [[G1492]] me, [[G3165]] until [[G2193]] come [[G2240]] when [[G3753]] ye shall say, [[G2036]] Blessed [[G2127]] he that [[G3588]] cometh [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the name [[G3686]] of the Lord. [[G2962]]
