### 1
And [[G1161]] it came to pass [[G1096]] on [[G1722]] the second after the first, [[G1207]] sabbath [[G4521]] that [[G1279]] he [[G846]] went [[G1279]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] corn fields; [[G4702]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] plucked [[G5089]] the [[G3588]] ears of corn, [[G4719]] and [[G2532]] did eat, [[G2068]] rubbing [[G5597]] in hands. [[G5495]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] certain [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5330]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] do ye [[G4160]] that which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] is [[G1832]] lawful [[G1832]] to do [[G4160]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath days? [[G4521]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] them [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] not so much as [[G3761]] Have ye [[G314]] read [[G314]] this, [[G5124]] what [[G3739]] David [[G1138]] did, [[G4160]] when [[G3698]] himself [[G846]] was an hungred, [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] they which [[G3588]] were [[G5607]] with [[G3326]] him; [[G846]]

### 4
How [[G5613]] he went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] did take [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] shewbread, [[G740]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] also [[G2532]] to them that were [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] him; [[G846]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] it is [[G1832]] lawful [[G1832]] to eat [[G5315]] but [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] for [[G2409]] priests [[G2409]] alone? [[G3441]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] That [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] is [[G2076]] Lord [[G2962]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4521]] sabbath. [[G4521]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] it came to pass [[G1096]] also [[G2532]] on [[G1722]] another [[G2087]] sabbath, [[G4521]] that he [[G846]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] taught: [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] there [[G1563]] was [[G2258]] a man [[G444]] whose [[G846]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] was [[G2258]] withered. [[G3584]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] watched [[G3906]] him, [[G846]] whether [[G1487]] he would heal [[G2323]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath day; [[G4521]] that [[G2443]] they might find [[G2147]] an accusation [[G2724]] against him. [[G846]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] he [[G846]] knew [[G1492]] their [[G846]] thoughts, [[G1261]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] to [[G444]] man [[G444]] which had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] withered [[G3584]] hand, [[G5495]] Rise up, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] stand forth [[G2476]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] midst. [[G3319]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] arose [[G450]] and stood forth. [[G2476]]

### 9
Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] I will ask [[G1905]] you [[G5209]] one thing; [[G5101]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] days [[G4521]] to do good, [[G15]] or [[G2228]] to do evil? [[G2554]] to save [[G4982]] life, [[G5590]] or [[G2228]] to destroy [[G622]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] looking round about upon [[G4017]] them [[G846]] all, [[G3956]] he said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G444]] man, [[G444]] Stretch forth [[G1614]] thy [[G4675]] hand. [[G5495]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] did [[G4160]] so: [[G3779]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] was restored [[G600]] whole [[G5199]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] other. [[G243]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] they [[G846]] were filled [[G4130]] with madness; [[G454]] and [[G2532]] communed [[G1255]] one with [[G4314]] another [[G240]] what [[G5101]] they might do [[G4160]] to Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] it came to pass [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days, [[G2250]] that he went out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] to pray, [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] continued all night [[G1273]] in [[G1722]] prayer [[G4335]] to God. [[G2316]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] it was [[G1096]] day, [[G2250]] he called [[G4377]] his [[G846]] disciples: [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] of [[G575]] them [[G846]] he chose [[G1586]] twelve, [[G1427]] whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] he named [[G3687]] apostles; [[G652]]

### 14
Simon, [[G4613]] (whom [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] he [[G3687]] named [[G3687]] Peter,) [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] Andrew [[G406]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] Philip [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] Bartholomew, [[G918]]

### 15
Matthew [[G3156]] and [[G2532]] Thomas, [[G2381]] James [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] of Alphaeus, [[G256]] and [[G2532]] Simon [[G4613]] called [[G2564]] Zelotes, [[G2207]]

### 16
And Judas [[G2455]] of James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] was [[G1096]] the traitor. [[G4273]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he came down [[G2597]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and stood [[G2476]] in [[G1909]] the plain, [[G3977]] and [[G2532]] the company [[G3793]] of his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] a great [[G4183]] multitude [[G4128]] of people [[G2992]] out [[G575]] of all [[G3956]] Judaea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] from sea [[G3882]] coast [[G3882]] of Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4605]] which [[G3739]] came [[G2064]] to hear [[G191]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to be healed [[G2390]] of their [[G846]] diseases; [[G3554]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] they that were vexed [[G3791]] with [[G5259]] unclean [[G169]] spirits: [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they were healed. [[G2323]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] multitude [[G3793]] sought [[G2212]] to touch [[G680]] him: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] there went [[G1831]] virtue [[G1411]] out of [[G3844]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] healed [[G2390]] all. [[G3956]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] lifted up [[G1869]] his [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] on [[G1519]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and said, [[G3004]] Blessed [[G3107]] poor: [[G4434]] for [[G3754]] yours [[G5212]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 21
Blessed [[G3107]] that hunger [[G3983]] now: [[G3568]] for [[G3754]] ye shall be filled. [[G5526]] Blessed [[G3107]] that weep [[G2799]] now: [[G3568]] for [[G3754]] ye shall laugh. [[G1070]]

### 22
Blessed [[G3107]] are ye, [[G2075]] when [[G3752]] men [[G444]] shall hate [[G3404]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] they shall separate [[G873]] you [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] shall reproach [[G3679]] and [[G2532]] cast out [[G1544]] your [[G5216]] name [[G3686]] as [[G5613]] evil, [[G4190]] for [[G1752]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of man's [[G444]] sake. [[G1752]]

### 23
Rejoice ye [[G5463]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] leap for joy: [[G4640]] for, [[G1063]] behold, [[G2400]] your [[G5216]] reward [[G3408]] great [[G4183]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] for [[G1063]] in [[G2596]] the like manner [[G5024]] did [[G4160]] their [[G846]] fathers [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G4396]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 24
But [[G4133]] woe [[G3759]] unto you [[G5213]] that are rich! [[G4145]] for [[G3754]] ye have received [[G568]] your [[G5216]] consolation. [[G3874]]

### 25
Woe [[G3759]] unto you [[G5213]] that are full! [[G1705]] for [[G3754]] ye shall hunger. [[G3983]] Woe [[G3759]] unto you [[G5213]] that laugh [[G1070]] now! [[G3568]] for [[G3754]] ye shall mourn [[G3996]] and [[G2532]] weep. [[G2799]]

### 26
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] when [[G3752]] all [[G3956]] men [[G444]] shall speak [[G2036]] well [[G2573]] of you! [[G5209]] for [[G1063]] so [[G2596]] did [[G4160]] their [[G846]] fathers [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] to false prophets. [[G5578]]

### 27
But [[G235]] I say [[G3004]] unto you [[G5213]] which hear, [[G191]] Love [[G25]] your [[G5216]] enemies, [[G2190]] do [[G4160]] good [[G2573]] to them which hate [[G3404]] you, [[G5209]]

### 28
Bless [[G2127]] them that curse [[G2672]] you, [[G5213]] and [[G2532]] pray [[G4336]] for [[G5228]] them which despitefully use [[G1908]] you. [[G5209]]

### 29
unto him [[G3588]] And that [[G5180]] smiteth [[G5180]] thee [[G4571]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cheek [[G4600]] offer [[G3930]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other; [[G243]] and [[G2532]] him [[G3588]] that taketh away [[G142]] thy [[G4675]] cloke [[G2440]] forbid [[G2967]] not [[G3361]] coat [[G5509]] also. [[G2532]]

### 30
Give [[G1325]] to every man [[G3956]] that asketh [[G154]] of thee; [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] of [[G575]] him [[G3588]] that taketh away [[G142]] thy goods [[G4674]] ask again. [[G523]] not [[G3361]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] ye would [[G2309]] that [[G2443]] men [[G444]] should do to [[G4160]] you, [[G5213]] do [[G4160]] ye [[G5210]] also [[G2532]] to them [[G846]] likewise. [[G3668]]

### 32
For [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] ye love [[G25]] them which love [[G25]] you, [[G5209]] what [[G4169]] thank [[G5485]] have [[G2076]] ye? [[G5213]] for [[G1063]] sinners [[G268]] also [[G2532]] love [[G25]] those that love [[G25]] them. [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] ye do good [[G15]] to them which do good [[G15]] to you, [[G5209]] what [[G4169]] thank [[G5485]] have [[G2076]] ye? [[G5213]] for [[G1063]] sinners [[G268]] also [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] same. [[G846]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] ye lend [[G1155]] of [[G3844]] whom [[G3739]] ye hope [[G1679]] to receive, [[G618]] what [[G4169]] thank [[G5485]] have [[G2076]] ye? [[G5213]] for [[G1063]] sinners [[G268]] also [[G2532]] lend [[G1155]] to sinners, [[G268]] to [[G2443]] receive [[G618]] as much again. [[G2470]]

### 35
But [[G4133]] love ye [[G25]] your [[G5216]] enemies, [[G2190]] and [[G2532]] do good, [[G15]] and [[G2532]] lend, [[G1155]] hoping for again; [[G560]] nothing [[G3367]] and [[G2532]] your [[G5216]] reward [[G3408]] shall be [[G2071]] great, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] ye shall be [[G2071]] the children [[G5207]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5310]] Highest: [[G5310]] for [[G3754]] he [[G846]] is [[G2076]] kind [[G5543]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] unthankful [[G884]] and [[G2532]] the evil. [[G4190]]

### 36
Be ye [[G1096]] therefore [[G3767]] merciful, [[G3629]] as [[G2531]] your [[G5216]] Father [[G3962]] also [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] merciful. [[G3629]]

### 37
Judge [[G2919]] not, [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye shall be [[G2919]] judged: [[G2919]] condemn [[G2613]] not, [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] ye shall [[G2613]] not [[G3756]] be [[G2613]] condemned: [[G2613]] forgive, [[G630]] and [[G2532]] ye shall be forgiven: [[G630]]

### 38
Give, [[G1325]] and [[G2532]] it shall be given [[G1325]] unto you; [[G5213]] good [[G2570]] measure, [[G3358]] pressed down, [[G4085]] and [[G2532]] shaken together, [[G4531]] and [[G2532]] running over, [[G5240]] shall men give [[G1325]] into [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] bosom. [[G2859]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] with [[G846]] same [[G846]] measure [[G3358]] that [[G3739]] ye mete withal [[G3354]] it shall be measured again. [[G488]] to you [[G5213]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] he spake [[G2036]] a parable [[G3850]] unto them, [[G846]] Can [[G1410]] the blind [[G5185]] lead [[G3594]] the blind? [[G5185]] not [[G3780]] shall they [[G4098]] both [[G297]] fall [[G4098]] into [[G1519]] the ditch? [[G999]]

### 40
The disciple [[G3101]] is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] above [[G5228]] his [[G846]] master: [[G1320]] but [[G1161]] every one [[G3956]] that is perfect [[G2675]] shall be [[G2071]] as [[G5613]] his [[G846]] master. [[G1320]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] why [[G5101]] beholdest thou [[G991]] the [[G3588]] mote [[G2595]] that is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] brother's [[G80]] eye, [[G3788]] but [[G1161]] perceivest [[G2657]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] beam [[G1385]] that is [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] thine [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] eye? [[G3788]]

### 42
Either [[G2228]] how [[G4459]] canst [[G1410]] thou say [[G3004]] to [[G80]] thy [[G4675]] brother, [[G80]] Brother, [[G80]] let me [[G863]] pull out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] mote [[G2595]] that [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] thine [[G4675]] eye, [[G3788]] thyself [[G846]] when thou [[G991]] beholdest [[G991]] not [[G3756]] the beam [[G1385]] that [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] thine own [[G4675]] eye? [[G3788]] Thou hypocrite, [[G5273]] cast out [[G1544]] first [[G4412]] the [[G3588]] beam [[G1385]] out of [[G1537]] thine own [[G4675]] eye, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shalt thou see clearly [[G1227]] to pull out [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] mote [[G2595]] that [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] brother's [[G80]] eye. [[G3788]]

### 43
For [[G1063]] a good [[G2570]] tree [[G1186]] bringeth forth [[G4160]] not [[G3756]] corrupt [[G4550]] fruit; [[G2590]] neither [[G3761]] a corrupt [[G4550]] doth forth [[G4160]] tree [[G1186]] bring [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 44
For [[G1063]] every [[G1538]] tree [[G1186]] is known [[G1097]] by [[G1537]] his own [[G2398]] fruit. [[G2590]] For [[G1063]] of [[G1537]] thorns [[G173]] not [[G3756]] men do [[G4816]] gather [[G4816]] figs, [[G4810]] nor [[G3761]] of [[G1537]] a bramble bush [[G942]] gather they [[G5166]] grapes. [[G4718]]

### 45
A [[G3588]] good [[G18]] man [[G444]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] good [[G18]] treasure [[G2344]] of his [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] bringeth forth [[G4393]] that which is good; [[G18]] and [[G2532]] an evil [[G4190]] man [[G444]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] treasure [[G2344]] of his [[G846]] heart [[G2588]] bringeth forth [[G4393]] that which is evil: [[G4190]] for [[G1063]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] abundance [[G4051]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2588]] heart [[G2588]] his [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] speaketh. [[G2980]]

### 46
And [[G1161]] why [[G5101]] call ye [[G2564]] me, [[G3165]] Lord, [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] not [[G3756]] the things which [[G3739]] I say? [[G3004]]

### 47
Whosoever [[G3956]] cometh [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] heareth [[G191]] my [[G3450]] sayings, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] doeth [[G4160]] them, [[G846]] I will shew [[G5263]] you [[G5213]] to whom [[G5101]] he is [[G2076]] like: [[G3664]]

### 48
He is [[G2076]] like [[G3664]] a man [[G444]] which [[G3739]] built an [[G3618]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] digged [[G4626]] deep, [[G900]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] the foundation [[G2310]] on [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] rock: [[G4073]] and [[G1161]] when the flood [[G4132]] arose, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] stream [[G4215]] beat vehemently [[G4366]] upon [[G1565]] that [[G1565]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] could [[G2480]] not [[G3756]] shake [[G4531]] it: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] it was founded [[G2311]] upon [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] rock. [[G4073]]

### 49
But [[G1161]] he that heareth, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] doeth [[G4160]] not, [[G3361]] is [[G2076]] like [[G3664]] a man [[G444]] that without [[G5565]] a foundation [[G2310]] built [[G3618]] an house [[G3614]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] which [[G3739]] against did vehemently, [[G4366]] the [[G3588]] stream [[G4215]] beat [[G4366]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] it fell; [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ruin [[G4485]] of that [[G1565]] house [[G3614]] was [[G1096]] great. [[G3173]]
