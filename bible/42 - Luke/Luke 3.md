### 1
Now [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] the fifteenth [[G4003]] year [[G2094]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2231]] reign [[G2231]] of Tiberius [[G5086]] Caesar, [[G2541]] Pontius [[G4194]] Pilate [[G4091]] being governor [[G2230]] of Judaea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Herod [[G2264]] being tetrarch [[G5075]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G1161]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Philip [[G5376]] tetrarch [[G5075]] of Ituraea [[G2484]] and [[G2532]] of the region [[G5561]] of Trachonitis, [[G5139]] and [[G2532]] Lysanias [[G3078]] the tetrarch [[G5075]] of Abilene, [[G9]]

### 2
Annas [[G452]] and [[G2532]] Caiaphas [[G2533]] being [[G1909]] the high priests, [[G749]] the word [[G4487]] of God [[G2316]] came [[G1096]] unto [[G1909]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Zacharias [[G2197]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] country about [[G4066]] Jordan, [[G2446]] preaching [[G2784]] the baptism [[G908]] of repentance [[G3341]] for [[G1519]] the remission [[G859]] of sins; [[G266]]

### 4
As [[G5613]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the book [[G976]] of the words [[G3056]] of Esaias [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet, [[G4396]] saying, [[G3004]] The voice [[G5456]] of one crying [[G994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] Prepare ye [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of the Lord, [[G2962]] make [[G4160]] his [[G846]] paths [[G5147]] straight. [[G2117]]

### 5
Every [[G3956]] valley [[G5327]] shall be filled, [[G4137]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] mountain [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] hill [[G1015]] shall be brought low; [[G5013]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] crooked [[G4646]] shall be made [[G2071]] straight, [[G2117]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rough [[G5138]] ways [[G3598]] made [[G1519]] smooth; [[G3006]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] flesh [[G4561]] shall see [[G3700]] the [[G3588]] salvation [[G4992]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 7
Then [[G3767]] said he [[G3004]] to the multitude [[G3793]] that came forth [[G1607]] to be baptized [[G907]] of [[G5259]] him, [[G846]] O generation [[G1081]] of vipers, [[G2191]] who [[G5101]] hath warned [[G5263]] you [[G5213]] to flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] to come? [[G3195]]

### 8
Bring forth [[G4160]] therefore [[G3767]] fruits [[G2590]] worthy [[G514]] of repentance, [[G3341]] and [[G2532]] begin [[G756]] not [[G3361]] to say [[G3004]] within [[G1722]] yourselves, [[G1438]] We have [[G2192]] Abraham [[G11]] to father: [[G3962]] for [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is able [[G1410]] of [[G1537]] these [[G5130]] stones [[G3037]] to raise up [[G1453]] children [[G5043]] unto Abraham. [[G11]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] now [[G2235]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] axe [[G513]] is laid [[G2749]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1186]] trees: [[G1186]] every [[G3956]] tree [[G1186]] therefore [[G3767]] which bringeth forth [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] good [[G2570]] fruit [[G2590]] is hewn down, [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the fire. [[G4442]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] shall we do [[G4160]] then? [[G3767]]

### 11
He answereth [[G611]] and [[G1161]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] He that hath [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] coats, [[G5509]] let him impart [[G3330]] to him that hath [[G2192]] none; [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] he that hath [[G2192]] meat, [[G1033]] let him do [[G4160]] likewise. [[G3668]]

### 12
Then [[G1161]] came [[G2064]] also [[G2532]] publicans [[G5057]] to be baptized, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] what [[G5101]] shall we do? [[G4160]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Exact [[G4238]] no [[G3367]] more [[G4119]] than [[G3844]] that which is appointed [[G1299]] you. [[G5213]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] the soldiers [[G4754]] likewise [[G2532]] demanded [[G1905]] of him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] we [[G2249]] shall [[G4160]] do? [[G4160]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Do violence to [[G1286]] no man, [[G3367]] neither [[G3366]] accuse falsely; [[G4811]] and [[G2532]] be content [[G714]] with [[G3800]] your [[G5216]] wages. [[G3800]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] as [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] were in expectation, [[G4328]] and [[G2532]] all men [[G3956]] mused [[G1260]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] of [[G4012]] John, [[G2491]] whether or not; [[G3379]] he [[G846]] were [[G1498]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]]

### 16
John [[G2491]] answered, [[G611]] saying [[G3004]] unto all, [[G537]] I [[G1473]] indeed [[G3303]] baptize [[G907]] you [[G5209]] with water; [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] one mightier than [[G2478]] I [[G3450]] cometh, [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] latchet [[G2438]] of whose [[G3739]] shoes [[G5266]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] to unloose: [[G3089]] he [[G846]] shall baptize [[G907]] you [[G5209]] with [[G1722]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] with fire: [[G4442]]

### 17
Whose [[G3739]] fan [[G4425]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] he will throughly purge [[G1245]] his [[G846]] floor, [[G257]] and [[G2532]] will gather [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] wheat [[G4621]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] garner; [[G596]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chaff [[G892]] he will burn [[G2618]] with fire [[G4442]] unquenchable. [[G762]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] other things [[G2087]] in his exhortation [[G3870]] preached he [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] unto people. [[G2992]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] tetrarch, [[G5076]] being reproved [[G1651]] by [[G5259]] him [[G846]] for [[G4012]] Herodias [[G2266]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Philip's [[G5376]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] for [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] the evils [[G4190]] which [[G3739]] Herod [[G2264]] had done, [[G4160]]

### 20
Added [[G4369]] yet [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] above [[G1909]] all, [[G3956]] that [[G2532]] he shut up [[G2623]] John [[G2491]] in [[G1722]] prison. [[G5438]]

### 21
Now [[G1161]] when [[G1722]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] were baptized, [[G907]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that Jesus [[G2424]] also [[G2532]] being baptized, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] praying, [[G4336]] the [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] was opened, [[G455]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] descended [[G2597]] in a bodily [[G4984]] shape [[G1491]] like [[G5616]] a dove [[G4058]] upon [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] came [[G1096]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] which said, [[G3004]] Thou [[G4771]] art [[G1488]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] Son; [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] thee [[G4671]] I am well pleased. [[G2106]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] himself [[G846]] began [[G756]] to be [[G2258]] about [[G5616]] thirty [[G5144]] years of age, [[G2094]] being [[G5607]] (as [[G5613]] was supposed) [[G3543]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Joseph, [[G2501]] which was of Heli, [[G2242]]
