### 1
Then [[G1161]] said he [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] It is [[G2076]] impossible [[G418]] but [[G3361]] that [[G3588]] offences [[G4625]] will come: [[G2064]] but [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] they come! [[G2064]]

### 2
It were better [[G3081]] for him [[G846]] that [[G1487]] a millstone [[G3458]] were hanged [[G4029]] about [[G4012]] his [[G846]] neck, [[G5137]] and [[G2532]] he cast [[G4496]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] than [[G2228]] that [[G2443]] he should offend [[G4624]] one [[G1520]] of these [[G5130]] little [[G3398]] ones. [[G3398]]

### 3
Take heed [[G4337]] to yourselves: [[G1438]] If [[G1437]] thy [[G4675]] brother [[G80]] trespass [[G264]] against [[G1519]] thee, [[G4571]] rebuke [[G2008]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] he repent, [[G3340]] forgive [[G863]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] he trespass [[G264]] against [[G1519]] thee [[G4571]] seven times [[G2034]] a [[G3588]] in [[G2250]] day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] seven times [[G2034]] in a [[G2250]] day [[G2250]] turn again [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] thee, [[G4571]] saying, [[G3004]] I repent; [[G3340]] thou shalt forgive [[G863]] him. [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] Increase [[G4369]] our [[G2254]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said, [[G2036]] If [[G1487]] ye had [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] as [[G5613]] a grain [[G2848]] of mustard seed, [[G4615]] ye might say [[G3004]] unto this [[G3778]] sycamine tree, [[G4807]] Be thou plucked up by the root, [[G1610]] and [[G2532]] be thou planted [[G5452]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] it should obey [[G5219]] you. [[G5213]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you, [[G5216]] having [[G2192]] a servant [[G1401]] plowing [[G722]] or [[G2228]] feeding cattle, [[G4165]] will say by and [[G2046]] unto him [[G3739]] when he is come [[G1525]] by, [[G2112]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] field, [[G68]] Go [[G3928]] and sit down to meat? [[G377]]

### 8
And [[G235]] not rather [[G3780]] will [[G2046]] say [[G2046]] unto him, [[G846]] Make ready [[G2090]] wherewith [[G5101]] I may sup, [[G1172]] and [[G2532]] gird thyself, [[G4024]] and serve [[G1247]] me, [[G3427]] till [[G2193]] I have eaten [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drunken; [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] afterward [[G3326]] thou [[G4771]] shalt eat [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drink? [[G4095]]

### 9
Doth [[G3361]] he [[G5485]] thank [[G5485]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] because [[G3754]] he did [[G4160]] the things that [[G3588]] were commanded [[G1299]] him? [[G846]] I trow [[G1380]] not. [[G3756]]

### 10
So [[G3779]] likewise [[G2532]] ye, [[G5210]] when [[G3752]] ye shall have done [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] those things which [[G3588]] are commanded [[G1299]] you, [[G5213]] say, [[G3004]] We are [[G2070]] unprofitable [[G888]] servants: [[G1401]] we have done [[G4160]] that which [[G3739]] was our duty [[G3784]] to do. [[G4160]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] he [[G846]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] that [[G2532]] he [[G846]] passed [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] the midst [[G3319]] of Samaria [[G4540]] and [[G2532]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] as he [[G846]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] a certain [[G5100]] village, [[G2968]] there met [[G528]] him [[G846]] ten [[G1176]] men [[G435]] that were lepers, [[G3015]] which [[G3739]] stood [[G2476]] afar off: [[G4207]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] lifted up [[G142]] voices, [[G5456]] and said, [[G3004]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Master, [[G1988]] have mercy [[G1653]] on us. [[G2248]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] when he saw [[G1492]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Go [[G4198]] shew [[G1925]] yourselves [[G1438]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G2409]] priests. [[G2409]] And [[G2532]] it came to pass, that, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] they [[G3588]] went, [[G5217]] they [[G846]] were cleansed. [[G2511]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] when he saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he was healed, [[G2390]] turned back, [[G5290]] and with [[G3326]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] fell down [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] face [[G4383]] at [[G3844]] his [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] giving [[G2168]] him [[G846]] thanks: [[G2168]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] was [[G2258]] a Samaritan. [[G4541]]

### 17
And [[G3588]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said, [[G2036]] not [[G3780]] Were there [[G2511]] ten [[G1176]] cleansed? [[G2511]] but [[G1161]] where [[G4226]] the [[G3588]] nine? [[G1767]]

### 18
not [[G3756]] There are [[G2147]] found [[G2147]] that returned [[G5290]] to give [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] to [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] save [[G1487]] this [[G3778]] stranger. [[G241]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Arise, [[G450]] go thy way: [[G4198]] thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] hath made [[G4982]] thee [[G4571]] whole. [[G4982]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] when he was demanded [[G1905]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] when [[G4219]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] should come, [[G2064]] he answered [[G611]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] cometh [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] with [[G3326]] observation: [[G3907]]

### 21
Neither [[G3761]] shall they say, [[G2046]] Lo [[G2400]] here! [[G5602]] or, [[G2228]] lo [[G2400]] there! [[G1563]] for, [[G1063]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] within [[G1787]] you. [[G5216]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] The days [[G2250]] will come, [[G2064]] when [[G3753]] ye shall desire [[G1937]] to see [[G1492]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2250]] days [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] ye shall [[G3700]] see [[G3700]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] they shall say [[G2046]] to you, [[G5213]] See [[G2400]] here; [[G5602]] or, [[G2228]] see [[G2400]] there: [[G1563]] go after [[G565]] not [[G3361]] nor [[G3366]] follow [[G1377]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] lightning, [[G796]] that [[G3588]] lighteneth [[G797]] out of [[G1537]] the one [[G3588]] under [[G5259]] heaven, [[G3772]] shineth [[G2989]] unto [[G1519]] the other [[G3588]] under [[G5259]] heaven; [[G3772]] so [[G3779]] shall [[G2071]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] be [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] day. [[G2250]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] first [[G4412]] must [[G1163]] he [[G846]] suffer [[G3958]] many things, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] be rejected [[G593]] of [[G575]] this [[G3778]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] it was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of [[G3575]] Noe, [[G3575]] so [[G3779]] shall it be [[G2071]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man. [[G444]]

### 27
They did eat, [[G2068]] they drank, [[G4095]] they married wives, [[G1060]] they were given in marriage, [[G1547]] until [[G891]] the day [[G2250]] that [[G3739]] Noe [[G3575]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ark, [[G2787]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] flood [[G2627]] came, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] destroyed [[G622]] them all. [[G537]]

### 28
Likewise [[G3668]] also [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] it was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of Lot; [[G3091]] they did eat, [[G2068]] they drank, [[G4095]] they bought, [[G59]] they sold, [[G4453]] they planted, [[G5452]] they builded; [[G3618]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] the same day [[G2250]] that [[G3739]] Lot [[G3091]] went [[G1831]] out [[G575]] of Sodom [[G4670]] it rained [[G1026]] fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] brimstone [[G2303]] from [[G575]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] destroyed [[G622]] all. [[G537]]

### 30
Even [[G2596]] thus [[G5024]] shall it be [[G2071]] in the day [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] when is [[G601]] Son [[G5207]] of man [[G444]] revealed. [[G601]]

### 31
In [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day, [[G2250]] he which [[G3739]] shall be [[G2071]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetop, [[G1430]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] stuff [[G4632]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] not [[G3361]] let him come [[G2597]] down [[G2597]] to take away: [[G142]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that is in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] field, [[G68]] likewise [[G3668]] let him [[G1994]] not [[G3361]] return [[G1994]] back. [[G3694]]

### 32
Remember [[G3421]] Lot's [[G3091]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 33
Whosoever [[G3739]] shall seek [[G2212]] to save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] shall lose [[G622]] it; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall lose [[G622]] his life [[G846]] shall preserve [[G2225]] it. [[G846]]

### 34
I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G5213]] in that [[G3778]] night [[G3571]] there shall be [[G2071]] two [[G1417]] in [[G1909]] one [[G1520]] bed; [[G2825]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] shall be taken, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] shall be left. [[G863]]

### 35
Two [[G1417]] shall be [[G2071]] grinding [[G229]] together; [[G846]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] shall be taken, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] left. [[G863]]

### 36
Two [[G1417]] shall be [[G2071]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] field; [[G68]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] shall be taken, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] left. [[G863]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] they answered [[G611]] and said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Where, [[G4226]] Lord? [[G2962]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Wheresoever [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] thither [[G1563]] will be gathered [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] eagles [[G105]] together. [[G4863]]
