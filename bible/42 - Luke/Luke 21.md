### 1
And [[G1161]] he looked up, [[G308]] and saw [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] rich men [[G4145]] casting [[G906]] their [[G846]] gifts [[G1435]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] treasury. [[G1049]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] he saw [[G1492]] also [[G2532]] a certain [[G5100]] poor [[G3998]] widow [[G5503]] casting in [[G906]] thither [[G1563]] two [[G1417]] mites. [[G3016]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he said, [[G2036]] Of a truth [[G230]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] poor [[G4434]] widow [[G5503]] hath cast in [[G906]] more [[G4119]] than they all: [[G3956]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] all [[G537]] these [[G3778]] have of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] abundance [[G4052]] cast in [[G906]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] offerings [[G1435]] of God: [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] she [[G3778]] of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] penury [[G5303]] hath cast in [[G906]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] living [[G979]] that [[G3739]] she had. [[G2192]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] as some [[G5100]] spake [[G3004]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] how [[G3754]] it was adorned [[G2885]] with goodly [[G2570]] stones [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] gifts, [[G334]] he said, [[G2036]]

### 6
these things [[G5023]] which [[G3739]] ye behold, [[G2334]] the days [[G2250]] will come, [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] there shall be [[G863]] left [[G863]] one stone [[G3037]] upon [[G1909]] another, [[G3037]] that [[G3739]] shall not [[G3756]] be thrown down. [[G2647]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] they asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] but [[G3767]] when [[G4219]] these things [[G5023]] shall [[G2071]] be? [[G2071]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] sign [[G4592]] when [[G3752]] these things [[G5023]] shall [[G3195]] come to pass? [[G1096]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Take heed that [[G991]] not [[G3361]] ye be [[G4105]] deceived: [[G4105]] for [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] name, [[G3686]] saying, [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] draweth near: [[G1448]] go ye [[G4198]] not [[G3361]] therefore [[G3767]] after [[G3694]] them. [[G846]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] ye shall hear [[G191]] of wars [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] commotions, [[G181]] not [[G3361]] be [[G4422]] terrified: [[G4422]] for [[G1063]] these things [[G5023]] must [[G1163]] first [[G4412]] come to pass; [[G1096]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] not [[G3756]] by and by. [[G2112]]

### 10
Then [[G5119]] said he [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Nation [[G1484]] shall rise [[G1453]] against [[G1909]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kingdom [[G932]] against [[G1909]] kingdom: [[G932]]

### 11
And [[G5037]] great [[G3173]] earthquakes [[G4578]] shall be [[G2071]] in [[G2596]] divers places, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] famines, [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] pestilences; [[G3061]] and [[G5037]] fearful sights [[G5400]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] signs [[G4592]] shall there be [[G2071]] from [[G575]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] before [[G4253]] all [[G537]] these, [[G5130]] they shall lay [[G1911]] their [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] persecute [[G1377]] delivering up [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] the synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] into prisons, [[G5438]] being brought [[G71]] before [[G1909]] kings [[G935]] and [[G2532]] rulers [[G2232]] for [[G1752]] my [[G3450]] name's [[G3686]] sake. [[G1752]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] it shall turn [[G576]] to you [[G5213]] for [[G1519]] a testimony. [[G3142]]

### 14
Settle [[G5087]] therefore [[G3767]] in [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] hearts, [[G2588]] not [[G3361]] to meditate before [[G4304]] what ye shall answer: [[G626]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] will give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] a mouth [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] wisdom, [[G4678]] which [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] your [[G5213]] adversaries [[G480]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G1410]] able [[G1410]] to gainsay [[G471]] nor [[G3761]] resist. [[G436]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] ye shall be betrayed [[G3860]] both [[G2532]] by [[G5259]] parents, [[G1118]] and [[G2532]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] kinsfolks, [[G4773]] and [[G2532]] friends; [[G5384]] and [[G2532]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] shall they cause to be put to death. [[G2289]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] ye shall be [[G2071]] hated [[G3404]] of [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] for [[G1223]] my [[G3450]] name's sake. [[G3686]]

### 18
But [[G2532]] there shall [[G622]] not [[G3361]] an hair [[G2359]] of [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] head [[G2776]] perish. [[G622]]

### 19
In [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] patience [[G5281]] possess ye [[G2932]] your [[G5216]] souls. [[G5590]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] ye shall see [[G1492]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] compassed [[G2944]] with [[G5259]] armies, [[G4760]] then [[G5119]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] desolation [[G2050]] thereof [[G846]] is nigh. [[G1448]]

### 21
Then [[G5119]] let them which [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] Judaea [[G2449]] flee [[G5343]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountains; [[G3735]] and let [[G2532]] them which [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of it [[G846]] depart out; [[G1633]] and let [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] them that [[G3588]] are in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] countries [[G5561]] enter [[G1525]] thereinto. [[G1519]]

### 22
For [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] be [[G1526]] the days [[G2250]] of vengeance, [[G1557]] that all things [[G3956]] which [[G3588]] are written [[G1125]] may be [[G4137]] fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] woe [[G3759]] them [[G3588]] unto that [[G2192]] are [[G2192]] with [[G1722]] child, [[G1064]] and [[G2532]] to them that [[G3588]] give suck, [[G2337]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days! [[G2250]] for [[G1063]] there shall be [[G2071]] great [[G3173]] distress [[G318]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] wrath [[G3709]] upon [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] people. [[G2992]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] they shall fall [[G4098]] by the edge [[G4750]] of the sword, [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] shall be led away captive [[G163]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] nations: [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] shall be [[G2071]] trodden down [[G3961]] of [[G5259]] the Gentiles, [[G1484]] until [[G891]] the times [[G2540]] of the Gentiles [[G1484]] be fulfilled. [[G4137]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] there shall be [[G2071]] signs [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] the sun, [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] in the moon, [[G4582]] and [[G2532]] in the stars; [[G798]] and [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] distress [[G4928]] of nations, [[G1484]] with [[G1722]] perplexity; [[G640]] the sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] the waves [[G4535]] roaring; [[G2278]]

### 26
Men's [[G444]] hearts failing them [[G674]] for [[G575]] fear, [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] for looking after [[G4329]] those things [[G3588]] which are coming on [[G1904]] the [[G3588]] earth: [[G3625]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] powers [[G1411]] of [[G3772]] heaven [[G3772]] shall be shaken. [[G4531]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] shall they see [[G3700]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] a cloud [[G3507]] with [[G3326]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] when these things [[G5130]] begin to [[G756]] come to pass, [[G1096]] then look up, [[G352]] and [[G2532]] lift up [[G1869]] your [[G5216]] heads; [[G2776]] for [[G1360]] your [[G5216]] redemption [[G629]] draweth nigh. [[G1448]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] he spake [[G2036]] to them [[G846]] a parable; [[G3850]] Behold [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] fig tree, [[G4808]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] trees; [[G1186]]

### 30
When [[G3752]] they shoot [[G4261]] now [[G2235]] forth, [[G4261]] ye see [[G991]] and know [[G1097]] of [[G575]] your own selves [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] summer [[G2330]] is [[G2076]] now [[G2235]] nigh at hand. [[G1451]]

### 31
So [[G3779]] likewise [[G2532]] ye, [[G5210]] when [[G3752]] ye see [[G1492]] these things [[G5023]] come to pass, [[G1096]] know ye [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is [[G2076]] nigh at hand. [[G1451]]

### 32
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] This [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] shall pass [[G3928]] not [[G3361]] away, [[G3928]] till [[G2193]] all [[G3956]] be fulfilled. [[G1096]]

### 33
Heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] shall pass away: [[G3928]] but [[G1161]] my [[G3450]] words [[G3056]] shall pass [[G3928]] not [[G3361]] away. [[G3928]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] take heed to [[G4337]] yourselves, [[G1438]] lest at any time [[G3379]] your [[G5216]] hearts [[G2588]] be overcharged [[G925]] with [[G1722]] surfeiting, [[G2897]] and [[G2532]] drunkenness, [[G3178]] and [[G2532]] cares [[G3308]] of this life, [[G982]] and [[G2532]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] come [[G2186]] upon [[G1909]] you [[G5209]] unawares. [[G160]]

### 35
For [[G1063]] as [[G5613]] a snare [[G3803]] shall it come [[G1904]] on [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] them that [[G3588]] dwell [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the face [[G4383]] of [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 36
Watch ye [[G69]] therefore, [[G3767]] and pray [[G1189]] always, [[G3956]] that [[G2443]] ye may be accounted worthy [[G2661]] to escape [[G1628]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] that [[G3588]] shall [[G3195]] come to pass, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] to stand [[G2476]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man. [[G444]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] in [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] day time [[G2250]] he was [[G2258]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple; [[G2411]] and [[G1161]] at night [[G3571]] he went out, [[G1831]] and abode [[G835]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] that [[G3588]] is called [[G2564]] of Olives. [[G1636]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] came early in the morning [[G3719]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] for to hear [[G191]] him. [[G846]]
