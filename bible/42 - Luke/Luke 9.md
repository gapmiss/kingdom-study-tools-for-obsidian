### 1
Then [[G1161]] he called [[G4779]] his [[G846]] twelve [[G1427]] disciples [[G3101]] together, [[G4779]] and gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] devils, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] to cure [[G2323]] diseases. [[G3554]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] to preach [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] to heal [[G2390]] the [[G3588]] sick. [[G770]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Take [[G142]] nothing [[G3367]] for [[G1519]] journey, [[G3598]] neither [[G3383]] staves, [[G4464]] nor [[G3383]] scrip, [[G4082]] neither [[G3383]] bread, [[G740]] neither [[G3383]] money; [[G694]] neither [[G3383]] have [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] coats [[G5509]] apiece. [[G303]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G3739]] house [[G3614]] ye enter [[G1525]] into, [[G1519]] there [[G1563]] abide, [[G3306]] and [[G2532]] thence [[G1564]] depart. [[G1831]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3745]] will [[G1209]] not [[G3361]] receive [[G1209]] you, [[G5209]] when ye go out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] that [[G1565]] city, [[G4172]] shake off [[G660]] the [[G3588]] very [[G2532]] dust [[G2868]] from [[G575]] your [[G5216]] feet [[G4228]] for [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] against [[G1909]] them. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] they departed, [[G1831]] and went [[G1330]] through [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] towns, [[G2968]] preaching the gospel, [[G2097]] and [[G2532]] healing [[G2323]] every where. [[G3837]]

### 7
Now [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] tetrarch [[G5076]] heard [[G191]] of that was [[G1096]] all [[G3956]] done [[G1096]] by [[G5259]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he was perplexed, [[G1280]] because [[G1223]] that [[G3588]] it was said [[G3004]] of [[G5259]] some, [[G5100]] that [[G3754]] John [[G2491]] was risen [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the dead; [[G3498]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] of [[G5259]] some, [[G5100]] that [[G3754]] Elias [[G2243]] had appeared; [[G5316]] and [[G1161]] of others, [[G243]] that [[G3754]] one [[G1520]] of [[G4396]] the [[G3588]] old [[G744]] prophets [[G4396]] was risen again. [[G450]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] Herod [[G2264]] said, [[G2036]] John [[G2491]] I [[G1473]] have [[G607]] beheaded: [[G607]] but [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] this, [[G3778]] of [[G4012]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] hear [[G191]] such things? [[G5108]] And [[G2532]] he desired [[G2212]] to see [[G1492]] him. [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] apostles, [[G652]] when they were returned, [[G5290]] told [[G1334]] him [[G846]] all that [[G3745]] they had done. [[G4160]] And [[G2532]] he took [[G3880]] them, [[G846]] and went aside [[G5298]] privately [[G2596]] into [[G1519]] a [[G5117]] desert [[G2048]] place [[G5117]] belonging to the city [[G4172]] called [[G2564]] Bethsaida. [[G966]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] when they knew [[G1097]] followed [[G190]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he received [[G1209]] them, [[G846]] and spake [[G2980]] unto them [[G846]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] healed [[G2390]] them that had [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] of healing. [[G2322]]

### 12
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G756]] day [[G2250]] began [[G756]] to wear away, [[G2827]] then [[G1161]] came [[G4334]] the [[G3588]] twelve, [[G1427]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Send away, [[G630]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] that [[G2443]] they may go [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] towns [[G2968]] and [[G2532]] country [[G68]] round about, [[G2945]] and lodge, [[G2647]] and [[G2532]] get [[G2147]] victuals: [[G1979]] for [[G3754]] we are [[G2070]] here [[G5602]] in [[G1722]] a desert [[G2048]] place. [[G5117]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Give [[G1325]] ye [[G5210]] them [[G846]] to eat. [[G5315]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] We [[G2254]] have [[G1526]] no [[G3756]] more [[G4119]] but [[G2228]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] fishes; [[G2486]] except [[G1487]] we [[G2249]] should go [[G4198]] and buy [[G59]] meat [[G1033]] for [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] this [[G5126]] people. [[G2992]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] they were [[G2258]] about [[G5616]] five thousand [[G4000]] men. [[G435]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Make down [[G2625]] them [[G846]] sit [[G2625]] by [[G303]] fifties [[G4004]] in a company. [[G2828]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] they did [[G4160]] so, [[G3779]] and [[G2532]] made down. [[G347]] them all [[G537]] sit [[G347]]

### 16
Then [[G1161]] he took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] fishes, [[G2486]] and looking up [[G308]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] he blessed [[G2127]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] brake, [[G2622]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3101]] disciples [[G3101]] to set before [[G3908]] the [[G3588]] multitude. [[G3793]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] they did eat, [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were [[G5526]] all [[G3956]] filled: [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] there was taken up [[G142]] of fragments [[G2801]] that [[G3588]] remained [[G4052]] to them [[G846]] twelve [[G1427]] baskets. [[G2894]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] he [[G846]] was [[G1511]] alone [[G2651]] praying, [[G4336]] his [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were with [[G4895]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he asked [[G1905]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Whom that [[G5101]] say [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] I [[G3165]] am? [[G1511]]

### 19
They [[G3588]] answering [[G611]] said, [[G2036]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist; [[G910]] but [[G1161]] some [[G243]] Elias; [[G2243]] and [[G1161]] others [[G243]] that [[G3754]] one [[G5100]] of [[G4396]] the [[G3588]] old [[G744]] prophets [[G4396]] is risen again. [[G450]]

### 20
He said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] But [[G1161]] whom that [[G5101]] say [[G3004]] ye [[G5210]] I [[G3165]] am? [[G1511]] Peter [[G4074]] answering [[G611]] said, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] straitly charged [[G2008]] them, [[G846]] and commanded [[G3853]] to tell [[G2036]] no man [[G3367]] that thing; [[G5124]]

### 22
Saying, [[G2036]] The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] suffer [[G3958]] many things, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] be rejected [[G593]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] be slain, [[G615]] and [[G2532]] be raised [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day. [[G2250]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] he said [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] all, [[G3956]] If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] will [[G2309]] come [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] let him deny [[G533]] himself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] his [[G846]] cross [[G4716]] daily, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3739]] will [[G2309]] save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] shall lose [[G622]] it: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] whosoever [[G3739]] will lose [[G622]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G1752]] my [[G1700]] sake, [[G1752]] the same [[G3778]] shall save [[G4982]] it. [[G846]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] is [[G5623]] a man [[G444]] advantaged, [[G5623]] if he gain [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G1161]] lose [[G622]] himself, [[G1438]] or [[G2228]] be cast away? [[G2210]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall be ashamed [[G1870]] of me [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] of [[G3056]] my [[G1699]] words, [[G3056]] of him [[G5126]] the [[G3588]] shall be [[G1870]] Son [[G5207]]  of [[G3588]] man [[G444]] ashamed, [[G1870]] when [[G3752]] he shall come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] Father's, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] of [[G32]] holy [[G40]] angels. [[G32]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] of a truth, [[G230]] there be [[G1526]] some [[G5100]] standing [[G2476]] here, [[G5602]] which [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] shall [[G1089]] taste [[G1089]] of death, [[G2288]] till [[G2193]] they see [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] it came to pass [[G1096]] about [[G5616]] an [[G2250]] eight [[G3638]] days [[G2250]] after [[G3326]] these [[G5128]] sayings, [[G3056]] he [[G2532]] took [[G3880]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] James, [[G2385]] and went up [[G305]] into [[G1519]] a [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] to pray. [[G4336]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] as [[G1096]] he [[G846]] prayed, [[G4336]] the [[G3588]] fashion [[G1491]] of [[G4383]] his [[G846]] countenance [[G4383]] was altered, [[G2087]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] raiment [[G2441]] white [[G3022]] glistering. [[G1823]]

### 30
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there talked with [[G4814]] him [[G846]] two [[G1417]] men, [[G435]] which [[G3748]] were [[G2258]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] Elias: [[G2243]]

### 31
Who [[G3739]] appeared [[G3700]] in [[G1722]] glory, [[G1391]] and spake [[G3004]] of [[G1841]] his [[G846]] decease [[G1841]] which [[G3739]] he should [[G3195]] accomplish [[G4137]] at [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that were with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] were [[G2258]] heavy [[G916]] with sleep: [[G5258]] and [[G1161]] when they were awake, [[G1235]] they saw [[G1492]] his [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] men [[G435]] that [[G3588]] stood with [[G4921]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] they [[G846]] departed [[G1316]] from [[G575]] him, [[G846]] Peter [[G4074]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Master, [[G1988]] it is [[G2076]] good [[G2570]] for us [[G2248]] to be [[G1511]] here: [[G5602]] and [[G2532]] let us make [[G4160]] three [[G5140]] tabernacles; [[G4633]] one [[G1520]] for thee, [[G4671]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] for Elias: [[G2243]] not [[G3361]] knowing [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] he said. [[G3004]]

### 34
While [[G1161]] he [[G846]] thus [[G5023]] spake, [[G3004]] there came [[G1096]] a cloud, [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] overshadowed [[G1982]] them: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] they feared [[G5399]] as [[G1722]] they [[G1565]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] cloud. [[G3507]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] there came [[G1096]] a voice [[G5456]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] cloud, [[G3507]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] beloved [[G27]] Son: [[G5207]] hear [[G191]] him. [[G846]]

### 36
And [[G2532]] when [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] was past, [[G1096]] Jesus [[G2424]] was found [[G2147]] alone. [[G3441]] And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] kept close, [[G4601]] and [[G2532]] told [[G518]] no man [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] any things [[G3762]] of those [[G3739]] which [[G3739]] they had seen. [[G3708]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, that [[G1096]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] next [[G1836]] day, [[G2250]] when were come [[G2718]] they [[G846]] down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] hill, [[G3735]] much [[G4183]] people [[G3793]] met [[G4876]] him. [[G846]]

### 38
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a man [[G435]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] company [[G3793]] cried out, [[G310]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] I beseech [[G1189]] thee, [[G4675]] look [[G1914]] upon [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] son: [[G5207]] for [[G3754]] he is [[G2076]] mine [[G3427]] only child. [[G3439]]

### 39
And, [[G2532]] lo, [[G2400]] a spirit [[G4151]] taketh [[G2983]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] suddenly [[G1810]] he out; [[G2896]] crieth [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] it teareth [[G4682]] him [[G846]] that he again, [[G876]] foameth [[G876]] and [[G2532]] bruising [[G4937]] him [[G846]] hardly [[G3425]] departeth [[G672]] from [[G575]] him. [[G846]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] I besought [[G1189]] thy [[G4675]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G2443]] cast out; [[G1544]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they could [[G1410]] not. [[G3756]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] said, [[G2036]] O [[G5599]] faithless [[G571]] and [[G2532]] perverse [[G1294]] generation, [[G1074]] how [[G2193]] long [[G4219]] shall I be [[G2071]] with [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] and [[G2532]] suffer [[G430]] you? [[G5216]] Bring [[G4317]] thy [[G4675]] son [[G5207]] hither. [[G5602]]

### 42
And as [[G1161]] he [[G846]] yet [[G2089]] was a [[G4334]] coming, [[G4334]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1140]] threw down, [[G4486]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] tare [[G4952]] And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] healed [[G2390]] the [[G3588]] child, [[G3816]] and [[G2532]] delivered again [[G591]] him [[G846]] to [[G3962]] his [[G846]] father. [[G3962]]

### 43
And [[G1161]] they were [[G1605]] all [[G3956]] amazed [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] mighty power [[G3168]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]] But [[G1161]] while they wondered [[G2296]] every one [[G3956]] at [[G1909]] all things [[G3956]] which [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] did, [[G4160]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]]

### 44
Let sink [[G5087]] these [[G5128]] sayings [[G3056]] down [[G5087]] into [[G1519]] your [[G5216]] ears: [[G3775]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] shall [[G3195]] be delivered [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] the hands [[G5495]] of men. [[G444]]

### 45
But [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] understood not [[G50]] this [[G5124]] saying, [[G4487]] and [[G2532]] it was [[G2258]] hid [[G3871]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] they perceived [[G143]] it [[G846]] not: [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] they feared [[G5399]] to ask [[G2065]] him [[G846]] of [[G4012]] that [[G5127]] saying. [[G4487]]

### 46
Then [[G1161]] there arose [[G1525]] a reasoning [[G1261]] among [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] which [[G5101]] of them [[G846]] should be [[G1498]] greatest. [[G3187]]

### 47
And [[G1161]] Jesus, [[G2424]] perceiving [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] thought [[G1261]] of [[G2588]] their [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] took [[G1949]] a child, [[G3813]] and set [[G2476]] him [[G846]] by [[G3844]] him, [[G1438]]

### 48
And [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Whosoever [[G3739]] shall receive [[G1209]] this [[G5124]] child [[G3813]] in [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] name [[G3686]] receiveth [[G1209]] me: [[G1691]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] shall receive [[G1209]] me [[G1691]] receiveth [[G1209]] him [[G3588]] that sent [[G649]] me: [[G3165]] for [[G1063]] he that is [[G5225]] least [[G3398]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5213]] all, [[G3956]] the same [[G3778]] shall be [[G2071]] great. [[G3173]]

### 49
And [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Master, [[G1988]] we saw [[G1492]] one [[G5100]] casting out [[G1544]] devils [[G1140]] in [[G1909]] thy [[G4675]] name; [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] we forbad [[G2967]] him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] he followeth [[G190]] not [[G3756]] with [[G3326]] us.
