### 1
After [[G3326]] these things [[G5023]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] appointed [[G322]] other [[G2087]] seventy [[G1440]] also, [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] and [[G303]] two [[G1417]] two [[G1417]] before [[G4253]] his [[G846]] face [[G4383]] into [[G1519]] every [[G3956]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] place, [[G5117]] whither [[G3739]] he [[G3195]] himself [[G846]] would [[G3195]] come. [[G2064]]

### 2
Therefore [[G3767]] said he [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] harvest [[G2326]] truly [[G3303]] great, [[G4183]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] labourers [[G2040]] few: [[G3641]] pray ye [[G1189]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2326]] harvest, [[G2326]] that [[G3704]] he would send forth [[G1544]] labourers [[G2040]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] harvest. [[G2326]]

### 3
Go your ways: [[G5217]] behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] send forth [[G649]] you [[G5209]] as [[G5613]] lambs [[G704]] among [[G1722]] wolves. [[G3074]]

### 4
Carry [[G941]] neither [[G3361]] purse, [[G905]] nor [[G3361]] scrip, [[G4082]] nor [[G3366]] shoes: [[G5266]] and [[G2532]] salute [[G782]] no man [[G3367]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] into [[G1519]] whatsoever [[G3739]] house [[G3614]] ye enter, [[G1525]] first [[G4412]] say, [[G3004]] Peace [[G1515]] to [[G3624]] this [[G5129]] house. [[G3624]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of peace [[G1515]] be [[G5600]] there, [[G1563]] your [[G5216]] peace [[G1515]] shall rest [[G1879]] upon [[G1909]] it: [[G846]] if [[G1487]] not, [[G3361]] it shall turn again. [[G344]] to [[G1909]] you [[G5209]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] house [[G3614]] remain, [[G3306]] eating [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinking [[G4095]] such things [[G3588]] as [[G3844]] they [[G846]] give: [[G3844]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] labourer [[G2040]] is [[G2076]] worthy [[G514]] of [[G3408]] his [[G846]] hire. [[G3408]] Go [[G3327]] not [[G3361]] from [[G1537]] house [[G3614]] to [[G1519]] house. [[G3614]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] whatsoever [[G3739]] city [[G4172]] ye enter, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] they receive [[G1209]] you, [[G5209]] eat [[G2068]] such [[G3588]] things as are set before [[G3908]] you: [[G5213]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] heal [[G2323]] the [[G3588]] sick [[G772]] that are therein, [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] say [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is come nigh [[G1448]] unto [[G1909]] you. [[G5209]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] into [[G1519]] whatsoever [[G3739]] city [[G4172]] ye enter, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] they receive [[G1209]] you [[G5209]] not, [[G3361]] go your ways out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] streets [[G4113]] of the same, [[G846]] and say, [[G2036]]

### 11
Even very [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dust [[G2868]] of [[G1537]] your [[G5216]] city, [[G4172]] which [[G3588]] cleaveth [[G2853]] on us, [[G2254]] we do wipe off against [[G631]] you: [[G5213]] notwithstanding [[G4133]] be ye sure [[G1097]] of this, [[G5124]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is come nigh [[G1448]] unto [[G1909]] you. [[G5209]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] it shall be [[G2071]] more tolerable [[G414]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] for Sodom, [[G4670]] than [[G2228]] for [[G4172]] that [[G1565]] city. [[G4172]]

### 13
Woe [[G3759]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Chorazin! [[G5523]] woe [[G3759]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Bethsaida! [[G966]] for [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] mighty works [[G1411]] had been done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4605]] which [[G3588]] have been done [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] a great while ago [[G3819]] had [[G3340]] they repented, [[G3340]] sitting [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] sackcloth [[G4526]] and [[G2532]] ashes. [[G4700]]

### 14
But [[G4133]] it shall be [[G2071]] more tolerable [[G414]] for Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon [[G4605]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment, [[G2920]] than [[G2228]] for you. [[G5213]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] thou, [[G4771]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] which art exalted [[G5312]] to [[G2193]] heaven, [[G3772]] shalt be thrust down [[G2601]] to [[G2193]] hell. [[G86]]

### 16
He [[G3588]] that heareth [[G191]] you [[G5216]] heareth [[G191]] me; [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that despiseth [[G114]] you [[G5209]] despiseth [[G114]] me; [[G1691]] and [[G1161]] he that despiseth [[G114]] me [[G1691]] despiseth [[G114]] him [[G3588]] that sent [[G649]] me. [[G3165]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] seventy [[G1440]] returned again [[G5290]] with [[G3326]] joy, [[G5479]] saying, [[G3004]] Lord, [[G2962]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] devils [[G1140]] are subject unto [[G5293]] us [[G2254]] through [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] name. [[G3686]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] I beheld [[G2334]] Satan [[G4567]] as [[G5613]] lightning [[G796]] fall [[G4098]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 19
Behold, [[G2400]] I give [[G1325]] unto you [[G5213]] power [[G1849]] to tread [[G3961]] on [[G1883]] serpents [[G3789]] and [[G2532]] scorpions, [[G4651]] and [[G2532]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2190]] enemy: [[G2190]] and [[G2532]] nothing [[G3762]] by any [[G3756]] shall [[G91]] means [[G3361]] hurt [[G91]] you. [[G5209]]

### 20
Notwithstanding [[G4133]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] rejoice [[G5463]] not, [[G3361]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] are subject unto [[G5293]] you; [[G5213]] but [[G1161]] rather [[G3123]] rejoice, [[G5463]] because [[G3754]] your [[G5216]] names [[G3686]] are written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 21
In [[G1722]] that [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] Jesus [[G2424]] rejoiced [[G21]] in [[G4151]] spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] I thank [[G1843]] thee, [[G4671]] O Father, [[G3962]] Lord [[G2962]] of [[G3772]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth, [[G1093]] that thou hast hid [[G613]] these things [[G5023]] from [[G575]] the wise [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] prudent, [[G4908]] and [[G2532]] hast revealed [[G601]] them [[G846]] unto babes: [[G3516]] even so, [[G3483]] Father; [[G3962]] for [[G3754]] so [[G3779]] it seemed [[G1096]] good [[G2107]] in [[G1715]] thy [[G4675]] sight. [[G1715]]

### 22
All things [[G3956]] are delivered [[G3860]] to me [[G3427]] of [[G5259]] my [[G3450]] Father: [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] no man [[G3762]] knoweth [[G1097]] who [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] is, [[G2076]] but [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Father; [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is, [[G2076]] but [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] to whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] will [[G1014]] reveal [[G601]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he turned him [[G4762]] unto [[G4314]] disciples, [[G3101]] and said [[G2036]] privately, [[G2596]] Blessed [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] which see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] things that [[G3739]] ye see: [[G991]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] kings [[G935]] have desired [[G2309]] to see [[G1492]] those things which [[G3739]] ye [[G5210]] see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] have [[G1492]] seen [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] to hear [[G191]] those things which [[G3739]] ye hear, [[G191]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] have [[G191]] heard [[G191]]

### 25
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a certain [[G5100]] lawyer [[G3544]] stood up, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] tempted [[G1598]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1320]] what [[G5101]] shall I do [[G4160]] to inherit [[G2816]] eternal [[G166]] life? [[G2222]]

### 26
He [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law? [[G3551]] how [[G4459]] readest thou? [[G314]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answering [[G611]] said, [[G2036]] Thou shalt love [[G25]] the Lord [[G2962]] thy [[G4675]] God [[G2316]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] heart, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] soul, [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] strength, [[G2479]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] thy [[G4675]] mind; [[G1271]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] neighbour [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] thyself. [[G4572]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Thou hast answered [[G611]] right: [[G3723]] this [[G5124]] do, [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt live. [[G2198]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] he, [[G3588]] willing [[G2309]] to justify [[G1344]] himself, [[G1438]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] And [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] neighbour? [[G4139]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G5274]] said, [[G2036]] A certain [[G5100]] man [[G444]] went down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to [[G1519]] Jericho, [[G2410]] and [[G2532]] fell among [[G4045]] thieves, [[G3027]] which [[G3739]] stripped of his raiment, [[G1562]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] wounded [[G2007]] and departed, [[G565]] leaving [[G863]] half dead. [[G2253]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] by [[G2596]] chance [[G4795]] there came down [[G2597]] a certain [[G5100]] priest [[G2409]] that [[G1565]] way: [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] when he saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] he passed by on the other side. [[G492]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] likewise [[G3668]] a [[G2532]] Levite, [[G3019]] when he was [[G1096]] at [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] place, [[G5117]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] looked [[G1492]] and passed by on the other side. [[G492]]

### 33
But [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] Samaritan, [[G4541]] as he journeyed, [[G3593]] came [[G2064]] where was: [[G2596]] he [[G846]] and [[G2532]] when he saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] he had compassion [[G4697]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] went to [[G4334]] and bound up [[G2611]] his [[G846]] wounds, [[G5134]] pouring in [[G2022]] oil [[G1637]] and [[G2532]] wine, [[G3631]] and [[G1161]] set [[G1913]] him [[G846]] on [[G1909]] his [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] beast, [[G2934]] and brought [[G71]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] an inn, [[G3829]] and [[G2532]] took care of [[G1959]] him. [[G846]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] morrow [[G839]] when he departed, [[G1831]] he took out [[G1544]] two [[G1417]] pence, [[G1220]] and gave [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] to [[G3830]] host, [[G3830]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Take care of [[G1959]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] whatsoever [[G3739]] thou spendest more, [[G4325]] when [[G1722]] I [[G3165]] come again, [[G1880]] I [[G1473]] will repay [[G591]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 36
Which [[G5101]] now [[G3767]] of these [[G5130]] three, [[G5140]] thinkest [[G1380]] thou, [[G4671]] was [[G1096]] neighbour [[G4139]] him [[G3588]] unto that [[G1706]] fell [[G1706]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] thieves? [[G3027]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] He [[G3588]] that shewed [[G4160]] mercy [[G1656]] on [[G3326]] him. [[G846]] Then [[G3767]] said [[G2036]] Jesus [[G2424]] unto him, [[G846]] Go, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] thou [[G4771]] likewise. [[G3668]]

### 38
Now [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] they [[G846]] went, [[G4198]] that [[G2532]] he [[G846]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] a [[G2968]] certain [[G5100]] village: [[G2968]] and [[G1161]] a [[G1135]] certain [[G5100]] woman [[G1135]] named [[G3686]] Martha [[G3136]] received [[G5264]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] her [[G846]] house. [[G3624]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] she [[G3592]] had [[G2258]] a sister [[G79]] called [[G2564]] Mary, [[G3137]] which [[G3739]] also [[G2532]] sat [[G3869]] at [[G3844]] Jesus' [[G2424]] feet, [[G4228]] and heard [[G191]] his [[G846]] word. [[G3056]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] Martha [[G3136]] was cumbered [[G4049]] about [[G4012]] much [[G4183]] serving, [[G1248]] and [[G1161]] came to him, [[G2186]] and said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] dost [[G3199]] thou [[G4671]] not [[G3756]] care [[G3199]] that [[G3754]] my [[G3450]] sister [[G79]] hath left [[G2641]] me [[G3165]] to serve [[G1247]] alone? [[G3441]] bid [[G2036]] her [[G846]] therefore [[G3767]] that [[G2443]] she help [[G4878]] me. [[G3427]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Martha, [[G3136]] Martha, [[G3136]] thou art careful [[G3309]] and [[G2532]] troubled [[G5182]] about [[G4012]] many things: [[G4183]]

### 42
But [[G1161]] one thing [[G1520]] is [[G2076]] needful: [[G5532]] and [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] hath chosen [[G1586]] that [[G3310]] good [[G18]] part, [[G3310]] which [[G3748]] not [[G3756]] shall be taken [[G851]] away [[G851]] from [[G575]] her. [[G846]]
