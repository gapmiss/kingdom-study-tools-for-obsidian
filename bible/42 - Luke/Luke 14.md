### 1
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as he [[G846]] went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the house [[G3624]] of one [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G758]] chief [[G758]] Pharisees [[G5330]] to eat [[G5315]] bread [[G740]] on the sabbath day, [[G4521]] that [[G2532]] they [[G846]] watched [[G2258]] him. [[G846]]

### 2
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there was [[G2258]] a certain [[G5100]] man [[G444]] before [[G1715]] him [[G846]] which had the dropsy. [[G5203]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answering [[G611]] spake [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] lawyers [[G3544]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] saying, [[G3004]] Is it lawful [[G1832]] to heal [[G2323]] the [[G3588]] on sabbath [[G4521]] day? [[G4521]]

### 4
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] held their [[G2270]] peace. [[G2270]] And [[G2532]] he took [[G1949]] and healed [[G2390]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] let him go; [[G630]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] saying, [[G2036]] Which [[G5101]] of you [[G5216]] an ass [[G3688]] shall have [[G1706]] or [[G2228]] an ox [[G1016]] fallen [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] a pit, [[G5421]] and [[G2532]] will not [[G3756]] straightway [[G2112]] pull out [[G385]] him [[G846]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sabbath [[G4521]] day? [[G2250]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] they could [[G2480]] not [[G3756]] answer again [[G470]] him [[G846]] to [[G4314]] these things. [[G5023]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] he put forth [[G3004]] a parable [[G3850]] to [[G4314]] those which [[G3588]] were bidden, [[G2564]] when he marked [[G1907]] how [[G4459]] they chose out [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] chief rooms; [[G4411]] saying [[G3004]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]]

### 8
When [[G3752]] thou art bidden [[G2564]] of [[G5259]] any [[G5100]] to [[G1519]] a wedding, [[G1062]] sit down [[G2625]] not [[G3361]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] highest room; [[G4411]] lest [[G3379]] a more honourable man [[G1784]] than thou [[G4675]] be [[G5600]] bidden [[G2564]] of [[G5259]] him; [[G846]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that bade [[G2564]] thee [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] him [[G846]] come [[G2064]] and say [[G2046]] to thee, [[G4671]] Give [[G1325]] this man [[G5129]] place; [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] thou [[G5119]] begin [[G756]] with [[G3326]] shame [[G152]] to take [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] lowest [[G2078]] room. [[G5117]]

### 10
But [[G235]] when [[G3752]] thou art bidden, [[G2564]] go [[G4198]] and sit down [[G377]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lowest [[G2078]] room; [[G5117]] that [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] he [[G3588]] that bade [[G2564]] thee [[G4571]] cometh, [[G2064]] he may say [[G2036]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Friend, [[G5384]] go up [[G4320]] higher: [[G511]] then [[G5119]] shalt [[G2071]] thou [[G4671]] have [[G2071]] worship [[G1391]] in the presence [[G1799]] of them that [[G3588]] sit at meat with [[G4873]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 11
For [[G3754]] whosoever [[G3956]] exalteth [[G5312]] himself [[G1438]] shall be abased; [[G5013]] and [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] humbleth [[G5013]] himself [[G1438]] shall be exalted. [[G5312]]

### 12
Then [[G1161]] said he [[G3004]] also [[G2532]] to him [[G846]] that [[G3588]] bade him, [[G2564]] When [[G3752]] thou makest [[G4160]] a dinner [[G712]] or [[G2228]] a supper, [[G1173]] call [[G5455]] not [[G3361]] thy [[G4675]] friends, [[G5384]] nor [[G3366]] thy [[G4675]] brethren, [[G80]] neither [[G3366]] thy [[G4675]] kinsmen, [[G4773]] nor [[G3366]] rich [[G4145]] neighbours; [[G1069]] lest [[G3379]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] bid again, [[G479]] thee [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] a recompence [[G468]] be made [[G1096]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 13
But [[G235]] when [[G3752]] thou makest [[G4160]] a feast, [[G1403]] call [[G2564]] the poor, [[G4434]] the maimed, [[G376]] the lame, [[G5560]] the blind: [[G5185]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] thou shalt be [[G2071]] blessed; [[G3107]] for [[G3754]] they cannot [[G2192]] recompense [[G467]] thee: [[G4671]] for [[G1063]] thou [[G4671]] shalt be recompensed [[G467]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1342]] just. [[G1342]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] when one [[G5100]] of them that [[G3588]] sat at meat with him [[G4873]] heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Blessed [[G3107]] he that [[G3739]] shall eat [[G5315]] bread [[G740]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 16
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] he [[G3588]] unto him, [[G846]] A certain [[G5100]] man [[G444]] made [[G4160]] a great [[G3173]] supper, [[G1173]] and [[G2532]] bade [[G2564]] many: [[G4183]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] his [[G846]] servant [[G1401]] at [[G1173]] supper [[G1173]] time [[G5610]] to say [[G2036]] to them that [[G3588]] were bidden, [[G2564]] Come; [[G2064]] for [[G3754]] all things [[G3956]] are [[G2076]] now [[G2235]] ready. [[G2092]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] they all [[G3956]] with [[G575]] one [[G1520]] began [[G756]] to make excuse. [[G3868]] The [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] I have bought [[G59]] a piece of ground, [[G68]] and [[G2532]] must [[G2192]] I [[G1831]] needs [[G318]] go [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] see [[G1492]] it: [[G846]] I pray [[G2065]] thee [[G4571]] have [[G2192]] me [[G3165]] excused. [[G3868]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] another [[G2087]] said, [[G2036]] I have bought [[G59]] five [[G4002]] yoke [[G2201]] of oxen, [[G1016]] and [[G2532]] I go [[G4198]] to prove [[G1381]] them: [[G846]] I pray [[G2065]] thee [[G4571]] have [[G2192]] me [[G3165]] excused. [[G3868]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] another [[G2087]] said, [[G2036]] I have married [[G1060]] a wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] therefore [[G1223]] I cannot [[G1410]] come. [[G2064]]

### 21
So that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] came, [[G3854]] and shewed [[G518]] his [[G846]] lord [[G2962]] these things. [[G5023]] Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] master of the house [[G3617]] being angry [[G3710]] said [[G2036]] to his [[G846]] servant, [[G1401]] Go out [[G1831]] quickly [[G5030]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] streets [[G4113]] and [[G2532]] lanes [[G4505]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4172]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] bring in [[G1521]] hither [[G5602]] the [[G3588]] poor, [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] the maimed, [[G376]] and [[G2532]] the halt, [[G5560]] and [[G2532]] the blind. [[G5185]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] it is done [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] thou hast commanded, [[G2004]] and [[G2532]] yet [[G2089]] there is [[G2076]] room. [[G5117]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] servant, [[G1401]] Go out [[G1831]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] highways [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] hedges, [[G5418]] and [[G2532]] compel [[G315]] to come in, [[G1525]] that [[G2443]] my [[G3450]] house [[G3624]] may be filled. [[G1072]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] That [[G3754]] none [[G3762]] of those [[G1565]] men [[G435]] which [[G3588]] were bidden [[G2564]] shall taste [[G1089]] of my [[G3450]] supper. [[G1173]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] there went with [[G4848]] great [[G4183]] multitudes [[G3793]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he turned, [[G4762]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]]

### 26
If [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] hate [[G3404]] not [[G3756]] his [[G1438]] father, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] sisters, [[G79]] yea, [[G2089]] and [[G1161]] his [[G3588]] own [[G1438]] life [[G5590]] also, [[G2532]] he cannot [[G1410]] be [[G1511]] my [[G3450]] disciple. [[G3101]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3748]] not [[G3756]] doth [[G941]] bear [[G941]] his [[G846]] cross, [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] come [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] me, [[G3450]] cannot [[G1410]] be [[G1511]] my [[G3450]] disciple. [[G3101]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you, [[G5216]] intending [[G2309]] to build [[G3618]] a tower, [[G4444]] sitteth down [[G2523]] not [[G3780]] first, [[G4412]] and counteth [[G5585]] the [[G3588]] cost, [[G1160]] whether [[G1487]] he have [[G2192]] to [[G4314]] finish [[G535]]

### 29
Lest [[G3379]] haply, [[G2443]] after he [[G846]] hath laid [[G5087]] the foundation, [[G2310]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] is [[G2480]] able [[G2480]] to finish [[G1615]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] behold [[G2334]] begin [[G756]] to mock [[G1702]] him, [[G846]]

### 30
Saying, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] began [[G756]] to build, [[G3618]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] was [[G2480]] able [[G2480]] to finish. [[G1615]]

### 31
Or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] king, [[G935]] going [[G4198]] to make [[G4820]] war [[G4171]] against [[G1519]] another [[G2087]] king, [[G935]] sitteth down [[G2523]] not [[G3780]] first, [[G4412]] and consulteth [[G1011]] whether [[G1487]] he be [[G2076]] able [[G1415]] with [[G1722]] ten [[G1176]] thousand [[G5505]] to meet him [[G528]] that [[G3588]] cometh [[G2064]] against [[G1909]] him [[G846]] with [[G3326]] twenty [[G1501]] thousand? [[G5505]]

### 32
Or [[G1161]] else, [[G1487]] while the other [[G846]] is [[G5607]] yet [[G2089]] a great way off, [[G4206]] he sendeth [[G649]] an ambassage, [[G4242]] and desireth conditions [[G2065]] of [[G4314]] peace. [[G1515]]

### 33
So [[G3767]] likewise, [[G3779]] whosoever he [[G3956]] be of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] that [[G3739]] forsaketh [[G657]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] that he hath, [[G5224]] he cannot [[G1410]] be [[G1511]] my [[G3450]] disciple. [[G3101]]

### 34
Salt [[G217]] good: [[G2570]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] salt [[G217]] have lost his savour, [[G3471]] wherewith [[G1722]] shall it be [[G741]] seasoned? [[G741]]

### 35
It is [[G2076]] neither [[G3777]] fit [[G2111]] for [[G1519]] the land, [[G1093]] nor yet [[G3777]] for [[G1519]] the dunghill; [[G2874]] men cast [[G906]] it [[G846]] out. [[G1854]] He that [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]]
