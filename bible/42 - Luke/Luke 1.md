### 1
Forasmuch [[G1895]] as many [[G4183]] have taken in hand [[G2021]] to set forth in order [[G392]] a declaration [[G1335]] of [[G4012]] those things [[G4229]] which are most surely believed [[G4135]] among [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]]

### 2
Even as [[G2531]] they delivered them [[G3860]] unto us, [[G2254]] which [[G3588]] from [[G575]] the beginning [[G746]] were [[G1096]] eyewitnesses, [[G845]] and [[G2532]] ministers [[G5257]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3056]] word; [[G3056]]

### 3
It seemed good [[G1380]] to me also, [[G2504]] having had [[G3877]] perfect [[G199]] understanding [[G3877]] of all things [[G3956]] from the very first, [[G509]] to write [[G1125]] unto thee [[G4671]] in order, [[G2517]] most excellent [[G2903]] Theophilus, [[G2321]]

### 4
That [[G2443]] thou mightest know [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] certainty [[G803]] of [[G4012]] those things, [[G3056]] wherein [[G3739]] thou hast been instructed. [[G2727]]

### 5
There was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of Herod, [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] of Judaea, [[G2449]] a certain [[G5100]] priest [[G2409]] named [[G3686]] Zacharias, [[G2197]] of [[G1537]] the course [[G2183]] of Abia: [[G7]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] daughters [[G2364]] of Aaron, [[G2]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] name [[G3686]] Elisabeth. [[G1665]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] they were [[G2258]] both [[G297]] righteous [[G1342]] before [[G1799]] God, [[G2316]] walking [[G4198]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] commandments [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] ordinances [[G1345]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] blameless. [[G273]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] had [[G2258]] no [[G3756]] child, [[G5043]] because that [[G2530]] Elisabeth [[G1665]] was [[G2258]] barren, [[G4723]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] both [[G297]] were [[G2258]] well stricken [[G4260]] in [[G1722]] years. [[G2250]]

### 8
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that while [[G1722]] he [[G846]] the [[G3588]] executed priest's [[G2407]] office [[G2407]] before [[G1725]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of his [[G846]] course, [[G2183]]

### 9
According to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] custom [[G1485]] the [[G3588]] of priest's [[G2405]] office, [[G2405]] his lot was [[G2975]] to burn incense [[G2370]] when he went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] multitude [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] were [[G2258]] praying [[G4336]] without [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] at [[G5610]] time [[G5610]] of incense. [[G2368]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] there appeared [[G3700]] unto him [[G846]] an angel [[G32]] of the Lord [[G2962]] standing [[G2476]] on [[G1537]] the right side [[G1188]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2379]] altar [[G2379]] of incense. [[G2368]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] Zacharias [[G2197]] when [[G1492]] saw [[G1492]] he was troubled, [[G5015]] and [[G2532]] fear [[G5401]] fell [[G1968]] upon [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Fear [[G5399]] not, [[G3361]] Zacharias: [[G2197]] for [[G1360]] thy [[G4675]] prayer [[G1162]] is heard; [[G1522]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] wife [[G1135]] Elisabeth [[G1665]] shall bear [[G1080]] thee [[G4671]] a son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt call [[G2564]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] John. [[G2491]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] thou [[G4671]] shalt have [[G2071]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] gladness; [[G20]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] shall rejoice [[G5463]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] birth. [[G1083]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] he shall be [[G2071]] great [[G3173]] in the sight of [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] shall drink [[G4095]] neither [[G3756]] wine [[G3631]] nor [[G2532]] strong drink; [[G4608]] and [[G2532]] he shall be filled [[G4130]] with [[G4151]] the Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] even [[G2089]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] mother's [[G3384]] womb. [[G2836]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5207]] children [[G5207]] of Israel [[G2474]] shall he turn [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] the Lord [[G2962]] their [[G846]] God. [[G2316]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] shall go [[G4281]] before [[G1799]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1411]] of Elias, [[G2243]] to turn [[G1994]] the hearts [[G2588]] of the fathers [[G3962]] to [[G1909]] the children, [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] the disobedient [[G545]] to [[G1722]] the wisdom [[G5428]] of the just; [[G1342]] to make ready [[G2090]] a people [[G2992]] prepared [[G2680]] for the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] Zacharias [[G2197]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] angel, [[G32]] Whereby [[G2596]] shall I know [[G1097]] this? [[G5124]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] an old man, [[G4246]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] wife [[G1135]] well stricken [[G4260]] in [[G1722]] years. [[G2250]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Gabriel, [[G1043]] that [[G3588]] stand [[G3936]] in the presence [[G1799]] of [[G2316]] God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] am sent [[G649]] to speak [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] to shew glad [[G2097]] thee [[G4671]] these [[G5023]] tidings. [[G2097]]

### 20
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] thou shalt be [[G2071]] dumb, [[G4623]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] able [[G1410]] to speak, [[G2980]] until [[G891]] the day [[G2250]] that [[G3739]] these things [[G5023]] shall be performed, [[G1096]] because [[G473]] thou believest [[G4100]] not [[G3756]] my [[G3450]] words, [[G3056]] which [[G3748]] shall be fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1519]] their [[G846]] season. [[G2540]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] waited [[G4328]] for [[G2258]] Zacharias, [[G2197]] and [[G2532]] marvelled [[G2296]] that [[G1722]] he [[G846]] tarried so long [[G5549]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G3485]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] when he came out, [[G1831]] he could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] speak [[G2980]] unto them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they perceived [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] he had seen [[G3708]] a vision [[G3701]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple: [[G3485]] for [[G2532]] he [[G846]] beckoned [[G1269]] unto [[G846]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] remained [[G1265]] speechless. [[G2974]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that, as soon as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of his [[G846]] ministration [[G3009]] were accomplished, [[G4130]] he departed [[G565]] to [[G1519]] his own [[G846]] house. [[G3624]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] those [[G3778]] days [[G2250]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] Elisabeth [[G1665]] conceived, [[G4815]] and [[G2532]] hid [[G4032]] herself [[G1438]] five [[G4002]] months, [[G3376]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 25
Thus [[G3779]] hath [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] dealt [[G4160]] with me [[G3427]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] wherein [[G3739]] he looked on [[G1896]] to take away [[G851]] my [[G3450]] reproach [[G3681]] among [[G1722]] men. [[G444]]

### 26
And [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] month [[G3376]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] Gabriel [[G1043]] was sent [[G649]] from [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] unto [[G1519]] a city [[G4172]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] named [[G3686]] Nazareth, [[G3478]]

### 27
To [[G4314]] a virgin [[G3933]] espoused [[G3423]] to a man [[G435]] whose [[G3739]] name was [[G3686]] Joseph, [[G2501]] of [[G1537]] the house [[G3624]] of David; [[G1138]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] virgin's [[G3933]] name [[G3686]] Mary. [[G3137]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] came in [[G1525]] unto [[G4314]] her, [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] Hail, [[G5463]] highly favoured, [[G5487]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] thee: [[G4675]] blessed [[G2127]] thou [[G4771]] among [[G1722]] women. [[G1135]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] she [[G3588]] when [[G1492]] saw [[G1492]] she was troubled [[G1298]] at [[G1909]] his [[G846]] saying, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] cast in her mind [[G1260]] what manner of [[G4217]] salutation [[G783]] this [[G3778]] should be. [[G1498]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Fear [[G5399]] not, [[G3361]] Mary: [[G3137]] for [[G1063]] thou hast found [[G2147]] favour [[G5485]] with [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]]

### 31
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] thou shalt conceive [[G4815]] in [[G1722]] thy womb, [[G1064]] and [[G2532]] bring forth [[G5088]] a son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] shalt call [[G2564]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] JESUS. [[G2424]]

### 32
He [[G3778]] shall be [[G2071]] great, [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] shall be called [[G2564]] the Son [[G5207]] of the Highest: [[G5310]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] shall give [[G1325]] unto him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of [[G3962]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] David: [[G1138]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] he shall reign [[G936]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Jacob [[G2384]] for [[G1519]] ever; [[G165]] and [[G2532]] of [[G932]] his [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] there shall be [[G2071]] no [[G3756]] end. [[G5056]]

### 34
Then [[G1161]] said [[G2036]] Mary [[G3137]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] angel, [[G32]] How [[G4459]] shall [[G2071]] this [[G5124]] be, [[G2071]] seeing [[G1893]] I know [[G1097]] not [[G3756]] a man? [[G435]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] The Holy [[G40]] Ghost [[G4151]] shall come [[G1904]] upon [[G1909]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] the power [[G1411]] of the Highest [[G5310]] shall overshadow [[G1982]] thee: [[G4671]] therefore [[G1352]] also [[G2532]] that holy thing [[G40]] which [[G3588]] shall be born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] thee [[G4771]] shall be called [[G2564]] the Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 36
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] thy [[G4675]] cousin [[G4773]] Elisabeth, [[G1665]] she [[G846]] also [[G2532]] hath [[G4815]] conceived [[G4815]] a son [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] old age: [[G1094]] and [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] the sixth [[G1623]] month [[G3376]] with her, [[G846]] who was called [[G2564]] barren. [[G4723]]

### 37
For [[G3754]] with [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] nothing [[G3756]] shall be [[G101]] impossible. [[G101]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] said, [[G2036]] Behold [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] handmaid [[G1399]] of the Lord; [[G2962]] be it [[G1096]] unto me [[G3427]] according to [[G2596]] thy [[G4675]] word. [[G4487]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] departed [[G565]] from [[G575]] her. [[G846]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] arose [[G450]] in [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days, [[G2250]] and went [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] hill country [[G3714]] with [[G3326]] haste, [[G4710]] into [[G1519]] a city [[G4172]] of Juda; [[G2448]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of Zacharias, [[G2197]] and [[G2532]] saluted [[G782]] Elisabeth. [[G1665]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that, when [[G5613]] Elisabeth [[G1665]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] salutation [[G783]] of Mary, [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] babe [[G1025]] leaped [[G4640]] in [[G1722]] her [[G846]] womb; [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] Elisabeth [[G1665]] was filled [[G4130]] with the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost: [[G4151]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] she spake out [[G400]] with a [[G5456]] loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] Blessed [[G2127]] thou [[G4771]] among [[G1722]] women, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] blessed [[G2127]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] of [[G2836]] thy [[G4675]] womb. [[G2836]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] whence [[G4159]] this [[G5124]] to me, [[G3427]] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of [[G2962]] my [[G3450]] Lord [[G2962]] should come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me? [[G3165]]

### 44
For, [[G1063]] lo, [[G2400]] as soon as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] of [[G783]] thy [[G4675]] salutation [[G783]] sounded [[G1096]] in [[G1519]] mine [[G3450]] ears, [[G3775]] the [[G3588]] babe [[G1025]] leaped [[G4640]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] womb [[G2836]] for [[G1722]] joy. [[G20]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] blessed [[G3107]] she that believed: [[G4100]] for [[G3754]] there shall be [[G2071]] a performance [[G5050]] of those things which were told [[G2980]] her [[G846]] from [[G3844]] the Lord. [[G2962]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] said, [[G2036]] My [[G3450]] soul [[G5590]] doth magnify [[G3170]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] spirit [[G4151]] hath rejoiced [[G21]] in [[G1909]] God [[G2316]] my [[G3450]] Saviour. [[G4990]]

### 48
For [[G3754]] he hath regarded [[G1914]] the [[G3588]] low estate [[G5014]] of [[G1399]] his [[G846]] handmaiden: [[G1399]] for, [[G1063]] behold, [[G2400]] from [[G575]] henceforth [[G3568]] all [[G3956]] generations [[G1074]] shall call blessed. [[G3106]] me [[G3165]]

### 49
For [[G3754]] he that is mighty [[G1415]] hath done [[G4160]] to me [[G3427]] great things; [[G3167]] and [[G2532]] holy [[G40]] his [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

### 50
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mercy [[G1656]] on them that fear [[G5399]] him [[G846]] from [[G1519]] generation [[G1074]] to generation. [[G1074]]

### 51
He hath shewed [[G4160]] strength [[G2904]] with [[G1722]] his [[G846]] arm; [[G1023]] he hath scattered [[G1287]] the proud [[G5244]] in the imagination [[G1271]] of [[G2588]] their [[G846]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 52
He hath put down [[G2507]] the mighty [[G1413]] from [[G575]] seats, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] exalted [[G5312]] them of low degree. [[G5011]]

### 53
He hath filled [[G1705]] the hungry [[G3983]] with good things; [[G18]] and [[G2532]] the rich [[G4147]] he hath sent away. [[G1821]] empty [[G2756]]

### 54
He hath holpen [[G482]] his [[G846]] servant [[G3816]] Israel, [[G2474]] in remembrance [[G3415]] of mercy; [[G1656]]

### 55
As [[G2531]] he spake [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]] to Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] to [[G4690]] his [[G846]] seed [[G4690]] for [[G1519]] ever. [[G165]]

### 56
And [[G1161]] Mary [[G3137]] abode [[G3306]] with [[G4862]] her [[G846]] about [[G5616]] three [[G5140]] months, [[G3376]] and [[G2532]] returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] her own [[G846]] house. [[G3624]]

### 57
Now [[G1161]] Elisabeth's [[G1665]] full came [[G4130]] time [[G5550]] that she [[G846]] should be delivered; [[G5088]] and [[G2532]] she brought forth [[G1080]] a son. [[G5207]]

### 58
And [[G2532]] her her [[G846]] neighbours [[G4040]] and [[G2532]] cousins [[G4773]] heard [[G191]] how [[G3754]] the Lord [[G2962]] had shewed great [[G3170]] mercy [[G1656]] upon [[G3326]] her; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they rejoiced [[G4796]] with [[G846]] her. [[G846]]

### 59
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, that [[G1096]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] eighth [[G3590]] day [[G2250]] they came [[G2064]] to circumcise [[G4059]] the [[G3588]] child; [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] they called [[G2564]] him [[G846]] Zacharias, [[G2197]] after [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G3962]] his [[G846]] father. [[G3962]]

### 60
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Not [[G3780]] but [[G235]] he shall be called [[G2564]] John. [[G2491]]

### 61
And [[G2532]] they said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] her, [[G846]] There is [[G2076]] none [[G3762]] of [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] kindred [[G4772]] that [[G3739]] is called [[G2564]] by [[G3686]] this [[G5129]] name. [[G3686]]

### 62
And [[G1161]] they made signs [[G1770]] to [[G3962]] his [[G846]] father, [[G3962]] how [[G5101]] he would have [[G2309]] him [[G846]] called. [[G2564]]

### 63
And [[G2532]] he asked for [[G154]] a writing table, [[G4093]] and wrote, [[G1125]] saying, [[G3004]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] is [[G2076]] John. [[G2491]] And [[G2532]] they marvelled [[G2296]] all. [[G3956]]

### 64
And [[G1161]] his [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] was opened [[G455]] immediately, [[G3916]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] tongue [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] he spake, [[G2980]] and praised [[G2127]] God. [[G2316]]

### 65
And [[G2532]] fear [[G5401]] came [[G1096]] on [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] that dwelt round about [[G4039]] them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] these [[G5023]] sayings [[G4487]] were noised abroad [[G1255]] throughout [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] hill country [[G3714]] of Judaea. [[G2449]]

### 66
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] they [[G3588]] that heard [[G191]] laid up [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] manner of [[G686]] child [[G3813]] this [[G5124]] shall [[G2071]] be! [[G2071]] And [[G2532]] the hand [[G5495]] of the Lord [[G2962]] was [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 67
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Zacharias [[G2197]] was filled [[G4130]] with the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Ghost, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] prophesied, [[G4395]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 68
Blessed [[G2128]] the Lord [[G2962]] God [[G2316]] of Israel; [[G2474]] for [[G3754]] he hath visited [[G1980]] and [[G2532]] redeemed [[G4160]] his [[G846]] people, [[G2992]]

### 69
And [[G2532]] hath raised up [[G1453]] an horn [[G2768]] of salvation [[G4991]] for us [[G2254]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of [[G3816]] his [[G846]] servant [[G3816]] David; [[G1138]]

### 70
As [[G2531]] he spake [[G2980]] by [[G1223]] the mouth [[G4750]] of [[G4396]] his [[G846]] holy [[G40]] prophets, [[G4396]] which [[G3588]] have been since [[G575]] the world began: [[G165]]

### 71
That we should be saved [[G4991]] from [[G1537]] our [[G2257]] enemies, [[G2190]] and [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] the hand [[G5495]] of all [[G3956]] that hate [[G3404]] us; [[G2248]]

### 72
To perform [[G4160]] the mercy [[G1656]] to [[G3326]] our [[G2257]] fathers, [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] to remember [[G3415]] his [[G846]] holy [[G40]] covenant; [[G1242]]

### 73
The oath [[G3727]] which [[G3739]] he sware [[G3660]] to [[G4314]] our [[G2257]] father [[G3962]] Abraham, [[G11]]

### 74
That he would grant [[G1325]] unto us, [[G2254]] that we being delivered [[G4506]] out of [[G1537]] the hand [[G5495]] of [[G2190]] our [[G2257]] enemies [[G2190]] might serve [[G3000]] him [[G846]] without fear, [[G870]]

### 75
In [[G1722]] holiness [[G3742]] and [[G2532]] righteousness [[G1343]] before [[G1799]] him, [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of [[G2222]] our [[G2257]] life. [[G2222]]

### 76
And [[G2532]] thou, [[G4771]] child, [[G3813]] shalt be called [[G2564]] the prophet [[G4396]] of the Highest: [[G5310]] for [[G1063]] thou shalt go [[G4313]] before [[G4253]] the face [[G4383]] of the Lord [[G2962]] to prepare [[G2090]] his [[G846]] ways; [[G3598]]

### 77
To give [[G1325]] knowledge [[G1108]] of salvation [[G4991]] unto [[G2992]] his [[G846]] people [[G2992]] by [[G1722]] the remission [[G859]] of [[G266]] their [[G846]] sins, [[G266]]

### 78
Through [[G1223]] tender [[G4698]] the [[G1656]] mercy [[G1656]] of [[G2316]] our [[G2257]] God; [[G2316]] whereby [[G1722]] the dayspring [[G395]] from [[G1537]] on high [[G5311]] hath visited [[G1980]] us, [[G2248]]

### 79
To give light [[G2014]] to them [[G3588]] that sit [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] darkness [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] the shadow [[G4639]] of death, [[G2288]] to guide [[G2720]] our [[G2257]] feet [[G4228]] into [[G1519]] the way [[G3598]] of peace. [[G1515]]

### 80
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] child [[G3813]] grew, [[G837]] and [[G2532]] waxed strong [[G2901]] in spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] deserts [[G2048]] till [[G2193]] the day [[G2250]] of [[G323]] his [[G846]] shewing [[G323]] unto [[G4314]] Israel. [[G2474]]
