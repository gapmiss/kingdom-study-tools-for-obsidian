### 1
And [[G1161]] he spake [[G3004]] a [[G2532]] parable [[G3850]] unto them [[G846]] that [[G3588]] men ought [[G1163]] always [[G3842]] to pray, [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] to faint; [[G1573]]

### 2
Saying, [[G3004]] There was [[G2258]] in [[G1722]] a [[G5100]] city [[G4172]] a [[G5100]] judge, [[G2923]] which feared [[G5399]] not [[G3361]] God, [[G2316]] neither [[G3361]] regarded [[G1788]] man: [[G444]]

### 3
And [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] a widow [[G5503]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] city; [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] she came [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Avenge [[G1556]] me [[G3165]] of [[G575]] mine [[G3450]] adversary. [[G476]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] he would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] for [[G1909]] a while: [[G5550]] but [[G1161]] afterward [[G3326]] he said [[G2036]] within [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] Though [[G1487]] I fear [[G5399]] not [[G3756]] God, [[G2316]] nor [[G3756]] regard [[G1788]] man; [[G444]]

### 5
Yet [[G1065]] because [[G1223]] this [[G3778]] widow [[G5503]] troubleth [[G3930]] me, [[G3427]] I will avenge [[G1556]] her, [[G846]] lest [[G3361]] by [[G1519]] continual [[G5056]] her [[G2064]] coming [[G2064]] she weary [[G5299]] me. [[G3165]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said, [[G2036]] Hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] unjust [[G93]] judge [[G2923]] saith. [[G3004]]

### 7
And [[G1161]]  shall [[G4160]] not [[G3361]] God [[G2316]] avenge [[G1557]] his own [[G846]] elect, [[G1588]] which [[G3588]] cry [[G994]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] though [[G2532]] he bear long [[G3114]] with [[G1909]] them? [[G846]]

### 8
I tell [[G3004]] you [[G5213]] that [[G3754]]  he will [[G4160]] avenge [[G1557]] them [[G846]] speedily. [[G5034]] when [[G4133]] Nevertheless [[G4133]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] cometh, [[G2064]] shall [[G687]] he find [[G2147]] faith [[G4102]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth? [[G1093]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] he spake [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] unto [[G4314]] certain [[G5100]] which [[G3588]] trusted [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] themselves [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] they were [[G1526]] righteous, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] despised [[G1848]] others: [[G3062]]

### 10
Two [[G1417]] men [[G444]] went up [[G305]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] to pray; [[G4336]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] a Pharisee, [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] a publican. [[G5057]]

### 11
The [[G3588]] Pharisee [[G5330]] stood [[G2476]] and prayed [[G4336]] thus [[G5023]] with [[G4314]] himself, [[G1438]] God, [[G2316]] I thank [[G2168]] thee, [[G4671]] that [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5618]] other [[G3062]] men [[G444]] extortioners, [[G727]] unjust, [[G94]] adulterers, [[G3432]] or [[G2228]] even [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] this [[G3778]] publican. [[G5057]]

### 12
I fast [[G3522]] twice [[G1364]] in the [[G3588]] week, [[G4521]] I give tithes [[G586]] of all [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] I possess. [[G2932]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] publican, [[G5057]] standing [[G2476]] afar off, [[G3113]] would [[G2309]] not [[G3756]] lift up [[G1869]] so much as [[G3761]] eyes [[G3788]] unto [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] but [[G235]] smote [[G5180]] upon [[G1519]] his [[G846]] breast, [[G4738]] saying, [[G3004]] God [[G2316]] be merciful [[G2433]] to me [[G3427]] a [[G3588]] sinner. [[G268]]

### 14
I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G5213]] this man [[G3778]] went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] his [[G846]] house [[G3624]] justified [[G1344]] than [[G2228]] the other: [[G1565]] for [[G3754]] every one [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] exalteth [[G5312]] himself [[G1438]] shall be abased; [[G5013]] and [[G1161]] he that [[G3588]] humbleth [[G5013]] himself [[G1438]] shall be exalted. [[G5312]]

### 15
And they brought [[G4374]] unto him [[G846]] also [[G2532]] infants, [[G1025]] that [[G2443]] he would touch [[G680]] them: [[G846]] but when [[G1161]] disciples [[G3101]] saw [[G1492]] they rebuked [[G2008]] them. [[G846]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] called [[G4341]] them [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] Suffer [[G863]] little children [[G3813]] to come [[G2064]] unto [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] forbid [[G2967]] them [[G846]] not: [[G3361]] for [[G1063]] of such [[G5108]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 17
Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Whosoever [[G3739]] shall [[G1209]] not [[G3361]] receive [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] as [[G5613]] a little child [[G3813]] in no [[G3756]] shall [[G1525]] wise [[G3361]] enter [[G1525]] therein. [[G1519]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] a certain [[G5100]] ruler [[G758]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Good [[G18]] Master, [[G1320]] what [[G5101]] shall I do [[G4160]] to inherit [[G2816]] eternal [[G166]] life? [[G2222]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] callest thou [[G3004]] me [[G3165]] good? [[G18]] none [[G3762]] good, [[G18]] save [[G1487]] one, [[G1520]] God. [[G2316]]

### 20
Thou knowest [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] commandments, [[G1785]] not [[G3361]] Do commit [[G3431]] adultery, [[G3431]] not [[G3361]] Do [[G5407]] kill, [[G5407]] not [[G3361]] Do [[G2813]] steal, [[G2813]] not [[G3361]] Do bear false [[G5576]] witness, [[G5576]] Honour [[G5091]] thy [[G4675]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] mother. [[G3384]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] All [[G3956]] these [[G5023]] have I kept [[G5442]] from [[G1537]] my [[G3450]] youth up. [[G3503]]

### 22
Now when [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [[G191]] these things, [[G5023]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Yet [[G2089]] lackest [[G3007]] thou [[G4671]] one thing: [[G1520]] sell [[G4453]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3745]] thou hast, [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] distribute [[G1239]] unto the poor, [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] thou shalt have [[G2192]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] come, [[G1204]] follow [[G190]] me. [[G3427]]

### 23
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] when [[G191]] heard [[G191]] this, [[G5023]] he was [[G1096]] very sorrowful: [[G4036]] for [[G1063]] he was [[G2258]] very [[G4970]] rich. [[G4145]]

### 24
And when [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw that [[G1492]] he [[G846]] was [[G1096]] very sorrowful, [[G4036]] he said, [[G2036]] How [[G4459]] hardly [[G1423]] they that [[G3588]] shall [[G1525]] have [[G2192]] riches [[G5536]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God! [[G2316]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] it is [[G2076]] easier for [[G2123]] a camel [[G2574]] to go [[G1525]] through [[G1223]] a needle's [[G4476]] eye, [[G5168]] than for [[G2228]] a rich man [[G4145]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 26
And [[G1161]] they that [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] said, [[G2036]] Who [[G5101]] then [[G2532]] can [[G1410]] be saved? [[G4982]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] The things which [[G3588]] impossible [[G102]] are [[G2076]] with [[G3844]] men [[G444]] are [[G2076]] possible [[G1415]] with [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]]

### 28
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G2036]] Lo, [[G2400]] we [[G2249]] have left [[G863]] all, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Verily [[G281]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] There is [[G2076]] no man [[G3762]] that [[G3739]] hath left [[G863]] house, [[G3614]] or [[G2228]] parents, [[G1118]] or [[G2228]] brethren, [[G80]] or [[G2228]] wife, [[G1135]] or [[G2228]] children, [[G5043]] for [[G1752]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God's [[G2316]] sake, [[G1752]]

### 30
Who [[G3739]] shall [[G618]] not [[G3361]] receive [[G618]] manifold more [[G4179]] in [[G1722]] this [[G5129]] present time, [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world [[G165]] to come [[G2064]] life [[G2222]] everlasting. [[G166]]

### 31
Then [[G1161]] he took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] twelve, [[G1427]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Behold, [[G2400]] we go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] all things [[G3956]]  that [[G3588]] are [[G1125]] written [[G1125]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] the [[G3588]] concerning [[G5207]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] shall be accomplished. [[G5055]]

### 32
For [[G1063]] he shall be delivered [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1484]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] shall be mocked, [[G1702]] and [[G2532]] spitefully entreated, [[G5195]] and [[G2532]] spitted on: [[G1716]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] they shall scourge [[G3146]] and put to [[G615]] him [[G846]] death: [[G615]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] he shall rise again. [[G450]]

### 34
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] understood [[G4920]] none [[G3762]] of these things: [[G5130]] and [[G2532]] this [[G5124]] saying [[G4487]] was [[G2258]] hid [[G2928]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] neither [[G2532]] they [[G1097]] knew [[G1097]] the things which [[G3588]] were spoken. [[G3004]]

### 35
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that as [[G1722]] he [[G846]] was come [[G1448]] nigh [[G1448]] unto [[G1519]] Jericho, [[G2410]] a certain [[G5100]] blind man [[G5185]] sat [[G2521]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] way side [[G3598]] begging: [[G4319]]

### 36
And [[G1161]] hearing [[G191]] the multitude [[G3793]] pass by, [[G1279]] he asked [[G4441]] what [[G5101]] it [[G5124]] meant. [[G1498]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] they told [[G518]] him, [[G846]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3480]] Nazareth [[G3480]] passeth by. [[G3928]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] he cried, [[G994]] saying, [[G3004]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy [[G1653]] on me. [[G3165]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] they which [[G3588]] went before [[G4254]] rebuked [[G2008]] him, [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he should hold his peace: [[G4623]] but [[G1161]] he [[G846]] cried [[G2896]] so much [[G4183]] the more, [[G3123]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy [[G1653]] on me. [[G3165]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood, [[G2476]] and commanded [[G2753]] him [[G846]] to be brought [[G71]] unto [[G4314]] him: [[G846]] and when [[G1161]] he [[G846]] was come near, [[G1448]] he asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]]

### 41
Saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] wilt thou [[G2309]] that I shall do [[G4160]] unto thee? [[G4671]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] that [[G2443]] I may receive my sight. [[G308]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Receive thy sight: [[G308]] thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] hath saved [[G4982]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] immediately [[G3916]] he received his sight, [[G308]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] him, [[G846]] glorifying [[G1392]] God: [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] when they saw [[G1492]] gave [[G1325]] praise [[G136]] unto [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]
