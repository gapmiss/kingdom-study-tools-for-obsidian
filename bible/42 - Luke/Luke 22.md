### 1
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] of unleavened [[G106]] bread [[G106]] drew nigh, [[G1448]] which [[G3588]] is called [[G3004]] the Passover. [[G3957]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] sought [[G2212]] how [[G4459]] they might kill [[G337]] him; [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 3
Then [[G1161]] entered [[G1525]] Satan [[G4567]] into [[G1519]] Judas [[G2455]] surnamed [[G1941]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] being [[G5607]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve. [[G1427]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] he went his way, [[G565]] and communed [[G4814]] the [[G3588]] with chief [[G749]] priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] captains, [[G4755]] how [[G4459]] he might betray [[G3860]] him [[G846]] unto them. [[G846]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] they were glad, [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] covenanted [[G4934]] to give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] money. [[G694]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] he promised, [[G1843]] and [[G2532]] sought [[G2212]] opportunity [[G2120]] to [[G3860]] betray [[G3860]] him [[G846]] unto them [[G846]] in the absence of [[G817]] the multitude. [[G3793]]

### 7
Then [[G1161]] came [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of unleavened [[G106]] bread, [[G106]] when [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] passover [[G3957]] must [[G1163]] be killed. [[G2380]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] he sent [[G649]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] saying, [[G2036]] Go [[G4198]] and prepare [[G2090]] us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] passover, [[G3957]] that [[G2443]] we may eat. [[G5315]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Where [[G4226]] wilt thou [[G2309]] that we prepare? [[G2090]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Behold, [[G2400]] when ye [[G5216]] are entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] there shall [[G4876]] a man [[G444]] meet [[G4876]] you, [[G5213]] bearing [[G941]] a pitcher [[G2765]] of water; [[G5204]] follow [[G190]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] where [[G3757]] he entereth in. [[G1531]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] ye shall say [[G2046]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3617]] goodman [[G3617]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3614]] house, [[G3614]] The [[G3588]] Master [[G1320]] saith [[G3004]] unto thee, [[G4671]] Where [[G4226]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] guestchamber, [[G2646]] where [[G3699]] I shall eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] passover [[G3957]] with [[G3326]] my [[G3450]] disciples? [[G3101]]

### 12
And he [[G2548]] shall shew [[G1166]] you [[G5213]] a large [[G3173]] upper room [[G508]] furnished: [[G4766]] there [[G1563]] make ready. [[G2090]]

### 13
And [[G1161]] they went, [[G565]] and found [[G2147]] as [[G2531]] he had said [[G2046]] unto them: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they made ready [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] passover. [[G3957]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] was come, [[G1096]] he sat down, [[G377]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] apostles [[G652]] with [[G4862]] him. [[G846]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] With desire [[G1939]] I have desired [[G1937]] to eat [[G5315]] this [[G5124]] passover [[G3957]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] before [[G4253]] I [[G3165]] suffer: [[G3958]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] I will [[G5315]] not [[G3361]] any more [[G3765]] eat [[G5315]] thereof, [[G1537]] until [[G2193]] it be fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] he took [[G1209]] the cup, [[G4221]] and gave thanks, [[G2168]] and said, [[G2036]] Take [[G2983]] this, [[G5124]] and [[G2532]] divide [[G1266]] among yourselves: [[G1438]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] I will [[G4095]] not [[G3361]] drink [[G4095]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G1081]] the [[G3588]] of [[G288]] vine, [[G288]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] shall come. [[G2064]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] he took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] and gave thanks, [[G2168]] and brake [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] unto them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G5124]] is [[G2076]] my [[G3450]] body [[G4983]] which [[G3588]] is given [[G1325]] for [[G5228]] you: [[G5216]] this [[G5124]] do [[G4160]] in [[G1519]] remembrance [[G364]] of [[G1699]] me. [[G1699]]

### 20
Likewise [[G5615]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] after [[G3326]] supper, [[G1172]] saying, [[G3004]] This [[G5124]] cup [[G4221]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] testament [[G1242]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] blood, [[G129]] which [[G3588]] is shed [[G1632]] for [[G5228]] you. [[G5216]]

### 21
But, [[G4133]] behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] of him that [[G3588]] betrayeth [[G3860]] me [[G3165]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] table. [[G5132]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] truly [[G3303]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] goeth, [[G4198]] as [[G2596]] it [[G3588]] was determined: [[G3724]] but [[G4133]] woe [[G3759]] unto that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] by [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] he is betrayed! [[G3860]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] began [[G756]] to inquire [[G4802]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G1438]] which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] it was [[G1498]] that should [[G3195]] do [[G4238]] this [[G3588]] thing. [[G5124]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] there was [[G1096]] also [[G2532]] a strife [[G5379]] among [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] which [[G5101]] of them [[G846]] should be [[G1511]] accounted [[G1380]] the greatest. [[G3187]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] The [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1484]] Gentiles [[G1484]] exercise lordship [[G2961]] over [[G846]] them; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they that [[G3588]] exercise authority upon [[G1850]] them [[G846]] are called [[G2564]] benefactors. [[G2110]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] not [[G3756]] so: [[G3779]] but [[G235]] he that [[G3588]] is greatest [[G3187]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G5213]] let him be [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] younger; [[G3501]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that is chief, [[G2233]] as [[G5613]] he that [[G3588]] doth serve. [[G1247]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] whether [[G5101]] greater, [[G3187]] he that [[G3588]] sitteth at meat, [[G345]] or [[G2228]] he that [[G3588]] serveth? [[G1247]] not [[G3780]] he that [[G3588]] sitteth at meat? [[G345]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] among [[G1722]] you [[G5216]] as [[G5613]] he that [[G3588]] serveth. [[G1247]]

### 28
Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] they which [[G3588]] have continued [[G1265]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] temptations. [[G3986]]

### 29
And I [[G2504]] appoint [[G1303]] unto you [[G5213]] a kingdom, [[G932]] as [[G2531]] my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] hath appointed [[G1303]] unto me; [[G3427]]

### 30
That [[G2443]] ye may eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] at [[G1909]] my [[G3450]] table [[G5132]] in [[G1722]] my [[G3450]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] sit [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] thrones [[G2362]] judging [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] tribes [[G5443]] of [[G2474]] Israel. [[G2474]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said, [[G2036]] Simon, [[G4613]] Simon, [[G4613]] behold, [[G2400]] Satan [[G4567]] hath desired [[G1809]] you, [[G5209]] that [[G3588]] he may sift [[G4617]] as [[G5613]] wheat: [[G4621]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] have prayed [[G1189]] for [[G4012]] thee, [[G4675]] that [[G2443]] thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] fail [[G1587]] not: [[G3361]] and [[G2532]] when [[G4218]] thou [[G4771]] art converted, [[G1994]] strengthen [[G4741]] thy [[G4675]] brethren. [[G80]]

### 33
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] I am [[G1510]] ready [[G2092]] to go [[G4198]] with [[G3326]] thee, [[G4675]] both [[G2532]] into [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] death. [[G2288]]

### 34
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] I tell [[G3004]] thee, [[G4671]] Peter, [[G4074]] the cock [[G220]] shall [[G5455]] not [[G3361]] crow [[G5455]] this day, [[G4594]] before that [[G4250]] thou shalt that [[G533]] thrice [[G5151]] deny [[G533]] thou [[G3361]] knowest [[G1492]] me. [[G3165]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] When [[G3753]] I sent [[G649]] you [[G5209]] without [[G817]] purse, [[G905]] and [[G2532]] scrip, [[G4082]] and [[G2532]] shoes, [[G5266]] lacked ye [[G5302]] any [[G3361]] thing? [[G5100]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Nothing. [[G3762]]

### 36
Then [[G3767]] said he [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] But [[G235]] now, [[G3568]] he that [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] a purse, [[G905]] let him take [[G142]] and [[G2532]] likewise [[G3668]] scrip: [[G4082]] and [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] hath [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] sword, [[G3162]] let him sell [[G4453]] his [[G846]] garment, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] buy one. [[G59]]

### 37
For [[G1063]] I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] this [[G5124]] that [[G3588]] is written [[G1125]] must [[G1163]] yet [[G2089]] be accomplished [[G5055]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1698]] And [[G2532]] he was reckoned [[G3049]] among [[G3326]] the transgressors: [[G459]] for [[G1063]] the things [[G3588]] concerning [[G4012]] me [[G1700]] have [[G2192]] an end. [[G5056]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Lord, [[G2962]] behold, [[G2400]] here [[G5602]] two [[G1417]] swords. [[G3162]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] It is [[G2076]] enough. [[G2425]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] he came out, [[G1831]] and went, [[G4198]] as [[G2596]] he [[G3588]] was wont, [[G1485]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mount [[G3735]] of [[G1636]] Olives; [[G1636]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] also [[G1161]] followed [[G190]] him. [[G846]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] when he was [[G1096]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] place, [[G5117]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Pray that [[G4336]] ye enter [[G1525]] not [[G3361]] into [[G1519]] temptation. [[G3986]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] was withdrawn [[G645]] from [[G575]] them [[G846]] about [[G5616]] a stone's [[G3037]] cast, [[G1000]] and [[G2532]] kneeled down, [[G5087]] and prayed, [[G4336]]

### 42
Saying, [[G3004]] Father, [[G3962]] if [[G1487]] thou be willing, [[G1014]] remove [[G3911]] this [[G5124]] cup [[G4221]] from [[G575]] me: [[G1700]] nevertheless [[G4133]] not [[G3361]] my [[G3450]] will, [[G2307]] but [[G235]] thine, [[G4674]] be done. [[G1096]]

### 43
And [[G1161]] there appeared [[G3700]] an angel [[G32]] unto him [[G846]] from [[G575]] heaven, [[G3772]] strengthening [[G1765]] him. [[G846]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] being [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] an agony [[G74]] he prayed [[G4336]] more earnestly: [[G1617]] and [[G1161]] his [[G846]] sweat [[G2402]] was [[G1096]] as it were [[G5616]] great drops [[G2361]] of blood [[G129]] falling down [[G2597]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] when he rose up [[G450]] from [[G575]] prayer, [[G4335]] and was come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] his [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] he found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] sleeping [[G2837]] for [[G575]] sorrow, [[G3077]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] sleep ye? [[G2518]] rise [[G450]] and pray, [[G4336]] lest ye [[G2443]] enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] temptation. [[G3986]]

### 47
And [[G1161]] while he [[G846]] yet [[G2089]] spake, [[G2980]] behold [[G2400]] a multitude, [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] was called [[G3004]] Judas, [[G2455]] one [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1427]] twelve, [[G1427]] went before [[G4281]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] drew near [[G1448]] unto [[G2424]] Jesus [[G2424]] to kiss [[G5368]] him. [[G846]]

### 48
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Judas, [[G2455]] betrayest thou [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] with a kiss? [[G5370]]

### 49
When [[G1161]] they which were [[G3588]] about [[G4012]] him [[G846]] saw [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] would follow, [[G2071]] they said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] shall we smite [[G3960]] with [[G1722]] the sword? [[G3162]]

### 50
And [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] smote [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] the [[G3588]] of high [[G749]] priest, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] cut off [[G851]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] ear. [[G3775]]

### 51
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] and said, [[G2036]] Suffer ye [[G1439]] thus [[G5127]] far. [[G2193]] And [[G2532]] he touched [[G680]] his [[G846]] ear, [[G5621]] and healed [[G2390]] him. [[G846]]

### 52
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] the chief priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] captains [[G4755]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2411]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] the elders, [[G4245]] which [[G3588]] were come [[G3854]] to [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] Be ye come out, [[G1831]] as [[G5613]] against [[G1909]] a thief, [[G3027]] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] staves? [[G3586]]

### 53
When I [[G3450]] was [[G5607]] daily [[G2596]] with [[G3326]] you [[G5216]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] ye stretched forth [[G1614]] no [[G3756]] hands [[G5495]] against [[G1909]] me: [[G1691]] but [[G235]] this [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] your [[G5216]] hour, [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1849]] of [[G4655]] darkness. [[G4655]]

### 54
Then [[G1161]] took they [[G4815]] him, [[G846]] and led [[G71]] and [[G2532]] brought [[G1521]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] high priest's [[G749]] house. [[G3624]] And [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] followed [[G190]] afar off. [[G3113]]

### 55
And [[G1161]] had [[G681]] when [[G1161]] they [[G846]] kindled [[G681]] a fire [[G4442]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] of [[G833]] hall, [[G833]] and [[G2532]] were set down together, [[G4776]] Peter sat [[G2521]] down [[G2521]] among [[G1722]] them. [[G846]]

### 56
But [[G1161]] a certain [[G5100]] maid [[G3814]] beheld [[G1492]] him [[G846]] as he sat [[G2521]] by [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] fire, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] earnestly looked [[G816]] upon him, [[G846]] and said, [[G2036]] This man [[G3778]] was [[G2258]] also [[G2532]] with [[G4862]] him. [[G846]]

### 57
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] denied [[G720]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Woman, [[G1135]] I know [[G1492]] him [[G846]] not. [[G3756]]

### 58
And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] a little while [[G1024]] another [[G2087]] saw [[G1492]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G5346]] Thou [[G4771]] art also [[G1488]] of [[G1537]] them. [[G846]] And [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G2036]] Man, [[G444]] I am [[G1510]] not. [[G3756]]

### 59
And [[G2532]] about [[G5616]] the space after [[G1339]] of one [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] another [[G243]] confidently affirmed, [[G1340]] saying, [[G3004]] Of [[G1909]] a truth [[G225]] this [[G3778]] also [[G2532]] was [[G2258]] with [[G3326]] him: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] he is [[G2076]] a Galilaean. [[G1057]]

### 60
And [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G2036]] Man, [[G444]] I know [[G1492]] not [[G3756]] what [[G3739]] thou sayest. [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] immediately, [[G3916]] while he [[G846]] yet [[G2089]] spake, [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] cock [[G220]] crew. [[G5455]]

### 61
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] turned, [[G4762]] and looked [[G1689]] upon [[G4074]] Peter. [[G4074]] And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] remembered [[G5279]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] how [[G5613]] he had said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Before [[G4250]] the cock [[G220]] crow, [[G5455]] thou shalt deny [[G533]] me [[G3165]] thrice. [[G5151]]

### 62
And [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] went [[G1831]] out, [[G1854]] and wept [[G2799]] bitterly. [[G4090]]

### 63
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] that [[G3588]] held [[G4912]] Jesus [[G2424]] mocked [[G1702]] him, [[G846]] and smote [[G1194]]

### 64
And [[G2532]] when they had blindfolded [[G4028]] him, [[G846]] they struck [[G5180]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] on [[G4383]] face, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Prophesy, [[G4395]] who [[G5101]] is it [[G2076]] that [[G3588]] smote [[G3817]] thee? [[G4571]]

### 65
And [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] other things [[G2087]] blasphemously [[G987]] spake they [[G3004]] against [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 66
And [[G2532]] as soon as [[G5613]] it was [[G1096]] day, [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4244]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2992]] people [[G2992]] and [[G5037]] the chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the scribes [[G1122]] came together, [[G4863]] and [[G2532]] led [[G321]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] their [[G1438]] council, [[G4892]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 67
Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] Christ? [[G5547]] tell [[G2036]] us. [[G2254]] And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] If I [[G1437]] tell [[G2036]] you, [[G5213]] ye will [[G4100]] not [[G3361]] believe: [[G4100]]

### 68
And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] also [[G2532]] I [[G2065]] ask [[G2065]] ye will [[G611]] not [[G3361]] answer [[G611]] me, [[G3427]] nor [[G2228]] let go. [[G630]]

### 69
Hereafter [[G575]] shall [[G2071]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] sit [[G2521]] on [[G1537]] the right hand [[G1188]] of [[G1411]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 70
Then [[G1161]] said they [[G2036]] all, [[G3956]] Art [[G1488]] thou [[G4771]] then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God? [[G2316]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G5346]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Ye [[G5210]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am. [[G1510]]

### 71
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] need [[G5532]] we [[G2192]] any further [[G2089]] witness? [[G3141]] for [[G1063]] we ourselves [[G846]] have heard [[G191]] of [[G575]] his own [[G846]] mouth. [[G4750]]
