### 1
And [[G2532]] it came to pass [[G1096]] afterward, [[G2517]] that [[G2532]] he [[G846]] went throughout [[G1353]] every [[G2596]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] village, [[G2968]] preaching [[G2784]] and [[G2532]] shewing the glad tidings [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom [[G932]] of God: [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] with [[G4862]] him, [[G846]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] women, [[G1135]] which [[G3739]] had been [[G2258]] healed [[G2323]] of [[G575]] evil [[G4190]] spirits [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] infirmities, [[G769]] Mary [[G3137]] called [[G2564]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] out of [[G575]] whom [[G3739]] went [[G1831]] seven [[G2033]] devils, [[G1140]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] Joanna [[G2489]] the wife [[G1135]] of Chuza [[G5529]] Herod's [[G2264]] steward, [[G2012]] and [[G2532]] Susanna, [[G4677]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] others, [[G2087]] which [[G3748]] ministered [[G1247]] unto him [[G846]] of [[G575]] their [[G846]] substance. [[G5224]]

### 4
And when [[G1161]] much [[G4183]] people [[G3793]] were gathered together, [[G4896]] and [[G2532]] were come [[G1975]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] out of every [[G2596]] city, [[G4172]] he spake [[G2036]] by [[G1223]] a parable: [[G3850]]

### 5
A [[G3588]] sower [[G4687]] went out [[G1831]] to sow [[G4687]] his [[G846]] seed: [[G4703]] and [[G2532]] as [[G1722]] he [[G846]] sowed, [[G4687]] some [[G3739]] fell [[G4098]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] way side; [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] it was trodden down, [[G2662]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fowls [[G4071]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3772]] air [[G3772]] devoured [[G2719]] it. [[G846]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] some [[G2087]] fell [[G4098]] upon [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] rock; [[G4073]] and [[G2532]] as soon as it was sprung up, [[G5453]] it withered away, [[G3583]] because [[G1223]] it [[G3588]] lacked [[G2192]] moisture. [[G2429]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] some [[G2087]] fell [[G4098]] among [[G1722]] thorns; [[G173]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] thorns [[G173]] sprang up with it, [[G4855]] and choked [[G638]] it. [[G846]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] other [[G2087]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] good [[G18]] ground, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] sprang up, [[G5453]] and bare [[G4160]] fruit [[G2590]] an hundredfold. [[G1542]] And when he had said [[G3004]] these things, [[G5023]] he cried, [[G5455]] He [[G3588]] that hath [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 9
And [[G1161]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] might [[G1498]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] be? [[G1498]]

### 10
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Unto you [[G5213]] it is given [[G1325]] to know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] mysteries [[G3466]] the [[G3588]] of [[G932]] kingdom [[G932]] of God: [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] to others [[G3062]] in [[G1722]] parables; [[G3850]] that [[G2443]] seeing [[G991]] not [[G3361]] they might [[G991]] see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] hearing [[G191]] not [[G3361]] they might [[G4920]] understand. [[G4920]]

### 11
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] is [[G2076]] this: [[G3778]] The [[G3588]] seed [[G4703]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 12
Those [[G3588]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] way side [[G3598]] are they [[G1526]] that [[G3588]] hear; [[G191]] then [[G1534]] cometh [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] taketh away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] out of [[G575]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] lest [[G3361]] they should believe [[G4100]] and be saved. [[G4982]]

### 13
They [[G3588]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] rock [[G4073]] which, [[G3739]] when [[G3752]] they hear, [[G191]] receive [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] with [[G3326]] joy; [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] these [[G3778]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] root, [[G4491]] which [[G3739]] for [[G4314]] a while [[G2540]] believe, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] time [[G2540]] of temptation [[G3986]] fall away. [[G868]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] that [[G3588]] which fell [[G4098]] among [[G1519]] thorns [[G173]] are [[G1526]] they, [[G3778]] which, [[G3588]] when they have heard, [[G191]] go forth, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] are choked [[G4846]] with [[G5259]] cares [[G3308]] and [[G2532]] riches [[G4149]] and [[G2532]] pleasures [[G2237]] of life, [[G979]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] bring fruit to [[G5052]] perfection. [[G5052]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] that [[G3588]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] ground [[G1093]] are [[G1526]] they, [[G3778]] which [[G3748]] in [[G1722]] an honest [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] good [[G18]] heart, [[G2588]] having heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] keep [[G2722]] and [[G2532]] bring forth fruit [[G2592]] with [[G1722]] patience. [[G5281]]

### 16
No man, [[G3762]] when he hath lighted [[G681]] a candle, [[G3088]] covereth [[G2572]] it [[G846]] with a vessel, [[G4632]] or [[G2228]] putteth [[G5087]] under [[G5270]] a bed; [[G2825]] but [[G235]] setteth [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] a candlestick, [[G3087]] that [[G2443]] they which enter in [[G1531]] may see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] light. [[G5457]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] nothing [[G3756]] is [[G2076]] secret, [[G2927]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G1096]] made [[G1096]] manifest; [[G5318]] neither [[G3761]] hid, [[G614]] that [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] shall be [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] come [[G2064]] abroad. [[G1519]]

### 18
Take heed [[G991]] therefore [[G3767]] how [[G4459]] ye hear: [[G191]] for [[G1063]] whosoever [[G3739]] hath, [[G2192]] to him [[G846]] shall be given; [[G1325]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3739]] hath [[G2192]] not, [[G3361]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] shall be taken [[G142]] even [[G2532]] that which [[G3739]] he seemeth [[G1380]] to have. [[G2192]]

### 19
Then [[G1161]] came [[G3854]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brethren, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3756]] come [[G4940]] at [[G846]] him [[G846]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] press. [[G3793]]

### 20
And [[G2532]] it was told [[G518]] him [[G846]] which said, [[G3004]] Thy [[G4675]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] thy [[G4675]] brethren [[G80]] stand [[G2476]] without, [[G1854]] desiring [[G2309]] to see [[G1492]] thee. [[G4571]]

### 21
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] answered [[G611]] and said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] My [[G3450]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] brethren [[G80]] are [[G1526]] these [[G3778]] which [[G3588]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] it. [[G846]]

### 22
Now [[G2532]] it came to pass [[G1096]] on [[G1722]] a certain [[G1520]] day, [[G2250]] that [[G2532]] he [[G846]] went [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] a ship [[G4143]] with [[G2532]] his [[G846]] disciples: [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Let us go over [[G1330]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3041]] lake. [[G3041]] And [[G2532]] they launched forth. [[G321]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] as they [[G846]] sailed [[G4126]] he fell asleep: [[G879]] and [[G2532]] there came down [[G2597]] a storm [[G2978]] of wind [[G417]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake; [[G3041]] and [[G2532]] they were filled [[G4845]] and [[G2532]] were in jeopardy. [[G2793]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] they came to him, [[G4334]] and awoke [[G1326]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Master, [[G1988]] master, [[G1988]] we perish. [[G622]] Then [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] arose, [[G1453]] and rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] raging [[G2830]] the [[G3588]] of [[G5204]] water: [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] they ceased, [[G3973]] and [[G2532]] there was [[G1096]] a calm. [[G1055]]

### 25
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Where [[G4226]] is [[G2076]] your [[G5216]] faith? [[G4102]] And [[G1161]] they being afraid [[G5399]] wondered, [[G2296]] saying [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] one [[G240]] another, [[G240]] What [[G5101]]  manner of man [[G686]] is [[G2076]] this! [[G3778]] for [[G3754]] he commandeth [[G2004]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] and [[G2532]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] they obey [[G5219]] him. [[G846]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] they arrived [[G2668]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] country [[G5561]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1046]] Gadarenes, [[G1046]] which [[G3748]] is [[G2076]] over against [[G495]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] when forth [[G1831]] he [[G846]] went [[G1831]] to [[G1909]] land, [[G1093]] there met [[G5221]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] a certain [[G5100]] man, [[G435]] which [[G3739]] had [[G2192]] devils [[G1140]] long [[G2425]] time, [[G5550]] and [[G2532]] ware [[G1737]] no [[G3756]] clothes, [[G2440]] neither [[G3756]] abode [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] house, [[G3614]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tombs. [[G3418]]

### 28
When [[G1161]] he saw [[G1492]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he cried out, [[G349]] and [[G2532]] down before [[G4363]] fell [[G4363]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] with a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] said, [[G2036]] What [[G5101]] have I [[G1698]] to do [[G2532]] with thee, [[G4671]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] most high? [[G5310]] I beseech [[G1189]] thee, [[G4675]] torment [[G928]] me [[G3165]] not. [[G3361]]

### 29
(For [[G1063]] he had commanded [[G3853]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] to come out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] man. [[G444]] For [[G1063]] oftentimes [[G5550]] it had caught [[G4884]] him: [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he was kept [[G5442]] bound [[G1196]] with chains [[G254]] and [[G2532]] in fetters; [[G3976]] and [[G2532]] he brake [[G1284]] the [[G3588]] bands, [[G1199]] and was driven [[G1643]] of [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1142]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness.) [[G2048]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked [[G1905]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] What [[G5101]] is [[G2076]] thy [[G4671]] name? [[G3686]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Legion: [[G3003]] because [[G3754]] many [[G4183]] devils [[G1140]] were entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] they besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] not [[G3361]] he would [[G2004]] command [[G2004]] them [[G846]] to go out [[G565]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] deep. [[G12]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] there [[G1563]] an herd [[G34]] of many [[G2425]] swine [[G5519]] feeding [[G1006]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mountain: [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] they besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] that [[G2443]] he would suffer [[G2010]] them [[G846]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] them. [[G1565]] And [[G2532]] he suffered [[G2010]] them. [[G846]]

### 33
Then [[G1161]] went [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] devils [[G1140]] out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] and entered [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] swine: [[G5519]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] herd [[G34]] ran violently [[G3729]] down [[G2596]] a [[G3588]] steep place [[G2911]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake, [[G3041]] and [[G2532]] were choked. [[G638]]

### 34
When [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] that fed [[G1006]] saw [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] was done, [[G1096]] they fled, [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] went [[G565]] and told [[G518]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] country. [[G68]]

### 35
Then [[G1161]] they went out [[G1831]] to see [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] was done; [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] out of [[G575]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] devils [[G1140]] were departed, [[G1831]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of [[G2424]] Jesus, [[G2424]] clothed, [[G2439]] and [[G2532]] in his right mind: [[G4993]] and [[G2532]] they were afraid. [[G5399]]

### 36
They which [[G3588]] also [[G2532]] saw [[G1492]] told [[G518]] them [[G846]] by what means [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] he that was possessed of [[G1139]] devils [[G1139]] was healed. [[G4982]]

### 37
Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G537]] multitude [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] of round about [[G4066]] country [[G4066]] the [[G3588]] of [[G1046]] Gadarenes [[G1046]] besought [[G2065]] him [[G846]] to depart [[G565]] from [[G575]] them; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] they were taken with [[G4912]] great [[G3173]] fear: [[G5401]] and [[G1161]] he [[G846]] went up [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] and returned back again. [[G5290]]

### 38
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] man [[G435]] out of [[G575]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] devils [[G1140]] were [[G1511]] departed [[G1831]] besought [[G1189]] him [[G846]] that he might be with [[G4862]] him: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] sent away, [[G630]] him [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]]

### 39
Return [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] thine own [[G4675]] house, [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] shew [[G1334]] how great things [[G3745]] God [[G2316]] hath done [[G4160]] unto thee. [[G4671]] And [[G2532]] he went his way, [[G565]] and published [[G2784]] throughout [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] city [[G4172]] how great things [[G3745]] Jesus [[G2424]] had done [[G4160]] unto him. [[G846]]

### 40
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, that, [[G1096]] when [[G1722]] Jesus [[G2424]] was returned, [[G5290]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] received [[G588]] him: [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they were [[G2258]] all [[G3956]] waiting [[G4328]] for [[G846]] him. [[G846]]

### 41
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] there came [[G2064]] a man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Jairus, [[G2383]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] was [[G5225]] a ruler [[G758]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4864]] synagogue: [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] he fell down [[G4098]] at [[G3844]] Jesus' [[G2424]] feet, [[G4228]] and besought [[G3870]] him [[G846]] that he would come [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] house: [[G3624]]

### 42
For [[G3754]] he [[G846]] had [[G2258]] one only [[G3439]] daughter, [[G2364]] about [[G5613]] twelve [[G1427]] years of age, [[G2094]] and [[G2532]] she [[G846]] lay a dying. [[G599]] But [[G1161]] as [[G1722]] he [[G846]] went [[G5217]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] thronged [[G4846]] him. [[G846]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] a woman [[G1135]] having [[G5607]] an [[G1722]] issue [[G4511]] of blood [[G129]] twelve [[G1427]] years, [[G2094]] which [[G3748]] had spent [[G4321]] all [[G3650]] her [[G3588]] living [[G979]] upon [[G1519]] physicians, [[G2395]] neither [[G3756]] could [[G2480]] be healed [[G2323]] of [[G5259]] any, [[G3762]]

### 44
Came [[G4334]] behind [[G3693]] and touched [[G680]] the [[G3588]] border [[G2899]] of his [[G846]] garment: [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G3916]] her [[G846]] issue [[G4511]] of [[G129]] blood [[G129]] stanched. [[G2476]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Who [[G5101]] touched [[G680]] me? [[G3450]] When [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] denied, [[G720]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] they [[G3588]] that were with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] Master, [[G1988]] the [[G3588]] multitude [[G3793]] throng [[G4912]] thee [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] press [[G598]] and [[G2532]] sayest thou, [[G3004]] Who [[G5101]] touched [[G680]] me? [[G3450]]

### 46
And [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] Somebody [[G5100]] hath touched [[G680]] me: [[G3450]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] perceive that [[G1097]] virtue [[G1411]] is gone out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] me. [[G1700]]

### 47
And when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] saw [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] she was [[G2990]] hid, [[G2990]] she came [[G2064]] trembling, [[G5141]] and [[G2532]] falling down before [[G4363]] him, [[G846]] she declared [[G518]] unto him [[G846]] before [[G1799]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] for [[G1223]] what [[G3739]] cause [[G156]] she had touched [[G680]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] how [[G5613]] she was healed [[G2390]] immediately. [[G3916]]

### 48
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto her, [[G846]] Daughter, [[G2364]] be of good comfort: [[G2293]] thy [[G4675]] faith [[G4102]] hath made [[G4982]] thee [[G4571]] whole; [[G4982]] go [[G4198]] in [[G1519]] peace. [[G1515]]

### 49
he [[G846]] While [[G2980]] yet [[G2089]] spake, [[G2980]] there cometh [[G2064]] one [[G5100]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] ruler of the synagogue's [[G752]] saying [[G3004]] to him, [[G846]] Thy [[G4675]] daughter [[G2364]] is dead; [[G2348]] trouble [[G4660]] not [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] Master. [[G1320]]

### 50
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] when [[G191]] heard [[G191]] he answered [[G611]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Fear [[G5399]] not: [[G3361]] believe [[G4100]] only, [[G3440]] and [[G2532]] she shall be made whole. [[G4982]]

### 51
And [[G1161]] when he came [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] he suffered [[G863]] no [[G3756]] man [[G3762]] to go in, [[G1525]] save [[G3361]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3816]] maiden. [[G3816]]

### 52
And [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] wept, [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] bewailed [[G2875]] her: [[G846]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Weep [[G2799]] not; [[G3361]] not [[G3756]] she is [[G599]] dead, [[G599]] but [[G235]] sleepeth. [[G2518]]

### 53
And [[G2532]] they laughed to scorn, [[G2606]] him [[G846]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] she was dead. [[G599]]

### 54
And [[G1161]] he [[G846]] put them [[G1544]] all [[G3956]] out, [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] took [[G2902]] her [[G846]] the [[G3588]] by [[G5495]] hand, [[G5495]] and called, [[G5455]] saying, [[G3004]] Maid, [[G3816]] arise. [[G1453]]

### 55
And [[G2532]] her [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] came again, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] she arose [[G450]] straightway: [[G3916]] and [[G2532]] he commanded [[G1299]] to give [[G1325]] her [[G846]] meat. [[G5315]]

### 56
And [[G2532]] her [[G846]] parents [[G1118]] were astonished: [[G1839]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] charged [[G3853]] them [[G846]] that they should tell [[G2036]] no man [[G3367]] what [[G3588]] was done. [[G1096]]
