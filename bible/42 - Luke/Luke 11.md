### 1
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, that, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] he [[G846]] was [[G1511]] praying [[G4336]] in [[G1722]] a [[G5117]] certain [[G5100]] place, [[G5117]] when [[G5613]] he ceased, [[G3973]] one [[G5100]] of [[G3101]] his [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Lord, [[G2962]] teach [[G1321]] us [[G2248]] to pray, [[G4336]] as [[G2531]] John [[G2491]] also [[G2532]] taught [[G1321]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] When [[G3752]] ye pray, [[G4336]] say, [[G3004]] Our [[G2257]] Father [[G3962]] which [[G3588]] art in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] Hallowed be [[G37]] thy [[G4675]] name. [[G3686]] Thy [[G4675]] kingdom [[G932]] come. [[G2064]] Thy [[G4675]] will [[G2307]] be done, [[G1096]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] so [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 3
Give [[G1325]] us [[G2254]] day [[G2250]] by [[G2596]] day [[G2250]] our [[G2257]] daily [[G1967]] bread. [[G740]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] forgive [[G863]] us [[G2254]] our [[G2257]] sins; [[G266]] for [[G1063]] we [[G846]] also [[G2532]] forgive [[G863]] every one [[G3956]] that is indebted [[G3784]] to us. [[G2254]] And [[G2532]] lead [[G1533]] us [[G2248]] not [[G3361]] into [[G1519]] temptation; [[G3986]] but [[G235]] deliver [[G4506]] us [[G2248]] from [[G575]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you [[G5216]] shall have [[G2192]] a friend, [[G5384]] and [[G2532]] shall go [[G4198]] unto [[G4314]] him [[G846]] at midnight, [[G3317]] and [[G2532]] say [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Friend, [[G5384]] lend [[G5531]] me [[G3427]] three [[G5140]] loaves; [[G740]]

### 6
For [[G1894]] a friend [[G5384]] of mine [[G3450]] in [[G1537]] his journey [[G3598]] is come [[G3854]] to [[G4314]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] I have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3756]] to [[G3739]] set before [[G3908]] him? [[G846]]

### 7
And he [[G2548]] from within [[G2081]] shall answer [[G611]] and say, [[G2036]] Trouble [[G2873]] me [[G3427]] not: [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] now [[G2235]] is [[G2808]] shut, [[G2808]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] children [[G3813]] are [[G1526]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] in [[G1519]] bed; [[G2845]] I cannot [[G1410]] rise [[G450]] and give [[G1325]] thee. [[G4671]]

### 8
I say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Though [[G1487]] he will [[G1325]] not [[G3756]] rise and [[G450]] give [[G1325]] him, [[G846]] because [[G1223]] he [[G3588]] is [[G1511]] his [[G846]] friend, [[G5384]] yet [[G1065]] because [[G1223]] of [[G335]] his [[G846]] importunity [[G335]] he will rise [[G1453]] and give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] as many as [[G3745]] he needeth. [[G5535]]

### 9
And I [[G2504]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Ask, [[G154]] and [[G2532]] it shall be given [[G1325]] you; [[G5213]] seek, [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] ye shall find; [[G2147]] knock, [[G2925]] and [[G2532]] it shall be opened [[G455]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] every that [[G3956]] one [[G3588]] asketh [[G154]] receiveth; [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3588]] that seeketh [[G2212]] findeth; [[G2147]] and [[G2532]] to him [[G3588]] that knocketh [[G2925]] it shall be opened. [[G455]]

### 11
If [[G1161]]  a [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] shall ask [[G154]] bread [[G740]] of any [[G5101]] of you [[G5216]] that is a father, [[G3962]] will he give [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a stone? [[G3037]] or [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] a fish, [[G2486]] will he [[G1929]] for [[G473]] a fish [[G2486]] give [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a serpent? [[G3789]]

### 12
Or [[G2228]] if [[G1437]] he shall ask [[G154]] an egg, [[G5609]] will he offer [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a scorpion? [[G4651]]

### 13
If [[G1487]] ye [[G5210]] then, [[G3767]] being [[G5225]] evil, [[G4190]] know how [[G1492]] to give [[G1325]] good [[G18]] gifts [[G1390]] unto [[G5216]] your [[G5216]] children: [[G5043]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] heavenly [[G3772]] shall [[G1325]] Father [[G3962]] give [[G1325]] the [[G4151]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] to them that ask [[G154]] him? [[G846]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] he was [[G2258]] casting out [[G1544]] a devil, [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] it [[G846]] was [[G2258]] dumb. [[G2974]] And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] when was gone [[G1831]] devil [[G1140]] out, [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] dumb [[G2974]] spake; [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] wondered. [[G2296]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] He casteth out [[G1544]] devils [[G1140]] through [[G1722]] Beelzebub [[G954]] the chief [[G758]] of [[G1140]] the [[G3588]] devils. [[G1140]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] others, [[G2087]] tempting [[G3985]] sought [[G2212]] of [[G3844]] him [[G846]] a sign [[G4592]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] he, [[G846]] knowing [[G1492]] their [[G846]] thoughts, [[G1270]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Every [[G3956]] kingdom [[G932]] divided [[G1266]] against [[G1909]] itself [[G1438]] is brought to desolation; [[G2049]] and [[G2532]] a house [[G3624]] against [[G1909]] a house [[G3624]] falleth. [[G4098]]

### 18
If [[G1487]] Satan [[G4567]] also [[G2532]] be divided [[G1266]] against [[G1909]] himself, [[G1438]] how [[G4459]] shall [[G2476]] his [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] stand? [[G2476]] because [[G3754]] ye say that [[G3004]] I [[G3165]] cast out [[G1544]] devils [[G1140]] through [[G1722]] Beelzebub. [[G954]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] by [[G1722]] Beelzebub [[G954]] cast out [[G1544]] devils, [[G1140]] by [[G1722]] whom [[G5101]] your [[G5216]] do out? [[G1544]] sons [[G5207]] cast [[G1544]] therefore [[G1223]] shall [[G2071]] they [[G846]] be [[G2071]] your [[G5216]] judges. [[G2923]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] with [[G1722]] I out [[G1544]] the finger [[G1147]] of God [[G2316]] cast [[G1544]] devils, [[G1140]] no doubt [[G686]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is come [[G5348]] upon [[G1909]] you. [[G5209]]

### 21
When [[G3752]] a [[G3588]] strong man [[G2478]] armed [[G2528]] keepeth [[G5442]] his [[G1438]] palace, [[G833]] his [[G846]] goods [[G5224]] are [[G2076]] in [[G1722]] peace: [[G1515]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] when [[G1875]] a [[G3588]] stronger [[G2478]] than he [[G846]] shall come upon [[G1904]] and overcome [[G3528]] him, [[G846]] him, [[G846]] he taketh [[G142]] from him [[G1909]] all [[G3833]] his [[G846]] armour [[G3833]] wherein [[G3739]] he trusted, [[G3982]] and [[G2532]] divideth [[G1239]] his [[G846]] spoils. [[G4661]]

### 23
He that is [[G5607]] not [[G3361]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] is [[G2076]] against [[G2596]] me: [[G1700]] and [[G2532]] he that gathereth [[G4863]] not [[G3361]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1700]] scattereth. [[G4650]]

### 24
When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] is gone out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] a [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] he walketh [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] dry [[G504]] places, [[G5117]] seeking [[G2212]] rest; [[G372]] and [[G2532]] finding [[G2147]] none, [[G3361]] he saith, [[G3004]] I will return [[G5290]] unto [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] house [[G3624]] whence [[G3606]] I came out. [[G1831]]

### 25
And [[G2532]] when he cometh, [[G2064]] he findeth [[G2147]] swept [[G4563]] and [[G2532]] garnished. [[G2885]]

### 26
Then [[G5119]] goeth he, [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] taketh [[G3880]] seven [[G2033]] other [[G2087]] spirits [[G4151]] more wicked [[G4190]] than himself; [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] they enter in, [[G1525]] and dwell [[G2730]] there: [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] of [[G444]] that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] is [[G1096]] worse [[G5501]] than the [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]]

### 27
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] he [[G846]] spake [[G3004]] these things, [[G5023]] a certain [[G5100]] woman [[G1135]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] company [[G3793]] lifted up [[G1869]] her voice, [[G5456]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Blessed [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] womb [[G2836]] that [[G3588]] bare [[G941]] thee, [[G4571]] and [[G2532]] the paps [[G3149]] which [[G3739]] thou hast sucked. [[G2337]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] he [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] Yea rather, [[G3304]] blessed [[G3107]] they [[G3588]] that hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G2316]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G5442]] it. [[G846]]

### 29
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when were gathered thick [[G1865]] people [[G3793]] together, [[G1865]] he began [[G756]] to say, [[G3004]] This [[G3778]] is [[G2076]] an [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] generation: [[G1074]] they seek [[G1934]] a sign; [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] there shall be [[G1325]] sign [[G4592]] given [[G1325]] it, [[G846]] but [[G3361]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] of Jonas [[G2495]] the [[G3588]] prophet. [[G4396]]

### 30
For [[G1063]] as [[G2531]] Jonas [[G2495]] was [[G1096]] a sign [[G4592]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G3536]] Ninevites, [[G3536]] so [[G3779]] shall [[G2071]] also [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] be [[G2071]] to [[G1074]] this [[G3778]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 31
The queen [[G938]] of the south [[G3558]] shall rise up [[G1453]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2920]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] of [[G1074]] this [[G3778]] generation, [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] condemn [[G2632]] them: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] she came [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] utmost parts [[G4009]] of [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of Solomon; [[G4672]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a greater [[G4119]] than Solomon [[G4672]] here. [[G5602]]

### 32
The men [[G435]] of Nineve [[G3535]] shall rise up [[G450]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2920]] with [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] generation, [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] shall condemn [[G2632]] it: [[G846]] for [[G3754]] they repented [[G3340]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] preaching [[G2782]] of Jonas; [[G2495]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] a greater [[G4119]] than Jonas [[G2495]] here. [[G5602]]

### 33
No man, [[G3762]] when [[G1161]] he hath lighted [[G681]] a candle, [[G3088]] putteth [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] a secret place, [[G2927]] neither [[G3761]] under [[G5259]] a [[G3588]] bushel, [[G3426]] but [[G235]] on [[G1909]] a [[G3588]] candlestick, [[G3087]] that [[G2443]] they [[G3588]] which come in [[G1531]] may see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] light. [[G5338]]

### 34
The [[G3588]] light [[G3088]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4983]] body [[G4983]] is [[G2076]] the [[G3588]] eye: [[G3788]] therefore [[G3767]] when [[G3752]] thine [[G4675]] eye [[G3788]] is [[G5600]] single, [[G573]] thy [[G4675]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] also [[G2532]] is [[G2076]] full of light; [[G5460]] but [[G1161]] when [[G1875]] is [[G5600]] evil, [[G4190]] thy [[G4675]] body [[G4983]] also [[G2532]] full of darkness. [[G4652]]

### 35
Take heed that [[G4648]] therefore [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] which [[G3588]] is in [[G1722]] thee [[G4671]] be [[G2076]] not [[G3361]] darkness. [[G4655]]

### 36
If [[G1487]] thy [[G4675]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] therefore [[G3767]] full of light, [[G5460]] having [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] part [[G3313]] dark, [[G4652]] the whole [[G3650]] shall be [[G2071]] full of light, [[G5460]] as [[G5613]] when [[G3752]] the bright [[G3588]] shining [[G796]] a [[G3588]] of [[G3088]] candle [[G3088]] doth give [[G5461]] thee [[G4571]] light. [[G5461]]

### 37
And [[G1161]] as [[G1722]] he [[G3588]] spake, [[G2980]] a certain [[G5100]] Pharisee [[G5330]] besought [[G2065]] him [[G846]] to [[G3704]] dine [[G709]] with [[G3844]] him: [[G846]] and [[G1161]] he went in, [[G1525]] and sat down to meat. [[G377]]

### 38
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] when [[G1492]] Pharisee [[G5330]] saw [[G1492]] he marvelled [[G2296]] that [[G3754]] not [[G3756]] he had [[G907]] first [[G4412]] washed [[G907]] before [[G4253]] dinner. [[G712]]

### 39
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] Now [[G3568]] ye [[G5210]] do make [[G2511]] Pharisees [[G5330]] clean [[G2511]] the [[G3588]] outside [[G1855]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4221]] cup [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] platter; [[G4094]] but [[G1161]] your [[G5216]] inward part [[G2081]] is full [[G1073]] of ravening [[G724]] and [[G2532]] wickedness. [[G4189]]

### 40
fools, [[G878]] not [[G3756]] did [[G4160]] he [[G3588]] that made [[G4160]] that [[G3588]] which is without [[G1855]] make [[G4160]] that [[G3588]] which is within [[G2081]] also? [[G2532]]

### 41
But rather [[G4133]] give [[G1325]] alms [[G1654]] of such things as ye [[G1751]] have; [[G1751]] and, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] all things [[G3956]] are [[G2076]] clean [[G2513]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 42
But [[G235]] woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] Pharisees! [[G5330]] for [[G3754]] ye tithe [[G586]] mint [[G2238]] and [[G2532]] rue [[G4076]] and [[G2532]] all manner of [[G3956]] herbs, [[G3001]] and [[G2532]] pass over [[G3928]] judgment [[G2920]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G2316]] God: [[G2316]] these [[G5023]] ought ye [[G1163]] to have done, [[G4160]] and the [[G2548]] not [[G3361]] to leave undone. [[G863]] other [[G2548]]

### 43
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] Pharisees! [[G5330]] for [[G3754]] ye love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] uppermost seats [[G4410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] greetings [[G783]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] markets. [[G58]]

### 44
Woe [[G3759]] unto you, [[G5213]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] for [[G3754]] ye are [[G2075]] as [[G5613]] graves [[G3419]] which [[G3588]] appear not, [[G82]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] men [[G444]] that [[G3588]] walk [[G4043]] over [[G1883]] not [[G3756]] are [[G1492]] aware [[G1492]]

### 45
Then [[G1161]] answered [[G611]] one [[G5100]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3544]] lawyers, [[G3544]] and said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Master, [[G1320]] thus [[G5023]] saying [[G3004]] thou reproachest [[G5195]] us [[G2248]] also. [[G2532]]

### 46
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Woe [[G3759]] unto you [[G5213]] also, [[G2532]] lawyers! [[G3544]] for [[G3754]] ye lade [[G5412]] men [[G444]] with burdens [[G5413]] grievous to be borne, [[G1419]] and [[G2532]] yourselves [[G846]] ye [[G4379]] touch [[G4379]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] burdens [[G5413]] one of [[G1520]] with [[G1147]] your [[G5216]] fingers. [[G1147]]

### 47
Woe [[G3759]] unto you! [[G5213]] for [[G3754]] ye build [[G3618]] the [[G3588]] sepulchres [[G3419]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4396]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G1161]] your [[G5216]] fathers [[G3962]] killed [[G615]] them. [[G846]]

### 48
Truly [[G686]] ye bear witness [[G3140]] that [[G2532]] ye allow [[G4909]] the [[G3588]] deeds [[G2041]] of [[G3962]] your [[G5216]] fathers: [[G3962]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] indeed [[G3303]] killed [[G615]] them, [[G846]] and [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] build [[G3618]] their [[G846]] sepulchres. [[G3419]]

### 49
