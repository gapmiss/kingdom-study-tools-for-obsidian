### 1
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] upon [[G1520]] first [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] of [[G4521]] week, [[G4521]] very early [[G901]] in the morning, [[G3722]] they came [[G2064]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3418]] bringing [[G5342]] the spices [[G759]] which [[G3739]] they had prepared, [[G2090]] and [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] they found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] rolled away [[G617]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre. [[G3419]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] they entered in, [[G1525]] and found [[G2147]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] the [[G3588]] of [[G2962]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as [[G1722]] they [[G846]] were much [[G1280]] perplexed [[G1280]] thereabout, [[G4012]] behold, [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] men [[G435]] stood by [[G2186]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] shining [[G797]] garments: [[G2067]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] as they [[G846]] were [[G1096]] afraid, [[G1719]] and [[G2532]] bowed down [[G2827]] faces [[G4383]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] they said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] seek ye [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] among [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] dead? [[G3498]]

### 6
He is [[G2076]] not [[G3756]] here, [[G5602]] but [[G235]] is risen: [[G1453]] remember [[G3415]] how [[G5613]] he spake [[G2980]] unto you [[G5213]] when he was [[G5607]] yet [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] Galilee, [[G1056]]

### 7
Saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G444]] man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] be delivered [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] the hands [[G5495]] of sinful [[G268]] men, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] be crucified, [[G4717]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] rise again. [[G450]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] they remembered [[G3415]] his [[G846]] words, [[G4487]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] returned [[G5290]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] and told [[G518]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5023]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G1733]] eleven, [[G1733]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] rest. [[G3062]]

### 10
It [[G2258]] was [[G2258]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] and [[G2532]] Joanna, [[G2489]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] of James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] other [[G3062]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] which [[G3739]] told [[G3004]] these things [[G5023]] unto [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] their [[G846]] words [[G4487]] seemed [[G5316]] to [[G1799]] them [[G846]] as [[G5616]] idle tales, [[G3026]] and [[G2532]] they believed not. [[G569]] them [[G846]]

### 12
Then arose [[G450]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G1161]] ran [[G5143]] unto [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre; [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] stooping down, [[G3879]] he beheld [[G991]] the [[G3588]] linen clothes [[G3608]] laid [[G2749]] by themselves, [[G3441]] and [[G2532]] departed, [[G565]] wondering [[G2296]] in [[G4314]] himself [[G1438]] at that which [[G3588]] was come to pass. [[G1096]]

### 13
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] went [[G2258]] that [[G1722]] same [[G846]] day [[G2250]] to [[G1519]] a village [[G2968]] called [[G3686]] Emmaus, [[G1695]] which [[G3739]] was [[G568]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] threescore [[G1835]] furlongs. [[G4712]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] talked [[G3656]] together [[G4314]] of [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G5130]] which [[G3588]] had happened. [[G4819]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that, while [[G1722]] they [[G846]] communed [[G3656]] and [[G2532]] reasoned, [[G4802]] Jesus [[G2424]] himself [[G846]] drew near, [[G1448]] and went [[G4848]] with [[G846]] them. [[G846]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were holden [[G2902]] that they should [[G846]] not [[G3361]] know [[G1921]] him. [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] What [[G5101]] manner of [[G3056]] communications [[G3056]] these [[G3778]] that [[G3739]] ye have [[G474]] one to [[G4314]] another, [[G240]] as ye walk, [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] are [[G2075]] sad? [[G4659]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] one of them, [[G1520]] whose [[G3739]] name [[G3686]] was Cleopas, [[G2810]] answering [[G611]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] him, [[G846]] thou [[G4771]] Art a [[G3939]] only [[G3441]] stranger [[G3939]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] hast [[G1097]] known [[G1097]] the things which [[G3588]] are come to pass [[G1096]] there [[G846]] in [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] days? [[G2250]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] What things? [[G4169]] And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Concerning [[G4012]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3480]] Nazareth, [[G3480]] which [[G3739]] was [[G1096]] a [[G435]] prophet [[G4396]] mighty [[G1415]] in [[G1722]] deed [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] word [[G3056]] before [[G1726]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people: [[G2992]]

### 20
And [[G5037]] how [[G3704]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] our [[G2257]] rulers [[G758]] delivered [[G3860]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] be condemned [[G2917]] to death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] have crucified [[G4717]] him. [[G846]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] we [[G2249]] trusted [[G1679]] that [[G3754]] it had been [[G2076]] he [[G846]] which [[G3588]] should [[G3195]] have redeemed [[G3084]] Israel: [[G2474]] and [[G1065]]  beside [[G235]] all [[G3956]] this, [[G5125]] to day [[G4594]] is [[G71]] the [[G5026]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] since [[G575]] these things [[G5023]] were done. [[G1096]]

### 22
Yea, [[G235]] and [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] women [[G1135]] also of [[G1537]] our company [[G2257]] made astonished, [[G1839]] us [[G2248]] which were [[G1096]] early [[G3721]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre; [[G3419]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] when they found [[G2147]] not [[G3361]] his [[G846]] body, [[G4983]] they came, [[G2064]] saying, that [[G3004]] also [[G2532]] they had [[G3708]] seen [[G3708]] a vision [[G3701]] of angels, [[G32]] which [[G3739]] said [[G3004]] that he [[G846]] was alive. [[G2198]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] certain [[G5100]] of them which were [[G3588]] with [[G4862]] us [[G2254]] went [[G565]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sepulchre, [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] even [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] women [[G1135]] had said: [[G2036]] but [[G1161]] him [[G846]] they saw [[G1492]] not. [[G3756]]

### 25
Then [[G2532]] he [[G846]] said [[G2036]] unto [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] O [[G5599]] fools, [[G453]] and [[G2532]] slow [[G1021]] of [[G2588]] heart [[G2588]] to [[G4100]] believe [[G4100]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] have spoken: [[G2980]]

### 26
Ought [[G1163]] not [[G3780]] Christ [[G5547]] to have suffered [[G3958]] these things, [[G5023]] and [[G2532]] to enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] glory? [[G1391]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] beginning [[G756]] at [[G575]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] he expounded [[G1329]] unto them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] scriptures [[G1124]] the things [[G3588]] concerning [[G4012]] himself. [[G1438]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] they drew nigh [[G1448]] unto [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] village, [[G2968]] whither [[G3757]] they went: [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] made as though [[G4364]] he would have gone [[G4198]] further. [[G4208]]

### 29
But [[G2532]] they constrained [[G3849]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] Abide [[G3306]] with [[G3326]] us: [[G2257]] for [[G3754]] it is [[G2076]] toward [[G4314]] evening, [[G2073]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] is far spent. [[G2827]] And [[G2532]] he went in [[G1525]] to [[G3306]] tarry [[G3306]] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] as he [[G846]] sat at meat [[G2625]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] he took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] and blessed [[G2127]] and [[G2532]] brake, [[G2806]] and gave [[G1929]] to them. [[G846]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were opened, [[G1272]] and [[G2532]] they knew [[G1921]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] vanished sight. [[G855]] out of [[G575]] their [[G846]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] they said [[G2036]] one to [[G4314]] another, [[G240]] Did [[G2258]] not [[G3780]] our [[G2257]] heart [[G2588]] burn [[G2545]] within [[G1722]] us, [[G2254]] while [[G5613]] he talked [[G2980]] with us [[G2254]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] while [[G5613]] he opened [[G1272]] to us [[G2254]] the [[G3588]] scriptures? [[G1124]]

### 33
And [[G2532]] they rose up [[G450]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] hour, [[G5610]] and returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] eleven [[G1733]] gathered together, [[G4867]] and [[G2532]] them that were [[G3588]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]]

### 34
Saying, [[G3004]] The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is risen [[G1453]] indeed, [[G3689]] and [[G2532]] hath appeared [[G3700]] to Simon. [[G4613]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] told [[G1834]] what things [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] how [[G5613]] he was known [[G1097]] of them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] breaking [[G2800]] of [[G740]] bread. [[G740]]

### 36
And as [[G1161]] they [[G846]] thus [[G5023]] spake, [[G2980]] Jesus [[G2424]] himself [[G846]] stood [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the midst [[G3319]] of them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saith [[G3004]] unto them, [[G846]] Peace [[G1515]] unto you. [[G5213]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] they were terrified [[G4422]] and [[G2532]] affrighted, [[G1719]] and supposed that [[G1380]] they had seen [[G2334]] a spirit. [[G4151]]

### 38
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Why [[G5101]] are [[G2075]] ye troubled? [[G5015]] and [[G2532]] why [[G1302]] do thoughts [[G1261]] arise [[G305]] in [[G1722]] your [[G5216]] hearts? [[G2588]]

### 39
Behold [[G1492]] my [[G3450]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] my [[G3450]] feet, [[G4228]] that [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] I [[G1473]] myself: [[G846]] handle [[G5584]] me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] see; [[G1492]] for [[G3754]] a spirit [[G4151]] hath [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] bones, [[G3747]] as [[G2531]] ye see [[G2334]] me [[G1691]] have. [[G2192]]

### 40
And when [[G2532]] thus [[G5124]] he had [[G2036]] spoken, [[G2036]] he shewed [[G1925]] them [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] feet. [[G4228]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] while they [[G846]] yet [[G2089]] believed not [[G569]] for [[G575]] joy, [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] wondered, [[G2296]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Have ye [[G2192]] here [[G1759]] any [[G5100]] meat? [[G1034]]

### 42
And [[G1161]] they [[G3588]] gave [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a piece [[G3313]] of a broiled [[G3702]] fish, [[G2486]] and [[G2532]] of [[G575]] honeycomb. [[G3193]] an [[G2781]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] he took [[G2983]] and did eat [[G5315]] before [[G1799]] them. [[G846]]

### 44
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] These [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] which [[G3739]] I spake [[G2980]] unto [[G4314]] you, [[G5209]] while I was [[G5607]] yet [[G2089]] with [[G4862]] you, [[G5213]] that [[G3754]] all things [[G3956]] must be [[G1163]] fulfilled, [[G4137]] which [[G3588]] were written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of Moses, [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] the prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] the psalms, [[G5568]] concerning [[G4012]] me. [[G1700]]

### 45
Then [[G5119]] opened he [[G1272]] their [[G846]] understanding, [[G3563]] that [[G3588]] they might understand [[G4920]] the [[G3588]] scriptures, [[G1124]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Thus [[G3779]] it is written, [[G1125]] and [[G2532]] thus [[G3779]] it behoved [[G1163]] Christ [[G5547]] to suffer, [[G3958]] and [[G2532]] to rise [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the dead [[G3498]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day: [[G2250]]

### 47
And [[G2532]] that repentance [[G3341]] and [[G2532]] remission [[G859]] of sins [[G266]] should be preached [[G2784]] in [[G1909]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] among [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] nations, [[G1484]] beginning [[G756]] at [[G575]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

### 48
And [[G1161]] ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] witnesses [[G3144]] of these things. [[G5130]]

### 49
And, [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] send [[G649]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of my [[G3450]] Father [[G3962]] upon [[G1909]] you: [[G5209]] but [[G1161]] tarry [[G2523]] ye [[G5210]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] of Jerusalem, [[G2419]] until [[G2193]] ye [[G3739]] be endued [[G1746]] with power [[G1411]] from [[G1537]] on high. [[G5311]]

### 50
And [[G1161]] he led [[G1806]] them [[G846]] out [[G1854]] as far as [[G2193]] to [[G1519]] Bethany, [[G963]] and [[G2532]] he lifted up [[G1869]] his [[G846]] hands, [[G5495]] and blessed [[G2127]] them. [[G846]]

### 51
And [[G2532]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] while [[G1722]] he [[G846]] blessed [[G2127]] them, [[G846]] he was parted [[G1339]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] carried up [[G399]] into [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 52
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] worshipped [[G4352]] him, [[G846]] and returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] with [[G3326]] great [[G3173]] joy: [[G5479]]

### 53
And [[G2532]] were [[G2258]] continually [[G1275]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] praising [[G134]] and [[G2532]] blessing [[G2127]] God. [[G2316]] Amen. [[G281]]
