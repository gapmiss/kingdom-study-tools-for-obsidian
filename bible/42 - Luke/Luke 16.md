### 1
And [[G1161]] he said [[G3004]] also [[G2532]] unto [[G4314]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] There was [[G2258]] a certain [[G5100]] rich [[G4145]] man, [[G444]] which [[G3739]] had [[G2192]] a steward; [[G3623]] and [[G2532]] the same [[G3778]] was accused [[G1225]] unto him [[G846]] that [[G5613]] he had wasted [[G1287]] his [[G846]] goods. [[G5224]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] he called [[G5455]] him, [[G846]] and said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] How is it [[G5101]] that I hear [[G191]] this [[G5124]] of [[G4012]] thee? [[G4675]] give [[G591]] an [[G3056]] account [[G3056]] of thy [[G4675]] stewardship; [[G3622]] for [[G1063]] thou mayest be [[G1410]] no [[G3756]] longer [[G2089]] steward. [[G3621]]

### 3
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] steward [[G3623]] said [[G2036]] within [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] What [[G5101]] shall I do? [[G4160]] for [[G3754]] my [[G3450]] lord [[G2962]] taketh away [[G851]] from [[G575]] me [[G1700]] the [[G3588]] stewardship: [[G3622]] I cannot [[G2480]] dig; [[G4626]] to beg [[G1871]] I am ashamed. [[G153]]

### 4
I am resolved [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] to do, [[G4160]] that, [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] I am put out [[G3179]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3622]] stewardship, [[G3622]] they may receive [[G1209]] me [[G3165]] into [[G1519]] their [[G846]] houses. [[G3624]]

### 5
So [[G2532]] he called [[G4341]] every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of his [[G1438]] lord's [[G2962]] debtors [[G5533]] and said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] unto [[G4413]] first, [[G4413]] How much [[G4214]] owest thou [[G3784]] unto my [[G3450]] lord? [[G2962]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] An hundred [[G1540]] measures [[G943]] of oil. [[G1637]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] Take [[G1209]] thy [[G4675]] bill, [[G1121]] and [[G2532]] sit down [[G2523]] quickly, [[G5030]] and write [[G1125]] fifty. [[G4004]]

### 7
Then [[G1899]] said he [[G2036]] to another, [[G2087]] And [[G1161]] how much [[G4214]] owest [[G3784]] thou? [[G4771]] And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] An hundred [[G1540]] measures [[G2884]] of wheat. [[G4621]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] Take [[G1209]] thy [[G4675]] bill, [[G1121]] and [[G2532]] write [[G1125]] fourscore. [[G3589]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lord [[G2962]] commended [[G1867]] the [[G3588]] unjust [[G93]] steward, [[G3623]] because [[G3754]] he had done [[G4160]] wisely: [[G5430]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of this [[G5127]] world [[G165]] are [[G1526]] in [[G1519]] their [[G1438]] generation [[G1074]] wiser [[G5429]] than [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5207]] of [[G5457]] light. [[G5457]]

### 9
And I [[G2504]] say [[G3004]] unto you, [[G5213]] Make [[G4160]] to yourselves [[G1438]] friends [[G5384]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mammon [[G3126]] of unrighteousness; [[G93]] that, [[G2443]] when [[G3752]] ye fail, [[G1587]] they may receive [[G1209]] you [[G5209]] into [[G1519]] everlasting [[G166]] habitations. [[G4633]]

### 10
He that [[G3588]] is faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] that which is least [[G1646]] is [[G2076]] faithful [[G4103]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] much: [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] he that [[G3588]] is unjust [[G94]] in [[G1722]] the least [[G1646]] is [[G2076]] unjust [[G94]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] much. [[G4183]]

### 11
If [[G1487]] therefore [[G3767]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G1096]] been [[G1096]] faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] unrighteous [[G94]] mammon, [[G3126]] who [[G5101]] will commit trust [[G4100]] to your [[G5213]] the [[G3588]] true [[G228]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] not [[G3756]] ye have [[G1096]] been [[G1096]] faithful [[G4103]] in [[G1722]] that which [[G3588]] is another man's, [[G245]] who [[G5101]] shall give [[G1325]] you [[G5213]] that which [[G3588]] is your own? [[G5212]]

### 13
No [[G3762]] servant [[G3610]] can [[G1410]] serve [[G1398]] two [[G1417]] masters: [[G2962]] for [[G1063]] either [[G2228]] he will hate [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] one, [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] other; [[G2087]] or else [[G2228]] he will hold to [[G472]] the one, [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] despise [[G2706]] the [[G3588]] other. [[G2087]] Ye cannot [[G1410]] serve [[G1398]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] mammon. [[G3126]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] also, [[G2532]] who were [[G5225]] covetous, [[G5366]] heard [[G191]] all [[G3956]] these things: [[G5023]] and [[G2532]] they derided [[G1592]] him. [[G846]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] he said [[G2036]] unto them, [[G846]] Ye [[G5210]] are [[G2075]] they which [[G3588]] justify [[G1344]] yourselves [[G1438]] before [[G1799]] men; [[G444]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] knoweth [[G1097]] your [[G5216]] hearts: [[G2588]] for [[G3754]] that which [[G3588]] is highly esteemed [[G5308]] among [[G1722]] men [[G444]] is [[G2076]] abomination [[G946]] in the sight [[G1799]] of [[G2316]] God. [[G2316]]

### 16
The [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] until [[G2193]] John: [[G2491]] since [[G575]] that time [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] is preached, [[G2097]] and [[G2532]] every man [[G3956]] presseth [[G971]] into [[G1519]] it. [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G1161]] it is [[G2076]] easier [[G2123]] for [[G3772]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] to pass, [[G3928]] than [[G2228]] one [[G1520]] tittle [[G2762]] the [[G3588]] of [[G3551]] law [[G3551]] to fail. [[G4098]]

### 18
Whosoever [[G3956]] putteth [[G630]] away [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] marrieth [[G1060]] another, [[G2087]] committeth adultery: [[G3431]] and [[G2532]] whosoever [[G3956]] marrieth her [[G1060]] that [[G3588]] is put away [[G630]] from [[G575]] husband [[G435]] committeth adultery. [[G3431]]

### 19
There was [[G2258]] a certain [[G5100]] rich [[G4145]] man, [[G444]] which [[G2532]] was clothed [[G1737]] in purple [[G4209]] and [[G2532]] fine linen, [[G1040]] and fared [[G2165]] sumptuously [[G2988]] every [[G2596]] day: [[G2250]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] there was [[G2258]] a certain [[G5100]] beggar [[G4434]] named [[G3686]] Lazarus, [[G2976]] which [[G3739]] was laid [[G906]] at [[G4314]] his [[G846]] gate, [[G4440]] full of sores, [[G1669]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] desiring [[G1937]] to be fed [[G5526]] with [[G575]] the [[G3588]] crumbs [[G5589]] which [[G3588]] fell [[G4098]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] rich man's [[G4145]] table: [[G5132]] moreover [[G235]] the [[G3588]] dogs [[G2965]] came [[G2064]] and licked [[G621]] his [[G846]] sores. [[G1668]]

### 22
And [[G1161]] it came to pass, [[G1096]] that [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] beggar [[G4434]] died, [[G599]] and [[G2532]] was carried [[G667]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] into [[G1519]] Abraham's [[G11]] bosom: [[G2859]] the [[G3588]] rich man [[G4145]] also [[G2532]] died, [[G599]] and [[G2532]] was buried; [[G2290]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] hell [[G86]] he lift up [[G1869]] his [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] being [[G5225]] in [[G1722]] torments, [[G931]] and seeth [[G3708]] Abraham [[G11]] afar [[G3113]] off, [[G575]] and [[G2532]] Lazarus [[G2976]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] bosom. [[G2859]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] cried [[G5455]] and said, [[G2036]] Father [[G3962]] Abraham, [[G11]] have mercy [[G1653]] on me, [[G3165]] and [[G2532]] send [[G3992]] Lazarus, [[G2976]] that [[G2443]] he may dip [[G911]] the [[G3588]] tip [[G206]] of his [[G846]] finger [[G1147]] in water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] cool [[G2711]] my [[G3450]] tongue; [[G1100]] for [[G3754]] I am tormented [[G3600]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] flame. [[G5395]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] Abraham [[G11]] said, [[G2036]] Son, [[G5043]] remember [[G3415]] that [[G3754]] thou [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] thy [[G4675]] lifetime [[G2222]] receivedst [[G618]] thy [[G4675]] good [[G18]] things, [[G18]] and [[G2532]] likewise [[G3668]] Lazarus [[G2976]] evil [[G2556]] things: [[G2556]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] he [[G3592]] is comforted, [[G3870]] and thou [[G4771]] art tormented. [[G3600]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] beside [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] this, [[G5125]] between [[G3342]] us [[G2257]] and [[G2532]] you [[G5216]] there is a great [[G3173]] gulf [[G5490]] fixed: [[G4741]] so that [[G3704]] they which [[G3588]] would [[G2309]] pass [[G1224]] from hence [[G1782]] to [[G4314]] you [[G5209]] cannot; [[G1410]] neither [[G3366]] can they pass [[G1276]] to [[G4314]] us, [[G2248]] that [[G3588]] from thence. [[G1564]]

### 27
Then [[G1161]] he said, [[G2036]] I pray [[G2065]] thee [[G4571]] therefore, [[G3767]] father, [[G3962]] that [[G2443]] thou wouldest send [[G3992]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] my [[G3450]] father's [[G3962]] house: [[G3624]]

### 28
For [[G1063]] I have [[G2192]] five [[G4002]] brethren; [[G80]] that [[G3704]] he may testify [[G1263]] unto them, [[G846]] lest [[G2443]] they [[G846]] also [[G2532]] come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] this [[G5126]] place [[G5117]] of [[G931]] torment. [[G931]]

### 29
Abraham [[G11]] saith [[G3004]] unto him, [[G846]] They have [[G2192]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets; [[G4396]] let them hear [[G191]] them. [[G846]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] he [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] Nay, [[G3780]] father [[G3962]] Abraham: [[G11]] but [[G235]] if [[G1437]] one [[G5100]] went [[G4198]] unto [[G4314]] them [[G846]] from [[G575]] the dead, [[G3498]] they will repent. [[G3340]]

### 31
And [[G1161]] he said [[G2036]] unto him, [[G846]] If [[G1487]] they hear [[G191]] not [[G3756]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] neither [[G3761]] will they be persuaded, [[G3982]] though [[G1437]] one [[G5100]] rose [[G450]] from [[G1537]] the dead. [[G3498]]
