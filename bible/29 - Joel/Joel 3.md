### 1
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] and in that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] when [[H834]] I shall bring again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]]

### 2
I will also gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] nations, [[H1471]] and will bring them down [[H3381]] into [[H413]] the valley [[H6010]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] and will plead [[H8199]] with [[H5973]] them there [[H8033]] for [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] and my heritage [[H5159]] Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] they have scattered [[H6340]] among the nations, [[H1471]] and parted [[H2505]] my land. [[H776]]

### 3
And they have cast [[H3032]] lots [[H1486]] for [[H413]] my people; [[H5971]] and have given [[H5414]] a boy [[H3206]] for an harlot, [[H2181]] and sold [[H4376]] a girl [[H3207]] for wine, [[H3196]] that they might drink. [[H8354]]

### 4
Yea, [[H1571]] and what [[H4100]] have ye [[H859]] to do with me, O Tyre, [[H6865]] and Zidon, [[H6721]] and all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1552]] of Palestine? [[H6429]] will ye [[H859]] render [[H7999]] me a recompence? [[H1576]] and if [[H518]] ye [[H859]] recompense [[H1580]] me, swiftly [[H7031]] speedily [[H4120]] will I return [[H7725]] your recompence [[H1576]] upon your own head; [[H7218]]

### 5
Because [[H834]] ye have taken [[H3947]] my silver [[H3701]] and my gold, [[H2091]] and have carried [[H935]] into your temples [[H1964]] my goodly [[H2896]] pleasant things: [[H4261]]

### 6
The children [[H1121]] also of Judah [[H3063]] and the children [[H1121]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] have ye sold [[H4376]] unto the Grecians, [[H3125]] that [[H4616]] ye might remove them far [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] their border. [[H1366]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2005]] I will raise [[H5782]] them out of [[H4480]] the place [[H4725]] whither [[H834]] ye have sold [[H4376]] them, and will return [[H7725]] your recompence [[H1576]] upon your own head: [[H7218]]

### 8
And I will sell [[H4376]] your sons [[H1121]] and your daughters [[H1323]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the children [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and they shall sell [[H4376]] them to the Sabeans, [[H7615]] to [[H413]] a people [[H1471]] far off: [[H7350]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]]

### 9
Proclaim [[H7121]] ye this [[H2063]] among the Gentiles; [[H1471]] Prepare [[H6942]] war, [[H4421]] wake up [[H5782]] the mighty men, [[H1368]] let all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of war [[H4421]] draw near; [[H5066]] let them come up: [[H5927]]

### 10
Beat [[H3807]] your plowshares [[H855]] into swords, [[H2719]] and your pruninghooks [[H4211]] into spears: [[H7420]] let the weak [[H2523]] say, [[H559]] I [[H589]] strong. [[H1368]]

### 11
Assemble [[H5789]] yourselves, and come, [[H935]] all [[H3605]] ye heathen, [[H1471]] and gather yourselves together [[H6908]] round about: [[H5439]] thither [[H8033]] cause thy mighty ones [[H1368]] to come down, [[H5181]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
Let the heathen [[H1471]] be wakened, [[H5782]] and come up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the valley [[H6010]] of Jehoshaphat: [[H3092]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] will I sit [[H3427]] to judge [[H8199]] all [[H3605]] the heathen [[H1471]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 13
Put [[H7971]] ye in the sickle, [[H4038]] for [[H3588]] the harvest [[H7105]] is ripe: [[H1310]] come, [[H935]] get you down; [[H3381]] for [[H3588]] the press [[H1660]] is full, [[H4390]] the fats [[H3342]] overflow; [[H7783]] for [[H3588]] their wickedness [[H7451]] great. [[H7227]]

### 14
Multitudes, [[H1995]] multitudes [[H1995]] in the valley [[H6010]] of decision: [[H2742]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] near [[H7138]] in the valley [[H6010]] of decision. [[H2742]]

### 15
The sun [[H8121]] and the moon [[H3394]] shall be darkened, [[H6937]] and the stars [[H3556]] shall withdraw [[H622]] their shining. [[H5051]]

### 16
The Lord [[H3068]] also shall roar [[H7580]] out of Zion, [[H6726]] and utter [[H5414]] his voice [[H6963]] from Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] shall shake: [[H7493]] but the Lord [[H3068]] the hope [[H4268]] of his people, [[H5971]] and the strength [[H4581]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
So shall ye know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] dwelling [[H7931]] in Zion, [[H6726]] my holy [[H6944]] mountain: [[H2022]] then shall Jerusalem [[H3389]] be [[H1961]] holy, [[H6944]] and there shall no [[H3808]] strangers [[H2114]] pass through [[H5674]] her any more. [[H5674]]

### 18
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the mountains [[H2022]] shall drop down [[H5197]] new wine, [[H6071]] and the hills [[H1389]] shall flow [[H1980]] with milk, [[H2461]] and all [[H3605]] the rivers [[H650]] of Judah [[H3063]] shall flow [[H1980]] with waters, [[H4325]] and a fountain [[H4599]] shall come forth [[H3318]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and shall water [[H8248]] the valley [[H5158]] of Shittim. [[H7851]]

### 19
Egypt [[H4714]] shall be [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H8077]] and Edom [[H123]] shall be [[H1961]] a desolate [[H8077]] wilderness, [[H4057]] for the violence [[H2555]] the children [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] because [[H834]] they have shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] in their land. [[H776]]

### 20
But Judah [[H3063]] shall dwell [[H3427]] for ever, [[H5769]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]

### 21
For I will cleanse [[H5352]] their blood [[H1818]] I have not [[H3808]] cleansed: [[H5352]] for the Lord [[H3068]] dwelleth [[H7931]] in Zion. [[H6726]]
