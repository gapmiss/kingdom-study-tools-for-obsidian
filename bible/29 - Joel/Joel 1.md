### 2
Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] ye old men, [[H2205]] and give ear, [[H238]] all [[H3605]] ye inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land. [[H776]] Hath this [[H2063]] been [[H1961]] in your days, [[H3117]] or even [[H518]] in the days [[H3117]] of your fathers? [[H1]]

### 3
Tell [[H5608]] ye your children [[H1121]] of [[H5921]] it, and your children [[H1121]] their children, [[H1121]] and their children [[H1121]] another [[H312]] generation. [[H1755]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] a nation [[H1471]] is come up [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] my land, [[H776]] strong, [[H6099]] and without [[H369]] number, [[H4557]] whose teeth [[H8127]] the teeth [[H8127]] of a lion, [[H738]] and he hath the cheek teeth [[H4973]] of a great lion. [[H3833]]

Lament [[H421]] like a virgin [[H1330]] girded [[H2296]] with sackcloth [[H8242]] for [[H5921]] the husband [[H1167]] of her youth. [[H5271]]

### 9
The meat offering [[H4503]] and the drink offering [[H5262]] is cut off [[H3772]] from the house [[H1004]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] the priests, [[H3548]] the Lord's [[H3068]] ministers, [[H8334]] mourn. [[H56]]

### 10
The field [[H7704]] is wasted, [[H7703]] the land [[H127]] mourneth; [[H56]] for [[H3588]] the corn [[H1715]] is wasted: [[H7703]] the new wine [[H8492]] is dried up, [[H3001]] the oil [[H3323]] languisheth. [[H535]]

### 11
Be ye ashamed, [[H954]] O ye husbandmen; [[H406]] howl, [[H3213]] O ye vinedressers, [[H3755]] for [[H5921]] the wheat [[H2406]] and for [[H5921]] the barley; [[H8184]] because [[H3588]] the harvest [[H7105]] of the field [[H7704]] is perished. [[H6]]

Gird [[H2296]] yourselves, and lament, [[H5594]] ye priests: [[H3548]] howl, [[H3213]] ye ministers [[H8334]] of the altar: [[H4196]] come, [[H935]] lie all night [[H3885]] in sackcloth, [[H8242]] ye ministers [[H8334]] of my God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] the meat offering [[H4503]] and the drink offering [[H5262]] is withholden [[H4513]] from the house [[H1004]] of your God. [[H430]]

### 14
Sanctify [[H6942]] ye a fast, [[H6685]] call [[H7121]] a solemn assembly, [[H6116]] gather [[H622]] the elders [[H2205]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and cry [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 15
Alas [[H162]] for the day! [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] at hand, [[H7138]] and as a destruction [[H7701]] from the Almighty [[H7706]] shall it come. [[H935]]

### 16
Is not [[H3808]] the meat [[H400]] cut off [[H3772]] before [[H5048]] our eyes, [[H5869]] joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H1524]] from the house [[H1004]] of our God? [[H430]]

### 17
The seed [[H6507]] is rotten [[H5685]] under [[H8478]] their clods, [[H4053]] the garners [[H214]] are laid desolate, [[H8074]] the barns [[H4460]] are broken down; [[H2040]] for [[H3588]] the corn [[H1715]] is withered. [[H3001]]

### 18
How [[H4100]] do the beasts [[H929]] groan! [[H584]] the herds [[H5739]] of cattle [[H1241]] are perplexed, [[H943]] because [[H3588]] they have no [[H369]] pasture; [[H4829]] yea, [[H1571]] the flocks [[H5739]] of sheep [[H6629]] are made desolate. [[H816]]

### 19
O Lord, [[H3068]] to [[H413]] thee will I cry: [[H7121]] for [[H3588]] the fire [[H784]] hath devoured [[H398]] the pastures [[H4999]] of the wilderness, [[H4057]] and the flame [[H3852]] hath burned [[H3857]] all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 20
The beasts [[H929]] of the field [[H7704]] cry [[H6165]] also [[H1571]] unto [[H413]] thee: for [[H3588]] the rivers [[H650]] of waters [[H4325]] are dried up, [[H3001]] and the fire [[H784]] hath devoured [[H398]] the pastures [[H4999]] of the wilderness. [[H4057]]
