### 1
Blow [[H8628]] ye the trumpet [[H7782]] in Zion, [[H6726]] and sound an alarm [[H7321]] in my holy [[H6944]] mountain: [[H2022]] let all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] tremble: [[H7264]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] cometh, [[H935]] for [[H3588]] nigh at hand; [[H7138]]

### 2
A day [[H3117]] of darkness [[H2822]] and of gloominess, [[H653]] a day [[H3117]] of clouds [[H6051]] and of thick darkness, [[H6205]] as the morning [[H7837]] spread [[H6566]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains: [[H2022]] a great [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] and a strong; [[H6099]] there hath not [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] ever [[H5769]] the like, [[H3644]] neither [[H3808]] shall be any more [[H3254]] after [[H310]] it, to [[H5704]] the years [[H8141]] of many [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 3
A fire [[H784]] devoureth [[H398]] before [[H6440]] them; and behind [[H310]] them a flame [[H3852]] burneth: [[H3857]] the land [[H776]] as the garden [[H1588]] of Eden [[H5731]] before [[H6440]] them, and behind [[H310]] them a desolate [[H8077]] wilderness; [[H4057]] yea, [[H1571]] and nothing [[H3808]] shall escape [[H6413]] them. [[H1961]]

### 4
The appearance [[H4758]] of them as the appearance [[H4758]] of horses; [[H5483]] and as horsemen, [[H6571]] so [[H3651]] shall they run. [[H7323]]

### 5
Like the noise [[H6963]] of chariots [[H4818]] on [[H5921]] the tops [[H7218]] of mountains [[H2022]] shall they leap, [[H7540]] like the noise [[H6963]] of a flame [[H3851]] of fire [[H784]] that devoureth [[H398]] the stubble, [[H7179]] as a strong [[H6099]] people [[H5971]] set in battle [[H4421]] array. [[H6186]]

### 6
Before their face [[H6440]] the people [[H5971]] shall be much pained: [[H2342]] all [[H3605]] faces [[H6440]] shall gather [[H6908]] blackness. [[H6289]]

### 7
They shall run [[H7323]] like mighty men; [[H1368]] they shall climb [[H5927]] the wall [[H2346]] like men [[H376]] of war; [[H4421]] and they shall march [[H1980]] every one [[H376]] on his ways, [[H1870]] and they shall not [[H3808]] break [[H5670]] their ranks: [[H734]]

### 8
Neither [[H3808]] shall one [[H376]] thrust [[H1766]] another; [[H251]] they shall walk [[H1980]] every one [[H1397]] in his path: [[H4546]] and they fall [[H5307]] upon [[H1157]] the sword, [[H7973]] they shall not [[H3808]] be wounded. [[H1214]]

### 9
They shall run to and fro [[H8264]] in the city; [[H5892]] they shall run [[H7323]] upon the wall, [[H2346]] they shall climb up [[H5927]] upon the houses; [[H1004]] they shall enter in [[H935]] at [[H1157]] the windows [[H2474]] like a thief. [[H1590]]

### 10
The earth [[H776]] shall quake [[H7264]] before [[H6440]] them; the heavens [[H8064]] shall tremble: [[H7493]] the sun [[H8121]] and the moon [[H3394]] shall be dark, [[H6937]] and the stars [[H3556]] shall withdraw [[H622]] their shining: [[H5051]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall utter [[H5414]] his voice [[H6963]] before [[H6440]] his army: [[H2428]] for [[H3588]] his camp [[H4264]] very [[H3966]] great: [[H7227]] for [[H3588]] strong [[H6099]] that executeth [[H6213]] his word: [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] great [[H1419]] and very [[H3966]] terrible; [[H3372]] and who [[H4310]] can abide [[H3557]] it? [[H3557]]

### 12
Therefore also [[H1571]] now, [[H6258]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] turn [[H7725]] ye to [[H5704]] me with all [[H3605]] your heart, [[H3824]] and with fasting, [[H6685]] and with weeping, [[H1065]] and with mourning: [[H4553]]

### 13
And rend [[H7167]] your heart, [[H3824]] and not [[H408]] your garments, [[H899]] and turn [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] gracious [[H2587]] and merciful, [[H7349]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] and of great [[H7227]] kindness, [[H2617]] and repenteth [[H5162]] him of [[H5921]] the evil. [[H7451]]

### 14
Who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] he will return [[H7725]] and repent, [[H5162]] and leave [[H7604]] a blessing [[H1293]] behind [[H310]] him; a meat offering [[H4503]] and a drink offering [[H5262]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] your God? [[H430]]

### 15
Blow [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] in Zion, [[H6726]] sanctify [[H6942]] a fast, [[H6685]] call [[H7121]] a solemn assembly: [[H6116]]

### 16
Gather [[H622]] the people, [[H5971]] sanctify [[H6942]] the congregation, [[H6951]] assemble [[H6908]] the elders, [[H2205]] gather [[H622]] the children, [[H5768]] and those that suck [[H3243]] the breasts: [[H7699]] let the bridegroom [[H2860]] go forth [[H3318]] of his chamber, [[H2315]] and the bride [[H3618]] out of her closet. [[H2646]]

### 17
Let the priests, [[H3548]] the ministers [[H8334]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] weep [[H1058]] between [[H996]] the porch [[H197]] and the altar, [[H4196]] and let them say, [[H559]] Spare [[H2347]] thy people, [[H5971]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and give [[H5414]] not [[H408]] thine heritage [[H5159]] to reproach, [[H2781]] that the heathen [[H1471]] should rule over [[H4910]] them: wherefore [[H4100]] should they say [[H559]] among the people, [[H5971]] Where [[H346]] their God? [[H430]]

### 18
Then will the Lord [[H3068]] be jealous [[H7065]] for his land, [[H776]] and pity [[H2550]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 19
Yea, the Lord [[H3068]] will answer [[H6030]] and say [[H559]] unto his people, [[H5971]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]]  you [[H853]] corn, [[H1715]] and wine, [[H8492]] and oil, [[H3323]] and ye shall be satisfied [[H7646]] therewith: [[H854]] and I will no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] make [[H5414]] you a reproach [[H2781]] among the heathen: [[H1471]]

### 20
But I will remove far off [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] you the northern [[H6830]] and will drive [[H5080]] him into [[H413]] a land [[H776]] barren [[H6723]] and desolate, [[H8077]] with [[H854]] his face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the east [[H6931]] sea, [[H3220]] and his hinder part [[H5490]] toward [[H413]] the utmost [[H314]] sea, [[H3220]] and his stink [[H889]] shall come up, [[H5927]] and his ill savour [[H6709]] shall come up, [[H5927]] because [[H3588]] he hath done [[H6213]] great things. [[H1431]]

### 21
Fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] O land; [[H127]] be glad [[H1523]] and rejoice: [[H8055]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] great things. [[H1431]]

### 22
Be not afraid, [[H3372]] ye beasts [[H929]] of the field: [[H7704]] for [[H3588]] the pastures [[H4999]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] do spring, [[H1876]] for [[H3588]] the tree [[H6086]] beareth [[H5375]] her fruit, [[H6529]] the fig tree [[H8384]] and the vine [[H1612]] do yield [[H5414]] their strength. [[H2428]]

### 23
Be glad [[H1523]] then, ye children [[H1121]] of Zion, [[H6726]] and rejoice [[H8055]] in the Lord [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] he hath given [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] the former rain [[H4175]] moderately, [[H6666]] and he will cause to come down [[H3381]] for you the rain, [[H1653]] the former rain, [[H4175]] and the latter rain [[H4456]] in the first [[H7223]]

### 24
And the floors [[H1637]] shall be full [[H4390]] of wheat, [[H1250]] and the fats [[H3342]] shall overflow [[H7783]] with wine [[H8492]] and oil. [[H3323]]

### 25
And I will restore [[H7999]]  to you [[H853]] the years [[H8141]] that [[H834]] the locust [[H697]] hath eaten, [[H398]] the cankerworm, [[H3218]] and the caterpiller, [[H2625]] and the palmerworm, [[H1501]] my great [[H1419]] army [[H2428]] which [[H834]] I sent [[H7971]] among you. [[H7971]]

### 26
And ye shall eat [[H398]] in plenty, [[H398]] and be satisfied, [[H7646]] and praise [[H1984]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] that [[H834]] hath dealt [[H6213]] wondrously [[H6381]] with [[H5973]] you: and my people [[H5971]] shall never [[H5769]] be ashamed. [[H954]]

### 27
And ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] in the midst [[H7130]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and none [[H369]] else: [[H5750]] and my people [[H5971]] shall never [[H5769]] be ashamed. [[H954]]

### 28
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] afterward, [[H310]] I will pour out [[H8210]] my spirit [[H7307]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] flesh; [[H1320]] and your sons [[H1121]] and your daughters [[H1323]] shall prophesy, [[H5012]] your old men [[H2205]] shall dream [[H2492]] dreams, [[H2472]] your young men [[H970]] shall see [[H7200]] visions: [[H2384]]

### 29
And also [[H1571]] upon [[H5921]] the servants [[H5650]] and upon [[H5921]] the handmaids [[H8198]] in those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] will I pour out [[H8210]] my spirit. [[H7307]]

### 30
And I will shew [[H5414]] wonders [[H4159]] in the heavens [[H8064]] and in the earth, [[H776]] blood, [[H1818]] and fire, [[H784]] and pillars [[H8490]] of smoke. [[H6227]]

### 31
The sun [[H8121]] shall be turned [[H2015]] into darkness, [[H2822]] and the moon [[H3394]] into blood, [[H1818]] before [[H6440]] the great [[H1419]] and the terrible [[H3372]] day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] come. [[H935]]

### 32
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] whosoever [[H3605]] shall call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be delivered: [[H4422]] for [[H3588]] in mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] and in Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall be [[H1961]] deliverance, [[H6413]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said, [[H559]] and in the remnant [[H8300]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall call. [[H7121]]
