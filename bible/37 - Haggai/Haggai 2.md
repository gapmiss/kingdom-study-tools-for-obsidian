### 1
In the seventh [[H7637]] in the one [[H259]] and twentieth [[H6242]] of the month, [[H2320]] came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H3027]] the prophet [[H5030]] Haggai, [[H2292]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak [[H559]] now [[H4994]] to [[H413]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] the son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] governor [[H6346]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Josedech, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] and to [[H413]] the residue [[H7611]] of the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
Who [[H4310]] left [[H7604]] among you that [[H834]] saw [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] in her first [[H7223]] glory? [[H3519]] and how [[H4100]] do ye [[H859]] see [[H7200]] it now? [[H6258]] not [[H3808]] in your eyes [[H5869]] in comparison [[H3644]] of it as nothing? [[H3644]]

### 4
Yet now [[H6258]] be strong, [[H2388]] O Zerubbabel, [[H2216]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and be strong, [[H2388]] O Joshua, [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Josedech, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest; [[H3548]] and be strong, [[H2388]] all [[H3605]] ye people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and work: [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]]

### 5
the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I covenanted [[H3772]] with [[H854]] you when ye came out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] so my spirit [[H7307]] remaineth [[H5975]] among [[H8432]] you: fear [[H3372]] ye not. [[H3372]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Yet [[H5750]] once, [[H259]] it [[H1931]] a little while, [[H4592]] and I [[H589]] will shake [[H7493]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and the earth, [[H776]] and the sea, [[H3220]] and the dry [[H2724]]

### 7
And I will shake [[H7493]] all [[H3605]] nations, [[H1471]] and the desire [[H2532]] of all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] shall come: [[H935]] and I will fill [[H4390]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] with glory, [[H3519]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 8
The silver [[H3701]] mine, and the gold [[H2091]] mine, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 9
The glory [[H3519]] of this [[H2088]] latter [[H314]] house [[H1004]] shall be [[H1961]] greater than [[H1419]] of the former, [[H7223]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]] and in this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] will I give [[H5414]] peace, [[H7965]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 10
In the four [[H702]] and twentieth [[H6242]] of the ninth [[H8671]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Darius, [[H1867]] came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H413]] Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]]

### 11
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Ask [[H7592]] now [[H4994]] the priests [[H3548]] the law, [[H8451]] saying, [[H559]]

### 12
If [[H2005]] one [[H376]] bear [[H5375]] holy [[H6944]] flesh [[H1320]] in the skirt [[H3671]] of his garment, [[H899]] and with his skirt [[H3671]] do touch [[H5060]] bread, [[H3899]] or pottage, [[H5138]] or wine, [[H3196]] or oil, [[H8081]] or any [[H3605]] meat, [[H3978]] shall it be holy? [[H6942]] And the priests [[H3548]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] No. [[H559]]

### 13
Then said [[H559]] Haggai, [[H2292]] If [[H518]] unclean [[H2931]] by a dead body [[H5315]] touch [[H5060]] any [[H3605]] of these, [[H428]] shall it be unclean? [[H2930]] And the priests [[H3548]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] It shall be unclean. [[H2930]]

### 14
Then answered [[H6030]] Haggai, [[H2292]] and said, [[H559]] So [[H3651]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and so [[H3651]] this [[H2088]] nation [[H1471]] before [[H6440]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and so [[H3651]] every [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] of their hands; [[H3027]] and that which [[H834]] they offer [[H7126]] there [[H8033]] unclean. [[H2931]]

### 15
And now, [[H6258]] I pray you, [[H4994]] consider [[H7760]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] and upward, [[H4605]] from before [[H2962]] a stone [[H68]] was laid [[H7760]] upon [[H413]] a stone [[H68]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 16
Since those were, [[H1961]] when came [[H935]] to [[H413]] an heap [[H6194]] of twenty [[H6242]] there were [[H1961]] ten: [[H6235]] when came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the pressfat [[H3342]] for to draw out [[H2834]] fifty [[H2572]] out of the press, [[H6333]] there were [[H1961]] twenty. [[H6242]]

### 17
I smote [[H5221]] you with blasting [[H7711]] and with mildew [[H3420]] and with hail [[H1259]] in [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the labours [[H4639]] of your hands; [[H3027]] yet ye not [[H369]] to [[H413]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
Consider [[H7760]] now [[H4994]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] and upward, [[H4605]] from the four [[H702]] and twentieth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the ninth [[H8671]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] the foundation [[H3245]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] temple [[H1964]] was laid, consider [[H7760]]

### 19
Is the seed [[H2233]] yet [[H5750]] in the barn? [[H4035]] yea, as yet [[H5704]] the vine, [[H1612]] and the fig tree, [[H8384]] and the pomegranate, [[H7416]] and the olive [[H2132]] tree, [[H6086]] hath not [[H3808]] brought forth: [[H5375]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] will I bless [[H1288]]

### 20
And again [[H8145]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Haggai [[H2292]] in the four [[H702]] and twentieth [[H6242]] of the month, [[H2320]] saying, [[H559]]

### 21
Speak [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zerubbabel, [[H2216]] governor [[H6346]] of Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] I [[H589]] will shake [[H7493]] the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth; [[H776]]

### 22
And I will overthrow [[H2015]] the throne [[H3678]] of kingdoms, [[H4467]] and I will destroy [[H8045]] the strength [[H2392]] of the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the heathen; [[H1471]] and I will overthrow [[H2015]] the chariots, [[H4818]] and those that ride [[H7392]] in them; and the horses [[H5483]] and their riders [[H7392]] shall come down, [[H3381]] every one [[H376]] by the sword [[H2719]] of his brother. [[H251]]

### 23
In that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] will I take [[H3947]] thee, O Zerubbabel, [[H2216]] my servant, [[H5650]] the son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and will make [[H7760]] thee as a signet: [[H2368]] for [[H3588]] I have chosen [[H977]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts.
