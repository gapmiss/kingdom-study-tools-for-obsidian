In the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Darius [[H1867]] the king, [[H4428]] in the sixth [[H8345]] month, [[H2320]] in the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the month, [[H2320]] came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H3027]] Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet [[H5030]] unto [[H413]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] the son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] governor [[H6346]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Josedech, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] speaketh [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] The time [[H6256]] is not [[H3808]] come, [[H935]] the time [[H6256]] that the Lord's [[H3068]] house [[H1004]] should be built. [[H1129]]

### 3
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H3027]] Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying, [[H559]]

### 4
time [[H6256]] for you, O ye, [[H859]] to dwell [[H3427]] in your cieled [[H5603]] houses, [[H1004]] and this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] waste? [[H2720]]

### 5
Now [[H6258]] therefore thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Consider [[H7760]] your ways. [[H1870]]

### 6
Ye have sown [[H2232]] much, [[H7235]] and bring in [[H935]] little; [[H4592]] ye eat, [[H398]] but ye have not enough; [[H7654]] ye drink, [[H8354]] but ye are not filled with drink; [[H7937]] ye clothe [[H3847]] you, but there is none warm; [[H2527]] and he that earneth wages [[H7936]] earneth wages [[H7936]] into [[H413]] a bag [[H6872]] with holes. [[H5344]]

### 7
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] Consider [[H7760]] your ways. [[H1870]]

### 8
Go up [[H5927]] to the mountain, [[H2022]] and bring [[H935]] wood, [[H6086]] and build [[H1129]] the house; [[H1004]] and I will take pleasure [[H7521]] in it, and I will be glorified, [[H3513]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
Ye looked [[H6437]] for [[H413]] much, [[H7235]] and, lo, [[H2009]] to little; [[H4592]] and when ye brought [[H935]] home, [[H1004]] I did blow [[H5301]] upon it. Why? [[H3282]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]] Because [[H3282]] of mine house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] waste, [[H2720]] and ye [[H859]] run [[H7323]] every man [[H376]] unto his own house. [[H1004]]

### 10
Therefore [[H5921]] the heaven [[H8064]] over [[H5921]] you is stayed [[H3607]] from dew, [[H2919]] and the earth [[H776]] is stayed [[H3607]] her fruit. [[H2981]]

### 11
And I called [[H7121]] for a drought [[H2721]] upon [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]] and upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and upon [[H5921]] the corn, [[H1715]] and upon [[H5921]] the new wine, [[H8492]] and upon [[H5921]] the oil, [[H3323]] and upon [[H5921]] which [[H834]] the ground [[H127]] bringeth forth, [[H3318]] and upon [[H5921]] men, [[H120]] and upon [[H5921]] cattle, [[H929]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the labour [[H3018]] of the hands. [[H3709]]

### 12
Then Zerubbabel [[H2216]] the son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] and Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Josedech, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] with all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the people, [[H5971]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and the words [[H1697]] of Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet, [[H5030]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] had sent [[H7971]] him, and the people [[H5971]] did fear [[H3372]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
Then spake [[H559]] Haggai [[H2292]] the Lord's [[H3068]] messenger [[H4397]] in the Lord's [[H3068]] message [[H4400]] unto the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] you, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] stirred up [[H5782]] the spirit [[H7307]] of Zerubbabel [[H2216]] the son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] governor [[H6346]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the spirit [[H7307]] of Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Josedech, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] and the spirit [[H7307]] of all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the people; [[H5971]] and they came [[H935]] and did [[H6213]] work [[H4399]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] their God, [[H430]]

### 15
In the four [[H702]] and twentieth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the sixth [[H8345]] month, [[H2320]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of Darius [[H1867]] the king. [[H4428]]
