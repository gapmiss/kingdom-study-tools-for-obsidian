### 1
Now the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jonah [[H3124]] the son [[H1121]] of Amittai, [[H573]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Arise, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Nineveh, [[H5210]] that great [[H1419]] city, [[H5892]] and cry [[H7121]] against [[H5921]] it; for [[H3588]] their wickedness [[H7451]] is come up [[H5927]] before [[H6440]] me. [[H6440]]

### 3
But Jonah [[H3124]] rose up [[H6965]] to flee [[H1272]] unto Tarshish [[H8659]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and went down [[H3381]] to Joppa; [[H3305]] and he found [[H4672]] a ship [[H591]] going [[H935]] to Tarshish: [[H8659]] so he paid [[H5414]] the fare [[H7939]] thereof, and went down [[H3381]] into it, to go [[H935]] with [[H5973]] them unto Tarshish [[H8659]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
But the Lord [[H3068]] sent out [[H2904]] a great [[H1419]] wind [[H7307]] into [[H413]] the sea, [[H3220]] and there was [[H1961]] a mighty [[H1419]] tempest [[H5591]] in the sea, [[H3220]] so that the ship [[H591]] was like [[H2803]] to be broken. [[H7665]]

### 5
Then the mariners [[H4419]] were afraid, [[H3372]] and cried [[H2199]] every man [[H376]] unto [[H413]] his god, [[H430]] and cast forth [[H2904]] the wares [[H3627]] that [[H834]] in the ship [[H591]] into [[H413]] the sea, [[H3220]] to lighten [[H7043]] of [[H5921]] them. But Jonah [[H3124]] was gone down [[H3381]] into [[H413]] the sides [[H3411]] of the ship; [[H5600]] and he lay, [[H7901]] and was fast asleep. [[H7290]]

### 6
So the shipmaster [[H7227]] came [[H7126]] to [[H413]] him, and said [[H559]] unto him, What [[H4100]] meanest thou, O sleeper? [[H7290]] arise, [[H6965]] call [[H7121]] upon [[H413]] thy God, [[H430]] if so be [[H194]] that God [[H430]] will think [[H6245]] upon us, that we perish [[H6]] not. [[H6]]

### 7
And they said [[H559]] every one [[H376]] to [[H413]] his fellow, [[H7453]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us cast [[H5307]] lots, [[H1486]] that we may know [[H3045]] for whose cause [[H7945]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] upon us. So they cast [[H5307]] lots, [[H1486]] and the lot [[H1486]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] Jonah. [[H3124]]

### 8
Then said [[H559]] they unto [[H413]] him, Tell [[H5046]] us, we pray thee, [[H4994]] for whose cause [[H834]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] upon us; What [[H4100]] thine occupation? [[H4399]] and whence [[H370]] comest [[H935]] thou? what [[H4100]] thy country? [[H776]] and of what [[H335]] people [[H5971]] thou? [[H5971]]

### 9
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I [[H595]] an Hebrew; [[H5680]] and I [[H589]] fear [[H3373]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] which [[H834]] hath made [[H6213]] the sea [[H3220]] and the dry [[H3004]]

### 10
Then were the men [[H582]] exceedingly [[H1419]] afraid, [[H3372]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Why [[H4100]] hast thou done [[H6213]] this? [[H2063]] For [[H3588]] the men [[H582]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] fled [[H1272]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] he had told them. [[H5046]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] they unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] unto thee, that the sea [[H3220]] may be calm [[H8367]] unto [[H5921]] us? for [[H3588]] the sea [[H3220]] wrought, [[H1980]] and was tempestuous. [[H5590]]

### 12
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Take me up, [[H5375]] and cast me forth [[H2904]] into [[H413]] the sea; [[H3220]] so shall the sea [[H3220]] be calm [[H8367]] unto [[H5921]] you: for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] for my sake [[H7945]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] tempest [[H5591]] upon [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 13
Nevertheless the men [[H582]] rowed hard [[H2864]] to bring [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land; [[H3004]] but they could [[H3201]] not: [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] the sea [[H3220]] wrought, [[H1980]] and was tempestuous [[H5590]] against [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 14
Wherefore they cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] We beseech thee, [[H577]] O Lord, [[H3068]] we beseech thee, [[H4994]] let us not [[H408]] perish [[H6]] for this [[H2088]] man's [[H376]] life, [[H5315]] and lay [[H5414]] not [[H408]] upon [[H5921]] us innocent [[H5355]] blood: [[H1818]] for [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] hast done [[H6213]] as [[H834]] it pleased thee. [[H2654]]

### 15
So they took up [[H5375]] Jonah, [[H3124]] and cast him forth [[H2904]] into [[H413]] the sea: [[H3220]] and the sea [[H3220]] ceased [[H5975]] from her raging. [[H2197]]

### 16
Then the men [[H376]] feared [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] exceedingly, [[H1419]] and offered [[H2076]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and made [[H5087]] vows. [[H5088]]

### 17
Now the Lord [[H3068]] had prepared [[H4487]] a great [[H1419]] fish [[H1709]] to swallow up [[H1104]] Jonah. [[H3124]] And Jonah [[H3124]] was [[H1961]] in the belly [[H4578]] of the fish [[H1709]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] and three [[H7969]] nights. [[H3915]]
