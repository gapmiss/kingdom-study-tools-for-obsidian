### 1
Then Jonah [[H3124]] prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] out of the fish's [[H1710]] belly, [[H4578]]

### 2
And said, [[H559]] I cried [[H7121]] by reason of mine affliction [[H6869]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he heard [[H6030]] me; out of the belly [[H990]] of hell [[H7585]] cried [[H7768]] I, thou heardest [[H8085]] my voice. [[H6963]]

### 3
For thou hadst cast [[H7993]] me into the deep, [[H4688]] in the midst [[H3824]] of the seas; [[H3220]] and the floods [[H5104]] compassed [[H5437]] me about: all [[H3605]] thy billows [[H4867]] and thy waves [[H1530]] passed [[H5674]] over [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 4
Then I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] I am cast out [[H1644]] of [[H5048]] thy sight; [[H5869]] yet [[H389]] I will look [[H5027]] again [[H3254]] toward [[H413]] thy holy [[H6944]] temple. [[H1964]]

### 5
The waters [[H4325]] compassed me about, [[H661]] to [[H5704]] the soul: [[H5315]] the depth [[H8415]] closed me round about, [[H5437]] the weeds [[H5488]] were wrapped about [[H2280]] my head. [[H7218]]

### 6
I went down [[H3381]] to the bottoms [[H7095]] of the mountains; [[H2022]] the earth [[H776]] with her bars [[H1280]] about [[H1157]] me for ever: [[H5769]] yet hast thou brought up [[H5927]] my life [[H2416]] from corruption, [[H7845]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God. [[H430]]

### 7
When my soul [[H5315]] fainted [[H5848]] within [[H5921]] me I remembered [[H2142]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and my prayer [[H8605]] came in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, into [[H413]] thine holy [[H6944]] temple. [[H1964]]

### 8
They that observe [[H8104]] lying [[H7723]] vanities [[H1892]] forsake [[H5800]] their own mercy. [[H2617]]

### 9
But I [[H589]] will sacrifice [[H2076]] unto thee with the voice [[H6963]] of thanksgiving; [[H8426]] I will pay [[H7999]] that [[H834]] I have vowed. [[H5087]] Salvation [[H3444]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto the fish, [[H1709]] and it vomited out [[H6958]] Jonah [[H3124]] upon [[H413]] the dry [[H3004]]
