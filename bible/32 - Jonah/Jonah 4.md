### 1
But it displeased [[H7489]] Jonah [[H3124]] exceedingly, [[H1419]] and he was very angry. [[H2734]]

### 2
And he prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] I pray thee, [[H577]] O Lord, [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] my saying, [[H1697]] when I was [[H1961]] yet [[H5704]] in [[H5921]] my country? [[H127]] Therefore [[H5921]] I fled [[H1272]] before [[H6923]] unto Tarshish: [[H8659]] for [[H3588]] I knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a gracious [[H2587]] God, [[H410]] and merciful, [[H7349]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] and of great [[H7227]] kindness, [[H2617]] and repentest [[H5162]] thee of [[H5921]] the evil. [[H7451]]

### 3
Therefore now, [[H6258]] O Lord, [[H3068]] take, [[H3947]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] my life [[H5315]] from [[H4480]] me; for [[H3588]] better [[H2896]] for me to die [[H4194]] than to live. [[H2416]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Doest thou well [[H3190]] to be angry? [[H2734]]

### 5
So Jonah [[H3124]] went out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] and sat [[H3427]] on the east side [[H6924]] of the city, [[H5892]] and there [[H8033]] made [[H6213]] him a booth, [[H5521]] and sat [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] it in the shadow, [[H6738]] till [[H5704]] he might see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] would become [[H1961]] of the city. [[H5892]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] prepared [[H4487]] a gourd, [[H7021]] and made to come up [[H5927]] over [[H5921]] Jonah, [[H3124]] that it might be [[H1961]] a shadow [[H6738]] over [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] to deliver [[H5337]] him from his grief. [[H7451]] So Jonah [[H3124]] was [[H8055]] exceeding [[H1419]] glad [[H8057]] of [[H5921]] the gourd. [[H7021]]

### 7
But God [[H430]] prepared [[H4487]] a worm [[H8438]] when the morning [[H7837]] rose [[H5927]] the next day, [[H4283]] and it smote [[H5221]] the gourd [[H7021]] that it withered. [[H3001]]

### 8
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the sun [[H8121]] did arise, [[H2224]] that God [[H430]] prepared [[H4487]] a vehement [[H2759]] east [[H6921]] wind; [[H7307]] and the sun [[H8121]] beat [[H5221]] upon [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of Jonah, [[H3124]] that he fainted, [[H5968]] and wished [[H7592]] in [[H853]] himself [[H5315]] to die, [[H4191]] and said, [[H559]] better [[H2896]] for me to die [[H4194]] than to live. [[H2416]]

### 9
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jonah, [[H3124]] Doest thou well [[H3190]] to be angry [[H2734]] for [[H5921]] the gourd? [[H7021]] And he said, [[H559]] I do well [[H3190]] to be angry, [[H2734]] unto [[H5704]] death. [[H4194]]

### 10
Then said [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Thou [[H859]] hast had pity [[H2347]] on [[H5921]] the gourd, [[H7021]] for the which [[H834]] thou hast not [[H3808]] laboured, [[H5998]] neither [[H3808]] madest it grow; [[H1431]] which came up [[H1961]] in a night, [[H3915]] and perished [[H6]] in a night: [[H3915]]

### 11
And should not [[H3808]] I [[H589]] spare [[H2347]] Nineveh, [[H5210]] that great [[H1419]] city, [[H5892]] wherein [[H834]] are [[H3426]] more than [[H7235]] sixscore [[H8147]] thousand [[H7239]] persons [[H120]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] discern [[H3045]] between [[H996]] their right hand [[H3225]] and their left hand; [[H8040]] and much [[H7227]] cattle?
