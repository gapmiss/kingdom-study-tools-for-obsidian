And the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] unto [[H413]] Jonah [[H3124]] the second time, [[H8145]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Arise, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] Nineveh, [[H5210]] that great [[H1419]] city, [[H5892]] and preach [[H7121]] unto [[H413]]  it [[H853]] the preaching [[H7150]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] bid [[H1696]] thee. [[H413]]

### 3
So Jonah [[H3124]] arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] Nineveh, [[H5210]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]] Now Nineveh [[H5210]] was [[H1961]] an exceeding [[H430]] great [[H1419]] city [[H5892]] of three [[H7969]] days' [[H3117]] journey. [[H4109]]

### 4
And Jonah [[H3124]] began [[H2490]] to enter [[H935]] into the city [[H5892]] a [[H259]] day's [[H3117]] journey, [[H4109]] and he cried, [[H7121]] and said, [[H559]] Yet [[H5750]] forty [[H705]] days, [[H3117]] and Nineveh [[H5210]] shall be overthrown. [[H2015]]

### 5
So the people [[H376]] of Nineveh [[H5210]] believed [[H539]] God, [[H430]] and proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast, [[H6685]] and put on [[H3847]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] from the greatest [[H1419]] of them even to [[H5704]] the least [[H6996]] of them. [[H6996]]

### 6
For word [[H1697]] came [[H5060]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Nineveh, [[H5210]] and he arose [[H6965]] from his throne, [[H3678]] and he laid [[H5674]] his robe [[H155]] from [[H5921]] him, and covered [[H3680]] with sackcloth, [[H8242]] and sat [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] ashes. [[H665]]

### 7
And he caused to be proclaimed [[H2199]] and published [[H559]] through Nineveh [[H5210]] by the decree [[H2940]] of the king [[H4428]] and his nobles, [[H1419]] saying, [[H559]] Let neither [[H408]] man [[H120]] nor beast, [[H929]] herd [[H1241]] nor flock, [[H6629]] taste [[H2938]] any thing: [[H3972]] let them not [[H408]] feed, [[H7462]] nor [[H408]] drink [[H8354]] water: [[H4325]]

### 8
But let man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] be covered [[H3680]] with sackcloth, [[H8242]] and cry [[H7121]] mightily [[H2394]] unto [[H413]] God: [[H430]] yea, let them turn [[H7725]] every one [[H376]] from his evil [[H7451]] way, [[H1870]] and from [[H4480]] the violence [[H2555]] that [[H834]] in their hands. [[H3709]]

### 9
Who [[H4310]] can tell [[H3045]] God [[H430]] will turn [[H7725]] and repent, [[H5162]] and turn away [[H7725]] from his fierce [[H2740]] anger, [[H639]] that we perish [[H6]] not? [[H6]]

### 10
And God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] their works, [[H4639]] that [[H3588]] they turned [[H7725]] from their evil [[H7451]] way; [[H1870]] and God [[H430]] repented [[H5162]] of [[H5921]] the evil, [[H7451]] that [[H834]] he had said [[H1696]] that he would do [[H6213]] unto them; and he did [[H6213]] not.
