# Isaiah 58

[[Isaiah 57|←]] • [[Isaiah 59|→]]

---

### 1
Cry [[H7121]] aloud, [[H1627]] spare [[H2820]] not, [[H408]] lift up [[H7311]] thy voice [[H6963]] like a trumpet, [[H7782]] and shew [[H5046]] my people [[H5971]] their transgression, [[H6588]] and the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] their sins. [[H2403]]

### 2
Yet they seek [[H1875]] me daily, [[H3117]] and delight [[H2654]] to know [[H1847]] my ways, [[H1870]] as a nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] did [[H6213]] righteousness, [[H6666]] and forsook [[H5800]] not [[H3808]] the ordinance [[H4941]] of their God: [[H430]] they ask [[H7592]] of me the ordinances [[H4941]] of justice; [[H6664]] they take delight [[H2654]] in approaching [[H7132]] to God. [[H430]]

### 3
Wherefore [[H4100]] have we fasted, [[H6684]] and thou seest [[H7200]] not? [[H3808]] have we afflicted [[H6031]] our soul, [[H5315]] and thou takest no knowledge? [[H3045]] Behold, [[H2005]] in the day [[H3117]] of your fast [[H6685]] ye find [[H4672]] pleasure, [[H2656]] and exact [[H5065]] all [[H3605]] your labours. [[H6092]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2005]] ye fast [[H6684]] for strife [[H7379]] and debate, [[H4683]] and to smite [[H5221]] with the fist [[H106]] of wickedness: [[H7562]] ye shall not [[H3808]] fast [[H6684]] as day, [[H3117]] to make your voice [[H6963]] to be heard [[H8085]] on high. [[H4791]]

### 5
Is [[H1961]] it such [[H2088]] a fast [[H6685]] that I have chosen? [[H977]] a day [[H3117]] for a man [[H120]] to afflict [[H6031]] his soul? [[H5315]] to bow down [[H3721]] his head [[H7218]] as a bulrush, [[H100]] and to spread [[H3331]] sackcloth [[H8242]] and ashes [[H665]] wilt thou call [[H7121]] this [[H2088]] a fast, [[H6685]] and an acceptable [[H7522]] day [[H3117]] to the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 6
not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] the fast [[H6685]] that I have chosen? [[H977]] to loose [[H6605]] the bands [[H2784]] of wickedness, [[H7562]] to undo [[H5425]] the heavy [[H4133]] burdens, [[H92]] and to let the oppressed [[H7533]] go [[H7971]] free, [[H2670]] and that ye break [[H5423]] every [[H3605]] yoke? [[H4133]]

### 7
not [[H3808]] to deal [[H6536]] thy bread [[H3899]] to the hungry, [[H7457]] and that thou bring [[H935]] the poor [[H6041]] that are cast out [[H4788]] to thy house? [[H1004]] when [[H3588]] thou seest [[H7200]] the naked, [[H6174]] that thou cover [[H3680]] him; and that thou hide [[H5956]]  not thyself [[H3808]] from thine own flesh? [[H1320]]

### 8
Then [[H227]] shall thy light [[H216]] break forth [[H1234]] as the morning, [[H7837]] and thine health [[H724]] shall spring forth [[H6779]] speedily: [[H4120]] and thy righteousness [[H6664]] shall go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee; the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be thy rereward. [[H622]]

### 9
Then [[H227]] shalt thou call, [[H7121]] and the Lord [[H3068]] shall answer; [[H6030]] thou shalt cry, [[H7768]] and he shall say, [[H559]] Here [[H2005]] I If [[H518]] thou take away [[H5493]] from the midst [[H8432]] of thee the yoke, [[H4133]] the putting forth [[H7971]] of the finger, [[H676]] and speaking [[H1696]] vanity; [[H205]]

### 10
And thou draw out [[H6329]] thy soul [[H5315]] to the hungry, [[H7457]] and satisfy [[H7646]] the afflicted [[H6031]] soul; [[H5315]] then shall thy light [[H216]] rise [[H2224]] in obscurity, [[H2822]] and thy darkness [[H653]] as the noonday: [[H6672]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall guide [[H5148]] thee continually, [[H8548]] and satisfy [[H7646]] thy soul [[H5315]] in drought, [[H6710]] and make fat [[H2502]] thy bones: [[H6106]] and thou shalt be [[H1961]] like a watered [[H7302]] garden, [[H1588]] and like a spring [[H4161]] of water, [[H4325]] whose [[H834]] waters [[H4325]] fail [[H3576]] not. [[H3576]]

### 12
And of [[H4480]] thee shall build [[H1129]] the old [[H5769]] waste places: [[H2723]] thou shalt raise up [[H6965]] the foundations [[H4146]] of many [[H1755]] generations; [[H1755]] and thou shalt be called, [[H7121]] The repairer [[H1443]] of the breach, [[H6556]] The restorer [[H7725]] of paths [[H5410]] to dwell in. [[H3427]]

### 13
If [[H518]] thou turn away [[H7725]] thy foot [[H7272]] from the sabbath, [[H7676]] doing [[H6213]] thy pleasure [[H2656]] on my holy [[H6944]] day; [[H3117]] and call [[H7121]] the sabbath [[H7676]] a delight, [[H6027]] the holy [[H6918]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] honourable; [[H3513]] and shalt honour [[H3513]] him, not doing [[H6213]] thine own ways, [[H1870]] nor finding [[H4672]] thine own pleasure, [[H2656]] nor speaking [[H1696]] words: [[H1697]]

### 14
Then [[H227]] shalt thou delight thyself [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and I will cause thee to ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] the high places [[H1116]] of the earth, [[H776]] and feed [[H398]] thee with the heritage [[H5159]] of Jacob [[H3290]] thy father: [[H1]] for [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]]
