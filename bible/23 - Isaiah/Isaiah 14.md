[[Isaiah 13|←]] • [[Isaiah 15|→]]

### 1
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will have mercy [[H7355]]  on [[H853]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and will yet [[H5750]] choose [[H977]] Israel, [[H3478]] and set [[H3240]] them in [[H5921]] their own land: [[H127]] and the strangers [[H1616]] shall be joined [[H3867]] with [[H5921]] them, and they shall cleave [[H5596]] to [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 2
And the people [[H5971]] shall take [[H3947]] them, and bring [[H935]] them to [[H413]] their place: [[H4725]] and the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall possess [[H5157]] them in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of the Lord [[H3068]] for servants [[H5650]] and handmaids: [[H8198]] and they shall take [[H1961]] them captives, [[H7617]] whose captives [[H7617]] they were; and they shall rule over [[H7287]] their oppressors. [[H5065]]

### 3
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in the day [[H3117]] that the Lord [[H3068]] shall give thee rest [[H5117]] from thy sorrow, [[H6090]] and from thy fear, [[H7267]] and from [[H4480]] the hard [[H7186]] bondage [[H5656]] wherein [[H834]] thou wast made to serve, [[H5647]]

### 4
That thou shalt take up [[H5375]] this [[H2088]] proverb [[H4912]] against [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and say, [[H559]] How [[H349]] hath the oppressor [[H5065]] ceased! [[H7673]] the golden city [[H4062]] ceased! [[H7673]]

### 5
The Lord [[H3068]] hath broken [[H7665]] the staff [[H4294]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] the sceptre [[H7626]] of the rulers. [[H4910]]

### 6
He who smote [[H5221]] the people [[H5971]] in wrath [[H5678]] with a continual [[H1115]] stroke, [[H4347]] he that ruled [[H7287]] the nations [[H1471]] in anger, [[H639]] is persecuted, [[H4783]] none [[H1097]] hindereth. [[H2820]]

### 7
The whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] is at rest, [[H5117]] is quiet: [[H8252]] they break forth [[H6476]] into singing. [[H7440]]

### 8
Yea, [[H1571]] the fir trees [[H1265]] rejoice [[H8055]] at thee, the cedars [[H730]] of Lebanon, [[H3844]] Since [[H227]] thou art laid down, [[H7901]] no [[H3808]] feller [[H3772]] is come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 9
Hell [[H7585]] from beneath [[H8478]] is moved [[H7264]] for thee to meet [[H7125]] at thy coming: [[H935]] it stirreth up [[H5782]] the dead [[H7496]] for thee, all [[H3605]] the chief ones [[H6260]] of the earth; [[H776]] it hath raised up [[H6965]] from their thrones [[H3678]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the nations. [[H1471]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] they shall speak [[H6030]] and say [[H559]] unto thee, Art thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] become weak [[H2470]] as we? art thou become like [[H4911]] unto [[H413]] us? [[H413]]

### 11
Thy pomp [[H1347]] is brought down [[H3381]] to the grave, [[H7585]] the noise [[H1998]] of thy viols: [[H5035]] the worm [[H7415]] is spread [[H3331]] under [[H8478]] thee, and the worms [[H8438]] cover [[H4374]] thee. [[H4374]]

### 12
How [[H349]] art thou fallen [[H5307]] from heaven, [[H8064]] O Lucifer, [[H1966]] son [[H1121]] of the morning! [[H7837]] art thou cut down [[H1438]] to the ground, [[H776]] which didst weaken [[H2522]] the nations! [[H1471]]

### 13
For thou [[H859]] hast said [[H559]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] I will ascend [[H5927]] into heaven, [[H8064]] I will exalt [[H7311]] my throne [[H3678]] above [[H4605]] the stars [[H3556]] of God: [[H410]] I will sit [[H3427]] also upon the mount [[H2022]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] in the sides [[H3411]] of the north: [[H6828]]

### 14
I will ascend [[H5927]] above [[H5921]] the heights [[H1116]] of the clouds; [[H5645]] I will be like [[H1819]] the most High. [[H5945]]

### 15
Yet [[H389]] thou shalt be brought down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] hell, [[H7585]] to [[H413]] the sides [[H3411]] of the pit. [[H953]]

### 16
They that see [[H7200]] thee shall narrowly look [[H7688]] upon [[H413]] thee, consider [[H995]] thee, this [[H2088]] the man [[H376]] that made the earth [[H776]] to tremble, [[H7264]] that did shake [[H7493]] kingdoms; [[H4467]]

### 17
made [[H7760]] the world [[H8398]] as a wilderness, [[H4057]] and destroyed [[H2040]] the cities [[H5892]] thereof; opened [[H6605]] not [[H3808]] the house [[H1004]] of his prisoners? [[H615]]

### 18
All [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the nations, [[H1471]] all [[H3605]] of them, lie [[H7901]] in glory, [[H3519]] every one [[H376]] in his own house. [[H1004]]

### 19
But thou [[H859]] art cast out [[H7993]] of thy grave [[H6913]] like an abominable [[H8581]] branch, [[H5342]] the raiment [[H3830]] of those that are slain, [[H2026]] thrust through [[H2944]] with a sword, [[H2719]] that go down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the stones [[H68]] of the pit; [[H953]] as a carcase [[H6297]] trodden under feet. [[H947]]

### 20
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] be joined [[H3161]] with [[H854]] them in burial, [[H6900]] because [[H3588]] thou hast destroyed [[H7843]] thy land, [[H776]] slain [[H2026]] thy people: [[H5971]] the seed [[H2233]] of evildoers [[H7489]] shall never [[H5769]] be renowned. [[H7121]]

### 21
Prepare [[H3559]] slaughter [[H4293]] for his children [[H1121]] for the iniquity [[H5771]] of their fathers; [[H1]] that they do not [[H1077]] rise, [[H6965]] nor possess [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] nor fill [[H4390]] the face [[H6440]] of the world [[H8398]] with cities. [[H6145]]

### 22
For I will rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and cut off [[H3772]] from Babylon [[H894]] the name, [[H8034]] and remnant, [[H7605]] and son, [[H5209]] and nephew, [[H5220]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
I will also make [[H7760]] it a possession [[H4180]] for the bittern, [[H7090]] and pools [[H98]] of water: [[H4325]] and I will sweep [[H2894]] it with the besom [[H4292]] of destruction, [[H8045]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 24
The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath sworn, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] Surely [[H518]] as [[H834]] I have thought, [[H1819]] so [[H3651]] shall it come to pass; [[H1961]] and as [[H834]] I have purposed, [[H3289]] shall it [[H1931]] stand: [[H6965]]

### 25
That I will break [[H7665]] the Assyrian [[H804]] in my land, [[H776]] and upon [[H5921]] my mountains [[H2022]] tread him under foot: [[H947]] then shall his yoke [[H5923]] depart [[H5493]] from off [[H5921]] them, and his burden [[H5448]] depart [[H5493]] from off [[H5921]] their shoulders. [[H7926]]

### 26
This [[H2063]] the purpose [[H6098]] that is purposed [[H6098]] upon [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] earth: [[H776]] and this [[H2063]] the hand [[H3027]] that is stretched out [[H5186]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations. [[H1471]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath purposed, [[H3289]] and who [[H4310]] shall disannul [[H6565]] and his hand [[H3027]] stretched out, [[H5186]] and who [[H4310]] shall turn it back? [[H7725]]

### 28
In the year [[H8141]] that king [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] died [[H4194]] was [[H1961]] this [[H2088]] burden. [[H4853]]

### 29
Rejoice [[H8055]] not [[H408]] thou, whole [[H3605]] Palestina, [[H6429]] because [[H3588]] the rod [[H7626]] of him that [[H3588]] smote [[H5221]] thee is broken: [[H7665]] for out of the serpent's [[H5175]] root [[H8328]] shall come forth [[H3318]] a cockatrice, [[H6848]] and his fruit [[H6529]] a fiery flying [[H5774]] serpent. [[H8314]]

### 30
And the firstborn [[H1060]] of the poor [[H1800]] shall feed, [[H7462]] and the needy [[H34]] shall lie down [[H7257]] in safety: [[H983]] and I will kill [[H4191]] thy root [[H8328]] with famine, [[H7458]] and he shall slay [[H2026]] thy remnant. [[H7611]]

### 31
Howl, [[H3213]] O gate; [[H8179]] cry, [[H2199]] O city; [[H5892]] thou, whole [[H3605]] Palestina, [[H6429]] dissolved: [[H4127]] for [[H3588]] there shall come [[H935]] from the north [[H6828]] a smoke, [[H6227]] and none [[H369]] alone [[H909]] in his appointed times. [[H4151]]

### 32
What [[H4100]] shall then answer [[H6030]] the messengers [[H4397]] of the nation? [[H1471]] That [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath founded [[H3245]] Zion, [[H6726]] and the poor [[H6041]] of his people [[H5971]] shall trust [[H2620]] in it. [[H2620]]
