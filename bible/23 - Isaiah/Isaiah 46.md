### 1
Bel [[H1078]] boweth down, [[H3766]] Nebo [[H5015]] stoopeth, [[H7164]] their idols [[H6091]] were [[H1961]] upon the beasts, [[H2416]] and upon the cattle: [[H929]] your carriages [[H5385]] heavy loaden; [[H6006]] a burden [[H4853]] to the weary [[H5889]]

### 2
They stoop, [[H7164]] they bow down [[H3766]] together; [[H3162]] they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] deliver [[H4422]] the burden, [[H4853]] but themselves [[H5315]] are gone [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]]

### 3
Hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, O house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which are borne [[H6006]] from [[H4480]] the belly, [[H990]] which are carried [[H5375]] from [[H4480]] the womb: [[H7356]]

### 4
And to [[H5704]] old age [[H2209]] I [[H589]] he; [[H1931]] and to [[H5704]] hoar hairs [[H7872]] will I [[H589]] carry [[H5445]] I [[H589]] have made, [[H6213]] and I [[H589]] will bear; [[H5375]] even I [[H589]] will carry, [[H5445]] and will deliver [[H4422]]

### 5
To whom [[H4310]] will ye liken [[H1819]] me, and make equal, [[H7737]] and compare [[H4911]] me, that we may be like? [[H1819]]

### 6
They lavish [[H2107]] gold [[H2091]] out of the bag, [[H3599]] and weigh [[H8254]] silver [[H3701]] in the balance, [[H7070]] hire [[H7936]] a goldsmith; [[H6884]] and he maketh [[H6213]] it a god: [[H410]] they fall down, [[H5456]] yea, [[H637]] they worship. [[H7812]]

### 7
They bear him [[H5375]] upon [[H5921]] the shoulder, [[H3802]] they carry him, [[H5445]] and set [[H3240]] him in his place, [[H8478]] and he standeth; [[H5975]] from his place [[H4725]] shall he not [[H3808]] remove: [[H4185]] yea, [[H637]] shall cry [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] him, yet can he not [[H3808]] answer, [[H6030]] nor [[H3808]] save [[H3467]] him out of his trouble. [[H6869]]

### 8
Remember [[H2142]] this, [[H2063]] and shew yourselves men: [[H377]] bring again [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] mind, [[H3820]] O ye transgressors. [[H6586]]

### 9
Remember [[H2142]] the former things [[H7223]] of old: [[H5769]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] God, [[H410]] and none [[H369]] else; [[H5750]] God, [[H430]] and none [[H657]] like me, [[H3644]]

### 10
Declaring [[H5046]] the end [[H319]] from the beginning, [[H7225]] and from ancient times [[H6924]] that [[H834]] are not [[H3808]] done, [[H6213]] saying, [[H559]] My counsel [[H6098]] shall stand, [[H6965]] and I will do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] my pleasure: [[H2656]]

### 11
Calling [[H7121]] a ravenous bird [[H5861]] from the east, [[H4217]] the man [[H376]] that executeth my counsel [[H6098]] from a far [[H4801]] country: [[H776]] yea, [[H637]] I have spoken [[H1696]] I will also [[H637]] bring [[H935]] it to pass; I have purposed [[H3335]] I will also [[H637]] do [[H6213]] it. [[H6213]]

### 12
Hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, ye stouthearted, [[H47]] that far from [[H7350]] righteousness: [[H6666]]

### 13
I bring near [[H7126]] my righteousness; [[H6666]] it shall not [[H3808]] be far off, [[H7368]] and my salvation [[H8668]] shall not [[H3808]] tarry: [[H309]] and I will place [[H5414]] salvation [[H8668]] in Zion [[H6726]] for Israel [[H3478]] my glory. [[H8597]]
