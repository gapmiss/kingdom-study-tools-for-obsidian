### 1
Yet now [[H6258]] hear, [[H8085]] O Jacob [[H3290]] my servant; [[H5650]] and Israel, [[H3478]] whom I have chosen: [[H977]]

### 2
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] that made [[H6213]] thee, and formed [[H3335]] thee from the womb, [[H990]] will help [[H5826]] thee; Fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] my servant; [[H5650]] and thou, Jesurun, [[H3484]] whom I have chosen. [[H977]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] I will pour [[H3332]] water [[H4325]] upon [[H5921]] him that is thirsty, [[H6771]] and floods [[H5140]] upon [[H5921]] the dry ground: [[H3004]] I will pour [[H3332]] my spirit [[H7307]] upon [[H5921]] thy seed, [[H2233]] and my blessing [[H1293]] upon [[H5921]] thine offspring: [[H6631]]

### 4
And they shall spring up [[H6779]] among [[H996]] the grass, [[H2682]] as willows [[H6155]] by [[H5921]] the water [[H4325]] courses. [[H2988]]

### 5
One [[H2088]] shall say, [[H559]] I [[H589]] the Lord's; [[H3068]] and another [[H2088]] shall call [[H7121]] by the name [[H8034]] of Jacob; [[H3290]] and another [[H2088]] shall subscribe [[H3789]] his hand [[H3027]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and surname [[H3655]] by the name [[H8034]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] the King [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and his redeemer [[H1350]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] I [[H589]] the first, [[H7223]] and I [[H589]] the last; [[H314]] and beside [[H1107]] me no [[H369]] God. [[H430]]

### 7
And who, [[H4310]] as I, shall call, [[H7121]] and shall declare [[H5046]] it, and set it in order [[H6186]] for me, since I appointed [[H7760]] the ancient [[H5769]] people? [[H5971]] and the things that are coming, [[H857]] and shall come, [[H935]] let them shew [[H5046]] unto them. [[H5046]]

### 8
Fear [[H6342]] ye not, [[H408]] neither [[H408]] be afraid: [[H7297]] have not [[H3808]] I told [[H8085]] thee from that time, [[H227]] and have declared [[H5046]] ye [[H859]] even my witnesses. [[H5707]] Is there [[H3426]] a God [[H433]] beside [[H1107]] me? yea, no [[H369]] God; [[H6697]] I know [[H3045]] not [[H1077]]

### 9
They that make [[H3335]] a graven image [[H6459]] all [[H3605]] of them vanity; [[H8414]] and their delectable things [[H2530]] shall not [[H1077]] profit; [[H3276]] and they [[H1992]] their own witnesses; [[H5707]] they see [[H7200]] not, [[H1077]] nor [[H1077]] know; [[H3045]] that [[H4616]] they may be ashamed. [[H954]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] hath formed [[H3335]] a god, [[H410]] or molten [[H5258]] a graven image [[H6459]] is profitable [[H3276]] for nothing? [[H1115]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] his fellows [[H2270]] shall be ashamed: [[H954]] and the workmen, [[H2796]] they [[H1992]] of men: [[H120]] let them all [[H3605]] be gathered together, [[H6908]] let them stand up; [[H5975]] they shall fear, [[H6342]] they shall be ashamed [[H954]] together. [[H3162]]

### 12
The smith [[H1270]] with the tongs [[H4621]] both worketh [[H6466]] in the coals, [[H6352]] and fashioneth [[H3335]] it with hammers, [[H4717]] and worketh [[H6466]] it with the strength [[H3581]] of his arms: [[H2220]] yea, [[H1571]] he is hungry, [[H7456]] and his strength [[H3581]] faileth: [[H369]] he drinketh [[H8354]] no [[H3808]] water, [[H4325]] and is faint. [[H3286]]

### 13
The carpenter [[H2796]] stretcheth out [[H5186]] rule; [[H6957]] he marketh it out [[H8388]] with a line; [[H8279]] he fitteth [[H6213]] it with planes, [[H4741]] and he marketh it out [[H8388]] with the compass, [[H4230]] and maketh [[H6213]] it after the figure [[H8403]] of a man, [[H376]] according to the beauty [[H8597]] of a man; [[H120]] that it may remain [[H3427]] in the house. [[H1004]]

### 14
He heweth him down [[H3772]] cedars, [[H730]] and taketh [[H3947]] the cypress [[H8645]] and the oak, [[H437]] which he strengtheneth [[H553]] for himself among the trees [[H6086]] of the forest: [[H3293]] he planteth [[H5193]] an ash, [[H766]] and the rain [[H1653]] doth nourish [[H1431]]

### 15
Then shall it be [[H1961]] for a man [[H120]] to burn: [[H1197]] for he will take [[H3947]] thereof, and warm [[H2552]] himself; yea, [[H637]] he kindleth [[H5400]] and baketh [[H644]] bread; [[H3899]] yea, [[H637]] he maketh [[H6466]] a god, [[H410]] and worshippeth [[H7812]] he maketh [[H6213]] it a graven image, [[H6459]] and falleth down [[H5456]] thereto. [[H5456]]

### 16
He burneth [[H8313]] part [[H2677]] thereof in [[H1119]] the fire; [[H784]] with [[H5921]] part [[H2677]] thereof he eateth [[H398]] flesh; [[H1320]] he roasteth [[H6740]] roast, [[H6748]] and is satisfied: [[H7646]] yea, [[H637]] he warmeth [[H2552]] and saith, [[H559]] Aha, [[H1889]] I am warm, [[H2552]] I have seen [[H7200]] the fire: [[H217]]

### 17
And the residue [[H7611]] thereof he maketh [[H6213]] a god, [[H410]] his graven image: [[H6459]] he falleth down [[H5456]] unto it, and worshippeth [[H7812]] and prayeth [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] it, and saith, [[H559]] Deliver [[H5337]] me; for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my god. [[H410]]

### 18
They have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] nor [[H3808]] understood: [[H995]] for [[H3588]] he hath shut [[H2902]] their eyes, [[H5869]] that they cannot see; [[H7200]] their hearts, [[H3826]] that they cannot understand. [[H7919]]

### 19
And none [[H3808]] considereth [[H7725]] in [[H413]] his heart, [[H3820]] neither [[H3808]] knowledge [[H1847]] nor [[H3808]] understanding [[H8394]] to say, [[H559]] I have burned [[H8313]] part [[H2677]] of it in [[H1119]] the fire; [[H784]] yea, [[H637]] also I have baked [[H644]] bread [[H3899]] upon [[H5921]] the coals [[H1513]] thereof; I have roasted [[H6740]] flesh, [[H1320]] and eaten [[H398]] and shall I make [[H6213]] the residue [[H3499]] thereof an abomination? [[H8441]] shall I fall down [[H5456]] to the stock [[H944]] of a tree? [[H6086]]

### 20
He feedeth [[H7462]] on ashes: [[H665]] a deceived [[H2048]] heart [[H3820]] hath turned him aside, [[H5186]] that he cannot [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] his soul, [[H5315]] nor [[H3808]] say, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] a lie [[H8267]] in my right hand? [[H3225]]

### 21
Remember [[H2142]] these, [[H428]] O Jacob [[H3290]] and Israel; [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my servant: [[H5650]] I have formed [[H3335]] thee; thou [[H859]] my servant: [[H5650]] O Israel, [[H3478]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] be forgotten [[H5382]] of me. [[H5382]]

### 22
I have blotted out, [[H4229]] as a thick cloud, [[H5645]] thy transgressions, [[H6588]] and, as a cloud, [[H6051]] thy sins: [[H2403]] return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] me; for [[H3588]] I have redeemed [[H1350]] thee. [[H1350]]

### 23
Sing, [[H7442]] O ye heavens; [[H8064]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath done [[H6213]] shout, [[H7321]] ye lower parts [[H8482]] of the earth: [[H776]] break forth [[H6476]] into singing, [[H7440]] ye mountains, [[H2022]] O forest, [[H3293]] and every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] therein: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath redeemed [[H1350]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and glorified himself [[H6286]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] thy redeemer, [[H1350]] and he that formed [[H3335]] thee from the womb, [[H990]] I [[H595]] the Lord [[H3068]] that maketh [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that stretcheth forth [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] alone; [[H905]] that spreadeth abroad [[H7554]] the earth [[H776]] by [[H854]] myself; [[H854]]

### 25
That frustrateth [[H6565]] the tokens [[H226]] of the liars, [[H907]] and maketh diviners [[H7080]] mad; [[H1984]] that turneth [[H7725]] wise [[H2450]] backward, [[H268]] and maketh their knowledge [[H1847]] foolish; [[H5528]]

### 26
That confirmeth [[H6965]] the word [[H1697]] of his servant, [[H5650]] and performeth [[H7999]] the counsel [[H6098]] of his messengers; [[H4397]] that saith [[H559]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Thou shalt be inhabited; [[H3427]] and to the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Ye shall be built, [[H1129]] and I will raise up [[H6965]] the decayed places [[H2723]] thereof: [[H2723]]

### 27
That saith [[H559]] to the deep, [[H6683]] Be dry, [[H2717]] and I will dry up [[H3001]] thy rivers: [[H5104]]

### 28
That saith [[H559]] of Cyrus, [[H3566]] my shepherd, [[H7462]] and shall perform [[H7999]] all [[H3605]] my pleasure: [[H2656]] even saying [[H559]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Thou shalt be built; [[H1129]] and to the temple, [[H1964]] Thy foundation shall be laid. [[H3245]]
