### 1
Come near, [[H7126]] ye nations, [[H1471]] to hear; [[H8085]] and hearken, [[H7181]] ye people: [[H3816]] let the earth [[H776]] hear, [[H8085]] and all that is therein; [[H4393]] the world, [[H8398]] and all things [[H3605]] that come forth [[H6631]] of it. [[H6631]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] the indignation [[H7110]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] nations, [[H1471]] and fury [[H2534]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their armies: [[H6635]] he hath utterly destroyed [[H2763]] them, he hath delivered [[H5414]] them to the slaughter. [[H2874]]

### 3
Their slain [[H2491]] also shall be cast out, [[H7993]] and their stink [[H889]] shall come up [[H5927]] out of their carcases, [[H6297]] and the mountains [[H2022]] shall be melted [[H4549]] with their blood. [[H1818]]

### 4
And all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] shall be dissolved, [[H4743]] and the heavens [[H8064]] shall be rolled together [[H1556]] as a scroll: [[H5612]] and all [[H3605]] their host [[H6635]] shall fall down, [[H5034]] as the leaf [[H5929]] falleth off [[H5034]] from the vine, [[H1612]] and as a falling [[H5034]] from the fig tree. [[H8384]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] my sword [[H2719]] shall be bathed [[H7301]] in heaven: [[H8064]] behold, [[H2009]] it shall come down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] Idumea, [[H123]] and upon [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of my curse, [[H2764]] to judgment. [[H4941]]

### 6
The sword [[H2719]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is filled [[H4390]] with blood, [[H1818]] it is made fat [[H1878]] with fatness, [[H2459]] with the blood [[H1818]] of lambs [[H3733]] and goats, [[H6260]] with the fat [[H2459]] of the kidneys [[H3629]] of rams: [[H352]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath a sacrifice [[H2077]] in Bozrah, [[H1224]] and a great [[H1419]] slaughter [[H2874]] in the land [[H776]] of Idumea. [[H123]]

### 7
And the unicorns [[H7214]] shall come down [[H3381]] with [[H5973]] them, and the bullocks [[H6499]] with [[H5973]] the bulls; [[H47]] and their land [[H776]] shall be soaked [[H7301]] with blood, [[H1818]] and their dust [[H6083]] made fat [[H1878]] with fatness. [[H2459]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] vengeance, [[H5359]] the year [[H8141]] of recompences [[H7966]] for the controversy [[H7379]] of Zion. [[H6726]]

### 9
And the streams [[H5158]] thereof shall be turned [[H2015]] into pitch, [[H2203]] and the dust [[H6083]] thereof into brimstone, [[H1614]] and the land [[H776]] thereof shall become [[H1961]] burning [[H1197]] pitch. [[H2203]]

### 10
It shall not [[H3808]] be quenched [[H3518]] night [[H3915]] nor day; [[H3119]] the smoke [[H6227]] thereof shall go up [[H5927]] for ever: [[H5769]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation [[H1755]] it shall lie waste; [[H2717]] none [[H369]] shall pass through [[H5674]] it for ever [[H5331]] and ever. [[H5331]]

### 11
But the cormorant [[H6893]] and the bittern [[H7090]] shall possess [[H3423]] it; the owl [[H3244]] also and the raven [[H6158]] shall dwell [[H7931]] in it: and he shall stretch out [[H5186]] upon [[H5921]] it the line [[H6957]] of confusion, [[H8414]] and the stones [[H68]] of emptiness. [[H922]]

### 12
They shall call [[H7121]] the nobles [[H2715]] thereof to the kingdom, [[H4410]] but none [[H369]] there, [[H8033]] and all [[H3605]] her princes [[H8269]] shall be [[H1961]] nothing. [[H657]]

### 13
And thorns [[H5518]] shall come up [[H5927]] in her palaces, [[H759]] nettles [[H7057]] and brambles [[H2336]] in the fortresses [[H4013]] thereof: and it shall be [[H1961]] an habitation [[H5116]] of dragons, [[H8577]] a court [[H2681]] for owls. [[H1323]]

### 14
The wild beasts of the desert [[H6728]] shall also meet [[H6298]] with [[H854]] the wild beasts of the island, [[H338]] and the satyr [[H8163]] shall cry [[H7121]] to [[H5921]] his fellow; [[H7453]] the screech owl [[H3917]] also [[H389]] shall rest [[H7280]] there, [[H8033]] and find [[H4672]] for herself a place of rest. [[H4494]]

### 15
There [[H8033]] shall the great owl [[H7091]] make her nest, [[H7077]] and lay, [[H4422]] and hatch, [[H1234]] and gather [[H1716]] under her shadow: [[H6738]] there [[H8033]] shall the vultures [[H1772]] also [[H389]] be gathered, [[H6908]] every one [[H802]] with her mate. [[H7468]]

### 16
Seek out [[H1875]] ye of [[H5921]] the book [[H5612]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and read: [[H7121]] no [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of these [[H2007]] shall fail, [[H5737]] none [[H802]] shall want [[H6485]] her mate: [[H7468]] for [[H3588]] my mouth [[H6310]] it [[H1931]] hath commanded, [[H6680]] and his spirit [[H7307]] it [[H1931]] hath gathered [[H6908]] them. [[H6908]]

### 17
And he [[H1931]] hath cast [[H5307]] the lot [[H1486]] for them, and his hand [[H3027]] hath divided [[H2505]] it unto them by line: [[H6957]] they shall possess [[H3423]] it for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation [[H1755]] shall they dwell [[H7931]] therein. [[H7931]]
