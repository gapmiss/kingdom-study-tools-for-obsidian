### 1
Now it came to pass [[H1961]] in the fourteenth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of king [[H4428]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] came up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the defenced [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and took [[H8610]] them. [[H8610]]

### 2
And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] sent [[H7971]] Rabshakeh [[H7262]] from Lachish [[H3923]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] with a great [[H3515]] army. [[H2426]] And he stood [[H5975]] by the conduit [[H8585]] of the upper [[H5945]] pool [[H1295]] in the highway [[H4546]] of the fuller's [[H3526]] field. [[H7704]]

### 3
Then came forth [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] him Eliakim, [[H471]] Hilkiah's [[H2518]] son, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] was over [[H5921]] the house, [[H1004]] and Shebna [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Joah, [[H3098]] Asaph's [[H623]] son, [[H1121]] the recorder. [[H2142]]

### 4
And Rabshakeh [[H7262]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Say [[H559]] ye now [[H4994]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the great [[H1419]] king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] What [[H4100]] confidence [[H986]] this [[H2088]] wherein [[H834]] thou trustest? [[H982]]

### 5
I say, [[H559]] (but [[H389]] vain [[H8193]] words) [[H1697]] counsel [[H6098]] and strength [[H1369]] for war: [[H4421]] now [[H6258]] on [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] dost thou trust, [[H982]] that [[H3588]] thou rebellest [[H4775]] against me? [[H4775]]

### 6
Lo, [[H2009]] thou trustest [[H982]] in [[H5921]] the staff [[H4938]] of this [[H2088]] broken [[H7533]] reed, [[H7070]] on [[H5921]] Egypt; [[H4714]] whereon [[H834]] if a man [[H376]] lean, [[H5564]] it will go [[H935]] into his hand, [[H3709]] and pierce [[H5344]] it: so [[H3651]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to all [[H3605]] that trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 7
But [[H3588]] if thou say [[H559]] to [[H413]] me, We trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God: [[H430]] not [[H3808]] he, [[H1931]] whose [[H834]] high places [[H1116]] and whose altars [[H4196]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] hath taken away, [[H5493]] and said [[H559]] to Judah [[H3063]] and to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Ye shall worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] altar? [[H4196]]

### 8
Now [[H6258]] therefore give pledges, [[H6148]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] to [[H854]] my master [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and I will give [[H5414]] thee two thousand [[H505]] horses, [[H5483]] if [[H518]] thou be able [[H3201]] on thy part to set [[H5414]] riders [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 9
How [[H349]] then wilt thou turn away [[H7725]] the face [[H6440]] of one [[H259]] captain [[H6346]] of the least [[H6996]] of my master's [[H113]] servants, [[H5650]] and put thy trust [[H982]] on [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] for chariots [[H7393]] and for horsemen? [[H6571]]

### 10
And am I now [[H6258]] come up [[H5927]] without [[H1107]] the Lord [[H3068]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to destroy [[H7843]] it? the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Go up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and destroy [[H7843]] it. [[H7843]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] Eliakim [[H471]] and Shebna [[H7644]] and Joah [[H3098]] unto [[H413]] Rabshakeh, [[H7262]] Speak, [[H1696]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] unto [[H413]] thy servants [[H5650]] in the Syrian language; [[H762]] for [[H3588]] we [[H587]] understand [[H8085]] and speak [[H1696]] not [[H408]] to [[H413]] us in the Jews' language, [[H3066]] in the ears [[H241]] of the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the wall. [[H2346]]

### 12
But Rabshakeh [[H7262]] said, [[H559]] Hath my master [[H113]] sent [[H7971]] me to [[H413]] thy master [[H113]] and to [[H413]] thee to speak [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words? [[H1697]] not [[H3808]] to [[H5921]] the men [[H376]] that sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] that they may eat [[H398]] their own dung, [[H2716]] and drink [[H8354]] their own piss [[H7890]] with you? [[H5973]]

### 13
Then Rabshakeh [[H7262]] stood, [[H5975]] and cried [[H7121]] with a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] in the Jews' language, [[H3066]] and said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]]  ye [[H853]] the words [[H1697]] of the great [[H1419]] king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 14
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] Let not [[H408]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] deceive [[H5377]] you: for [[H3588]] he shall not [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to deliver [[H5337]] you. [[H5337]]

### 15
Neither [[H408]] let Hezekiah [[H2396]] make you trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] will surely [[H5337]] deliver [[H5337]] us: this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] shall not [[H3808]] be delivered [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 16
Hearken [[H8085]] not [[H408]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah: [[H2396]] for [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] Make [[H6213]] with [[H854]] me a present, [[H1293]] and come out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] me: and eat [[H398]] ye every one [[H376]] of his vine, [[H1612]] and every one [[H376]] of his fig tree, [[H8384]] and drink [[H8354]] ye every one [[H376]] the waters [[H4325]] of his own cistern; [[H953]]

### 17
Until [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] and take you away [[H3947]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] like your own land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] of corn [[H1715]] and wine, [[H8492]] a land [[H776]] of bread [[H3899]] and vineyards. [[H3754]]

### 18
lest [[H6435]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] persuade [[H5496]] you, saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] will deliver [[H5337]] us. Hath any [[H376]] of the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H1471]] delivered [[H5337]] his land [[H776]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria? [[H804]]

### 19
Where [[H346]] the gods [[H430]] of Hamath [[H2574]] and Arphad? [[H774]] where [[H346]] the gods [[H430]] of Sepharvaim? [[H5617]] and [[H3588]] have they delivered [[H5337]] Samaria [[H8111]] out of my hand? [[H3027]]

### 20
Who [[H4310]] among all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of these [[H428]] lands, [[H776]] that [[H834]] have delivered [[H5337]] their land [[H776]] out of my hand, [[H3027]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] should deliver [[H5337]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] out of my hand? [[H3027]]

### 21
But they held their peace, [[H2790]] and answered [[H6030]] him not [[H3808]] a word: [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] the king's [[H4428]] commandment [[H4687]] was, saying, [[H559]] Answer [[H6030]] him not. [[H6030]]

### 22
Then came [[H935]] Eliakim, [[H471]] the son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] that [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the household, [[H1004]] and Shebna [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Joah, [[H3098]] the son [[H1121]] of Asaph, [[H623]] the recorder, [[H2142]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] with clothes [[H899]] rent, [[H7167]] and told [[H5046]]  him [[H853]] the words [[H1697]] of Rabshakeh.
