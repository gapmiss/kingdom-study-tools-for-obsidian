### 1
Nevertheless [[H3588]] the dimness [[H4155]] not [[H3808]] such as [[H834]] in her vexation, [[H4164]] when [[H6256]] at the first [[H7223]] he lightly afflicted [[H7043]] the land [[H776]] of Zebulun [[H2074]] and the land [[H776]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] and afterward [[H314]] did more grievously afflict [[H3513]] the way [[H1870]] of the sea, [[H3220]] beyond [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] in Galilee [[H1551]] of the nations. [[H1471]]

### 2
The people [[H5971]] that walked [[H1980]] in darkness [[H2822]] have seen [[H7200]] a great [[H1419]] light: [[H216]] they that dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of the shadow of death, [[H6757]] upon [[H5921]] them hath the light [[H216]] shined. [[H5050]]

### 3
Thou hast multiplied [[H7235]] the nation, [[H1471]] not [[H3808]] increased [[H1431]] the joy: [[H8057]] they joy [[H8055]] before [[H6440]] thee according to the joy [[H8057]] in harvest, [[H7105]] as [[H834]] rejoice [[H1523]] when they divide [[H2505]] the spoil. [[H7998]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thou hast broken [[H2865]] the yoke [[H5923]] of his burden, [[H5448]] and the staff [[H4294]] of his shoulder, [[H7926]] the rod [[H7626]] of his oppressor, [[H5065]] as in the day [[H3117]] of Midian. [[H4080]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] battle [[H5430]] of the warrior [[H5431]] with confused noise, [[H7494]] and garments [[H8071]] rolled [[H1556]] in blood; [[H1818]] but shall be [[H1961]] with burning [[H8316]] fuel [[H3980]] of fire. [[H784]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] unto us a child [[H3206]] is born, [[H3205]] unto us a son [[H1121]] is given: [[H5414]] and the government [[H4951]] shall be upon [[H5921]] his shoulder: [[H7926]] and his name [[H8034]] shall be [[H1961]] called [[H7121]] Wonderful, [[H6382]] Counseller, [[H3289]] The mighty [[H1368]] God, [[H410]] The everlasting [[H5703]] Father, [[H1]] The Prince [[H8269]] of Peace. [[H7965]]

### 7
Of the increase [[H4766]] of government [[H4951]] and peace [[H7965]] no [[H369]] end, [[H7093]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David, [[H1732]] and upon [[H5921]] his kingdom, [[H4467]] to order [[H3559]] it, and to establish [[H5582]] it with judgment [[H4941]] and with justice [[H6666]] from henceforth [[H6258]] even for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]] The zeal [[H7068]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] will perform [[H6213]] this. [[H6213]]

### 8
The Lord [[H136]] sent [[H7971]] a word [[H1697]] into Jacob, [[H3290]] and it hath lighted [[H5307]] upon Israel. [[H3478]]

### 9
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] shall know, [[H3045]] Ephraim [[H669]] and the inhabitant [[H3427]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] that say [[H559]] in the pride [[H1346]] and stoutness [[H1433]] of heart, [[H3824]]

### 10
The bricks [[H3843]] are fallen down, [[H5307]] but we will build [[H1129]] with hewn stones: [[H1496]] the sycomores [[H8256]] are cut down, [[H1438]] but we will change [[H2498]] cedars. [[H730]]

### 11
Therefore the Lord [[H3068]] shall set up [[H7682]] the adversaries [[H6862]] of Rezin [[H7526]] against [[H5921]] him, and join together; [[H5526]] his enemies [[H341]]

### 12
The Syrians [[H758]] before, [[H6924]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] behind; [[H268]] and they shall devour [[H398]] Israel [[H3478]] with open [[H3605]] mouth. [[H6310]] For all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] his anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away, [[H7725]] but his hand [[H3027]] stretched out still. [[H5186]]

### 13
For the people [[H5971]] turneth [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H5704]] him that smiteth [[H5221]] them, neither [[H3808]] do they seek [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 14
Therefore the Lord [[H3068]] will cut off [[H3772]] from Israel [[H3478]] head [[H7218]] and tail, [[H2180]] branch [[H3712]] and rush, [[H100]] in one [[H259]] day. [[H3117]]

### 15
The ancient [[H2205]] and honourable, [[H6440]] he [[H1931]] the head; [[H7218]] and the prophet [[H5030]] that teacheth [[H3384]] lies, [[H8267]] he [[H1931]] the tail. [[H2180]]

### 16
For the leaders [[H833]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] cause to err; [[H8582]] and led [[H833]] of them destroyed. [[H1104]]

### 17
Therefore [[H5921]] the Lord [[H136]] shall have no [[H3808]] joy [[H8055]] in [[H5921]] their young men, [[H970]] neither [[H3808]] shall have mercy [[H7355]] on their fatherless [[H3490]] and widows: [[H490]] for [[H3588]] every one [[H3605]] an hypocrite [[H2611]] and an evildoer, [[H7489]] and every [[H3605]] mouth [[H6310]] speaketh [[H1696]] folly. [[H5039]] For all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] his anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away, [[H7725]] but his hand [[H3027]] stretched out still. [[H5186]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] wickedness [[H7564]] burneth [[H1197]] as the fire: [[H784]] it shall devour [[H398]] the briers [[H8068]] and thorns, [[H7898]] and shall kindle [[H3341]] in the thickets [[H5442]] of the forest, [[H3293]] and they shall mount up [[H55]] the lifting up [[H1348]] of smoke. [[H6227]]

### 19
Through the wrath [[H5678]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] is the land [[H776]] darkened, [[H6272]] and the people [[H5971]] shall be [[H1961]] as the fuel [[H3980]] of the fire: [[H784]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] shall spare [[H2550]] his brother. [[H251]]

### 20
And he shall snatch [[H1504]] on [[H5921]] the right hand, [[H3225]] and be hungry; [[H7456]] and he shall eat [[H398]] on [[H5921]] the left hand, [[H8040]] and they shall not [[H3808]] be satisfied: [[H7646]] they shall eat [[H398]] every man [[H376]] the flesh [[H1320]] of his own arm: [[H2220]]

### 21
Manasseh, [[H4519]] Ephraim; [[H669]] and Ephraim, [[H669]] Manasseh: [[H4519]] they [[H1992]] together [[H3162]] against [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]] For all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] his anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away, [[H7725]] but his hand [[H3027]] stretched out still. [[H5186]]
