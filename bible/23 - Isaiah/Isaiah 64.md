[[Isaiah 63|←]] • [[Isaiah 65|→]]

---

### 1
Oh that [[H3863]] thou wouldest rend [[H7167]] the heavens, [[H8064]] that thou wouldest come down, [[H3381]] that the mountains [[H2022]] might flow down [[H2151]] at thy presence, [[H6440]]

### 2
As the melting [[H2003]] fire [[H784]] burneth, [[H6919]] the fire [[H784]] causeth the waters [[H4325]] to boil, [[H1158]] to make thy name [[H8034]] known [[H3045]] to thine adversaries, [[H6862]] the nations [[H1471]] may tremble [[H7264]] at thy presence! [[H6440]]

### 3
When thou didst [[H6213]] terrible things [[H3372]] we looked [[H6960]]  not for, [[H3808]] thou camest down, [[H3381]] the mountains [[H2022]] flowed down [[H2151]] at thy presence. [[H6440]]

### 4
For since the beginning of the world [[H5769]] have not [[H3808]] heard, [[H8085]] nor [[H3808]] perceived by the ear, [[H238]] neither [[H3808]] hath the eye [[H5869]] seen, [[H7200]] O God, [[H430]] beside [[H2108]] thee, he hath prepared [[H6213]] for him that waiteth [[H2442]] for him. [[H2442]]

### 5
Thou meetest [[H6293]] him that rejoiceth [[H7797]] and worketh [[H6213]] righteousness, [[H6664]] remember [[H2142]] thee in thy ways: [[H1870]] behold, [[H2005]] thou [[H859]] art wroth; [[H7107]] for we have sinned: [[H2398]] in those is continuance, [[H5769]] and we shall be saved. [[H3467]]

### 6
But we are [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] as an unclean [[H2931]] and all [[H3605]] our righteousnesses [[H6666]] as filthy [[H5708]] rags; [[H899]] and we all [[H3605]] do fade [[H5034]] as a leaf; [[H5929]] and our iniquities, [[H5771]] like the wind, [[H7307]] have taken us away. [[H5375]]

### 7
And none [[H369]] that calleth [[H7121]] upon thy name, [[H8034]] that stirreth up himself [[H5782]] to take hold [[H2388]] of thee: for [[H3588]] thou hast hid [[H5641]] thy face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] us, and hast consumed [[H4127]] us, because [[H3027]] of our iniquities. [[H5771]]

### 8
But now, [[H6258]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou [[H859]] our father; [[H1]] we [[H587]] the clay, [[H2563]] and thou [[H859]] our potter; [[H3335]] and we all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of thy hand. [[H3027]]

### 9
Be not wroth [[H7107]] very sore, [[H3966]] O Lord, [[H3068]] neither [[H408]] remember [[H2142]] iniquity [[H5771]] for ever: [[H5703]] behold, [[H2005]] see, [[H5027]] we beseech thee, [[H4994]] we all [[H3605]] thy people. [[H5971]]

### 10
Thy holy [[H6944]] cities [[H5892]] are [[H1961]] a wilderness, [[H4057]] Zion [[H6726]] is [[H1961]] a wilderness, [[H4057]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a desolation. [[H8077]]

### 11
Our holy [[H6944]] and our beautiful [[H8597]] house, [[H1004]] where [[H834]] our fathers [[H1]] praised [[H1984]] thee, is [[H1961]] burned up [[H8316]] with fire: [[H784]] and all [[H3605]] our pleasant things [[H4261]] are [[H1961]] laid waste. [[H2723]]

### 12
Wilt thou refrain thyself [[H662]] for [[H5921]] these [[H428]] O Lord? [[H3068]] wilt thou hold thy peace, [[H2814]] and afflict [[H6031]] us very sore? [[H3966]]
