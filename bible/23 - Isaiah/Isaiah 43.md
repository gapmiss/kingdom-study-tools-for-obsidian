### 1
But now [[H6258]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] that created [[H1254]] thee, O Jacob, [[H3290]] and he that formed [[H3335]] thee, O Israel, [[H3478]] Fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I have redeemed [[H1350]] thee, I have called [[H7121]] by thy name; [[H8034]] thou [[H859]] mine. [[H859]]

### 2
When [[H3588]] thou passest through [[H5674]] the waters, [[H4325]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] thee; and through the rivers, [[H5104]] they shall not [[H3808]] overflow [[H7857]] thee: when [[H3588]] thou walkest [[H1980]] through [[H1119]] the fire, [[H784]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] be burned; [[H3554]] neither [[H3808]] shall the flame [[H3852]] kindle [[H1197]] upon thee. [[H1197]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel, [[H3478]] thy Saviour: [[H3467]] I gave [[H5414]] Egypt [[H4714]] thy ransom, [[H3724]] Ethiopia [[H3568]] and Seba [[H5434]] for [[H8478]] thee. [[H8478]]

### 4
Since [[H834]] thou wast precious [[H3365]] in my sight, [[H5869]] thou hast been honourable, [[H3513]] and I [[H589]] have loved [[H157]] thee: therefore will I give [[H5414]] men [[H120]] for [[H8478]] thee, and people [[H3816]] for [[H8478]] thy life. [[H5315]]

### 5
Fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H854]] thee: I will bring [[H935]] thy seed [[H2233]] from the east, [[H4217]] and gather [[H6908]] thee from the west; [[H4628]]

### 6
I will say [[H559]] to the north, [[H6828]] Give up; [[H5414]] and to the south, [[H8486]] Keep not back: [[H3607]] bring [[H935]] my sons [[H1121]] from far, [[H7350]] and my daughters [[H1323]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the earth; [[H776]]

### 7
every one [[H3605]] that is called [[H7121]] by my name: [[H8034]] for I have created [[H1254]] him for my glory, [[H3519]] I have formed [[H3335]] him; yea, [[H637]] I have made [[H6213]] him. [[H6213]]

### 8
Bring forth [[H3318]] the blind [[H5787]] people [[H5971]] that have [[H3426]] eyes, [[H5869]] and the deaf [[H2795]] that have ears. [[H241]]

### 9
Let all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] be gathered [[H6908]] together, [[H3162]] and let the people [[H3816]] be assembled: [[H622]] who [[H4310]] among them can declare [[H5046]] this, [[H2063]] and shew [[H8085]] us former things? [[H7223]] let them bring forth [[H5414]] their witnesses, [[H5707]] that they may be justified: [[H6663]] or let them hear, [[H8085]] and say, [[H559]] truth. [[H571]]

### 10
Ye [[H859]] my witnesses, [[H5707]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and my servant [[H5650]] whom [[H834]] I have chosen: [[H977]] that [[H4616]] ye may know [[H3045]] and believe [[H539]] me, and understand [[H995]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] he: [[H1931]] before [[H6440]] me there was no [[H3808]] God [[H410]] formed, [[H3335]] neither [[H3808]] shall there be [[H1961]] after [[H310]] me. [[H310]]

### 11
I, [[H595]] I, [[H595]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and beside [[H1107]] me no [[H369]] saviour. [[H3467]]

### 12
I [[H595]] have declared, [[H5046]] and have saved, [[H3467]] and I have shewed, [[H8085]] when no [[H369]] strange [[H2114]] among you: therefore ye [[H859]] my witnesses, [[H5707]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that I [[H589]] God. [[H410]]

### 13
Yea, [[H1571]] before the day [[H3117]] I [[H589]] he; [[H1931]] and none [[H369]] that can deliver [[H5337]] out of my hand: [[H3027]] I will work, [[H6466]] and who [[H4310]] shall let [[H7725]] it? [[H7725]]

### 14
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] your redeemer, [[H1350]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel; [[H3478]] For your sake [[H4616]] I have sent [[H7971]] to Babylon, [[H894]] and have brought down [[H3381]] all [[H3605]] their nobles, [[H1281]] and the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] whose cry [[H7440]] in the ships. [[H591]]

### 15
I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] your Holy One, [[H6918]] the creator [[H1254]] of Israel, [[H3478]] your King. [[H4428]]

### 16
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which maketh [[H5414]] a way [[H1870]] in the sea, [[H3220]] and a path [[H5410]] in the mighty [[H5794]] waters; [[H4325]]

### 17
Which bringeth forth [[H3318]] the chariot [[H7393]] and horse, [[H5483]] the army [[H2428]] and the power; [[H5808]] they shall lie down [[H7901]] together, [[H3162]] they shall not [[H1077]] rise: [[H6965]] they are extinct, [[H1846]] they are quenched [[H3518]] as tow. [[H6594]]

### 18
Remember [[H2142]] ye not [[H408]] the former things, [[H7223]] neither [[H408]] consider [[H995]] the things of old. [[H6931]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2005]] I will do [[H6213]] a new thing; [[H2319]] now [[H6258]] it shall spring forth; [[H6779]] shall ye not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] it? I will even [[H637]] make [[H7760]] a way [[H1870]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] rivers [[H5104]] in the desert. [[H3452]]

### 20
The beast [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] shall honour [[H3513]] me, the dragons [[H8577]] and the owls: [[H1323]] because [[H3588]] I give [[H5414]] waters [[H4325]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] rivers [[H5104]] in the desert, [[H3452]] to give drink [[H8248]] to my people, [[H5971]] my chosen. [[H972]]

### 21
This [[H2098]] people [[H5971]] have I formed [[H3335]] for myself; they shall shew forth [[H5608]] my praise. [[H8416]]

### 22
But thou hast not [[H3808]] called upon [[H7121]] me, O Jacob; [[H3290]] but [[H3588]] thou hast been weary [[H3021]] of me, O Israel. [[H3478]]

### 23
Thou hast not [[H3808]] brought [[H935]] me the small cattle [[H7716]] of thy burnt offerings; [[H5930]] neither [[H3808]] hast thou honoured [[H3513]] me with thy sacrifices. [[H2077]] I have not [[H3808]] caused thee to serve [[H5647]] with an offering, [[H4503]] nor [[H3808]] wearied [[H3021]] thee with incense. [[H3828]]

### 24
Thou hast bought [[H7069]] me no [[H3808]] sweet cane [[H7070]] with money, [[H3701]] neither [[H3808]] hast thou filled [[H7301]] me with the fat [[H2459]] of thy sacrifices: [[H2077]] but [[H389]] thou hast made me to serve [[H5647]] with thy sins, [[H2403]] thou hast wearied [[H3021]] me with thine iniquities. [[H5771]]

### 25
I, [[H595]] I, [[H595]] he [[H1931]] that blotteth out [[H4229]] thy transgressions [[H6588]] for mine own sake, [[H4616]] and will not [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] thy sins. [[H2403]]

### 26
Put me in remembrance: [[H2142]] let us plead [[H8199]] together: [[H3162]] declare [[H5608]] thou, [[H859]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest be justified. [[H6663]]

### 27
Thy first [[H7223]] father [[H1]] hath sinned, [[H2398]] and thy teachers [[H3887]] have transgressed [[H6586]] against me. [[H6586]]

### 28
Therefore I have profaned [[H2490]] the princes [[H8269]] of the sanctuary, [[H6944]] and have given [[H5414]] Jacob [[H3290]] to the curse, [[H2764]] and Israel [[H3478]] to reproaches. [[H1421]]
