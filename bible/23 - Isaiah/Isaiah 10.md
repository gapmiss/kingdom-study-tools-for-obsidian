# Isaiah 10

[[Isaiah 9|←]] • [[Isaiah 11|→]]

---

### 1
Woe [[H1945]] unto them that decree [[H2710]] unrighteous [[H205]] decrees, [[H2711]] and that write [[H3789]] grievousness [[H5999]] they have prescribed; [[H3789]]

### 2
To turn aside [[H5186]] the needy [[H1800]] from judgment, [[H1779]] and to take away [[H1497]] the right [[H4941]] from the poor [[H6041]] of my people, [[H5971]] that widows [[H490]] may be [[H1961]] their prey, [[H7998]] and they may rob [[H962]] the fatherless! [[H3490]]

### 3
And what [[H4100]] will ye do [[H6213]] in the day [[H3117]] of visitation, [[H6486]] and in the desolation [[H7722]] shall come [[H935]] from far? [[H4801]] to [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] will ye flee [[H5127]] for help? [[H5833]] and where [[H575]] will ye leave [[H5800]] your glory? [[H3519]]

### 4
Without [[H1115]] me they shall bow down [[H3766]] under [[H8478]] the prisoners, [[H616]] and they shall fall [[H5307]] under [[H8478]] the slain. [[H2026]] For all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] his anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away, [[H7725]] but his hand [[H3027]] stretched out still. [[H5186]]

### 5
O [[H1945]] Assyrian, [[H804]] the rod [[H7626]] of mine anger, [[H639]] and the staff [[H4294]] in their hand [[H3027]] is mine indignation. [[H2195]]

### 6
I will send [[H7971]] him against an hypocritical [[H2611]] nation, [[H1471]] and against [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] of my wrath [[H5678]] will I give him a charge, [[H6680]] to take [[H7997]] the spoil, [[H7998]] and to take [[H962]] the prey, [[H957]] and to tread them down [[H7760]] like the mire [[H2563]] of the streets. [[H2351]]

### 7
Howbeit he [[H1931]] meaneth [[H1819]] not [[H3808]] so, [[H3651]] neither [[H3808]] doth his heart [[H3824]] think [[H2803]] so; [[H3651]] but [[H3588]] in his heart [[H3824]] to destroy [[H8045]] and cut off [[H3772]] nations [[H1471]] not [[H3808]] a few. [[H4592]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] he saith, [[H559]] not [[H3808]] my princes [[H8269]] altogether [[H3162]] kings? [[H4428]]

### 9
not [[H3808]] Calno [[H3641]] as Carchemish? [[H3751]] not [[H3808]] Hamath [[H2574]] as Arpad? [[H774]] not [[H3808]] Samaria [[H8111]] as Damascus? [[H1834]]

### 10
As [[H834]] my hand [[H3027]] hath found [[H4672]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the idols, [[H457]] and whose graven images [[H6456]] did excel them of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and of Samaria; [[H8111]]

### 11
Shall I not, [[H3808]] as [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] unto Samaria [[H8111]] and her idols, [[H457]] so [[H3651]] do [[H6213]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and her idols? [[H6091]]

### 12
Wherefore it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] hath performed [[H1214]]  his [[H853]] whole [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] upon mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] and on Jerusalem, [[H3389]] I will punish [[H6485]] the fruit [[H6529]] of the stout [[H1433]] heart [[H3824]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and [[H5921]] the glory [[H8597]] of his high [[H7312]] looks. [[H5869]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] he saith, [[H559]] By the strength [[H3581]] of my hand [[H3027]] I have done [[H6213]] and by my wisdom; [[H2451]] for [[H3588]] I am prudent: [[H995]] and I have removed [[H5493]] the bounds [[H1367]] of the people, [[H5971]] and have robbed [[H8154]] their treasures, [[H6264]] and I have put down [[H3381]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] like a valiant [[H47]]

### 14
And my hand [[H3027]] hath found [[H4672]] as a nest [[H7064]] the riches [[H2428]] of the people: [[H5971]] and as one gathereth [[H622]] eggs [[H1000]] left, [[H5800]] have I [[H589]] gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the earth; [[H776]] and there was [[H1961]] none [[H3808]] that moved [[H5074]] the wing, [[H3671]] or opened [[H6475]] the mouth, [[H6310]] or peeped. [[H6850]]

### 15
Shall the axe [[H1631]] boast itself [[H6286]] against [[H5921]] him that heweth [[H2672]] therewith? shall the saw [[H4883]] magnify itself [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] him that shaketh [[H5130]] it? as if the rod [[H7626]] should shake [[H5130]]  against [[H853]] them that lift it up, [[H7311]] as if the staff [[H4294]] should lift up [[H7311]] no [[H3808]] wood. [[H6086]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] shall the Lord, [[H113]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] send [[H7971]] among his fat ones [[H4924]] leanness; [[H7332]] and under [[H8478]] his glory [[H3519]] he shall kindle [[H3344]] a burning [[H3350]] like the burning [[H3350]] of a fire. [[H784]]

### 17
And the light [[H216]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall be [[H1961]] for a fire, [[H784]] and his Holy One [[H6918]] for a flame: [[H3852]] and it shall burn [[H1197]] and devour [[H398]] his thorns [[H7898]] and his briers [[H8068]] in one [[H259]] day; [[H3117]]

### 18
And shall consume [[H3615]] the glory [[H3519]] of his forest, [[H3293]] and of his fruitful field, [[H3759]] both soul [[H5315]] and body: [[H1320]] and they shall be [[H1961]] as when a standardbearer [[H5263]] fainteth. [[H4549]]

### 19
And the rest [[H7605]] of the trees [[H6086]] of his forest [[H3293]] shall be [[H1961]] few, [[H4557]] that a child [[H5288]] may write [[H3789]] them. [[H3789]]

### 20
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the remnant [[H7605]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and such as are escaped [[H6413]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] again [[H3254]] stay [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] him that smote [[H5221]] them; but shall stay [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel, [[H3478]] in truth. [[H571]]

### 21
The remnant [[H7605]] shall return, [[H7725]] the remnant [[H7605]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] unto [[H413]] the mighty [[H1368]] God. [[H410]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] though [[H518]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] be [[H1961]] as the sand [[H2344]] of the sea, [[H3220]] a remnant [[H7605]] of them shall return: [[H7725]] the consumption [[H3631]] decreed [[H2782]] shall overflow [[H7857]] with righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts [[H6635]] shall make [[H6213]] a consumption, [[H3617]] even determined, [[H2782]] in the midst [[H7130]] of all [[H3605]] the land. [[H776]]

### 24
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] O my people [[H5971]] that dwellest [[H3427]] in Zion, [[H6726]] be not [[H408]] afraid [[H3372]] of the Assyrian: [[H804]] he shall smite [[H5221]] thee with a rod, [[H7626]] and shall lift up [[H5375]] his staff [[H4294]] against [[H5921]] thee, after the manner [[H1870]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] yet [[H5750]] a very [[H4213]] little while, [[H4592]] and the indignation [[H2195]] shall cease, [[H3615]] and mine anger [[H639]] in [[H5921]] their destruction. [[H8399]]

### 26
And the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] shall stir up [[H5782]] a scourge [[H7752]] for [[H5921]] him according to the slaughter [[H4347]] of Midian [[H4080]] at the rock [[H6697]] of Oreb: [[H6159]] and his rod [[H4294]] upon [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] so shall he lift it up [[H5375]] after the manner [[H1870]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 27
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] his burden [[H5448]] shall be taken away [[H5493]] from off [[H5921]] thy shoulder, [[H7926]] and his yoke [[H5923]] from off [[H5921]] thy neck, [[H6677]] and the yoke [[H5923]] shall be destroyed [[H2254]] because [[H6440]] of the anointing. [[H8081]]

### 28
He is come [[H935]] to [[H5921]] Aiath, [[H5857]] he is passed [[H5674]] to Migron; [[H4051]] at Michmash [[H4363]] he hath laid up [[H6485]] his carriages: [[H3627]]

### 29
They are gone over [[H5674]] the passage: [[H4569]] they have taken up their lodging [[H4411]] at Geba; [[H1387]] Ramah [[H7414]] is afraid; [[H2729]] Gibeah [[H1390]] of Saul [[H7586]] is fled. [[H5127]]

### 30
Lift up [[H6670]] thy voice, [[H6963]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Gallim: [[H1554]] cause it to be heard [[H7181]] unto Laish, [[H3919]] O poor [[H6041]] Anathoth. [[H6068]]

### 31
Madmenah [[H4088]] is removed; [[H5074]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Gebim [[H1374]] gather themselves to flee. [[H5756]]

### 32
As yet [[H5750]] shall he remain [[H5975]] at Nob [[H5011]] that day: [[H3117]] he shall shake [[H5130]] his hand [[H3027]] the mount [[H2022]] of the daughter [[H1004]] of Zion, [[H6726]] the hill [[H1389]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 33
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord, [[H113]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] shall lop [[H5586]] the bough [[H6288]] with terror: [[H4637]] and the high ones [[H7311]] of stature [[H6967]] hewn down, [[H1438]] and the haughty [[H1364]] shall be humbled. [[H8213]]

### 34
And he shall cut down [[H5362]] the thickets [[H5442]] of the forest [[H3293]] with iron, [[H1270]] and Lebanon [[H3844]] shall fall [[H5307]] by a mighty one. [[H117]]
