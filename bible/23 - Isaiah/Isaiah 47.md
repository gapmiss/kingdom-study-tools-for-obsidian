[[Isaiah 46|←]] • [[Isaiah 48|→]]

### 1
Come down, [[H3381]] and sit [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] the dust, [[H6083]] O virgin [[H1330]] daughter [[H1323]] of Babylon, [[H894]] sit [[H3427]] on the ground: [[H776]] no [[H369]] throne, [[H3678]] O daughter [[H1323]] of the Chaldeans: [[H3778]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] be called [[H7121]] tender [[H7390]] and delicate. [[H6028]]

### 2
Take [[H3947]] the millstones, [[H7347]] and grind [[H2912]] meal: [[H7058]] uncover [[H1540]] thy locks, [[H6777]] make bare [[H2834]] the leg, [[H7640]] uncover [[H1540]] the thigh, [[H7785]] pass over [[H5674]] the rivers. [[H5104]]

### 3
Thy nakedness [[H6172]] shall be uncovered, [[H1540]] yea, [[H1571]] thy shame [[H2781]] shall be seen: [[H7200]] I will take [[H3947]] vengeance, [[H5359]] and I will not [[H3808]] meet [[H6293]] a man. [[H120]]

### 4
our redeemer, [[H1350]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] his name, [[H8034]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Sit [[H3427]] thou silent, [[H1748]] and get [[H935]] thee into darkness, [[H2822]] O daughter [[H1323]] of the Chaldeans: [[H3778]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] be called, [[H7121]] The lady [[H1404]] of kingdoms. [[H4467]]

### 6
I was wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] my people, [[H5971]] I have polluted [[H2490]] mine inheritance, [[H5159]] and given [[H5414]] them into thine hand: [[H3027]] thou didst shew [[H7760]] them no [[H3808]] mercy; [[H7356]] upon [[H5921]] the ancient [[H2205]] hast thou very [[H3966]] heavily laid [[H3513]] thy yoke. [[H5923]]

### 7
And thou saidst, [[H559]] I shall be [[H1961]] a lady [[H1404]] for ever: [[H5769]] that [[H5704]] thou didst not [[H3808]] lay [[H7760]] these [[H428]] to [[H5921]] thy heart, [[H3820]] neither [[H3808]] didst remember [[H2142]] the latter end [[H319]] of it. [[H319]]

### 8
Therefore hear [[H8085]] now [[H6258]] this, [[H2063]] given to pleasures, [[H5719]] that dwellest [[H3427]] carelessly, [[H983]] that sayest [[H559]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] I [[H589]] and none else beside [[H657]] me; I shall not [[H3808]] sit [[H3427]] a widow, [[H490]] neither [[H3808]] shall I know [[H3045]] the loss of children: [[H7908]]

### 9
But these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] shall come [[H935]] to thee in a moment [[H7281]] in one [[H259]] day, [[H3117]] the loss of children, [[H7908]] and widowhood: [[H489]] they shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee in their perfection [[H8537]] for the multitude [[H7230]] of thy sorceries, [[H3785]] for the great [[H3966]] abundance [[H6109]] of thine enchantments. [[H2267]]

### 10
For thou hast trusted [[H982]] in thy wickedness: [[H7451]] thou hast said, [[H559]] None [[H369]] seeth [[H7200]] me. Thy wisdom [[H2451]] and thy knowledge, [[H1847]] it [[H1931]] hath perverted [[H7725]] thee; and thou hast said [[H559]] in thine heart, [[H3820]] I [[H589]] and none else beside [[H657]] me. [[H5750]]

### 11
Therefore shall evil [[H7451]] come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee; thou shalt not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] from whence it riseth: [[H7837]] and mischief [[H1943]] shall fall [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] thee; thou shalt not [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to put it off: [[H3722]] and desolation [[H7722]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee suddenly, [[H6597]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] know. [[H3045]]

### 12
Stand [[H5975]] now [[H4994]] with thine enchantments, [[H2267]] and with the multitude [[H7230]] of thy sorceries, [[H3785]] wherein [[H834]] thou hast laboured [[H3021]] from thy youth; [[H5271]] if so be [[H194]] thou shalt be able [[H3201]] to profit, [[H3276]] if so be [[H194]] thou mayest prevail. [[H6206]]

### 13
Thou art wearied [[H3811]] in the multitude [[H7230]] of thy counsels. [[H6098]] Let now [[H4994]] the astrologers, [[H1895]] the stargazers, [[H2374]] the monthly [[H2320]] prognosticators, [[H3045]] stand up, [[H5975]] and save [[H3467]] thee from that [[H834]] shall come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2009]] they shall be [[H1961]] as stubble; [[H7179]] the fire [[H784]] shall burn [[H8313]] them; they shall not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] themselves [[H5315]] from the power [[H3027]] of the flame: [[H3852]] not [[H369]] a coal [[H1513]] to warm [[H2552]] at, fire [[H217]] to sit [[H3427]] before [[H5048]] it. [[H5048]]

### 15
Thus [[H3651]] shall they be [[H1961]] unto thee with whom [[H834]] thou hast laboured, [[H3021]] thy merchants, [[H5503]] from thy youth: [[H5271]] they shall wander [[H8582]] every one [[H376]] to his quarter; [[H5676]] none [[H369]] shall save [[H3467]] thee. [[H3467]]
