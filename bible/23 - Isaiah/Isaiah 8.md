### 1
Moreover the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Take [[H3947]] thee a great [[H1419]] roll, [[H1549]] and write [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] it with a man's [[H582]] pen [[H2747]] concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. [[H4122]]

### 2
And I took unto me faithful [[H539]] witnesses [[H5707]] to record, [[H5749]] Uriah [[H223]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Zechariah [[H2148]] the son [[H1121]] of Jeberechiah. [[H3000]]

### 3
And I went [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] the prophetess; [[H5031]] and she conceived, [[H2029]] and bare [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] to [[H413]] me, Call [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Maher-shalal-hash-baz. [[H4122]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] before [[H2962]] the child [[H5288]] shall have knowledge [[H3045]] to cry, [[H7121]] My father, [[H1]] and my mother, [[H517]] the riches [[H2428]] of Damascus [[H1834]] and the spoil [[H7998]] of Samaria [[H8111]] shall be taken away [[H5375]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 5
The Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] also unto [[H413]] me again, [[H3254]] saying, [[H559]]

### 6
Forasmuch [[H3282]] as this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] refuseth [[H3988]] the waters [[H4325]] of Shiloah [[H7975]] that go [[H1980]] softly, [[H328]] and rejoice in [[H4885]] Rezin [[H7526]] and Remaliah's [[H7425]] son; [[H1121]]

### 7
Now therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] bringeth up [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]]  them [[H853]] the waters [[H4325]] of the river, [[H5104]] strong [[H6099]] and many, [[H7227]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and all [[H3605]] his glory: [[H3519]] and he shall come up [[H5927]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his channels, [[H650]] and go over [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] his banks: [[H1415]]

### 8
And he shall pass [[H2498]] through Judah; [[H3063]] he shall overflow [[H7857]] and go over, [[H5674]] he shall reach [[H5060]] to [[H5704]] the neck; [[H6677]] and the stretching out [[H4298]] of his wings [[H3671]] shall fill [[H4393]] the breadth [[H7341]] of thy land, [[H776]] O Immanuel. [[H6005]]

### 9
Associate [[H7489]] yourselves, O ye people, [[H5971]] and ye shall be broken in pieces; [[H2865]] and give ear, [[H238]] all [[H3605]] ye of far [[H4801]] countries: [[H776]] gird yourselves, [[H247]] and ye shall be broken in pieces; [[H2865]] gird yourselves, [[H247]] and ye shall be broken in pieces. [[H2865]]

### 10
Take [[H5779]] counsel [[H6098]] together, and it shall come to nought; [[H6565]] speak [[H1696]] the word, [[H1697]] and it shall not [[H3808]] stand: [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] God [[H410]] with us. [[H410]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] thus [[H3541]] to [[H413]] me with a strong [[H2393]] hand, [[H3027]] and instructed [[H3256]] me that I should not walk [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]]

### 12
Say [[H559]] ye not, [[H3808]] A confederacy, [[H7195]] to all [[H3605]] whom [[H834]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] shall say, [[H559]] A confederacy; [[H7195]] neither [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] ye their fear, [[H4172]] nor [[H3808]] be afraid. [[H6206]]

### 13
Sanctify [[H6942]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] himself; and him [[H1931]] your fear, [[H4172]] and him [[H1931]] your dread. [[H6206]]

### 14
And he shall be [[H1961]] for a sanctuary; [[H4720]] but for a stone [[H68]] of stumbling [[H5063]] and for a rock [[H6697]] of offence [[H4383]] to both [[H8147]] the houses [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] for a gin [[H6341]] and for a snare [[H4170]] to the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 15
And many [[H7227]] among them shall stumble, [[H3782]] and fall, [[H5307]] and be broken, [[H7665]] and be snared, [[H3369]] and be taken. [[H3920]]

### 16
Bind up [[H6887]] the testimony, [[H8584]] seal [[H2856]] the law [[H8451]] among my disciples. [[H3928]]

### 17
And I will wait [[H2442]] upon the Lord, [[H3068]] that hideth [[H5641]] his face [[H6440]] from the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and I will look [[H6960]] for him. [[H6960]]

### 18
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] and the children [[H3206]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]] me for signs [[H226]] and for wonders [[H4159]] in Israel [[H3478]] from [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] which dwelleth [[H7931]] in mount [[H2022]] Zion. [[H6726]]

### 19
And when [[H3588]] they shall say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] you, Seek [[H1875]] unto [[H413]] them that have familiar spirits, [[H178]] and unto [[H413]] wizards [[H3049]] that peep, [[H6850]] and that mutter: [[H1897]] should not [[H3808]] a people [[H5971]] seek [[H1875]] unto [[H413]] their God? [[H430]] for [[H1157]] the living [[H2416]] to [[H413]] the dead? [[H4191]]

### 20
To the law [[H8451]] and to the testimony: [[H8584]] if [[H518]] they speak [[H559]] not [[H3808]] according to this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] because [[H834]] no [[H369]] light [[H7837]] in them. [[H7837]]

### 21
And they shall pass [[H5674]] through it, hardly bestead [[H7185]] and hungry: [[H7457]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] that when [[H3588]] they shall be hungry, [[H7456]] they shall fret themselves, [[H7107]] and curse [[H7043]] their king [[H4428]] and their God, [[H430]] and look [[H6437]] upward. [[H4605]]

### 22
And they shall look [[H5027]] unto [[H413]] the earth; [[H776]] and behold [[H2009]] trouble [[H6869]] and darkness, [[H2825]] dimness [[H4588]] of anguish; [[H6695]] and driven [[H5080]] to darkness. [[H653]]
