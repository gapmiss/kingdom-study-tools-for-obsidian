[[Isaiah 19|←]] • [[Isaiah 21|→]]

### 1
In the year [[H8141]] that Tartan [[H8661]] came [[H935]] unto Ashdod, [[H795]] (when Sargon [[H5623]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] sent [[H7971]] him,) and fought [[H3898]] against Ashdod, [[H795]] and took [[H3920]] it; [[H3920]]

### 2
At the same [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] spake [[H1696]] the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H3027]] Isaiah [[H3470]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz, [[H531]] saying, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and loose [[H6605]] the sackcloth [[H8242]] from off [[H5921]] thy loins, [[H4975]] and put off [[H2502]] thy shoe [[H5275]] from [[H5921]] thy foot. [[H7272]] And he did so, [[H6213]] walking [[H1980]] naked [[H6174]] and barefoot. [[H3182]]

### 3
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Like as [[H834]] my servant [[H5650]] Isaiah [[H3470]] hath walked [[H1980]] naked [[H6174]] and barefoot [[H3182]] three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] a sign [[H226]] and wonder [[H4159]] upon [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] and upon [[H5921]] Ethiopia; [[H3568]]

### 4
So [[H3651]] shall the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] lead away [[H5090]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] prisoners, [[H7628]] and the Ethiopians [[H3568]] captives, [[H1546]] young [[H5288]] and old, [[H2205]] naked [[H6174]] and barefoot, [[H3182]] even with buttocks [[H8357]] uncovered, [[H2834]] to the shame [[H6172]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 5
And they shall be afraid [[H2865]] and ashamed [[H954]] of Ethiopia [[H3568]] their expectation, [[H4007]] and of [[H4480]] Egypt [[H4714]] their glory. [[H8597]]

### 6
And the inhabitant [[H3427]] of this [[H2088]] isle [[H339]] shall say [[H559]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] Behold, [[H2009]] such [[H3541]] our expectation, [[H4007]] whither [[H834]] we flee [[H5127]] for help [[H5833]] to be delivered [[H5337]] from [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria: [[H804]] and how [[H349]] shall we [[H587]] escape?
