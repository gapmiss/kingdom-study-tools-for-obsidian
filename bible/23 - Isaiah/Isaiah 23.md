### 1
The burden [[H4853]] of Tyre. [[H6865]] Howl, [[H3213]] ye ships [[H591]] of Tarshish; [[H8659]] for [[H3588]] it is laid waste, [[H7703]] so that there is no house, [[H1004]] no entering in: [[H935]] from the land [[H776]] of Chittim [[H3794]] it is revealed [[H1540]] to them. [[H1540]]

### 2
Be still, [[H1826]] ye inhabitants [[H3427]] of the isle; [[H339]] thou whom the merchants [[H5503]] of Zidon, [[H6721]] that pass over [[H5674]] the sea, [[H3220]] have replenished. [[H4390]]

### 3
And by great [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] the seed [[H2233]] of Sihor, [[H7883]] the harvest [[H7105]] of the river, [[H2975]] her revenue; [[H8393]] and she is [[H1961]] a mart [[H5505]] of nations. [[H1471]]

### 4
Be thou ashamed, [[H954]] O Zidon: [[H6721]] for [[H3588]] the sea [[H3220]] hath spoken, [[H559]] the strength [[H4581]] of the sea, [[H3220]] saying, [[H559]] I travail [[H2342]] not, [[H3808]] nor [[H3808]] bring forth children, [[H3205]] neither [[H3808]] do I nourish up [[H1431]] young men, [[H970]] bring up [[H7311]] virgins. [[H1330]]

### 5
As [[H834]] at the report [[H8088]] concerning Egypt, [[H4714]] shall they be sorely pained [[H2342]] at the report [[H8088]] of Tyre. [[H6865]]

### 6
Pass ye over [[H5674]] to Tarshish; [[H8659]] howl, [[H3213]] ye inhabitants [[H3427]] of the isle. [[H339]]

### 7
this [[H2063]] your joyous [[H5947]] whose antiquity [[H6927]] of ancient [[H6924]] days? [[H3117]] her own feet [[H7272]] shall carry [[H2986]] her afar off [[H7350]] to sojourn. [[H1481]]

### 8
Who [[H4310]] hath taken this counsel [[H3289]] against [[H5921]] Tyre, [[H6865]] the crowning [[H5849]] whose [[H834]] merchants [[H5503]] princes, [[H8269]] whose traffickers [[H3669]] the honourable [[H3513]] of the earth? [[H776]]

### 9
The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath purposed [[H3289]] it, to stain [[H2490]] the pride [[H1347]] of all [[H3605]] glory, [[H6643]] to bring into contempt [[H7043]] all [[H3605]] the honourable [[H3513]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
Pass through [[H5674]] thy land [[H776]] as a river, [[H2975]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Tarshish: [[H8659]] no [[H369]] more [[H5750]] strength. [[H4206]]

### 11
He stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] he shook [[H7264]] the kingdoms: [[H4467]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given a commandment [[H6680]] against [[H413]] the merchant [[H3667]] to destroy [[H8045]] the strong holds [[H4581]] thereof. [[H4581]]

### 12
And he said, [[H559]] Thou shalt no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] rejoice, [[H5937]] O thou oppressed [[H6231]] virgin, [[H1330]] daughter [[H1323]] of Zidon: [[H6721]] arise, [[H6965]] pass over [[H5674]] to Chittim; [[H3794]] there [[H8033]] also [[H1571]] shalt thou have no rest. [[H5117]]

### 13
Behold [[H2005]] the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans; [[H3778]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] was [[H1961]] not, [[H3808]] the Assyrian [[H804]] founded [[H3245]] it for them that dwell in the wilderness: [[H6728]] they set up [[H6965]] the towers [[H971]] thereof, they raised up [[H6209]] the palaces [[H759]] thereof; he brought [[H7760]] it to ruin. [[H4654]]

### 14
Howl, [[H3213]] ye ships [[H591]] of Tarshish: [[H8659]] for [[H3588]] your strength [[H4581]] is laid waste. [[H7703]]

### 15
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] that Tyre [[H6865]] shall be forgotten [[H7911]] seventy [[H7657]] years, [[H8141]] according to the days [[H3117]] of one [[H259]] king: [[H4428]] after the end [[H7093]] of seventy [[H7657]] years [[H8141]] shall Tyre [[H6865]] sing [[H7892]] as an harlot. [[H2181]]

### 16
Take [[H3947]] an harp, [[H3658]] go about [[H5437]] the city, [[H5892]] thou harlot [[H2181]] that hast been forgotten; [[H7911]] make sweet [[H3190]] melody, [[H5059]] sing many [[H7235]] songs, [[H7892]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest be remembered. [[H2142]]

### 17
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] after the end [[H7093]] of seventy [[H7657]] years, [[H8141]] that the Lord [[H3068]] will visit [[H6485]] Tyre, [[H6865]] and she shall turn [[H7725]] to her hire, [[H868]] and shall commit fornication [[H2181]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the world [[H776]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 18
And her merchandise [[H5504]] and her hire [[H868]] shall be [[H1961]] holiness [[H6944]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] it shall not [[H3808]] be treasured [[H686]] nor [[H3808]] laid up; [[H2630]] for [[H3588]] her merchandise [[H5504]] shall be [[H1961]] for them that dwell [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to eat [[H398]] sufficiently, [[H7654]] and for durable [[H6266]] clothing.
