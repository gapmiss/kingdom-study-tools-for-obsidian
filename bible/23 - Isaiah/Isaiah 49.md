### 1
Listen, [[H8085]] O isles, [[H339]] unto [[H413]] me; and hearken, [[H7181]] ye people, [[H3816]] from far; [[H7350]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath called [[H7121]] me from the womb; [[H990]] from the bowels [[H4578]] of my mother [[H517]] hath he made mention [[H2142]] of my name. [[H8034]]

### 2
And he hath made [[H7760]] my mouth [[H6310]] like a sharp [[H2299]] sword; [[H2719]] in the shadow [[H6738]] of his hand [[H3027]] hath he hid [[H2244]] me, and made [[H7760]] me a polished [[H1305]] shaft; [[H2671]] in his quiver [[H827]] hath he hid [[H5641]] me; [[H5641]]

### 3
And said [[H559]] unto me, Thou [[H859]] my servant, [[H5650]] O Israel, [[H3478]] in whom [[H834]] I will be glorified. [[H6286]]

### 4
Then I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] I have laboured [[H3021]] in vain, [[H7385]] I have spent [[H3615]] my strength [[H3581]] for nought, [[H8414]] and in vain: [[H1892]] surely [[H403]] my judgment [[H4941]] with [[H854]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and my work [[H6468]] with [[H854]] my God. [[H430]]

### 5
And now, [[H6258]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] that formed [[H3335]] me from the womb [[H990]] his servant, [[H5650]] to bring [[H7725]] Jacob [[H3290]] again to [[H413]] him, Though Israel [[H3478]] be not gathered, [[H622]] yet shall I be glorious [[H3513]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and my God [[H430]] shall be [[H1961]] my strength. [[H5797]]

### 6
And he said, [[H559]] It is a light thing [[H7043]] that thou shouldest be [[H1961]] my servant [[H5650]] to raise up [[H6965]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and to restore [[H7725]] the preserved [[H5336]] of Israel: [[H3478]] I will also give [[H5414]] thee for a light [[H216]] to the Gentiles, [[H1471]] that thou mayest be [[H1961]] my salvation [[H3444]] unto [[H5704]] the end [[H7097]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 7
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the Redeemer [[H1350]] of Israel, [[H3478]] his Holy One, [[H6918]] to him whom man [[H5315]] despiseth, [[H960]] to him whom the nation [[H1471]] abhorreth, [[H8581]] to a servant [[H5650]] of rulers, [[H4910]] Kings [[H4428]] shall see [[H7200]] and arise, [[H6965]] princes [[H8269]] also shall worship, [[H7812]] because of [[H4616]] the Lord [[H3068]] that [[H834]] is faithful, [[H539]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and he shall choose [[H977]] thee. [[H977]]

### 8
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] In an acceptable [[H7522]] time [[H6256]] have I heard [[H6030]] thee, and in a day [[H3117]] of salvation [[H3444]] have I helped [[H5826]] thee: and I will preserve [[H5341]] thee, and give [[H5414]] thee for a covenant [[H1285]] of the people, [[H5971]] to establish [[H6965]] the earth, [[H776]] to cause to inherit [[H5157]] the desolate [[H8074]] heritages; [[H5159]]

### 9
That thou mayest say [[H559]] to the prisoners, [[H631]] Go forth; [[H3318]] to them that [[H834]] in darkness, [[H2822]] Shew yourselves. [[H1540]] They shall feed [[H7462]] in [[H5921]] the ways, [[H1870]] and their pastures [[H4830]] in all [[H3605]] high places. [[H8205]]

### 10
They shall not [[H3808]] hunger [[H7456]] nor [[H3808]] thirst; [[H6770]] neither [[H3808]] shall the heat [[H8273]] nor sun [[H8121]] smite [[H5221]] them: for [[H3588]] he that hath mercy [[H7355]] on them shall lead [[H5090]] them, even by [[H5921]] the springs [[H4002]] of water [[H4325]] shall he guide [[H5095]] them. [[H5095]]

### 11
And I will make [[H7760]] all [[H3605]] my mountains [[H2022]] a way, [[H1870]] and my highways [[H4546]] shall be exalted. [[H7311]]

### 12
Behold, [[H2009]] these [[H428]] shall come [[H935]] from far: [[H7350]] and, lo, [[H2009]] these [[H428]] from the north [[H6828]] and from the west; [[H3220]] and these [[H428]] from the land [[H776]] of Sinim. [[H5515]]

### 13
Sing, [[H7442]] O heavens; [[H8064]] and be joyful, [[H1523]] O earth; [[H776]] and break forth [[H6476]] into singing, [[H7440]] O mountains: [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath comforted [[H5162]] his people, [[H5971]] and will have mercy [[H7355]] upon his afflicted. [[H6041]]

### 14
But Zion [[H6726]] said, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath forsaken [[H5800]] me, and my Lord [[H136]] hath forgotten [[H7911]] me. [[H7911]]

### 15
Can a woman [[H802]] forget [[H7911]] her sucking child, [[H5764]] that she should not have compassion [[H7355]] on the son [[H1121]] of her womb? [[H990]] yea, [[H1571]] they [[H428]] may forget, [[H7911]] yet will I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] thee. [[H7911]]

### 16
Behold, [[H2005]] I have graven [[H2710]] thee upon [[H5921]] the palms of hands; [[H3709]] thy walls [[H2346]] continually [[H8548]] before [[H5048]] me. [[H5048]]

### 17
Thy children [[H1121]] shall make haste; [[H4116]] thy destroyers [[H2040]] and they that made thee waste [[H2717]] shall go forth [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 18
Lift up [[H5375]] thine eyes [[H5869]] round about, [[H5439]] and behold: [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] these gather themselves together, [[H6908]] come [[H935]] to thee. I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] thou shalt surely [[H3588]] clothe [[H3847]] thee with them all, [[H3605]] as with an ornament, [[H5716]] and bind [[H7194]] them as a bride [[H3618]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] thy waste [[H2723]] and thy desolate places, [[H8074]] and the land [[H776]] of thy destruction, [[H2035]] shall even [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] be too narrow [[H3334]] by reason of the inhabitants, [[H3427]] and they that swallowed thee up [[H1104]] shall be far away. [[H7368]]

### 20
The children [[H1121]] which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost [[H7923]] the other, shall say [[H559]] again [[H5750]] in thine ears, [[H241]] The place [[H4725]] too strait [[H6862]] for me: [[H0]] give place [[H5066]] to me [[H0]] that I may dwell. [[H3427]]

### 21
Then shalt thou say [[H559]] in thine heart, [[H3824]] Who [[H4310]] hath begotten [[H3205]]  me [[H853]] these, [[H428]] seeing I [[H589]] have lost my children, [[H7921]] and am desolate, [[H1565]] a captive, [[H1540]] and removing to and fro? [[H5493]] and who [[H4310]] hath brought up [[H1431]] these? [[H428]] Behold, [[H2005]] I [[H589]] was left [[H7604]] alone; [[H905]] these, [[H428]] where [[H375]] they [[H1992]]

### 22
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2009]] I will lift up [[H5375]] mine hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] the Gentiles, [[H1471]] and set up [[H7311]] my standard [[H5251]] to [[H413]] the people: [[H5971]] and they shall bring [[H935]] thy sons [[H1121]] in arms, [[H2684]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] shall be carried [[H5375]] upon [[H5921]] shoulders. [[H3802]]

### 23
And kings [[H4428]] shall be [[H1961]] thy nursing fathers, [[H539]] and their queens [[H8282]] thy nursing mothers: [[H3243]] they shall bow down [[H7812]] to thee with face [[H639]] toward the earth, [[H776]] and lick up [[H3897]] the dust [[H6083]] of thy feet; [[H7272]] and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for they [[H834]] shall not [[H3808]] be ashamed [[H954]] that wait [[H6960]] for me. [[H6960]]

### 24
Shall the prey [[H4455]] be taken [[H3947]] from the mighty, [[H1368]] or [[H518]] the lawful [[H6662]] captive [[H7628]] delivered? [[H4422]]

### 25
But [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Even [[H1571]] the captives [[H7628]] of the mighty [[H1368]] shall be taken away, [[H3947]] and the prey [[H4455]] of the terrible [[H6184]] shall be delivered: [[H4422]] for I [[H595]] will contend with [[H7378]] him that contendeth with [[H3401]] thee, and I [[H595]] will save [[H3467]] thy children. [[H1121]]

### 26
And I will feed [[H398]] them that oppress [[H3238]]  thee with [[H853]] their own flesh; [[H1320]] and they shall be drunken [[H7937]] with their own blood, [[H1818]] as with sweet wine: [[H6071]] and all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy Saviour [[H3467]] and thy Redeemer, [[H1350]] the mighty One [[H46]] of Jacob.
