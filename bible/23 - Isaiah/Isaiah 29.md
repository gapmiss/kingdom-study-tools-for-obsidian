[[Isaiah 28|←]] • [[Isaiah 30|→]]

### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to Ariel, [[H740]] to Ariel, [[H740]] the city [[H7151]] David [[H1732]] dwelt! [[H2583]] add [[H5595]] ye year [[H8141]] to [[H5921]] year; [[H8141]] let them kill [[H5362]] sacrifices. [[H2282]]

### 2
Yet I will distress [[H6693]] Ariel, [[H740]] and there shall be [[H1961]] heaviness [[H8386]] and sorrow: [[H592]] and it shall be [[H1961]] unto me as Ariel. [[H740]]

### 3
And I will camp [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] thee round about, [[H1754]] and will lay siege [[H6696]] against [[H5921]] thee with a mount, [[H4674]] and I will raise [[H6965]] forts [[H4694]] against [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 4
And thou shalt be brought down, [[H8213]] shalt speak [[H1696]] out of the ground, [[H776]] and thy speech [[H565]] shall be low [[H7817]] out of the dust, [[H6083]] and thy voice [[H6963]] shall be, [[H1961]] as of one that hath a familiar spirit, [[H178]] out of the ground, [[H776]] and thy speech [[H565]] shall whisper [[H6850]] out of the dust. [[H6083]]

### 5
Moreover the multitude [[H1995]] of thy strangers [[H2114]] shall be [[H1961]] like small [[H1851]] dust, [[H80]] and the multitude [[H1995]] of the terrible ones [[H6184]] as chaff [[H4671]] that passeth away: [[H5674]] yea, it shall be [[H1961]] at an instant [[H6621]] suddenly. [[H6597]]

### 6
Thou shalt be visited [[H6485]] of [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] with thunder, [[H7482]] and with earthquake, [[H7494]] and great [[H1419]] noise, [[H6963]] with storm [[H5492]] and tempest, [[H5591]] and the flame [[H3851]] of devouring [[H398]] fire. [[H784]]

### 7
And the multitude [[H1995]] of all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that fight [[H6633]] against [[H5921]] Ariel, [[H740]] even all [[H3605]] that fight [[H6633]] against her and her munition, [[H4685]] and that distress [[H6693]] her, shall be [[H1961]] as a dream [[H2472]] of a night [[H3915]] vision. [[H2377]]

### 8
It shall even be [[H1961]] as when [[H834]] an hungry [[H7457]] dreameth, [[H2492]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he eateth; [[H398]] but he awaketh, [[H6974]] and his soul [[H5315]] is empty: [[H7386]] or as when [[H834]] a thirsty man [[H6771]] dreameth, [[H2492]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he drinketh; [[H8354]] but he awaketh, [[H6974]] and, behold, [[H2009]] faint, [[H5889]] and his soul [[H5315]] hath appetite: [[H8264]] so [[H3651]] shall the multitude [[H1995]] of all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] be, [[H1961]] that fight [[H6633]] against [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Zion. [[H6726]]

### 9
Stay yourselves, [[H4102]] and wonder; [[H8539]] cry ye out, [[H8173]] and cry: [[H8173]] they are drunken, [[H7937]] but not [[H3808]] with wine; [[H3196]] they stagger, [[H5128]] but not [[H3808]] with strong drink. [[H7941]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath poured out [[H5258]] upon [[H5921]] you the spirit [[H7307]] of deep sleep, [[H8639]] and hath closed [[H6105]] your eyes: [[H5869]] the prophets [[H5030]] and your rulers, [[H7218]] the seers [[H2374]] hath he covered. [[H3680]]

### 11
And the vision [[H2380]] of all [[H3605]] is become [[H1961]] unto you as the words [[H1697]] of a book [[H5612]] that is sealed, [[H2856]] which [[H834]] deliver [[H5414]] to [[H413]] one that is learned, [[H3045]] saying, [[H559]] Read [[H7121]] this, [[H2088]] I pray thee: [[H4994]] and he saith, [[H559]] I cannot; [[H3201]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] sealed: [[H2856]]

### 12
And the book [[H5612]] is delivered [[H5414]] to [[H5921]] him that [[H834]] is not learned, [[H3045]] saying, [[H559]] Read [[H7121]] this, [[H2088]] I pray thee: [[H4994]] and he saith, [[H559]] I am not learned. [[H3045]]

### 13
Wherefore the Lord [[H136]] said, [[H559]] Forasmuch [[H3282]] as this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] draw near [[H5066]] with their mouth, [[H6310]] and with their lips [[H8193]] do honour [[H3513]] me, but have removed [[H7368]] their heart [[H3820]] far from [[H4480]] me, and their fear [[H3373]] toward [[H853]] me is [[H1961]] taught [[H3925]] by the precept [[H4687]] of men: [[H376]]

### 14
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I will proceed [[H3254]] to do a marvellous work [[H6381]] among [[H854]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] a marvellous work [[H6381]] and a wonder: [[H6382]] for the wisdom [[H2451]] of their wise [[H2450]] shall perish, [[H6]] and the understanding [[H998]] of their prudent [[H995]] shall be hid. [[H5641]]

### 15
Woe [[H1945]] unto them that seek deep [[H6009]] to hide [[H5641]] their counsel [[H6098]] from the Lord, [[H3068]] and their works [[H4639]] are [[H1961]] in the dark, [[H4285]] and they say, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] seeth [[H7200]] us? and who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] us? [[H3045]]

### 16
Surely [[H518]] your turning of things upside down [[H2017]] shall be esteemed [[H2803]] as the potter's [[H3335]] clay: [[H2563]] for [[H3588]] shall the work [[H4639]] say [[H559]] of him that made [[H6213]] it, He made [[H6213]] me not? [[H3808]] or shall the thing framed [[H3336]] say [[H559]] of him that framed [[H3335]] it, He had no understanding? [[H995]]

### 17
it not [[H3808]] yet [[H5750]] a very [[H4213]] little while, [[H4592]] and Lebanon [[H3844]] shall be turned [[H7725]] into a fruitful field, [[H3759]] and the fruitful field [[H3759]] shall be esteemed [[H2803]] as a forest? [[H3293]]

### 18
And in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall the deaf [[H2795]] hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the book, [[H5612]] and the eyes [[H5869]] of the blind [[H5787]] shall see [[H7200]] out of obscurity, [[H652]] and out of darkness. [[H2822]]

### 19
The meek [[H6035]] also shall increase [[H3254]] joy [[H8057]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] and the poor [[H34]] among men [[H120]] shall rejoice [[H1523]] in the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] the terrible one [[H6184]] is brought to nought, [[H656]] and the scorner [[H3887]] is consumed, [[H3615]] and all [[H3605]] that watch [[H8245]] for iniquity [[H205]] are cut off: [[H3772]]

### 21
That make a man [[H120]] an offender [[H2398]] for a word, [[H1697]] and lay a snare [[H6983]] for him that reproveth [[H3198]] in the gate, [[H8179]] and turn aside [[H5186]] the just [[H6662]] for a thing of nought. [[H8414]]

### 22
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] redeemed [[H6299]] Abraham, [[H85]] concerning [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] Jacob [[H3290]] shall not [[H3808]] now [[H6258]] be ashamed, [[H954]] neither [[H3808]] shall his face [[H6440]] now [[H6258]] wax pale. [[H2357]]

### 23
But when [[H3588]] he seeth [[H7200]] his children, [[H3206]] the work [[H4639]] of mine hands, [[H3027]] in the midst [[H7130]] of him, they shall sanctify [[H6942]] my name, [[H8034]] and sanctify [[H6942]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and shall fear [[H6206]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
They also that erred [[H8582]] in spirit [[H7307]] shall come [[H3045]] to understanding, [[H998]] and they that murmured [[H7279]] shall learn [[H3925]] doctrine. [[H3948]]
