### 1
For Zion's [[H6726]] sake [[H4616]] will I not [[H3808]] hold my peace, [[H2814]] and for Jerusalem's [[H3389]] sake [[H4616]] I will not [[H3808]] rest, [[H8252]] until [[H5704]] the righteousness [[H6664]] thereof go forth [[H3318]] as brightness, [[H5051]] and the salvation [[H3444]] thereof as a lamp [[H3940]] burneth. [[H1197]]

### 2
And the Gentiles [[H1471]] shall see [[H7200]] thy righteousness, [[H6664]] and all [[H3605]] kings [[H4428]] thy glory: [[H3519]] and thou shalt be called [[H7121]] by a new [[H2319]] name, [[H5344]] which [[H834]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall name. [[H8034]]

### 3
Thou shalt also be [[H1961]] a crown [[H5850]] of glory [[H8597]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and a royal [[H4410]] diadem [[H6797]] in the hand [[H3709]] of thy God. [[H430]]

### 4
Thou shalt no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be termed [[H559]] Forsaken; [[H5800]] neither [[H3808]] shall thy land [[H776]] any more [[H5750]] be termed [[H559]] Desolate: [[H8077]] but [[H3588]] thou shalt be called [[H7121]] Hephzibah, [[H2657]] and thy land [[H776]] Beulah: [[H1166]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] delighteth [[H2654]] in thee, and thy land [[H776]] shall be married. [[H1166]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] a young man [[H970]] marrieth [[H1166]] a virgin, [[H1330]] shall thy sons [[H1121]] marry [[H1166]] thee: and the bridegroom [[H2860]] rejoiceth [[H4885]] over [[H5921]] the bride, [[H3618]] shall thy God [[H430]] rejoice [[H7797]] over [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 6
I have set [[H6485]] watchmen [[H8104]] upon [[H5921]] thy walls, [[H2346]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] shall never [[H8548]] hold their peace [[H2814]] day [[H3117]] nor night: [[H3915]] ye that make mention [[H2142]]  of [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] keep not silence, [[H1824]]

### 7
And give [[H5414]] him no [[H408]] rest, [[H1824]] till [[H5704]] he establish, [[H3559]] and till [[H5704]] he make [[H7760]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a praise [[H8416]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] hath sworn [[H7650]] by his right hand, [[H3225]] and by the arm [[H2220]] of his strength, [[H5797]] Surely I will no [[H518]] more [[H5750]] give [[H5414]] thy corn [[H1715]] meat [[H3978]] for thine enemies; [[H341]] and the sons [[H1121]] of the stranger [[H5236]] shall not [[H518]] drink [[H8354]] thy wine, [[H8492]] for the which [[H834]] thou hast laboured: [[H3021]]

### 9
But [[H3588]] they that have gathered [[H622]] it shall eat [[H398]] it, and praise [[H1984]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and they that have brought it together [[H6908]] shall drink [[H8354]] it in the courts [[H2691]] of my holiness. [[H6944]]

### 10
Go through, [[H5674]] go through [[H5674]] the gates; [[H8179]] prepare [[H6437]] ye the way [[H1870]] of the people; [[H5971]] cast up, [[H5549]] cast up [[H5549]] the highway; [[H4546]] gather out [[H5619]] the stones; [[H68]] lift up [[H7311]] a standard [[H5251]] for [[H5921]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath proclaimed [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] the end [[H7097]] of the world, [[H776]] Say [[H559]] ye to the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] Behold, [[H2009]] thy salvation [[H3468]] cometh; [[H935]] behold, [[H2009]] his reward [[H7939]] with [[H854]] him, and his work [[H6468]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 12
And they shall call [[H7121]] them, The holy [[H6944]] people, [[H5971]] The redeemed [[H1350]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and thou shalt be called, [[H7121]] Sought out, [[H1875]] A city [[H5892]] not [[H3808]] forsaken. [[H5800]]
