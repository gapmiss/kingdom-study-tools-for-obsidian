And there shall come forth [[H3318]] a rod [[H2415]] out of the stem [[H1503]] of Jesse, [[H3448]] and a Branch [[H5342]] shall grow [[H6509]] out of his roots: [[H8328]]

### 2
And the spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall rest [[H5117]] upon [[H5921]] him, the spirit [[H7307]] of wisdom [[H2451]] and understanding, [[H998]] the spirit [[H7307]] of counsel [[H6098]] and might, [[H1369]] the spirit [[H7307]] of knowledge [[H1847]] and of the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord; [[H3068]]

### 3
And shall make him of quick understanding [[H7306]] in the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and he shall not [[H3808]] judge [[H8199]] after the sight [[H4758]] of his eyes, [[H5869]] neither [[H3808]] reprove [[H3198]] after the hearing [[H4926]] of his ears: [[H241]]

### 4
But with righteousness [[H6664]] shall he judge [[H8199]] the poor, [[H1800]] and reprove [[H3198]] with equity [[H4334]] for the meek [[H6035]] of the earth: [[H776]] and he shall smite [[H5221]] the earth [[H776]] with the rod [[H7626]] of his mouth, [[H6310]] and with the breath [[H7307]] of his lips [[H8193]] shall he slay [[H4191]] the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 5
And righteousness [[H6664]] shall be [[H1961]] the girdle [[H232]] of his loins, [[H4975]] and faithfulness [[H530]] the girdle [[H232]] of his reins. [[H2504]]

### 6
The wolf [[H2061]] also shall dwell [[H1481]] with [[H5973]] the lamb, [[H3532]] and the leopard [[H5246]] shall lie down [[H7257]] with [[H5973]] the kid; [[H1423]] and the calf [[H5695]] and the young lion [[H3715]] and the fatling [[H4806]] together; [[H3162]] and a little [[H6996]] child [[H5288]] shall lead [[H5090]] them. [[H5090]]

### 7
And the cow [[H6510]] and the bear [[H1677]] shall feed; [[H7462]] their young ones [[H3206]] shall lie down [[H7257]] together: [[H3162]] and the lion [[H738]] shall eat [[H398]] straw [[H8401]] like the ox. [[H1241]]

### 8
And the sucking child [[H3243]] shall play [[H8173]] on [[H5921]] the hole [[H2352]] of the asp, [[H6620]] and the weaned child [[H1580]] shall put [[H1911]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the cockatrice' [[H6848]] den. [[H3975]]

### 9
They shall not [[H3808]] hurt [[H7489]] nor [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] in all [[H3605]] my holy [[H6944]] mountain: [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] the earth [[H776]] shall be full [[H4390]] of the knowledge [[H1844]]  of [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as the waters [[H4325]] cover [[H3680]] the sea. [[H3220]]

### 10
And in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there shall be [[H1961]] a root [[H8328]] of Jesse, [[H3448]] which [[H834]] shall stand [[H5975]] for an ensign [[H5251]] of the people; [[H5971]] to [[H413]] it shall the Gentiles [[H1471]] seek: [[H1875]] and his rest [[H4496]] shall be [[H1961]] glorious. [[H3519]]

### 11
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the Lord [[H136]] shall set his hand [[H3027]] again [[H3254]] the second time [[H8145]] to recover [[H7069]] the remnant [[H7605]] of his people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] shall be left, [[H7604]] from Assyria, [[H804]] and from Egypt, [[H4714]] and from Pathros, [[H6624]] and from Cush, [[H3568]] and from Elam, [[H5867]] and from Shinar, [[H8152]] and from Hamath, [[H2574]] and from the islands [[H339]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 12
And he shall set up [[H5375]] an ensign [[H5251]] for the nations, [[H1471]] and shall assemble [[H622]] the outcasts [[H1760]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and gather together [[H6908]] the dispersed [[H5310]] of Judah [[H3063]] from the four [[H702]] corners [[H3671]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 13
The envy [[H7068]] also of Ephraim [[H669]] shall depart, [[H5493]] and the adversaries [[H6862]] of Judah [[H3063]] shall be cut off: [[H3772]] Ephraim [[H669]] shall not [[H3808]] envy [[H7065]] Judah, [[H3063]] and Judah [[H3063]] shall not [[H3808]] vex [[H6887]] Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 14
But they shall fly [[H5774]] upon the shoulders [[H3802]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] toward the west; [[H3220]] they shall spoil [[H962]] them [[H1121]] of the east [[H6924]] together: [[H3162]] they shall lay [[H4916]] their hand [[H3027]] upon Edom [[H123]] and Moab; [[H4124]] and the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] shall obey them. [[H4928]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall utterly destroy [[H2763]] the tongue [[H3956]] of the Egyptian [[H4714]] sea; [[H3220]] and with his mighty [[H5868]] wind [[H7307]] shall he shake [[H5130]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the river, [[H5104]] and shall smite [[H5221]] it in the seven [[H7651]] streams, [[H5158]] and make go over [[H1869]] dryshod. [[H5275]]

### 16
And there shall be [[H1961]] an highway [[H4546]] for the remnant [[H7605]] of his people, [[H5971]] which [[H834]] shall be left, [[H7604]] from Assyria; [[H804]] like as [[H834]] it was [[H1961]] to Israel [[H3478]] in the day [[H3117]] that he came up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt.
