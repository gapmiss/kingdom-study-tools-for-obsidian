### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to the rebellious [[H5637]] children, [[H1121]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that take [[H6213]] counsel, [[H6098]] but not [[H3808]] of [[H4480]] me; and that cover [[H5258]] with a covering, [[H4541]] but not [[H3808]] of my spirit, [[H7307]] that [[H4616]] they may add [[H5595]] sin [[H2403]] to [[H5921]] sin: [[H2403]]

### 2
That walk [[H1980]] to go down [[H3381]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] and have not [[H3808]] asked [[H7592]] at my mouth; [[H6310]] to strengthen [[H5810]] themselves in the strength [[H4581]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and to trust [[H2620]] in the shadow [[H6738]] of Egypt! [[H4714]]

### 3
Therefore shall the strength [[H4581]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] be [[H1961]] your shame, [[H1322]] and the trust [[H2622]] in the shadow [[H6738]] of Egypt [[H4714]] confusion. [[H3639]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] his princes [[H8269]] were [[H1961]] at Zoan, [[H6814]] and his ambassadors [[H4397]] came [[H5060]] to Hanes. [[H2609]]

### 5
They were all [[H3605]] ashamed [[H3001]] of [[H5921]] a people [[H5971]] could not [[H3808]] profit [[H3276]] them, nor [[H3808]] be an help [[H5828]] nor [[H3808]] profit, [[H3276]] but [[H3588]] a shame, [[H1322]] and also [[H1571]] a reproach. [[H2781]]

### 6
The burden [[H4853]] of the beasts [[H929]] of the south: [[H5045]] into the land [[H776]] of trouble [[H6869]] and anguish, [[H6695]] from whence the young [[H3833]] and old lion, [[H3918]] the viper [[H660]] and fiery flying [[H5774]] serpent, [[H8314]] they will carry [[H5375]] their riches [[H2428]] upon [[H5921]] the shoulders [[H3802]] of young asses, [[H5895]] and their treasures [[H214]] upon [[H5921]] the bunches [[H1707]] of camels, [[H1581]] to [[H5921]] a people [[H5971]] shall not [[H3808]] profit [[H3276]]

### 7
For the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall help [[H5826]] in vain, [[H1892]] and to no purpose: [[H7385]] therefore [[H3651]] have I cried [[H7121]] concerning this, [[H2063]] Their [[H1992]] strength [[H7293]] to sit still. [[H7674]]

### 8
Now [[H6258]] go, [[H935]] write [[H3789]] it before [[H854]] them in [[H5921]] a table, [[H3871]] and note [[H2710]] it in [[H5921]] a book, [[H5612]] that it may be [[H1961]] for the time [[H3117]] to come [[H314]] for [[H5704]] ever [[H5703]] and ever: [[H5769]]

### 9
That [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] a rebellious [[H4805]] people, [[H5971]] lying [[H3586]] children, [[H1121]] children [[H1121]] will [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] the law [[H8451]] of the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 10
Which [[H834]] say [[H559]] to the seers, [[H7200]] See [[H7200]] not; [[H3808]] and to the prophets, [[H2374]] Prophesy [[H2372]] not [[H3808]] unto us right things, [[H5229]] speak [[H1696]] unto us smooth things, [[H2513]] prophesy [[H2372]] deceits: [[H4123]]

### 11
Get you out [[H5493]] of [[H4480]] the way, [[H1870]] turn aside [[H5186]] out of [[H4480]] the path, [[H734]]  cause [[H853]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel [[H3478]] to cease [[H7673]] from before [[H6440]] us. [[H6440]]

### 12
Wherefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Because [[H3282]] ye despise [[H3988]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] and trust [[H982]] in oppression [[H6233]] and perverseness, [[H3868]] and stay [[H8172]] thereon: [[H8172]]

### 13
Therefore [[H3651]] this [[H2088]] iniquity [[H5771]] shall be [[H1961]] to you as a breach [[H6556]] ready to fall, [[H5307]] swelling out [[H1158]] in a high [[H7682]] wall, [[H2346]] whose [[H834]] breaking [[H7667]] cometh [[H935]] suddenly [[H6597]] at an instant. [[H6621]]

### 14
And he shall break [[H7665]] it as the breaking [[H7667]] of the potters' [[H3335]] vessel [[H5035]] that is broken in pieces; [[H3807]] he shall not [[H3808]] spare: [[H2550]] so that there shall not [[H3808]] be found [[H4672]] in the bursting [[H4386]] of it a sherd [[H2789]] to take [[H2846]] fire [[H784]] from the hearth, [[H3344]] or to take [[H2834]] water [[H4325]] out of the pit. [[H1360]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel; [[H3478]] In returning [[H7729]] and rest [[H5183]] shall ye be saved; [[H3467]] in quietness [[H8252]] and in confidence [[H985]] shall be [[H1961]] your strength: [[H1369]] and ye would [[H14]] not. [[H14]]

### 16
But ye said, [[H559]] No; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] we will flee [[H5127]] upon [[H5921]] horses; [[H5483]] therefore [[H5921]] shall ye flee: [[H5127]] and, We will ride [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] the swift; [[H7031]] therefore [[H5921]] shall they that pursue [[H7291]] you be swift. [[H7043]]

### 17
One [[H259]] thousand [[H505]] at [[H6440]] the rebuke [[H1606]] of one; [[H259]] at [[H6440]] the rebuke [[H1606]] of five [[H2568]] shall ye flee: [[H5127]] till [[H5704]] ye be left [[H3498]] as a beacon [[H8650]] upon [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of a mountain, [[H2022]] and as an ensign [[H5251]] on [[H5921]] an hill. [[H1389]]

### 18
And therefore [[H3651]] will the Lord [[H3068]] wait, [[H2442]] that he may be gracious [[H2603]] unto you, and therefore [[H3651]] will he be exalted, [[H7311]] that he may have mercy [[H7355]] upon you: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] a God [[H430]] of judgment: [[H4941]] blessed [[H835]] all [[H3605]] they that wait [[H2442]] for him. [[H2442]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] shall dwell [[H3427]] in Zion [[H6726]] at Jerusalem: [[H3389]] thou shalt weep [[H1058]] no more: [[H1058]] he will be very [[H2603]] gracious [[H2603]] unto thee at the voice [[H6963]] of thy cry; [[H2199]] when he shall hear [[H8085]] it, he will answer [[H6030]] thee. [[H6030]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H136]] give [[H5414]] you the bread [[H3899]] of adversity, [[H6862]] and the water [[H4325]] of affliction, [[H3906]] yet shall not [[H3808]] thy teachers [[H3384]] be removed into a corner [[H3670]] any more, [[H5750]] but thine eyes [[H5869]] shall [[H1961]] see [[H7200]] thy teachers: [[H3384]]

### 21
And thine ears [[H241]] shall hear [[H8085]] a word [[H1697]] behind [[H310]] thee, saying, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] the way, [[H1870]] walk ye in it, [[H3212]] when [[H3588]] ye turn to the right hand, [[H541]] and when [[H3588]] ye turn to the left. [[H8041]]

### 22
Ye shall defile [[H2930]]  also [[H853]] the covering [[H6826]] of thy graven images [[H6456]] of silver, [[H3701]] and the ornament [[H642]] of thy molten images [[H4541]] of gold: [[H2091]] thou shalt cast them away [[H2219]] as [[H3644]] a menstruous cloth; [[H1739]] thou shalt say [[H559]] unto it, Get thee hence. [[H3318]]

### 23
Then shall he give [[H5414]] the rain [[H4306]] of thy seed, [[H2233]] that [[H834]] thou shalt sow [[H2232]] the ground [[H127]] withal; and bread [[H3899]] of the increase [[H8393]] of the earth, [[H127]] and it shall be [[H1961]] fat [[H1879]] and plenteous: [[H8082]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall thy cattle [[H4735]] feed [[H7462]] in large [[H7337]] pastures. [[H3733]]

### 24
The oxen [[H504]] likewise and the young asses [[H5895]] that ear [[H5647]] the ground [[H127]] shall eat [[H398]] clean [[H2548]] provender, [[H1098]] which [[H834]] hath been winnowed [[H2219]] with the shovel [[H7371]] and with the fan. [[H4214]]

### 25
And there shall be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] mountain, [[H2022]] and upon [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H5375]] hill, [[H1389]] rivers [[H6388]] streams [[H2988]] of waters [[H4325]] in the day [[H3117]] of the great [[H7227]] slaughter, [[H2027]] when the towers [[H4026]] fall. [[H5307]]

### 26
Moreover the light [[H216]] of the moon [[H3842]] shall be [[H1961]] as the light [[H216]] of the sun, [[H2535]] and the light [[H216]] of the sun [[H2535]] shall be [[H1961]] sevenfold, [[H7659]] as the light [[H216]] of seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] in the day [[H3117]] that the Lord [[H3068]] bindeth up [[H2280]] the breach [[H7667]] of his people, [[H5971]] and healeth [[H7495]] the stroke [[H4273]] of their wound. [[H4347]]

### 27
Behold, [[H2009]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] cometh [[H935]] from far, [[H4801]] burning [[H1197]] his anger, [[H639]] and the burden [[H4858]] heavy: [[H3514]] his lips [[H8193]] are full [[H4390]] of indignation, [[H2195]] and his tongue [[H3956]] as a devouring [[H398]] fire: [[H784]]

### 28
And his breath, [[H7307]] as an overflowing [[H7857]] stream, [[H5158]] shall reach to the midst [[H2673]] of [[H5704]] the neck, [[H6677]] to sift [[H5130]] the nations [[H1471]] with the sieve [[H5299]] of vanity: [[H7723]] and a bridle [[H7448]] in [[H5921]] the jaws [[H3895]] of the people, [[H5971]] causing to err. [[H8582]]

### 29
Ye shall have [[H1961]] a song, [[H7892]] as in the night [[H3915]] a holy solemnity [[H2282]] is kept; [[H6942]] and gladness [[H8057]] of heart, [[H3824]] as when one goeth [[H1980]] with a pipe [[H2485]] to come [[H935]] into the mountain [[H2022]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to [[H413]] the mighty One [[H6697]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 30
And the Lord [[H3068]]  shall cause [[H853]] his glorious [[H1935]] voice [[H6963]] to be heard, [[H8085]] and shall shew [[H7200]] the lighting down [[H5183]] of his arm, [[H2220]] with the indignation [[H2197]] of anger, [[H639]] and the flame [[H3851]] of a devouring [[H398]] fire, [[H784]] scattering, [[H5311]] and tempest, [[H2230]] and hailstones. [[H68]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] through the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall the Assyrian [[H804]] be beaten down, [[H2865]] smote [[H5221]] with a rod. [[H7626]]

### 32
And every place [[H3605]] where the grounded [[H4145]] staff [[H4294]] shall pass, [[H4569]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall lay [[H5117]] upon [[H5921]] him, shall be [[H1961]] with tabrets [[H8596]] and harps: [[H3658]] and in battles [[H4421]] of shaking [[H8573]] will he fight [[H3898]] with it. [[H3898]]

### 33
For [[H3588]] Tophet [[H8613]] ordained [[H6186]] of old; [[H865]] yea, [[H1571]] for the king [[H4428]] it [[H1931]] is prepared; [[H3559]] he hath made deep [[H6009]] large: [[H7337]] the pile [[H4071]] thereof fire [[H784]] and much [[H7235]] wood; [[H6086]] the breath [[H5397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] like a stream [[H5158]] of brimstone, [[H1614]] doth kindle [[H1197]] it. [[H1197]]
