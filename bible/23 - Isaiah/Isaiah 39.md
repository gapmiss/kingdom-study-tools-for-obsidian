### 1
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Merodach-baladan, [[H4757]] the son [[H1121]] of Baladan, [[H1081]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] and a present [[H4503]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah: [[H2396]] for he had heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] he had been sick, [[H2470]] and was recovered. [[H2388]]

### 2
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] was glad [[H8055]] of [[H5921]] them, and shewed [[H7200]]  them [[H853]] the house [[H1004]] of his precious things, [[H5238]] the silver, [[H3701]] and the gold, [[H2091]] and the spices, [[H1314]] and the precious [[H2896]] ointment, [[H8081]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of his armour, [[H3627]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was found [[H4672]] in his treasures: [[H214]] there was [[H1961]] nothing [[H1697]] in his house, [[H1004]] nor in all [[H3605]] his dominion, [[H4475]] that [[H834]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] shewed them [[H7200]] not. [[H3808]]

### 3
Then came [[H935]] Isaiah [[H3470]] the prophet [[H5030]] unto [[H413]] king [[H4428]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, What [[H4100]] said [[H559]] these [[H428]] men? [[H582]] and from whence [[H370]] came [[H935]] they unto [[H413]] thee? And Hezekiah [[H2396]] said, [[H559]] They are come [[H935]] from a far [[H7350]] country [[H776]] unto [[H413]] me, from Babylon. [[H894]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] he, What [[H4100]] have they seen [[H7200]] in thine house? [[H1004]] And Hezekiah [[H2396]] answered, [[H559]] All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in mine house [[H1004]] have they seen: [[H7200]] there is [[H1961]] nothing [[H1697]] among my treasures [[H214]] that [[H834]] I have not [[H3808]] shewed [[H7200]] them. [[H7200]]

### 5
Then said [[H559]] Isaiah [[H3470]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]]

### 6
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] come, [[H935]] that all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in thine house, [[H1004]] and which [[H834]] thy fathers [[H1]] have laid up in store [[H686]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] shall be carried [[H5375]] to Babylon: [[H894]] nothing [[H1697]] shall be left, [[H3498]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
And of thy sons [[H1121]] that [[H834]] shall issue [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] thee, which [[H834]] thou shalt beget, [[H3205]] shall they take away; [[H3947]] and they shall be [[H1961]] eunuchs [[H5631]] in the palace [[H1964]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 8
Then said [[H559]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] to [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] Good [[H2896]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] thou hast spoken. [[H1696]] He said [[H559]] moreover, For [[H3588]] there shall be [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] and truth [[H571]] in my days. [[H3117]]
