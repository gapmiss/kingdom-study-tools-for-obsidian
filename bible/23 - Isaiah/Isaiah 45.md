### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] to his anointed, [[H4899]] to Cyrus, [[H3566]] whose [[H834]] right hand [[H3225]] I have holden, [[H2388]] to subdue [[H7286]] nations [[H1471]] before [[H6440]] him; and I will loose [[H6605]] the loins [[H4975]] of kings, [[H4428]] to open [[H6605]] before [[H6440]] him the two leaved gates; [[H1817]] and the gates [[H8179]] shall not [[H3808]] be shut; [[H5462]]

### 2
I [[H589]] will go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee, and make the crooked places [[H1921]] straight: [[H3474]] I will break in pieces [[H7665]] the gates [[H1817]] of brass, [[H5154]] and cut in sunder [[H1438]] the bars [[H1280]] of iron: [[H1270]]

### 3
And I will give [[H5414]] thee the treasures [[H214]] of darkness, [[H2822]] and hidden riches [[H4301]] of secret places, [[H4565]] that [[H4616]] thou mayest know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which call [[H7121]] by thy name, [[H8034]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
For Jacob [[H3290]] my servant's [[H5650]] sake, [[H4616]] and Israel [[H3478]] mine elect, [[H972]] I have even called [[H7121]] thee by thy name: [[H8034]] I have surnamed [[H3655]] thee, though thou hast not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] me. [[H3045]]

### 5
I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and none [[H369]] else, [[H5750]] no [[H369]] God [[H430]] beside [[H2108]] me: I girded [[H247]] thee, though thou hast not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] me: [[H3045]]

### 6
That [[H4616]] they may know [[H3045]] from the rising [[H4217]] of the sun, [[H8121]] and from the west, [[H4628]] that [[H3588]] none [[H657]] beside [[H1107]] me. I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and none [[H369]] else. [[H369]]

### 7
I form [[H3335]] the light, [[H216]] and create [[H1254]] darkness: [[H2822]] I make [[H6213]] peace, [[H7965]] and create [[H1254]] evil: [[H7451]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]]

### 8
Drop down, [[H7491]] ye heavens, [[H8064]] from above, [[H4605]] and let the skies [[H7834]] pour down [[H5140]] righteousness: [[H6664]] let the earth [[H776]] open, [[H6605]] and let them bring forth [[H6509]] salvation, [[H3468]] and let righteousness [[H6666]] spring up [[H6779]] together; [[H3162]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have created [[H1254]] it. [[H1254]]

### 9
Woe [[H1945]] unto him that striveth [[H7378]] with [[H853]] his Maker! [[H3335]] the potsherd [[H2789]] with [[H853]] the potsherds [[H2789]] of the earth. [[H127]] Shall the clay [[H2563]] say [[H559]] to him that fashioneth [[H3335]] it, What [[H4100]] makest [[H6213]] thou? or thy work, [[H6467]] He hath no [[H369]] hands? [[H3027]]

### 10
Woe [[H1945]] unto him that saith [[H559]] unto father, [[H1]] What [[H4100]] begettest [[H3205]] thou? or to the woman, [[H802]] What [[H4100]] hast thou brought forth? [[H2342]]

### 11
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and his Maker, [[H3335]] Ask [[H7592]] me of things to come [[H857]] concerning [[H5921]] my sons, [[H1121]] and concerning [[H5921]] the work [[H6467]] of my hands [[H3027]] command [[H6680]] ye me. [[H6680]]

### 12
I [[H595]] have made [[H6213]] the earth, [[H776]] and created [[H1254]] man [[H120]] upon [[H5921]] it: I, [[H589]] my hands, [[H3027]] have stretched out [[H5186]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and all [[H3605]] their host [[H6635]] have I commanded. [[H6680]]

### 13
I [[H595]] have raised him up [[H5782]] in righteousness, [[H6664]] and I will direct [[H3474]] all [[H3605]] his ways: [[H1870]] he [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] my city, [[H5892]] and he shall let go [[H7971]] my captives, [[H1546]] not [[H3808]] for price [[H4242]] nor [[H3808]] reward, [[H7810]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 14
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] The labour [[H3018]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and merchandise [[H5505]] of Ethiopia [[H3568]] and of the Sabeans, [[H5436]] men [[H376]] of stature, [[H4060]] shall come over [[H5674]] unto [[H5921]] thee, and they shall be [[H1961]] thine: they shall come [[H1980]] after [[H310]] thee; in chains [[H2131]] they shall come over, [[H5674]] and they shall fall down [[H7812]] unto [[H413]] thee, they shall make supplication [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] thee, Surely [[H389]] God [[H410]] in thee; and none [[H369]] else, [[H5750]] no [[H657]] God. [[H430]]

### 15
Verily [[H403]] thou [[H859]] a God [[H410]] that hidest thyself, [[H5641]] O God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the Saviour. [[H3467]]

### 16
They shall be ashamed, [[H954]] and also [[H1571]] confounded, [[H3637]] all [[H3605]] of them: they shall go [[H1980]] to confusion [[H3639]] together [[H3162]] makers [[H2796]] of idols. [[H6736]]

### 17
Israel [[H3478]] shall be saved [[H3467]] in the Lord [[H3068]] with an everlasting [[H5769]] salvation: [[H8668]] ye shall not [[H3808]] be ashamed [[H954]] nor [[H3808]] confounded [[H3637]] world [[H5769]] without end. [[H5703]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] that created [[H1254]] the heavens; [[H8064]] God [[H430]] himself [[H1931]] that formed [[H3335]] the earth [[H776]] and made [[H6213]] it; he [[H1931]] hath established [[H3559]] it, he created [[H1254]] it not [[H3808]] in vain, [[H8414]] he formed [[H3335]] it to be inhabited: [[H3427]] I [[H589]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and none [[H369]] else. [[H369]]

### 19
I have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] in secret, [[H5643]] in a dark [[H2822]] place [[H4725]] of the earth: [[H776]] I said [[H559]] not [[H3808]] unto the seed [[H2233]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] Seek [[H1245]] ye me in vain: [[H8414]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] speak [[H1696]] righteousness, [[H6664]] I declare [[H5046]] things that are right. [[H4339]]

### 20
Assemble yourselves [[H6908]] and come; [[H935]] draw near [[H5066]] together, [[H3162]] ye escaped [[H6412]] of the nations: [[H1471]] they have no knowledge [[H3045]] that set up [[H5375]] the wood [[H6086]] of their graven image, [[H6459]] and pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] a god [[H410]] cannot [[H3808]] save. [[H3467]]

### 21
Tell [[H5046]] ye, and bring near; [[H5066]] yea, [[H637]] let them take counsel [[H3289]] together: [[H3162]] who [[H4310]] hath declared [[H8085]] this [[H2063]] from ancient time? [[H6924]] hath told [[H5046]] it from that time? [[H227]] not [[H3808]] I [[H589]] the Lord? [[H3068]] and no [[H369]] God [[H430]] else [[H5750]] beside [[H1107]] me; a just [[H6662]] God [[H410]] and a Saviour; [[H3467]] none [[H369]] beside [[H2108]] me. [[H2108]]

### 22
Look [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] me, and be ye saved, [[H3467]] all [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] God, [[H410]] and none [[H369]] else. [[H369]]

### 23
I have sworn [[H7650]] by myself, the word [[H1697]] is gone out [[H3318]] of my mouth [[H6310]] righteousness, [[H6666]] and shall not [[H3808]] return, [[H7725]] That [[H3588]] unto me every [[H3605]] knee [[H1290]] shall bow, [[H3766]] every [[H3605]] tongue [[H3956]] shall swear. [[H7650]]

### 24
Surely, [[H389]] shall say, [[H559]] in the Lord [[H3068]] have I righteousness [[H6666]] and strength: [[H5797]] to [[H5704]] him shall come; [[H935]] and all [[H3605]] that are incensed [[H2734]] against him shall be ashamed. [[H954]]

### 25
In the Lord [[H3068]] shall all [[H3605]] the seed [[H2233]] of Israel [[H3478]] be justified, [[H6663]] and shall glory. [[H1984]]
