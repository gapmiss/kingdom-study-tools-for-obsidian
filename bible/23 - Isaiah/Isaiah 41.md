# Isaiah 41

[[Isaiah 40|←]] • [[Isaiah 42|→]]

---

### 1
Keep silence [[H2790]] before [[H413]] me, O islands; [[H339]] and let the people [[H3816]] renew [[H2498]] strength: [[H3581]] let them come near; [[H5066]] then [[H227]] let them speak: [[H1696]] let us come near [[H7126]] together [[H3162]] to judgment. [[H4941]]

### 2
Who [[H4310]] raised up [[H5782]] the righteous [[H6664]] from the east, [[H4217]] called [[H7121]] him to his foot, [[H7272]] gave [[H5414]] the nations [[H1471]] before [[H6440]] him, and made rule [[H7287]] over kings? [[H4428]] he gave [[H5414]] as the dust [[H6083]] to his sword, [[H2719]] as driven [[H5086]] stubble [[H7179]] to his bow. [[H7198]]

### 3
He pursued [[H7291]] them, passed [[H5674]] safely; [[H7965]] by the way [[H734]] he had not [[H3808]] gone [[H935]] with his feet. [[H7272]]

### 4
Who [[H4310]] hath wrought [[H6466]] and done [[H6213]] calling [[H7121]] the generations [[H1755]] from the beginning? [[H7218]] I [[H589]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the first, [[H7223]] and with [[H853]] the last; [[H314]] I [[H589]] he. [[H589]]

### 5
The isles [[H339]] saw [[H7200]] and feared; [[H3372]] the ends [[H7098]] of the earth [[H776]] were afraid, [[H2729]] drew near, [[H7126]] and came. [[H857]]

### 6
They helped [[H5826]] every one [[H376]] his neighbour; [[H7453]] and said [[H559]] to his brother, [[H251]] Be of good courage. [[H2388]]

### 7
So the carpenter [[H2796]] encouraged [[H2388]] the goldsmith, [[H6884]] he that smootheth [[H2505]] the hammer [[H6360]] him that smote [[H1986]] the anvil, [[H6471]] saying, [[H559]] It [[H1931]] ready [[H2896]] for the sodering: [[H1694]] and he fastened [[H2388]] it with nails, [[H4548]] it should not [[H3808]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 8
But thou, [[H859]] Israel, [[H3478]] my servant, [[H5650]] Jacob [[H3290]] whom [[H834]] I have chosen, [[H977]] the seed [[H2233]] of Abraham [[H85]] my friend. [[H157]]

### 9
whom [[H834]] I have taken [[H2388]] from the ends [[H7098]] of the earth, [[H776]] and called [[H7121]] thee from the chief men [[H678]] thereof, and said [[H559]] unto thee, Thou [[H859]] my servant; [[H5650]] I have chosen [[H977]] thee, and not [[H3808]] cast thee away. [[H3988]]

### 10
Fear [[H3372]] thou not; [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] with [[H5973]] thee: be not [[H408]] dismayed; [[H8159]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] thy God: [[H430]] I will strengthen [[H553]] thee; yea, [[H637]] I will help [[H5826]] thee; yea, [[H637]] I will uphold [[H8551]] thee with the right hand [[H3225]] of my righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] they that were incensed [[H2734]] against thee shall be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded: [[H3637]] they shall be [[H1961]] as nothing; [[H369]] and they [[H376]] that strive [[H7379]] with thee shall perish. [[H6]]

### 12
Thou shalt seek [[H1245]] them, and shalt not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] them, [[H376]] them that contended [[H4695]] with thee: they [[H376]] that war [[H4421]] against thee shall be [[H1961]] as nothing, [[H369]] and as a thing of nought. [[H657]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] will hold [[H2388]] thy right hand, [[H3225]] saying [[H559]] unto thee, Fear [[H3372]] not; [[H408]] I [[H589]] will help [[H5826]] thee. [[H5826]]

### 14
Fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] thou worm [[H8438]] Jacob, [[H3290]] ye men [[H4962]] of Israel; [[H3478]] I [[H589]] will help [[H5826]] thee, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and thy redeemer, [[H1350]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
Behold, [[H2009]] I will make [[H7760]] thee a new [[H2319]] sharp [[H2742]] threshing instrument [[H4173]] having [[H1167]] teeth: [[H6374]] thou shalt thresh [[H1758]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and beat small, [[H1854]] and shalt make [[H7760]] the hills [[H1389]] as chaff. [[H4671]]

### 16
Thou shalt fan [[H2219]] them, and the wind [[H7307]] shall carry them away, [[H5375]] and the whirlwind [[H5591]] shall scatter [[H6327]] them: and thou [[H859]] shalt rejoice [[H1523]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] shalt glory [[H1984]] in the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
the poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] seek [[H1245]] water, [[H4325]] and none, [[H369]] their tongue [[H3956]] faileth [[H5405]] for thirst, [[H6772]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] will hear them, [[H6030]] the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] will not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] them. [[H5800]]

### 18
I will open [[H6605]] rivers [[H5104]] in [[H5921]] high places, [[H8205]] and fountains [[H4599]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the valleys: [[H1237]] I will make [[H7760]] the wilderness [[H4057]] a pool [[H98]] of water, [[H4325]] and the dry [[H6723]] land [[H776]] springs [[H4161]] of water. [[H4325]]

### 19
I will plant [[H5414]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] the cedar, [[H730]] the shittah tree, [[H7848]] and the myrtle, [[H1918]] and the oil [[H8081]] tree; [[H6086]] I will set [[H7760]] in the desert [[H6160]] the fir tree, [[H1265]] the pine, [[H8410]] and the box tree [[H8391]] together: [[H3162]]

### 20
That [[H4616]] they may see, [[H7200]] and know, [[H3045]] and consider, [[H7760]] and understand [[H7919]] together, [[H3162]] that [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] and the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel [[H3478]] hath created [[H1254]] it. [[H1254]]

### 21
Produce [[H7126]] your cause, [[H7379]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] bring forth [[H5066]] your strong [[H6110]] saith [[H559]] the King [[H4428]] of Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 22
Let them bring forth, [[H5066]] and shew [[H5046]]  us [[H853]] what [[H834]] shall happen: [[H7136]] let them shew [[H5046]] the former things, [[H7223]] what [[H4100]] they [[H2007]] that we may consider [[H7760]] them, and know [[H3045]] the latter end [[H319]] of them; or [[H176]] declare [[H8085]] us things for to come. [[H935]]

### 23
Shew [[H5046]] the things that are to come [[H857]] hereafter, [[H268]] that we may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] gods: [[H430]] yea, [[H637]] do good, [[H3190]] or do evil, [[H7489]] that we may be dismayed, [[H8159]] and behold [[H7200]] together. [[H3162]]

### 24
Behold, [[H2005]] ye [[H859]] of nothing, [[H369]] and your work [[H6467]] of nought: [[H659]] an abomination [[H8441]] chooseth [[H977]] you. [[H977]]

### 25
I have raised up [[H5782]] from the north, [[H6828]] and he shall come: [[H857]] from the rising [[H4217]] of the sun [[H8121]] shall he call [[H7121]] upon my name: [[H8034]] and he shall come [[H935]] upon princes [[H5461]] as [[H3644]] morter, [[H2563]] and as [[H3644]] the potter [[H3335]] treadeth [[H7429]] clay. [[H2916]]

### 26
Who [[H4310]] hath declared [[H5046]] from the beginning, [[H7218]] that we may know? [[H3045]] and beforetime, [[H6440]] that we may say, [[H559]] righteous? [[H6662]] yea, [[H637]] none [[H369]] that sheweth, [[H5046]] yea, [[H637]] none [[H369]] that declareth, [[H8085]] yea, [[H637]] none [[H369]] that heareth [[H8085]] your words. [[H561]]

### 27
The first [[H7223]] to Zion, [[H6726]] Behold, behold [[H2009]] them: and I will give [[H5414]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] one that bringeth good tidings. [[H1319]]

### 28
For I beheld, [[H7200]] and no [[H369]] man; [[H376]] even among them, [[H428]] and no [[H369]] counseller, [[H3289]] that, when I asked [[H7592]] of them, could answer [[H7725]] a word. [[H1697]]

### 29
Behold, [[H2005]] they all [[H3605]] vanity; [[H205]] their works [[H4639]] nothing: [[H657]] their molten images [[H5262]] wind [[H7307]] and confusion. [[H8414]]
