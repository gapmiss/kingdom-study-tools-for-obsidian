[[Isaiah 34|←]] • [[Isaiah 36|→]]

---

### 1
The wilderness [[H4057]] and the solitary place [[H6723]] shall be glad [[H7797]] for them; and the desert [[H6160]] shall rejoice, [[H1523]] and blossom [[H6524]] as the rose. [[H2261]]

### 2
It shall blossom [[H6524]] abundantly, [[H6524]] and rejoice [[H1523]] even [[H637]] with joy [[H1525]] and singing: [[H7442]] the glory [[H3519]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] shall be given [[H5414]] unto it, the excellency [[H1926]] of Carmel [[H3760]] and Sharon, [[H8289]] they [[H1992]] shall see [[H7200]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the excellency [[H1926]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 3
Strengthen [[H2388]] ye the weak [[H7504]] hands, [[H3027]] and confirm [[H553]] the feeble [[H3782]] knees. [[H1290]]

### 4
Say [[H559]] to them of a fearful [[H4116]] heart, [[H3820]] Be strong, [[H2388]] fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] behold, [[H2009]] your God [[H430]] will come [[H935]] vengeance, [[H5359]] God [[H430]] a recompence; [[H1576]] he [[H1931]] will come [[H935]] and save [[H3467]] you. [[H3467]]

### 5
Then [[H227]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the blind [[H5787]] shall be opened, [[H6491]] and the ears [[H241]] of the deaf [[H2795]] shall be unstopped. [[H6605]]

### 6
Then [[H227]] shall the lame [[H6455]] leap [[H1801]] as an hart, [[H354]] and the tongue [[H3956]] of the dumb [[H483]] sing: [[H7442]] for [[H3588]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] shall waters [[H4325]] break out, [[H1234]] and streams [[H5158]] in the desert. [[H6160]]

### 7
And the parched ground [[H8273]] shall become [[H1961]] a pool, [[H98]] and the thirsty land [[H6774]] springs [[H4002]] of water: [[H4325]] in the habitation [[H5116]] of dragons, [[H8577]] where each lay, [[H7258]] grass [[H2682]] with reeds [[H7070]] and rushes. [[H1573]]

### 8
And an highway [[H4547]] shall be [[H1961]] there, [[H8033]] and a way, [[H1870]] and it shall be called [[H7121]] The way [[H1870]] of holiness; [[H6944]] the unclean [[H2931]] shall not [[H3808]] pass over [[H5674]] it; but it [[H1931]] for those: the wayfaring men, [[H1980]] though fools, [[H191]] shall not [[H3808]] err [[H8582]]

### 9
No [[H3808]] lion [[H738]] shall be [[H1961]] there, [[H8033]] nor [[H1077]] ravenous [[H6530]] beast [[H2416]] shall go up [[H5927]] thereon, it shall not [[H3808]] be found [[H4672]] there; [[H8033]] but the redeemed [[H1350]] shall walk [[H1980]]

### 10
And the ransomed [[H6299]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall return, [[H7725]] and come [[H935]] to Zion [[H6726]] with songs [[H7440]] and everlasting [[H5769]] joy [[H8057]] upon [[H5921]] their heads: [[H7218]] they shall obtain [[H5381]] joy [[H8057]] and gladness, [[H8342]] and sorrow [[H3015]] and sighing [[H585]] shall flee away.
