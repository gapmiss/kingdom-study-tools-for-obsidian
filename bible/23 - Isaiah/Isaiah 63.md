### 1
Who [[H4310]] this [[H2088]] that cometh [[H935]] from Edom, [[H123]] with dyed [[H2556]] garments [[H899]] from Bozrah? [[H1224]] this [[H2088]] glorious [[H1921]] in his apparel, [[H3830]] travelling [[H6808]] in the greatness [[H7230]] of his strength? [[H3581]] I [[H589]] that speak [[H1696]] in righteousness, [[H6666]] mighty [[H7227]] to save. [[H3467]]

### 2
Wherefore [[H4069]] red [[H122]] in thine apparel, [[H3830]] and thy garments [[H899]] like him that treadeth [[H1869]] in the winefat? [[H1660]]

### 3
I have trodden [[H1869]] the winepress [[H6333]] alone; [[H905]] and of the people [[H5971]] none [[H376]] with [[H854]] me: for I will tread [[H1869]] them in mine anger, [[H639]] and trample [[H7429]] them in my fury; [[H2534]] and their blood [[H5332]] shall be sprinkled [[H5137]] upon [[H5921]] my garments, [[H899]] and I will stain [[H1351]] all [[H3605]] my raiment. [[H4403]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of vengeance [[H5359]] in mine heart, [[H3820]] and the year [[H8141]] of my redeemed [[H1350]] is come. [[H935]]

### 5
And I looked, [[H5027]] and none [[H369]] to help; [[H5826]] and I wondered [[H8074]] that none [[H369]] to uphold: [[H5564]] therefore mine own arm [[H2220]] brought salvation [[H3467]] unto me; and my fury, [[H2534]] it [[H1931]] upheld [[H5564]] me. [[H5564]]

### 6
And I will tread down [[H947]] the people [[H5971]] in mine anger, [[H639]] and make them drunk [[H7937]] in my fury, [[H2534]] and I will bring down [[H3381]] their strength [[H5332]] to the earth. [[H776]]

### 7
I will mention [[H2142]] the lovingkindnesses [[H2617]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the praises [[H8416]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] according [[H5921]] to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath bestowed [[H1580]] on us, and the great [[H7227]] goodness [[H2898]] toward the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] he hath bestowed [[H1580]] on them according to his mercies, [[H7356]] and according to the multitude [[H7230]] of his lovingkindnesses. [[H2617]]

### 8
For he said, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] they [[H1992]] my people, [[H5971]] children [[H1121]] will not [[H3808]] lie: [[H8266]] so he was [[H1961]] their Saviour. [[H3467]]

### 9
In all [[H3605]] their affliction [[H6869]] he was afflicted, [[H6862]] and the angel [[H4397]] of his presence [[H6440]] saved [[H3467]] them: in his love [[H160]] and in his pity [[H2551]] he [[H1931]] redeemed [[H1350]] them; and he bare [[H5190]] them, and carried [[H5375]] them all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of old. [[H5769]]

### 10
But they [[H1992]] rebelled, [[H4784]] and vexed [[H6087]] his holy [[H6944]] Spirit: [[H7307]] therefore he was turned [[H2015]] to be their enemy, [[H341]] he [[H1931]] fought [[H3898]] against them. [[H3898]]

### 11
Then he remembered [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of old, [[H5769]] Moses, [[H4872]] his people, [[H5971]] Where [[H346]] he that brought them up [[H5927]] out of the sea [[H3220]] with [[H854]] the shepherd [[H7462]] of his flock? [[H6629]] where [[H346]] he that put [[H7760]] his holy [[H6944]] Spirit [[H7307]] within [[H7130]] him? [[H7130]]

### 12
That led [[H1980]] by the right hand [[H3225]] of Moses [[H4872]] with his glorious [[H8597]] arm, [[H2220]] dividing [[H1234]] the water [[H4325]] before [[H6440]] them, to make [[H6213]] himself an everlasting [[H5769]] name? [[H8034]]

### 13
That led [[H1980]] them through the deep, [[H8415]] as an horse [[H5483]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] they should not [[H3808]] stumble? [[H3782]]

### 14
As a beast [[H929]] goeth down [[H3381]] into the valley, [[H1237]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] caused him to rest: [[H5117]] so [[H3651]] didst thou lead [[H5090]] thy people, [[H5971]] to make [[H6213]] thyself a glorious [[H8597]] name. [[H8034]]

### 15
Look down [[H5027]] from heaven, [[H8064]] and behold [[H7200]] from the habitation [[H2073]] of thy holiness [[H6944]] and of thy glory: [[H8597]] where [[H346]] thy zeal [[H7068]] and thy strength, [[H1369]] the sounding [[H1995]] of thy bowels [[H4578]] and of thy mercies [[H7356]] toward [[H413]] me? are they restrained? [[H662]]

### 16
Doubtless [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] our father, [[H1]] though [[H3588]] Abraham [[H85]] be ignorant [[H3808]] of us, and Israel [[H3478]] acknowledge [[H5234]] us not: [[H3808]] thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] our father, [[H1]] our redeemer; [[H1350]] thy name [[H8034]] from everlasting. [[H5769]]

### 17
O Lord, [[H3068]] why [[H4100]] hast thou made us to err [[H8582]] from thy ways, [[H1870]] hardened [[H7188]] our heart [[H3820]] from thy fear? [[H3374]] Return [[H7725]] for thy servants' [[H5650]] sake, [[H4616]] the tribes [[H7626]] of thine inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 18
The people [[H5971]] of thy holiness [[H6944]] have possessed [[H3423]] but a little while: [[H4705]] our adversaries [[H6862]] have trodden down [[H947]] thy sanctuary. [[H4720]]

### 19
We are [[H1961]] thou never [[H5769]] barest rule [[H4910]] over them; they were not [[H3808]] called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] thy name. [[H8034]]
