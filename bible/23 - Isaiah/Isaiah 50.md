### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Where [[H335]] the bill [[H5612]] of your mother's [[H517]] divorcement, [[H3748]] whom [[H834]] I have put away? [[H7971]] or [[H176]] which [[H4310]] of my creditors [[H5383]] to whom [[H834]] I have sold [[H4376]] you? Behold, [[H2005]] for your iniquities [[H5771]] have ye sold yourselves, [[H4376]] and for your transgressions [[H6588]] is your mother [[H517]] put away. [[H7971]]

### 2
Wherefore, [[H4069]] when I came, [[H935]] no [[H369]] man? [[H376]] when I called, [[H7121]] none [[H369]] to answer? [[H6030]] Is my hand [[H3027]] shortened [[H7114]] at all, [[H7114]] that it cannot redeem? [[H6304]] or [[H518]] have I no [[H369]] power [[H3581]] to deliver? [[H5337]] behold, [[H2005]] at my rebuke [[H1606]] I dry up [[H2717]] the sea, [[H3220]] I make [[H7760]] the rivers [[H5104]] a wilderness: [[H4057]] their fish [[H1710]] stinketh, [[H887]] because no [[H369]] water, [[H4325]] and dieth [[H4191]] for thirst. [[H6772]]

### 3
I clothe [[H3847]] the heavens [[H8064]] with blackness, [[H6940]] and I make [[H7760]] sackcloth [[H8242]] their covering. [[H3682]]

### 4
The Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] hath given [[H5414]] me the tongue [[H3956]] of the learned, [[H3928]] that I should know [[H3045]] how to speak [[H5790]] a word [[H1697]]  in season to [[H853]] weary: [[H3287]] he wakeneth [[H5782]] morning [[H1242]] by morning, [[H1242]] he wakeneth [[H5782]] mine ear [[H241]] to hear [[H8085]] as the learned. [[H3928]]

### 5
The Lord [[H136]] God [[H3068]] hath opened [[H6605]] mine ear, [[H241]] and I [[H595]] was not [[H3808]] rebellious, [[H4784]] neither [[H3808]] turned away [[H5472]] back. [[H268]]

### 6
I gave [[H5414]] my back [[H1460]] to the smiters, [[H5221]] and my cheeks [[H3895]] to them that plucked off the hair: [[H4803]] I hid [[H5641]] not [[H3808]] my face [[H6440]] from shame [[H3639]] and spitting. [[H7536]]

### 7
For the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] will help [[H5826]] me; therefore [[H5921]] shall I not [[H3808]] be confounded: [[H3637]] therefore [[H5921]] have I set [[H7760]] my face [[H6440]] like a flint, [[H2496]] and I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I shall not [[H3808]] be ashamed. [[H954]]

### 8
near [[H7138]] that justifieth [[H6663]] me; who [[H4310]] will contend [[H7378]] with [[H854]] me? let us stand [[H5975]] together: [[H3162]] who [[H4310]] mine adversary? [[H1167]] let him come near [[H5066]] to [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 9
Behold, [[H2005]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] will help [[H5826]] me; who [[H4310]] he [[H1931]] shall condemn [[H7561]] me? lo, [[H2005]] they all [[H3605]] shall wax old [[H1086]] as a garment; [[H899]] the moth [[H6211]] shall eat them up. [[H398]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] among you that feareth [[H3373]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that obeyeth [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of his servant, [[H5650]] that [[H834]] walketh [[H1980]] darkness, [[H2825]] and hath no [[H369]] light? [[H5051]] let him trust [[H982]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and stay [[H8172]] upon his God. [[H430]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] ye that kindle [[H6919]] a fire, [[H784]] that compass about [[H247]] with sparks: [[H2131]] walk [[H1980]] in the light [[H217]] of your fire, [[H784]] and in the sparks [[H2131]] ye have kindled. [[H1197]] This [[H2063]] shall ye have [[H1961]] of mine hand; [[H3027]] ye shall lie down [[H7901]] in sorrow. [[H4620]]
