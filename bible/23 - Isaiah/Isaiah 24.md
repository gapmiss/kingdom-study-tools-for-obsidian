[[Isaiah 23|←]] • [[Isaiah 25|→]]

---

### 1
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] maketh the earth [[H776]] empty, [[H1238]] and maketh it waste, [[H1110]] and turneth [[H5753]] it upside down, [[H6440]] and scattereth abroad [[H6327]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof. [[H3427]]

### 2
And it shall be, [[H1961]] as with the people, [[H5971]] so with the priest; [[H3548]] as with the servant, [[H5650]] so with his master; [[H113]] as with the maid, [[H8198]] so with her mistress; [[H1404]] as with the buyer, [[H7069]] so with the seller; [[H4376]] as with the lender, [[H3867]] so with the borrower; [[H3867]] as with the taker of usury, [[H5383]] so [[H834]] with the giver of usury [[H5378]] to him. [[H5378]]

### 3
The land [[H776]] shall be utterly [[H1238]] emptied, [[H1238]] and utterly [[H962]] spoiled: [[H962]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] word. [[H1697]]

### 4
The earth [[H776]] mourneth [[H56]] fadeth away, [[H5034]] the world [[H8398]] languisheth [[H535]] fadeth away, [[H5034]] the haughty [[H4791]] people [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] do languish. [[H535]]

### 5
The earth [[H776]] also is defiled [[H2610]] under [[H8478]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof; because [[H3588]] they have transgressed [[H5674]] the laws, [[H8451]] changed [[H2498]] the ordinance, [[H2706]] broken [[H6565]] the everlasting [[H5769]] covenant. [[H1285]]

### 6
Therefore [[H5921]] hath the curse [[H423]] devoured [[H398]] the earth, [[H776]] and they that dwell [[H3427]] therein are desolate: [[H816]] therefore [[H5921]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth [[H776]] are burned, [[H2787]] and few [[H4213]] men [[H582]] left. [[H7604]]

### 7
The new wine [[H8492]] mourneth, [[H56]] the vine [[H1612]] languisheth, [[H535]] all [[H3605]] the merryhearted [[H8056]] do sigh. [[H584]]

### 8
The mirth [[H4885]] of tabrets [[H8596]] ceaseth, [[H7673]] the noise [[H7588]] of them that rejoice [[H5947]] endeth, [[H2308]] the joy [[H4885]] of the harp [[H3658]] ceaseth. [[H7673]]

### 9
They shall not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] with a song; [[H7892]] strong drink [[H7941]] shall be bitter [[H4843]] to them that drink [[H8354]] it. [[H8354]]

### 10
The city [[H7151]] of confusion [[H8414]] is broken down: [[H7665]] every [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] is shut up, [[H5462]] that no man may come in. [[H935]]

### 11
a crying [[H6682]] for [[H5921]] wine [[H3196]] in the streets; [[H2351]] all [[H3605]] joy [[H8057]] is darkened, [[H6150]] the mirth [[H4885]] of the land [[H776]] is gone. [[H1540]]

### 12
In the city [[H5892]] is left [[H7604]] desolation, [[H8047]] and the gate [[H8179]] is smitten [[H3807]] with destruction. [[H7591]]

### 13
When [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] it shall be [[H1961]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the land [[H776]] among [[H8432]] the people, [[H5971]] as the shaking [[H5363]] of an olive tree, [[H2132]] as the gleaning grapes [[H5955]] when [[H518]] the vintage [[H1210]] is done. [[H3615]]

### 14
They [[H1992]] shall lift up [[H5375]] their voice, [[H6963]] they shall sing [[H7442]] for the majesty [[H1347]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] they shall cry aloud [[H6670]] from the sea. [[H3220]]

### 15
Wherefore [[H5921]] glorify [[H3513]] ye the Lord [[H3068]] in the fires, [[H217]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the isles [[H339]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 16
From the uttermost part [[H3671]] of the earth [[H776]] have we heard [[H8085]] songs, [[H2158]] glory [[H6643]] to the righteous. [[H6662]] But I said, [[H559]] My leanness, [[H7334]] my leanness, [[H7334]] woe [[H188]] unto me! the treacherous dealers [[H898]] have dealt treacherously; [[H898]] yea, the treacherous dealers [[H898]] have dealt very [[H899]] treacherously. [[H898]]

### 17
Fear, [[H6343]] and the pit, [[H6354]] and the snare, [[H6341]] upon [[H5921]] thee, O inhabitant [[H3427]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 18
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] he who fleeth [[H5127]] from the noise [[H6963]] of the fear [[H6343]] shall fall [[H5307]] into [[H413]] the pit; [[H6354]] and he that cometh up [[H5927]] out of the midst [[H8432]] of the pit [[H6354]] shall be taken [[H3920]] in the snare: [[H6341]] for [[H3588]] the windows [[H699]] from on high [[H4791]] are open, [[H6605]] and the foundations [[H4146]] of the earth [[H776]] do shake. [[H7493]]

### 19
The earth [[H776]] is utterly [[H7489]] broken down, [[H7489]] the earth [[H776]] is clean [[H6565]] dissolved, [[H6565]] the earth [[H776]] is moved [[H4131]] exceedingly. [[H4131]]

### 20
The earth [[H776]] shall reel [[H5128]] to and fro [[H5128]] like a drunkard, [[H7910]] and shall be removed [[H5110]] like a cottage; [[H4412]] and the transgression [[H6588]] thereof shall be heavy [[H3513]] upon [[H5921]] it; and it shall fall, [[H5307]] and not [[H3808]] rise [[H6965]] again. [[H3254]]

### 21
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall punish [[H6485]] the host [[H6635]] of the high ones [[H4791]] on high, [[H4791]] and the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H127]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H127]]

### 22
And they shall be gathered together, [[H622]] prisoners [[H616]] are gathered [[H626]] in [[H5921]] the pit, [[H953]] and shall be shut up [[H5462]] in [[H5921]] the prison, [[H4525]] and after many [[H7230]] days [[H3117]] shall they be visited. [[H6485]]

### 23
Then the moon [[H3842]] shall be confounded, [[H2659]] and the sun [[H2535]] ashamed, [[H954]] when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] shall reign [[H4427]] in mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and before [[H5048]] his ancients [[H2205]] gloriously. [[H3519]]
