# Isaiah 32

[[Isaiah 31|←]] • [[Isaiah 33|→]]

---

### 1
Behold, [[H2005]] a king [[H4428]] shall reign [[H4427]] in righteousness, [[H6664]] and princes [[H8269]] shall rule [[H8323]] in judgment. [[H4941]]

### 2
And a man [[H376]] shall be [[H1961]] as an hiding place [[H4224]] from the wind, [[H7307]] and a covert [[H5643]] from the tempest; [[H2230]] as rivers [[H6388]] of water [[H4325]] in a dry place, [[H6724]] as the shadow [[H6738]] of a great [[H3515]] rock [[H5553]] in a weary [[H5889]] land. [[H776]]

### 3
And the eyes [[H5869]] of them that see [[H7200]] shall not [[H3808]] be dim, [[H8159]] and the ears [[H241]] of them that hear [[H8085]] shall hearken. [[H7181]]

### 4
The heart [[H3824]] also of the rash [[H4116]] shall understand [[H995]] knowledge, [[H3045]] and the tongue [[H3956]] of the stammerers [[H5926]] shall be ready [[H4116]] to speak [[H1696]] plainly. [[H6703]]

### 5
The vile person [[H5036]] shall be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] called [[H7121]] liberal, [[H5081]] nor [[H3808]] the churl [[H3596]] said [[H559]] bountiful. [[H7771]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] the vile person [[H5036]] will speak [[H1696]] villany, [[H5039]] and his heart [[H3820]] will work [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H205]] to practise [[H6213]] hypocrisy, [[H2612]] and to utter [[H1696]] error [[H8442]] against [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to make empty [[H7324]] the soul [[H5315]] of the hungry, [[H7457]] and he will cause the drink [[H4945]] of the thirsty [[H6771]] to fail. [[H2637]]

### 7
The instruments [[H3627]] also of the churl [[H3596]] evil: [[H7451]] he [[H1931]] deviseth [[H3289]] wicked devices [[H2154]] to destroy [[H2254]] the poor [[H6035]] with lying [[H8267]] words, [[H561]] even when the needy [[H34]] speaketh [[H1696]] right. [[H4941]]

### 8
But the liberal [[H5081]] deviseth [[H3289]] liberal things; [[H5081]] and by [[H5921]] liberal things [[H5081]] shall he stand. [[H6965]]

### 9
Rise up, [[H6965]] ye women [[H802]] that are at ease; [[H7600]] hear [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] ye careless [[H982]] daughters; [[H1323]] give ear [[H238]] unto my speech. [[H565]]

### 10
Many days [[H3117]] and years [[H8141]] shall ye be troubled, [[H7264]] ye careless women: [[H982]] for [[H3588]] the vintage [[H1210]] shall fail, [[H3615]] the gathering [[H625]] shall not [[H1097]] come. [[H935]]

### 11
Tremble, [[H2729]] ye women that are at ease; [[H7600]] be troubled, [[H7264]] ye careless ones: [[H982]] strip [[H6584]] you, and make you bare, [[H6209]] and gird [[H2290]] upon [[H5921]] loins. [[H2504]]

### 12
They shall lament [[H5594]] for [[H5921]] the teats, [[H7699]] for [[H5921]] the pleasant [[H2531]] fields, [[H7704]] for [[H5921]] the fruitful [[H6509]] vine. [[H1612]]

### 13
Upon [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of my people [[H5971]] shall come up [[H5927]] thorns [[H6975]] briers; [[H8068]] yea, [[H3588]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the houses [[H1004]] of joy [[H4885]] the joyous [[H5947]] city: [[H7151]]

### 14
Because [[H3588]] the palaces [[H759]] shall be forsaken; [[H5203]] the multitude [[H1995]] of the city [[H5892]] shall be left; [[H5800]] the forts [[H6076]] and towers [[H975]] shall be [[H1961]] for [[H1157]] dens [[H4631]] for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] a joy [[H4885]] of wild asses, [[H6501]] a pasture [[H4829]] of flocks; [[H5739]]

### 15
Until [[H5704]] the spirit [[H7307]] be poured [[H6168]] upon [[H5921]] us from on high, [[H4791]] and the wilderness [[H4057]] be [[H1961]] a fruitful field, [[H3759]] and the fruitful field [[H3759]] be counted [[H2803]] for a forest. [[H3293]]

### 16
Then judgment [[H4941]] shall dwell [[H7931]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and righteousness [[H6666]] remain [[H3427]] in the fruitful field. [[H3759]]

### 17
And the work [[H4639]] of righteousness [[H6666]] shall be [[H1961]] peace; [[H7965]] and the effect [[H5656]] of righteousness [[H6666]] quietness [[H8252]] and assurance [[H983]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 18
And my people [[H5971]] shall dwell [[H3427]] in a peaceable [[H7965]] habitation, [[H5116]] and in sure [[H4009]] dwellings, [[H4908]] and in quiet [[H7600]] resting places; [[H4496]]

### 19
When it shall hail, [[H1258]] coming down [[H3381]] on the forest; [[H3293]] and the city [[H5892]] shall be low [[H8213]] in a low place. [[H8218]]

### 20
Blessed [[H835]] ye that sow [[H2232]] beside [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] waters, [[H4325]] that send forth [[H7971]] the feet [[H7272]] of the ox [[H7794]] and the ass. [[H2543]]
