[[Isaiah 41|←]] • [[Isaiah 43|→]]

### 1
Behold [[H2005]] my servant, [[H5650]] whom I uphold; [[H8551]] mine elect, [[H972]] my soul [[H5315]] delighteth; [[H7521]] I have put [[H5414]] my spirit [[H7307]] upon [[H5921]] him: he shall bring forth [[H3318]] judgment [[H4941]] to the Gentiles. [[H1471]]

### 2
He shall not [[H3808]] cry, [[H6817]] nor [[H3808]] lift up, [[H5375]] nor [[H3808]] cause his voice [[H6963]] to be heard [[H8085]] in the street. [[H2351]]

### 3
A bruised [[H7533]] reed [[H7070]] shall he not [[H3808]] break, [[H7665]] and the smoking [[H3544]] flax [[H6594]] shall he not [[H3808]] quench: [[H3518]] he shall bring forth [[H3318]] judgment [[H4941]] unto truth. [[H571]]

### 4
He shall not [[H3808]] fail [[H3543]] nor [[H3808]] be discouraged, [[H7533]] till [[H5704]] he have set [[H7760]] judgment [[H4941]] in the earth: [[H776]] and the isles [[H339]] shall wait [[H3176]] for his law. [[H8451]]

### 5
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] God [[H410]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he that created [[H1254]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and stretched them out; [[H5186]] he that spread forth [[H7554]] the earth, [[H776]] and that which cometh out [[H6631]] of it; he that giveth [[H5414]] breath [[H5397]] unto the people [[H5971]] upon [[H5921]] it, and spirit [[H7307]] to them that walk [[H1980]] therein: [[H1980]]

### 6
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have called [[H7121]] thee in righteousness, [[H6664]] and will hold [[H2388]] thine hand, [[H3027]] and will keep [[H5341]] thee, and give [[H5414]] thee for a covenant [[H1285]] of the people, [[H5971]] for a light [[H216]] of the Gentiles; [[H1471]]

### 7
To open [[H6491]] the blind [[H5787]] eyes, [[H5869]] to bring out [[H3318]] the prisoners [[H616]] from the prison, [[H4525]] them that sit [[H3427]] in darkness [[H2822]] out of the prison [[H3608]] house. [[H1004]]

### 8
I [[H589]] the Lord: [[H3068]] that [[H1931]] my name: [[H8034]] and my glory [[H3519]] will I not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] to another, [[H312]] neither my praise [[H8416]] to graven images. [[H6456]]

### 9
Behold, [[H2009]] the former things [[H7223]] are come to pass, [[H935]] and new things [[H2319]] do I [[H589]] declare: [[H5046]] before [[H2962]] they spring forth [[H6779]] I tell [[H8085]] you of them. [[H8085]]

### 10
Sing [[H7891]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] a new [[H2319]] song, [[H7892]] his praise [[H8416]] from the end [[H7097]] of the earth, [[H776]] ye that go down [[H3381]] to the sea, [[H3220]] and all that is therein; [[H4393]] the isles, [[H339]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof. [[H3427]]

### 11
Let the wilderness [[H4057]] and the cities [[H5892]] thereof lift up [[H5375]] the villages [[H2691]] Kedar [[H6938]] doth inhabit: [[H3427]] let the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the rock [[H5553]] sing, [[H7442]] let them shout [[H6681]] from the top [[H7218]] of the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 12
Let them give [[H7760]] glory [[H3519]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and declare [[H5046]] his praise [[H8416]] in the islands. [[H339]]

### 13
The Lord [[H3068]] shall go forth [[H3318]] as a mighty man, [[H1368]] he shall stir up [[H5782]] jealousy [[H7068]] like a man [[H376]] of war: [[H4421]] he shall cry, [[H7321]] yea, [[H637]] roar; [[H6873]] he shall prevail [[H1396]] against [[H5921]] his enemies. [[H341]]

### 14
I have long time [[H5769]] holden my peace; [[H2814]] I have been still, [[H2790]] refrained myself: [[H662]] will I cry [[H6463]] like a travailing woman; [[H3205]] I will destroy [[H5395]] and devour [[H7602]] at once. [[H3162]]

### 15
I will make waste [[H2717]] mountains [[H2022]] and hills, [[H1389]] and dry up [[H3001]] all [[H3605]] their herbs; [[H6212]] and I will make [[H7760]] the rivers [[H5104]] islands, [[H339]] and I will dry up [[H3001]] the pools. [[H98]]

### 16
And I will bring [[H1980]] the blind [[H5787]] by a way [[H1870]] they knew [[H3045]] not; [[H3808]] I will lead them [[H1869]] in paths [[H5410]] they have not [[H3808]] known: [[H3045]] I will make [[H7760]] darkness [[H4285]] light [[H216]] before [[H6440]] them, and crooked things [[H4625]] straight. [[H4334]] These [[H428]] things [[H1697]] will I do [[H6213]] unto them, and not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] them. [[H5800]]

### 17
They shall be turned [[H5472]] back, [[H268]] they shall be greatly [[H1322]] ashamed, [[H954]] that trust [[H982]] in graven images, [[H6459]] that say [[H559]] to the molten images, [[H4541]] Ye [[H859]] our gods. [[H430]]

### 18
Hear, [[H8085]] ye deaf; [[H2795]] and look, [[H5027]] ye blind, [[H5787]] that ye may see. [[H7200]]

### 19
Who [[H4310]] blind, [[H5787]] but [[H3588]] my servant? [[H5650]] or deaf, [[H2795]] as my messenger [[H4397]] I sent? [[H7971]] who [[H4310]] blind [[H5787]] as perfect, [[H7999]] and blind [[H5787]] as the Lord's [[H3068]] servant? [[H5650]]

### 20
Seeing [[H7200]] many things, [[H7227]] but thou observest [[H8104]] not; [[H3808]] opening [[H6491]] the ears, [[H241]] but he heareth [[H8085]] not. [[H8085]]

### 21
The Lord [[H3068]] is well pleased [[H2654]] for his righteousness' [[H6664]] sake; [[H4616]] he will magnify [[H1431]] the law, [[H8451]] and make honourable. [[H142]]

### 22
But this [[H1931]] a people [[H5971]] robbed [[H962]] and spoiled; [[H8154]] all [[H3605]] of them snared [[H6351]] in holes, [[H2352]] and they are hid [[H2244]] in prison [[H3608]] houses: [[H1004]] they are [[H1961]] for a prey, [[H957]] and none [[H369]] delivereth; [[H5337]] for a spoil, [[H4933]] and none [[H369]] saith, [[H559]] Restore. [[H7725]]

### 23
Who [[H4310]] among you will give ear [[H238]] to this? [[H2063]] will hearken [[H7181]] and hear [[H8085]] for the time to come? [[H268]]

### 24
Who [[H4310]] gave [[H5414]] Jacob [[H3290]] for a spoil, [[H4882]] and Israel [[H3478]] to the robbers? [[H962]] did not [[H3808]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he against whom [[H2098]] we have sinned? [[H2398]] for they would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in his ways, [[H1870]] neither [[H3808]] were they obedient [[H8085]] unto his law. [[H8451]]

### 25
Therefore he hath poured [[H8210]] upon [[H5921]] him the fury [[H2534]] of his anger, [[H639]] and the strength [[H5807]] of battle: [[H4421]] and it hath set him on fire [[H3857]] round about, [[H5439]] yet he knew [[H3045]] not; [[H3808]] and it burned [[H1197]] him, yet he laid [[H7760]] not [[H3808]] to [[H5921]] heart.
