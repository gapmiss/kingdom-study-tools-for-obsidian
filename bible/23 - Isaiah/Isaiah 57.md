# Isaiah 57

[[Isaiah 56|←]] • [[Isaiah 58|→]]

---

### 1
The righteous [[H6662]] perisheth, [[H6]] and no [[H369]] man [[H376]] layeth [[H7760]] to [[H5921]] heart: [[H3820]] and merciful [[H2617]] men [[H376]] taken away, [[H622]] none [[H369]] considering [[H995]] that [[H3588]] the righteous [[H6662]] is taken away [[H622]] from [[H6440]] the evil [[H7451]]

### 2
He shall enter [[H935]] into peace: [[H7965]] they shall rest [[H5117]] in [[H5921]] their beds, [[H4904]] walking [[H1980]] his uprightness. [[H5228]]

### 3
But draw near [[H7126]] hither, [[H2008]] ye [[H859]] sons [[H1121]] of the sorceress, [[H6049]] the seed [[H2233]] of the adulterer [[H5003]] and the whore. [[H2181]]

### 4
Against [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] do ye sport yourselves? [[H6026]] against [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] make ye a wide [[H7337]] mouth, [[H6310]] draw out [[H748]] the tongue? [[H3956]] ye [[H859]] not [[H3808]] children [[H3206]] of transgression, [[H6588]] a seed [[H2233]] of falsehood, [[H8267]]

### 5
Enflaming [[H2552]] yourselves with idols [[H410]] under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree, [[H6086]] slaying [[H7819]] the children [[H3206]] in the valleys [[H5158]] under [[H8478]] the clifts [[H5585]] of the rocks? [[H5553]]

### 6
Among the smooth [[H2511]] of the stream [[H5158]] thy portion; [[H2506]] they, [[H1992]] they [[H1992]] thy lot: [[H1486]] even [[H1571]] to them hast thou poured [[H8210]] a drink offering, [[H5262]] thou hast offered [[H5927]] a meat offering. [[H4503]] Should I receive comfort [[H5162]] in [[H5921]] these? [[H5921]]

### 7
Upon [[H5921]] a lofty [[H1364]] and high [[H5375]] mountain [[H2022]] hast thou set [[H7760]] thy bed: [[H4904]] even [[H1571]] thither [[H8033]] wentest thou up [[H5927]] to offer [[H2076]] sacrifice. [[H2077]]

### 8
Behind [[H310]] the doors [[H1817]] also and the posts [[H4201]] hast thou set up [[H7760]] thy remembrance: [[H2146]] for [[H3588]] thou hast discovered [[H1540]] than [[H853]] me, and art gone up; [[H5927]] thou hast enlarged [[H7337]] thy bed, [[H4904]] and made [[H3772]] thee with them; thou lovedst [[H157]] their bed [[H4904]] where [[H3027]] thou sawest [[H2372]]

### 9
And thou wentest [[H7788]] to the king [[H4428]] with ointment, [[H8081]] and didst increase [[H7235]] thy perfumes, [[H7547]] and didst send [[H7971]] thy messengers [[H6735]] far off, [[H7350]] and didst debase [[H8213]] unto [[H5704]] hell. [[H7585]]

### 10
Thou art wearied [[H3021]] in the greatness [[H7230]] of thy way; [[H1870]] saidst [[H559]] thou not, [[H3808]] There is no hope: [[H2976]] thou hast found [[H4672]] the life [[H2416]] of thine hand; [[H3027]] therefore [[H5921]] thou wast not [[H3808]] grieved. [[H2470]]

### 11
And of whom [[H4310]] hast thou been afraid [[H1672]] or feared, [[H3372]] that [[H3588]] thou hast lied, [[H3576]] and hast not [[H3808]] remembered [[H2142]] me, nor [[H3808]] laid [[H7760]] to [[H5921]] thy heart? [[H3820]] have not [[H3808]] I [[H589]] held my peace [[H2814]] even of old, [[H5769]] and thou fearest [[H3372]] me not? [[H3372]]

### 12
I [[H589]] will declare [[H5046]] thy righteousness, [[H6666]] and thy works; [[H4639]] for they shall not [[H3808]] profit [[H3276]] thee. [[H3276]]

### 13
When thou criest, [[H2199]] let thy companies [[H6899]] deliver [[H5337]] thee; but the wind [[H7307]] shall carry them all away; [[H5375]] vanity [[H1892]] shall take [[H3947]] but he that putteth his trust [[H2620]] in me shall possess [[H5157]] the land, [[H776]] and shall inherit [[H3423]] my holy [[H6944]] mountain; [[H2022]]

### 14
And shall say, [[H559]] Cast ye up, [[H5549]] cast ye up, [[H5549]] prepare [[H6437]] the way, [[H1870]] take up [[H7311]] the stumblingblock [[H4383]] out of the way [[H1870]] of my people. [[H5971]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the high [[H7311]] and lofty One [[H5375]] that inhabiteth [[H7931]] eternity, [[H5703]] whose name [[H8034]] Holy; [[H6918]] I dwell [[H7931]] in the high [[H4791]] and holy [[H6918]] with [[H854]] him also of a contrite [[H1793]] and humble [[H8217]] spirit, [[H7307]] to revive [[H2421]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the humble, [[H8217]] and to revive [[H2421]] the heart [[H3820]] of the contrite ones. [[H1792]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] contend [[H7378]] for ever, [[H5769]] neither [[H3808]] will I be always [[H5331]] wroth: [[H7107]] for [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] should fail [[H5848]] before [[H6440]] me, and the souls [[H5397]] I [[H589]] have made. [[H6213]]

### 17
For the iniquity [[H5771]] of his covetousness [[H1215]] was I wroth, [[H7107]] and smote [[H5221]] him: I hid [[H5641]] me, and was wroth, [[H7107]] and he went on [[H3212]] frowardly [[H7726]] in the way [[H1870]] of his heart. [[H3820]]

### 18
I have seen [[H7200]] his ways, [[H1870]] and will heal [[H7495]] him: I will lead [[H5148]] him also, and restore [[H7999]] comforts [[H5150]] unto him and to his mourners. [[H57]]

### 19
I create [[H1254]] the fruit [[H5108]] of the lips; [[H8193]] Peace, [[H7965]] peace [[H7965]] to far off, [[H7350]] and to near, [[H7138]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and I will heal [[H7495]] him. [[H7495]]

### 20
But the wicked [[H7563]] like the troubled [[H1644]] sea, [[H3220]] when [[H3588]] it cannot [[H3201]] rest, [[H8252]] whose waters [[H4325]] cast up [[H1644]] mire [[H7516]] and dirt. [[H2916]]

### 21
no [[H369]] peace, [[H7965]] saith [[H559]] my God, [[H430]] to the wicked. [[H7563]]
