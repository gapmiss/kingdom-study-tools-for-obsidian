[[Isaiah 39|←]] • [[Isaiah 41|→]]

### 1
Comfort [[H5162]] ye, comfort [[H5162]] ye my people, [[H5971]] saith [[H559]] your God. [[H430]]

### 2
Speak [[H1696]] ye comfortably [[H3820]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and cry [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] her, that [[H3588]] her warfare [[H6635]] is accomplished, [[H4390]] that [[H3588]] her iniquity [[H5771]] is pardoned: [[H7521]] for [[H3588]] she hath received [[H3947]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] double [[H3718]] for all [[H3605]] her sins. [[H2403]]

### 3
The voice [[H6963]] of him that crieth [[H7121]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] Prepare [[H6437]] ye the way [[H1870]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] make straight [[H3474]] in the desert [[H6160]] a highway [[H4546]] for our God. [[H430]]

### 4
Every [[H3605]] valley [[H1516]] shall be exalted, [[H5375]] and every [[H3605]] mountain [[H2022]] and hill [[H1389]] shall be made low: [[H8213]] and the crooked [[H6121]] shall be made [[H1961]] straight, [[H4334]] and the rough places [[H7406]] plain: [[H1237]]

### 5
And the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be revealed, [[H1540]] and all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] shall see [[H7200]] together: [[H3162]] for [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]]

### 6
The voice [[H6963]] said, [[H559]] Cry. [[H7121]] And he said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] shall I cry? [[H7121]] All [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] grass, [[H2682]] and all [[H3605]] the goodliness [[H2617]] thereof as the flower [[H6731]] of the field: [[H7704]]

### 7
The grass [[H2682]] withereth, [[H3001]] the flower [[H6731]] fadeth: [[H5034]] because [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] bloweth [[H5380]] upon it: surely [[H403]] the people [[H5971]] grass. [[H2682]]

### 8
The grass [[H2682]] withereth, [[H3001]] the flower [[H6731]] fadeth: [[H5034]] but the word [[H1697]] of our God [[H430]] shall stand [[H6965]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 9
O Zion, [[H6726]] that bringest good tidings, [[H1319]] get thee up [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] the high [[H1364]] mountain; [[H2022]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] that bringest good tidings, [[H1319]] lift up [[H7311]] thy voice [[H6963]] with strength; [[H3581]] lift up, [[H7311]] be not afraid; [[H3372]] say [[H559]] unto the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Behold [[H2009]] your God! [[H430]]

### 10
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] will come [[H935]] with strong [[H2389]] and his arm [[H2220]] shall rule [[H4910]] for him: behold, [[H2009]] his reward [[H7939]] with [[H854]] him, and his work [[H6468]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 11
He shall feed [[H7462]] his flock [[H5739]] like a shepherd: [[H7462]] he shall gather [[H6908]] the lambs [[H2922]] with his arm, [[H2220]] and carry [[H5375]] in his bosom, [[H2436]] shall gently lead [[H5095]] those that are with young. [[H5763]]

### 12
Who [[H4310]] hath measured [[H4058]] the waters [[H4325]] in the hollow of his hand, [[H8168]] and meted out [[H8505]] heaven [[H8064]] with the span, [[H2239]] and comprehended [[H3557]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth [[H776]] in a measure, [[H7991]] and weighed [[H8254]] the mountains [[H2022]] in scales, [[H6425]] and the hills [[H1389]] in a balance? [[H3976]]

### 13
Who [[H4310]] hath directed [[H8505]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] or his counseller [[H376]] hath taught [[H3045]] him? [[H3045]]

### 14
With whom [[H4310]] took he counsel, [[H3289]] and instructed [[H995]] him, and taught [[H3925]] him in the path [[H734]] of judgment, [[H4941]] and taught [[H3925]] him knowledge, [[H1847]] and shewed [[H3045]] to him the way [[H1870]] of understanding? [[H8394]]

### 15
Behold, [[H2005]] the nations [[H1471]] as a drop [[H4752]] of a bucket, [[H1805]] and are counted [[H2803]] as the small dust [[H7834]] of the balance: [[H3976]] behold, [[H2005]] he taketh up [[H5190]] the isles [[H339]] as a very little thing. [[H1851]]

### 16
And Lebanon [[H3844]] not [[H369]] sufficient [[H1767]] to burn, [[H1197]] nor [[H369]] the beasts [[H2416]] thereof sufficient [[H1767]] for a burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 17
All [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] before [[H5048]] him as nothing; [[H369]] and they are counted [[H2803]] to him less than nothing, [[H657]] and vanity. [[H8414]]

### 18
To [[H413]] whom [[H4310]] then will ye liken [[H1819]] God? [[H410]] or what [[H4100]] likeness [[H1823]] will ye compare [[H6186]] unto him? [[H6186]]

### 19
The workman [[H2796]] melteth [[H5258]] a graven image, [[H6459]] and the goldsmith [[H6884]] spreadeth [[H7554]] it over with gold, [[H2091]] and casteth [[H6884]] silver [[H3701]] chains. [[H7577]]

### 20
He that so impoverished [[H5533]] that he hath no oblation [[H8641]] chooseth [[H977]] a tree [[H6086]] will not [[H3808]] rot; [[H7537]] he seeketh [[H1245]] unto him a cunning [[H2450]] workman [[H2796]] to prepare [[H3559]] a graven image, [[H6459]] shall not [[H3808]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 21
Have ye not [[H3808]] known? [[H3045]] have ye not [[H3808]] heard? [[H8085]] hath it not [[H3808]] been told [[H5046]] you from the beginning? [[H7218]] have ye not [[H3808]] understood [[H995]] from the foundations [[H4146]] of the earth? [[H776]]

### 22
he that sitteth [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the circle [[H2329]] of the earth, [[H776]] and the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof as grasshoppers; [[H2284]] that stretcheth out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] as a curtain, [[H1852]] and spreadeth them out [[H4969]] as a tent [[H168]] to dwell in: [[H3427]]

### 23
That bringeth [[H5414]] the princes [[H7336]] to nothing; [[H369]] he maketh [[H6213]] the judges [[H8199]] of the earth [[H776]] as vanity. [[H8414]]

### 24
Yea, [[H637]] they shall not [[H1077]] be planted; [[H5193]] yea, [[H637]] they shall not [[H1077]] be sown: [[H2232]] yea, [[H637]] their stock [[H1503]] shall not [[H1077]] take root [[H8327]] in the earth: [[H776]] and he shall also [[H1571]] blow [[H5398]] upon them, and they shall wither, [[H3001]] and the whirlwind [[H5591]] shall take [[H5375]] them away as stubble. [[H7179]]

### 25
To [[H413]] whom [[H4310]] then will ye liken [[H1819]] me, or shall I be equal? [[H7737]] saith [[H559]] the Holy One. [[H6918]]

### 26
Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] on high, [[H4791]] and behold [[H7200]] who [[H4310]] hath created [[H1254]] these [[H428]] that bringeth out [[H3318]] their host [[H6635]] by number: [[H4557]] he calleth [[H7121]] them all [[H3605]] by names [[H8034]] by the greatness [[H7230]] of his might, [[H202]] for that strong [[H533]] in power; [[H3581]] not [[H3808]] one [[H376]] faileth. [[H5737]]

### 27
Why [[H4100]] sayest [[H559]] thou, O Jacob, [[H3290]] and speakest, [[H1696]] O Israel, [[H3478]] My way [[H1870]] is hid [[H5641]] from the Lord, [[H3068]] and my judgment [[H4941]] is passed over [[H5674]] from my God? [[H430]]

### 28
Hast thou not [[H3808]] known? [[H3045]] hast thou not [[H3808]] heard, [[H8085]] the everlasting [[H5769]] God, [[H430]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the Creator [[H1254]] of the ends [[H7098]] of the earth, [[H776]] fainteth [[H3286]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] is weary? [[H3021]] no [[H369]] searching [[H2714]] of his understanding. [[H8394]]

### 29
He giveth [[H5414]] power [[H3581]] to the faint; [[H3287]] and to no [[H369]] might [[H202]] he increaseth [[H7235]] strength. [[H6109]]

### 30
Even the youths [[H5288]] shall faint [[H3286]] and be weary, [[H3021]] and the young men [[H970]] shall utterly [[H3782]] fall: [[H3782]]

### 31
But they that wait upon [[H6960]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall renew [[H2498]] strength; [[H3581]] they shall mount up [[H5927]] with wings [[H83]] as eagles; [[H5404]] they shall run, [[H7323]] and not [[H3808]] be weary; [[H3021]] they shall walk, [[H1980]] and not [[H3808]] faint. [[H3286]]
