### 1
Who [[H4310]] hath believed [[H539]] our report? [[H8052]] and to [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] is the arm [[H2220]] of the Lord [[H3068]] revealed? [[H1540]]

### 2
For he shall grow up [[H5927]] before [[H6440]] him as a tender plant, [[H3126]] and as a root [[H8328]] out of a dry [[H6723]] ground: [[H776]] he hath no [[H3808]] form [[H8389]] nor [[H3808]] comeliness; [[H1926]] and when we shall see [[H7200]] him, no [[H3808]] beauty [[H4758]] that we should desire [[H2530]] him. [[H2530]]

### 3
He is despised [[H959]] and rejected [[H2310]] of men; [[H376]] a man [[H376]] of sorrows, [[H4341]] and acquainted [[H3045]] with grief: [[H2483]] and we hid as it were [[H4564]] faces [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] him; he was despised, [[H959]] and we esteemed [[H2803]] him not. [[H2803]]

### 4
Surely [[H403]] he [[H1931]] hath borne [[H5375]] our griefs, [[H2483]] and carried [[H5445]] our sorrows: [[H4341]] yet we [[H587]] did esteem [[H2803]] him stricken, [[H5060]] smitten [[H5221]] of God, [[H430]] and afflicted. [[H6031]]

### 5
But he [[H1931]] wounded [[H2490]] for our transgressions, [[H6588]] bruised [[H1792]] for our iniquities: [[H5771]] the chastisement [[H4148]] of our peace [[H7965]] upon [[H5921]] him; and with his stripes [[H2250]] we are healed. [[H7495]]

### 6
All [[H3605]] we like sheep [[H6629]] have gone astray; [[H8582]] we have turned [[H6437]] every one [[H376]] to his own way; [[H1870]] and the Lord [[H3068]] hath laid [[H6293]]  on him [[H853]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of us all. [[H5771]]

### 7
He was oppressed, [[H5065]] and he [[H1931]] was afflicted, [[H6031]] yet he opened [[H6605]] not [[H3808]] his mouth: [[H6310]] he is brought [[H2986]] as a lamb [[H7716]] to the slaughter, [[H2874]] and as a sheep [[H7353]] before [[H6440]] her shearers [[H1494]] is dumb, [[H481]] so he openeth [[H6605]] not [[H3808]] his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 8
He was taken [[H3947]] from prison [[H6115]] and from judgment: [[H4941]] and who [[H4310]] shall declare [[H7878]] his generation? [[H1755]] for [[H3588]] he was cut off [[H1504]] out of the land [[H776]] of the living: [[H2416]] for the transgression [[H6588]] of my people [[H5971]] was he stricken. [[H5061]]

### 9
And he made [[H5414]] his grave [[H6913]] with [[H854]] the wicked, [[H7563]] and with [[H854]] the rich [[H6223]] in his death; [[H4194]] because [[H5921]] he had done [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] violence, [[H2555]] neither [[H3808]] deceit [[H4820]] in his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 10
Yet it pleased [[H2654]] the Lord [[H3068]] to bruise [[H1792]] him; he hath put to grief: [[H2470]] when [[H518]] thou shalt make [[H7760]] his soul [[H5315]] an offering for sin, [[H817]] he shall see [[H7200]] seed, [[H2233]] he shall prolong [[H748]] days, [[H3117]] and the pleasure [[H2656]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall prosper [[H6743]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
He shall see [[H7200]] of the travail [[H5999]] of his soul, [[H5315]] shall be satisfied: [[H7646]] by his knowledge [[H1847]] shall my righteous [[H6662]] servant [[H5650]] justify [[H6663]] many; [[H7227]] for he [[H1931]] shall bear [[H5445]] their iniquities. [[H5771]]

### 12
Therefore [[H3651]] will I divide [[H2505]] him with the great, [[H7227]] and he shall divide [[H2505]] the spoil [[H7998]] with [[H854]] the strong; [[H6099]] because [[H8478]] he hath poured out [[H6168]] his soul [[H5315]] unto death: [[H4194]] and he [[H1931]] was numbered [[H4487]] with [[H854]] the transgressors; [[H6586]] and he bare [[H5375]] the sin [[H2399]] of many, [[H7227]] and made intercession [[H6293]] for the transgressors.
