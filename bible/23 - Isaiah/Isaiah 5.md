### 1
Now [[H4994]] will I sing [[H7891]] to my wellbeloved [[H3039]] a song [[H7892]] of my beloved [[H1730]] touching his vineyard. [[H3754]] My wellbeloved [[H3039]] hath [[H1961]] a vineyard [[H3754]] in a very fruitful [[H8081]] hill: [[H7161]]

### 2
And he fenced [[H5823]] it, and gathered out the stones [[H5619]] thereof, and planted [[H5193]] it with the choicest vine, [[H8321]] and built [[H1129]] a tower [[H4026]] in the midst [[H8432]] of it, and also [[H1571]] made [[H2672]] a winepress [[H3342]] therein: and he looked [[H6960]] that it should bring forth [[H6213]] grapes, [[H6025]] and it brought forth [[H6213]] wild grapes. [[H891]]

### 3
And now, [[H6258]] O inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] judge, [[H8199]] I pray you, [[H4994]] betwixt [[H996]] me and my vineyard. [[H3754]]

### 4
What [[H4100]] could have been done [[H6213]] more [[H5750]] to my vineyard, [[H3754]] that I have not [[H3808]] done [[H6213]] in it? wherefore, [[H4069]] when I looked [[H6960]] that it should bring forth [[H6213]] grapes, [[H6025]] brought it forth [[H6213]] wild grapes? [[H891]]

### 5
And now [[H6258]] go to; I will tell [[H3045]]  you [[H853]] what [[H834]] I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] to my vineyard: [[H3754]] I will take away [[H5493]] the hedge [[H4881]] thereof, and it shall be [[H1961]] eaten up; [[H1197]] break down [[H6555]] the wall [[H1447]] thereof, and it shall be [[H1961]] trodden down: [[H4823]]

### 6
And I will lay [[H7896]] it waste: [[H1326]] it shall not [[H3808]] be pruned, [[H2168]] nor [[H3808]] digged; [[H5737]] but there shall come up [[H5927]] briers [[H8068]] and thorns: [[H7898]] I will also command [[H6680]] the clouds [[H5645]] that they rain [[H4305]] no rain [[H4306]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the vineyard [[H3754]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] his pleasant [[H8191]] plant: [[H5194]] and he looked [[H6960]] for judgment, [[H4941]] but behold [[H2009]] oppression; [[H4939]] for righteousness, [[H6666]] but behold [[H2009]] a cry. [[H6818]]

### 8
Woe [[H1945]] unto them that join [[H5060]] house [[H1004]] to house, [[H1004]] lay [[H7126]] field [[H7704]] to field, [[H7704]] till [[H5704]] no [[H657]] place, [[H4725]] that they may be placed [[H3427]] alone [[H905]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the earth! [[H776]]

### 9
In mine ears [[H241]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Of a truth [[H3808]] many [[H7227]] houses [[H1004]] shall be [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8047]] great [[H1419]] and fair, [[H2896]] without [[H369]] inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 10
Yea, [[H3588]] ten [[H6235]] acres [[H6776]] of vineyard [[H3754]] shall yield [[H6213]] one [[H259]] bath, [[H1324]] and the seed [[H2233]] of an homer [[H2563]] shall yield [[H6213]] an ephah. [[H374]]

### 11
Woe [[H1945]] unto them that rise up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] they may follow [[H7291]] strong drink; [[H7941]] that continue [[H309]] until night, [[H5399]] wine [[H3196]] inflame [[H1814]] them! [[H1814]]

### 12
And the harp, [[H3658]] and the viol, [[H5035]] the tabret, [[H8596]] and pipe, [[H2485]] and wine, [[H3196]] are [[H1961]] in their feasts: [[H4960]] but they regard [[H5027]] not [[H3808]] the work [[H6467]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] neither [[H3808]] consider [[H7200]] the operation [[H4639]] of his hands. [[H3027]]

### 13
Therefore [[H3651]] my people [[H5971]] are gone into captivity, [[H1540]] because no [[H1097]] knowledge: [[H1847]] and their honourable [[H3519]] men [[H4962]] famished, [[H7458]] and their multitude [[H1995]] dried up [[H6704]] with thirst. [[H6772]]

### 14
Therefore [[H3651]] hell [[H7585]] hath enlarged [[H7337]] herself, [[H5315]] and opened [[H6473]] her mouth [[H6310]] without [[H1097]] measure: [[H2706]] and their glory, [[H1926]] and their multitude, [[H1995]] and their pomp, [[H7588]] and he that rejoiceth, [[H5938]] shall descend [[H3381]] into it. [[H3381]]

### 15
And the mean man [[H120]] shall be brought down, [[H7817]] and the mighty man [[H376]] shall be humbled, [[H8213]] and the eyes [[H5869]] of the lofty [[H1364]] shall be humbled: [[H8213]]

### 16
But the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] shall be exalted [[H1361]] in judgment, [[H4941]] and God [[H410]] that is holy [[H6918]] shall be sanctified [[H6942]] in righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 17
Then shall the lambs [[H3532]] feed [[H7462]] after their manner, [[H1699]] and the waste places [[H2723]] of the fat ones [[H4220]] shall strangers [[H1481]] eat. [[H398]]

### 18
Woe [[H1945]] unto them that draw [[H4900]] iniquity [[H5771]] with cords [[H2256]] of vanity, [[H7723]] and sin [[H2403]] as it were with a cart [[H5699]] rope: [[H5688]]

### 19
That say, [[H559]] Let him make speed, [[H4116]] hasten [[H2363]] his work, [[H4639]] that [[H4616]] we may see [[H7200]] and let the counsel [[H6098]] of the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel [[H3478]] draw nigh [[H7126]] and come, [[H935]] that we may know [[H3045]]

### 20
Woe [[H1945]] unto them that call [[H559]] evil [[H7451]] good, [[H2896]] and good [[H2896]] evil; [[H7451]] that put [[H7760]] darkness [[H2822]] for light, [[H216]] and light [[H216]] for darkness; [[H2822]] that put [[H7760]] bitter [[H4751]] for sweet, [[H4966]] and sweet [[H4966]] for bitter! [[H4751]]

### 21
Woe [[H1945]] unto wise [[H2450]] in their own eyes, [[H5869]] and prudent [[H995]] in [[H5048]] their own sight! [[H6440]]

### 22
Woe [[H1945]] unto mighty [[H1368]] to drink [[H8354]] wine, [[H3196]] and men [[H582]] of strength [[H2428]] to mingle [[H4537]] strong drink: [[H7941]]

### 23
Which justify [[H6663]] the wicked [[H7563]] for [[H6118]] reward, [[H7810]] and take away [[H5493]] the righteousness [[H6666]] of the righteous [[H6662]] from [[H4480]] him! [[H4480]]

### 24
Therefore [[H3651]] as the fire [[H784]] devoureth [[H398]] the stubble, [[H7179]] and the flame [[H3956]] consumeth [[H7503]] the chaff, [[H2842]] their root [[H8328]] shall be [[H1961]] as rottenness, [[H4716]] and their blossom [[H6525]] shall go up [[H5927]] as dust: [[H80]] because [[H3588]] they have cast away [[H3988]] the law [[H8451]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and despised [[H5006]] the word [[H565]] of the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 25
Therefore [[H5921]] is the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] kindled [[H2734]] against his people, [[H5971]] and he hath stretched forth [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] them, and hath smitten [[H5221]] them: and the hills [[H2022]] did tremble, [[H7264]] and their carcases [[H5038]] torn [[H5478]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the streets. [[H2351]] For all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] his anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away, [[H7725]] but his hand [[H3027]] stretched out [[H5186]] still. [[H5186]]

### 26
And he will lift up [[H5375]] an ensign [[H5251]] to the nations [[H1471]] from far, [[H7350]] and will hiss [[H8319]] unto them from the end [[H7097]] of the earth: [[H776]] and, behold, [[H2009]] they shall come [[H935]] with speed [[H4120]] swiftly: [[H7031]]

### 27
None [[H369]] shall be weary [[H5889]] nor [[H369]] stumble [[H3782]] among them; none [[H3808]] shall slumber [[H5123]] nor [[H3808]] sleep; [[H3462]] neither [[H3808]] shall the girdle [[H232]] of their loins [[H2504]] be loosed, [[H6605]] nor [[H3808]] the latchet [[H8288]] of their shoes [[H5275]] be broken: [[H5423]]

### 28
Whose [[H834]] arrows [[H2671]] sharp, [[H8150]] and all [[H3605]] their bows [[H7198]] bent, [[H1869]] their horses' [[H5483]] hoofs [[H6541]] shall be counted [[H2803]] like flint, [[H6862]] and their wheels [[H1534]] like a whirlwind: [[H5492]]

### 29
Their roaring [[H7581]] like a lion, [[H3833]] they shall roar [[H7580]] like young lions: [[H3715]] yea, they shall roar, [[H5098]] and lay hold [[H270]] of the prey, [[H2964]] and shall carry away safe, [[H6403]] and none [[H369]] shall deliver [[H5337]]

### 30
And in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they shall roar [[H5098]] against [[H5921]] them like the roaring [[H5100]] of the sea: [[H3220]] and if look [[H5027]] unto the land, [[H776]] behold [[H2009]] darkness [[H2822]] sorrow, [[H6862]] and the light [[H216]] is darkened [[H2821]] in the heavens [[H6183]] thereof.
