[[Isaiah 65|←]] • [[Jeremiah 1|→]]

### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] The heaven [[H8064]] my throne, [[H3678]] and the earth [[H776]] my footstool: [[H7272]] where [[H335]] the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] ye build [[H1129]] unto me? and where [[H335]] the [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] of my rest? [[H4496]]

### 2
For all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] hath mine hand [[H3027]] made, [[H6213]] and all [[H3605]] those [[H428]] have been, [[H1961]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord: [[H3068]] but to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] will I look, [[H5027]] to [[H413]] poor [[H6041]] and of a contrite [[H5223]] spirit, [[H7307]] and trembleth [[H2730]] at [[H5921]] my word. [[H1697]]

### 3
He that killeth [[H7819]] an ox [[H7794]] he slew [[H5221]] a man; [[H376]] he that sacrificeth [[H2076]] a lamb, [[H7716]] he cut off a dog's [[H3611]] neck; [[H6202]] he that offereth [[H5927]] an oblation, [[H4503]] swine's [[H2386]] blood; [[H1818]] he that burneth [[H2142]] incense, [[H3828]] he blessed [[H1288]] an idol. [[H205]] Yea, [[H1571]] they [[H1992]] have chosen [[H977]] their own ways, [[H1870]] and their soul [[H5315]] delighteth [[H2654]] in their abominations. [[H8251]]

### 4
I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] will choose [[H977]] their delusions, [[H8586]] and will bring [[H935]] their fears [[H4035]] upon them; because [[H3282]] when I called, [[H7121]] none [[H369]] did answer; [[H6030]] when I spake, [[H1696]] they did not [[H3808]] hear: [[H8085]] but they did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] before mine eyes, [[H5869]] and chose [[H977]] in which [[H834]] I delighted [[H2654]] not. [[H2654]]

### 5
Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] ye that tremble [[H2730]] at [[H413]] his word; [[H1697]] Your brethren [[H251]] that hated [[H8130]] you, that cast you out [[H5077]] for my name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]] said, [[H559]] Let the Lord [[H3068]] be glorified: [[H3513]] but he shall appear [[H7200]] to your joy, [[H8057]] and they [[H1992]] shall be ashamed. [[H954]]

### 6
A voice [[H6963]] of noise [[H7588]] from the city, [[H5892]] a voice [[H6963]] from the temple, [[H1964]] a voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H3068]] that rendereth [[H7999]] recompence [[H1576]] to his enemies. [[H341]]

### 7
Before [[H2962]] she travailed, [[H2342]] she brought forth; [[H3205]] before [[H2962]] her pain [[H2256]] came, [[H935]] she was delivered [[H4422]] of a man child. [[H2145]]

### 8
Who [[H4310]] hath heard [[H8085]] such a thing? [[H2063]] who [[H4310]] hath seen [[H7200]] such things? [[H428]] Shall the earth [[H776]] be made to bring forth [[H2342]] in one [[H259]] day? [[H3117]] shall a nation [[H1471]] be born [[H3205]] at once? [[H6471]] for [[H3588]] as soon as [[H1571]] Zion [[H6726]] travailed, [[H2342]] she brought forth [[H3205]] her children. [[H1121]]

### 9
Shall I [[H589]] bring to the birth, [[H7665]] and not [[H3808]] cause to bring forth? [[H3205]] saith [[H559]] the Lord: [[H3068]] shall I [[H589]] cause to bring forth, [[H3205]] and shut [[H6113]] saith [[H559]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 10
Rejoice [[H8055]] ye with [[H854]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and be glad [[H1523]] with her, all [[H3605]] ye that love [[H157]] her: rejoice [[H7797]] for joy [[H4885]] with [[H854]] her, all [[H3605]] ye that mourn [[H56]] for [[H5921]] her: [[H5921]]

### 11
That [[H4616]] ye may suck, [[H3243]] and be satisfied [[H7646]] with the breasts [[H7699]] of her consolations; [[H8575]] that [[H4616]] ye may milk out, [[H4711]] and be delighted [[H6026]] with the abundance [[H2123]] of her glory. [[H3519]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will extend [[H5186]] peace [[H7965]] to [[H413]] her like a river, [[H5104]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the Gentiles [[H1471]] like a flowing [[H7857]] stream: [[H5158]] then shall ye suck, [[H3243]] ye shall be borne [[H5375]] upon [[H5921]] sides, [[H6654]] and be dandled [[H8173]] upon [[H5921]] knees. [[H1290]]

### 13
As one [[H376]] whom [[H834]] his mother [[H517]] comforteth, [[H5162]] so [[H3651]] will I [[H595]] comfort [[H5162]] you; and ye shall be comforted [[H5162]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 14
And when ye see [[H7200]] your heart [[H3820]] shall rejoice, [[H7797]] and your bones [[H6106]] shall flourish [[H6524]] like an herb: [[H1877]] and the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be known [[H3045]] toward [[H854]] his servants, [[H5650]] and indignation [[H2194]] toward [[H854]] his enemies. [[H341]]

### 15
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] will come [[H935]] with fire, [[H784]] and with his chariots [[H4818]] like a whirlwind, [[H5492]] to render [[H7725]] his anger [[H639]] with fury, [[H2534]] and his rebuke [[H1606]] with flames [[H3851]] of fire. [[H784]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] by fire [[H784]] and by his sword [[H2719]] will the Lord [[H3068]] plead [[H8199]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] flesh: [[H1320]] and the slain [[H2491]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall be many. [[H7231]]

### 17
They that sanctify themselves, [[H6942]] and purify themselves [[H2891]] in [[H413]] the gardens [[H1593]] behind [[H310]] one [[H259]] in the midst, [[H8432]] eating [[H398]] swine's [[H2386]] flesh, [[H1320]] and the abomination, [[H8263]] and the mouse, [[H5909]] shall be consumed [[H5486]] together, [[H3162]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
For I [[H595]] their works [[H4639]] and their thoughts: [[H4284]] it shall come, [[H935]] that I will gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] and tongues; [[H3956]] and they shall come, [[H935]] and see [[H7200]] my glory. [[H3519]]

### 19
And I will set [[H7760]] a sign [[H226]] among them, and I will send [[H7971]] those that escape [[H6412]] of them unto [[H413]] the nations, [[H1471]] Tarshish, [[H8659]] Pul, [[H6322]] and Lud, [[H3865]] that draw [[H4900]] the bow, [[H7198]] Tubal, [[H8422]] and Javan, [[H3120]] the isles [[H339]] afar off, [[H7350]] that [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] heard [[H8085]] my fame, [[H8088]] neither [[H3808]] have seen [[H7200]] my glory; [[H3519]] and they shall declare [[H5046]] my glory [[H3519]] among the Gentiles. [[H1471]]

### 20
And they shall bring [[H935]] all [[H3605]] your brethren [[H251]] an offering [[H4503]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] out of all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] upon horses, [[H5483]] and in chariots, [[H7393]] and in litters, [[H6632]] and upon mules, [[H6505]] and upon swift beasts, [[H3753]] to [[H5921]] my holy [[H6944]] mountain [[H2022]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] bring [[H935]] an offering [[H4503]] in a clean [[H2889]] vessel [[H3627]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
And I will also [[H1571]] take [[H3947]] of them for priests [[H3548]] for Levites, [[H3881]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] as [[H834]] the new [[H2319]] heavens [[H8064]] and the new [[H2319]] earth, [[H776]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] will make, [[H6213]] shall remain [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] so [[H3651]] shall your seed [[H2233]] and your name [[H8034]] remain. [[H5975]]

### 23
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] from [[H1767]] one new moon [[H2320]] to another, [[H2320]] and from [[H1767]] one sabbath [[H7676]] to another, [[H7676]] shall all [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] come [[H935]] to worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] me, saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 24
And they shall go forth, [[H3318]] and look [[H7200]] upon the carcases [[H6297]] of the men [[H376]] that have transgressed [[H6586]] against me: for [[H3588]] their worm [[H8438]] shall not [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] neither [[H3808]] shall their fire [[H784]] be quenched; [[H3518]] and they shall be [[H1961]] an abhorring [[H1860]] unto all [[H3605]] flesh.
