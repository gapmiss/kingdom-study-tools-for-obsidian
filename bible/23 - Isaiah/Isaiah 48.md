[[Isaiah 47|←]] • [[Isaiah 49|→]]

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] ye this, [[H2063]] O house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] which are called [[H7121]] by the name [[H8034]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and are come forth [[H3318]] out of the waters [[H4325]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which swear [[H7650]] by the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and make mention [[H2142]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] not [[H3808]] in truth, [[H571]] nor [[H3808]] in righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] they call themselves [[H7121]] of the holy [[H6944]] city, [[H5892]] and stay themselves [[H5564]] upon [[H5921]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] his name. [[H8034]]

### 3
I have declared [[H5046]] the former things [[H7223]] from the beginning; [[H227]] and they went forth [[H3318]] out of my mouth, [[H6310]] and I shewed [[H8085]] them; I did [[H6213]] suddenly, [[H6597]] and they came to pass. [[H935]]

### 4
Because I knew [[H1847]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] obstinate, [[H7186]] and thy neck [[H6203]] an iron [[H1270]] sinew, [[H1517]] and thy brow [[H4696]] brass; [[H5154]]

### 5
I have even from the beginning [[H227]] declared [[H5046]] to thee; before [[H2962]] it came to pass [[H935]] I shewed [[H8085]] thee: lest [[H6435]] thou shouldest say, [[H559]] Mine idol [[H6090]] hath done them, [[H6213]] and my graven image, [[H6459]] and my molten image, [[H5262]] hath commanded [[H6680]] them. [[H6680]]

### 6
Thou hast heard, [[H8085]] see [[H2372]] all [[H3605]] this; and will not [[H3808]] ye [[H859]] declare [[H5046]] I have shewed [[H8085]] thee new things [[H2319]] from this time, [[H6258]] even hidden things, [[H5341]] and thou didst not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] them. [[H3045]]

### 7
They are created [[H1254]] now, [[H6258]] and not [[H3808]] from the beginning; [[H227]] even before [[H6440]] the day [[H3117]] when thou heardest [[H8085]] them not; [[H3808]] lest [[H6435]] thou shouldest say, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I knew [[H3045]] them. [[H3045]]

### 8
Yea, [[H1571]] thou heardest [[H8085]] not; [[H3808]] yea, [[H1571]] thou knewest [[H3045]] not; [[H3808]] yea, [[H1571]] from that time [[H227]] thine ear [[H241]] was not [[H3808]] opened: [[H6605]] for [[H3588]] I knew [[H3045]] that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, [[H898]] and wast called [[H7121]] a transgressor [[H6586]] from the womb. [[H990]]

### 9
For my name's [[H8034]] sake [[H4616]] will I defer [[H748]] mine anger, [[H639]] and for my praise [[H8416]] will I refrain [[H2413]] for thee, that I cut thee not off. [[H3772]]

### 10
Behold, [[H2009]] I have refined [[H6884]] thee, but not [[H3808]] with silver; [[H3701]] I have chosen [[H977]] thee in the furnace [[H3564]] of affliction. [[H6040]]

### 11
For mine own sake, [[H4616]] for mine own sake, [[H4616]] will I do [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] how [[H349]] should be polluted? [[H2490]] and I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] my glory [[H3519]] unto another. [[H312]]

### 12
Hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, O Jacob [[H3290]] and Israel, [[H3478]] my called; [[H7121]] I [[H589]] he; [[H1931]] I [[H589]] the first, [[H7223]] I [[H589]] also [[H637]] the last. [[H314]]

### 13
Mine hand [[H3027]] also [[H637]] hath laid the foundation [[H3245]] of the earth, [[H776]] and my right hand [[H3225]] hath spanned [[H2946]] the heavens: [[H8064]] I [[H589]] call [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] them, they stand up [[H5975]] together. [[H3162]]

### 14
All [[H3605]] ye, assemble yourselves, [[H6908]] and hear; [[H8085]] which [[H4310]] among them hath declared [[H5046]] these [[H428]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath loved [[H157]] him: he will do [[H6213]] his pleasure [[H2656]] on Babylon, [[H894]] and his arm [[H2220]] the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 15
I, [[H589]] I, [[H589]] have spoken; [[H1696]] yea, [[H637]] I have called [[H7121]] him: I have brought [[H935]] him, and he shall make his way [[H1870]] prosperous. [[H6743]]

### 16
Come ye near [[H7126]] unto me, [[H413]] hear [[H8085]] ye this; [[H2063]] I have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] in secret [[H5643]] from the beginning; [[H7218]] from the time [[H6256]] that it was, [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] I: [[H589]] and now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] and his Spirit, [[H7307]] hath sent me. [[H7971]]

### 17
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] thy Redeemer, [[H1350]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel; [[H3478]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] which teacheth [[H3925]] thee to profit, [[H3276]] which leadeth [[H1869]] thee by the way [[H1870]] thou shouldest go. [[H1980]]

### 18
O that [[H3863]] thou hadst hearkened [[H7181]] to my commandments! [[H4687]] then had thy peace [[H7965]] been [[H1961]] as a river, [[H5104]] and thy righteousness [[H6666]] as the waves [[H1530]] of the sea: [[H3220]]

### 19
Thy seed [[H2233]] also had been [[H1961]] as the sand, [[H2344]] and the offspring [[H6631]] of thy bowels [[H4578]] like the gravel [[H4579]] thereof; his name [[H8034]] should not [[H3808]] have been cut off [[H3772]] nor [[H3808]] destroyed [[H8045]] from before [[H6440]] me. [[H6440]]

### 20
Go ye forth [[H3318]] of Babylon, [[H894]] flee [[H1272]] ye from the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] with a voice [[H6963]] of singing [[H7440]] declare [[H5046]] ye, tell [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] utter [[H3318]] it to [[H5704]] the end [[H7097]] of the earth; [[H776]] say [[H559]] ye, The Lord [[H3068]] hath redeemed [[H1350]] his servant [[H5650]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 21
And they thirsted [[H6770]] not [[H3808]] he led [[H1980]] them through the deserts: [[H2723]] he caused the waters [[H4325]] to flow [[H5140]] out of the rock [[H6697]] for them: he clave [[H1234]] the rock [[H6697]] also, and the waters [[H4325]] gushed out. [[H2100]]

### 22
no [[H369]] peace, [[H7965]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] unto the wicked. [[H7563]]
