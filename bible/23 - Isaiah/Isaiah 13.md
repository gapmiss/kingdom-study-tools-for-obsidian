# Isaiah 13

[[Isaiah 12|←]] • [[Isaiah 14|→]]

---

### 1
The burden [[H4853]] of Babylon, [[H894]] which [[H834]] Isaiah [[H3470]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] did see. [[H2372]]

### 2
Lift ye up [[H5375]] a banner [[H5251]] upon [[H5921]] the high [[H8192]] mountain, [[H2022]] exalt [[H7311]] the voice [[H6963]] unto them, shake [[H5130]] the hand, [[H3027]] that they may go [[H935]] into the gates [[H6607]] of the nobles. [[H5081]]

### 3
I [[H589]] have commanded [[H6680]] my sanctified ones, [[H6942]] I have also [[H1571]] called [[H7121]] my mighty ones [[H1368]] for mine anger, [[H639]] them that rejoice [[H5947]] in my highness. [[H1346]]

### 4
The noise [[H6963]] of a multitude [[H1995]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] like as [[H1823]] of a great [[H7227]] people; [[H5971]] a tumultuous [[H7588]] noise [[H6963]] of the kingdoms [[H4467]] of nations [[H1471]] gathered together: [[H622]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] mustereth [[H6485]] the host [[H6635]] of the battle. [[H4421]]

### 5
They come [[H935]] from a far [[H4801]] country, [[H776]] from the end [[H7097]] of heaven, [[H8064]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and the weapons [[H3627]] of his indignation, [[H2195]] to destroy [[H2254]] the whole [[H3605]] land. [[H776]]

### 6
Howl [[H3213]] ye; for [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] at hand; [[H7138]] it shall come [[H935]] as a destruction [[H7701]] from the Almighty. [[H7706]]

### 7
Therefore [[H5921]] shall all [[H3605]] hands [[H3027]] be faint, [[H7503]] and every [[H3605]] man's [[H582]] heart [[H3824]] shall melt: [[H4549]]

### 8
And they shall be afraid: [[H926]] pangs [[H6735]] and sorrows [[H2256]] shall take hold [[H270]] of them; they shall be in pain [[H2342]] as a woman that travaileth: [[H3205]] they shall be amazed [[H8539]] one [[H376]] at [[H413]] another; [[H7453]] their faces [[H6440]] flames. [[H3851]]

### 9
Behold, [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] cometh, [[H935]] cruel [[H394]] both with wrath [[H5678]] and fierce [[H2740]] anger, [[H639]] to lay [[H7760]] the land [[H776]] desolate: [[H8047]] and he shall destroy [[H8045]] the sinners [[H2400]] thereof out of [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the stars [[H3556]] of heaven [[H8064]] and the constellations [[H3685]] thereof shall not [[H3808]] give [[H1984]] their light: [[H216]] the sun [[H8121]] shall be darkened [[H2821]] in his going forth, [[H3318]] and the moon [[H3394]] shall not [[H3808]] cause her light [[H216]] to shine. [[H5050]]

### 11
And I will punish [[H6485]] the world [[H8398]] for [[H5921]] evil, [[H7451]] and the wicked [[H7563]] for [[H5921]] their iniquity; [[H5771]] and I will cause the arrogancy [[H1347]] of the proud [[H2086]] to cease, [[H7673]] and will lay low [[H8213]] the haughtiness [[H1346]] of the terrible. [[H6184]]

### 12
I will make a man [[H376]] more precious [[H3365]] than fine gold; [[H6337]] even a man [[H120]] than the golden wedge [[H3800]] of Ophir. [[H211]]

### 13
Therefore [[H5921]] I will shake [[H7264]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] shall remove [[H7493]] out of her place, [[H4725]] in the wrath [[H5678]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and in the day [[H3117]] of his fierce [[H2740]] anger. [[H639]]

### 14
And it shall be [[H1961]] as the chased [[H5080]] roe, [[H6643]] and as a sheep [[H6629]] that no [[H369]] man taketh up: [[H6908]] they shall every man [[H376]] turn [[H6437]] to [[H413]] his own people, [[H5971]] and flee [[H5127]] every one [[H376]] into [[H413]] his own land. [[H776]]

### 15
Every one [[H3605]] that is found [[H4672]] shall be thrust through; [[H1856]] and every one [[H3605]] that is joined [[H5595]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 16
Their children [[H5768]] also shall be dashed pieces [[H7376]] to before their eyes; [[H5869]] their houses [[H1004]] shall be spoiled, [[H8155]] and their wives [[H802]] ravished. [[H7693]]

### 17
Behold, [[H2005]] I will stir up [[H5782]] the Medes [[H4074]] against [[H5921]] them, which [[H834]] shall not [[H3808]] regard [[H2803]] silver; [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] they shall not [[H3808]] delight [[H2654]] in it. [[H2654]]

### 18
bows [[H7198]] also shall dash pieces; [[H7376]] the young men [[H5288]] to and they shall have no [[H3808]] pity [[H7355]] on the fruit [[H6529]] of the womb; [[H990]] their eye [[H5869]] shall not [[H3808]] spare [[H2347]] children. [[H1121]]

### 19
And Babylon, [[H894]] the glory [[H6643]] of kingdoms, [[H4467]] the beauty [[H8597]] of the Chaldees' [[H3778]] excellency, [[H1347]] shall be [[H1961]] as when God [[H430]] overthrew [[H4114]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah. [[H6017]]

### 20
It shall never [[H5331]] be inhabited, [[H3427]] neither [[H3808]] shall it be dwelt [[H7931]] in from generation [[H1755]] to [[H5704]] generation: [[H1755]] neither [[H3808]] shall the Arabian [[H6163]] pitch tent [[H167]] there; [[H8033]] neither [[H3808]] shall the shepherds [[H7462]] make their fold [[H7257]] there. [[H7257]]

### 21
But wild beasts of the desert [[H6728]] shall lie [[H7257]] there; [[H8033]] and their houses [[H1004]] shall be full [[H4390]] of doleful creatures; [[H255]] and owls [[H1323]] shall dwell [[H7931]] there, [[H8033]] and satyrs [[H8163]] shall dance [[H7540]] there. [[H7540]]

### 22
And the wild beasts of the islands [[H338]] shall cry [[H6030]] in their desolate houses, [[H490]] and dragons [[H8577]] in pleasant [[H6027]] palaces: [[H1964]] and her time [[H6256]] near [[H7138]] to come, [[H935]] and her days [[H3117]] shall not [[H3808]] be prolonged. [[H4900]]
