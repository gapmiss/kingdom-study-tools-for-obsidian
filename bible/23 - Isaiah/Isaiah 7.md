### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] of Ahaz [[H271]] the son [[H1121]] of Jotham, [[H3147]] the son [[H1121]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Rezin [[H7526]] the king [[H4428]] of Syria, [[H758]] and Pekah [[H6492]] the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah, [[H7425]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] went up [[H5927]] toward Jerusalem [[H3389]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] it, but could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] prevail [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 2
And it was told [[H5046]] the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Syria [[H758]] is confederate [[H5117]] with [[H5921]] Ephraim. [[H669]] And his heart [[H3824]] was moved, [[H5128]] and the heart [[H3824]] of his people, [[H5971]] as the trees [[H6086]] of the wood [[H3293]] are moved [[H5128]] with [[H6440]] the wind. [[H7307]]

### 3
Then said [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] Go forth [[H3318]] now [[H4994]] to meet [[H7125]] Ahaz, [[H271]] thou, [[H859]] and Shear-jashub [[H7610]] thy son, [[H1121]] at [[H413]] the end [[H7097]] of the conduit [[H8585]] of the upper [[H5945]] pool [[H1295]] in [[H413]] the highway [[H4546]] of the fuller's [[H3526]] field; [[H7704]]

### 4
And say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Take heed, [[H8104]] and be quiet; [[H8252]] fear [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] neither [[H408]] be fainthearted [[H7401]] for the two [[H8147]] tails [[H2180]] of these [[H428]] smoking [[H6226]] firebrands, [[H181]] for the fierce [[H2750]] anger [[H639]] of Rezin [[H7526]] with Syria, [[H758]] and of the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah. [[H7425]]

### 5
Because [[H3282]] Syria, [[H758]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah, [[H7425]] have taken evil [[H7451]] counsel [[H3289]] against [[H5921]] thee, saying, [[H559]]

### 6
Let us go up [[H5927]] against Judah, [[H3063]] and vex [[H6973]] it, and let us make a breach [[H1234]] therein for [[H413]] us, and set [[H4427]] a king [[H4428]] in the midst [[H8432]]  of it, [[H853]] the son [[H1121]] of Tabeal: [[H2870]]

### 7
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] It shall not [[H3808]] stand, [[H6965]] neither [[H3808]] shall it come to pass. [[H3808]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] the head [[H7218]] of Syria [[H758]] Damascus, [[H1834]] and the head [[H7218]] of Damascus [[H1834]] Rezin; [[H7526]] and within [[H5750]] threescore [[H8346]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] shall Ephraim [[H669]] be broken, [[H2844]] that it be not a people. [[H5971]]

### 9
And the head [[H7218]] of Ephraim [[H669]] Samaria, [[H8111]] and the head [[H7218]] of Samaria [[H8111]] Remaliah's [[H7425]] son. [[H1121]] If [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] believe, [[H539]] surely [[H3588]] ye shall not [[H3808]] be established. [[H539]]

### 10
Moreover the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] again [[H3254]] unto [[H413]] Ahaz, [[H271]] saying, [[H559]]

### 11
Ask [[H7592]] thee a sign [[H226]] of [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God; [[H430]] ask [[H7592]] it either in the depth, [[H6009]] or [[H176]] in the height [[H1361]] above. [[H4605]]

### 12
But Ahaz [[H271]] said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] ask, [[H7592]] neither [[H3808]] will I tempt [[H5254]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And he said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] ye now, [[H4994]] O house [[H1004]] of David; [[H1732]] a small thing [[H4592]] for [[H4480]] you to weary [[H3811]] men, [[H376]] but [[H3588]] will ye weary [[H3811]] my God [[H430]] also? [[H430]]

### 14
Therefore [[H3651]] the Lord [[H136]] himself [[H1931]] shall give [[H5414]] you a sign; [[H226]] Behold, [[H2009]] a virgin [[H5959]] shall conceive, [[H2030]] and bear [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and shall call [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Immanuel. [[H6005]]

### 15
Butter [[H2529]] and honey [[H1706]] shall he eat, [[H398]] that he may know [[H3045]] to refuse [[H3988]] the evil, [[H7451]] and choose [[H977]] the good. [[H2896]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] before [[H2962]] the child [[H5288]] shall know [[H3045]] to refuse [[H3988]] the evil, [[H7451]] and choose [[H977]] the good, [[H2896]] the land [[H127]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] abhorrest [[H6973]] shall be [[H6440]] forsaken [[H5800]] of both [[H8147]] her kings. [[H4428]]

### 17
The Lord [[H3068]] shall bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and upon [[H5921]] thy people, [[H5971]] and upon [[H5921]] thy father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] days [[H3117]] that [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] come, [[H935]] from the day [[H3117]] that Ephraim [[H669]] departed [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] Judah; [[H3063]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 18
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall hiss [[H8319]] for the fly [[H2070]] that [[H834]] in the uttermost part [[H7097]] of the rivers [[H2975]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and for the bee [[H1682]] that [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 19
And they shall come, [[H935]] and shall rest [[H5117]] all [[H3605]] of them in the desolate [[H1327]] valleys, [[H5158]] and in the holes [[H5357]] of the rocks, [[H5553]] and upon all [[H3605]] thorns, [[H5285]] and upon all [[H3605]] bushes. [[H5097]]

### 20
In the same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall the Lord [[H136]] shave [[H1548]] with a razor [[H8593]] that is hired, [[H7917]] by them beyond [[H5676]] the river, [[H5104]] by the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] the head, [[H7218]] and the hair [[H8181]] of the feet: [[H7272]] and it shall also [[H1571]] consume [[H5595]] the beard. [[H2206]]

### 21
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] a man [[H376]] shall nourish [[H2421]] a young [[H1241]] cow, [[H5697]] and two [[H8147]] sheep; [[H6629]]

### 22
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] for the abundance [[H7230]] of milk [[H2461]] they shall give [[H6213]] he shall eat [[H398]] butter: [[H2529]] for [[H3588]] butter [[H2529]] and honey [[H1706]] shall every one [[H3605]] eat [[H398]] that is left [[H3498]] in [[H7130]] the land. [[H776]]

### 23
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] shall be, [[H1961]] where [[H8033]] there were [[H1961]] a thousand [[H505]] vines [[H1612]] at a thousand [[H505]] silverlings, [[H3701]] it shall be [[H1961]] for briers [[H8068]] and thorns. [[H7898]]

### 24
With arrows [[H2671]] and with bows [[H7198]] shall come [[H935]] thither; [[H8033]] because [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] shall become [[H1961]] briers [[H8068]] and thorns. [[H7898]]

### 25
And all [[H3605]] hills [[H2022]] that [[H834]] shall be digged [[H5737]] with the mattock, [[H4576]] there shall not [[H3808]] come thither [[H935]] the fear [[H3374]] of briers [[H8068]] and thorns: [[H7898]] but it shall be [[H1961]] for the sending forth [[H4916]] of oxen, [[H7794]] and for the treading [[H4823]] of lesser cattle.
