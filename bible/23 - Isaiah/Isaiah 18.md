### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to the land [[H776]] shadowing [[H6767]] with wings, [[H3671]] which [[H834]] beyond [[H5676]] the rivers [[H5104]] of Ethiopia: [[H3568]]

### 2
That sendeth [[H7971]] ambassadors [[H6735]] by the sea, [[H3220]] even in vessels [[H3627]] of bulrushes [[H1573]] upon [[H6440]] the waters, [[H4325]] Go, [[H1980]] ye swift [[H7031]] messengers, [[H4397]] to [[H413]] a nation [[H1471]] scattered [[H4900]] and peeled, [[H4178]] to [[H413]] a people [[H5971]] terrible [[H3372]] from [[H4480]] their beginning [[H1931]] hitherto; [[H1973]] a nation [[H1471]] meted out [[H6978]] and trodden down, [[H4001]] whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] the rivers [[H5104]] have spoiled! [[H958]]

### 3
All [[H3605]] ye inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world, [[H8398]] and dwellers [[H7931]] on the earth, [[H776]] see [[H7200]] ye, when he lifteth up [[H5375]] an ensign [[H5251]] on the mountains; [[H2022]] and when he bloweth [[H8628]] a trumpet, [[H7782]] hear [[H8085]] ye. [[H8085]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] so [[H3541]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, I will take my rest, [[H8252]] and I will consider [[H5027]] in my dwelling place [[H4349]] like a clear [[H6703]] heat [[H2527]] upon [[H5921]] herbs, [[H216]] like a cloud [[H5645]] of dew [[H2919]] in the heat [[H2527]] of harvest. [[H7105]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] afore [[H6440]] the harvest, [[H7105]] when the bud [[H6525]] is perfect, [[H8552]] and the sour grape [[H1155]] is [[H1961]] ripening [[H1580]] in the flower, [[H5328]] he shall both cut off [[H3772]] the sprigs [[H2150]] with pruning hooks, [[H4211]] and take away [[H5493]] cut down [[H8456]] the branches. [[H5189]]

### 6
They shall be left [[H5800]] together [[H3162]] unto the fowls [[H5861]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] and to the beasts [[H929]] of the earth: [[H776]] and the fowls [[H5861]] shall summer [[H6972]] upon [[H5921]] them, and all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H929]] of the earth [[H776]] shall winter [[H2778]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 7
In that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] shall the present [[H7862]] be brought [[H2986]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] of a people [[H5971]] scattered [[H4900]] and peeled, [[H4178]] and from a people [[H5971]] terrible [[H3372]] from [[H4480]] their beginning [[H1931]] hitherto; [[H1973]] a nation [[H1471]] meted out [[H6978]] and trodden under foot, [[H4001]] whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] the rivers [[H5104]] have spoiled, [[H958]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the mount [[H2022]] Zion.
