# Isaiah 26

[[Isaiah 25|←]] • [[Isaiah 27|→]]

---

### 1
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall this [[H2088]] song [[H7892]] be sung [[H7891]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah; [[H3063]] We have a strong [[H5797]] city; [[H5892]] salvation [[H3444]] will appoint [[H7896]] walls [[H2346]] and bulwarks. [[H2426]]

### 2
Open [[H6605]] ye the gates, [[H8179]] that the righteous [[H6662]] nation [[H1471]] which keepeth [[H8104]] the truth [[H529]] may enter in. [[H935]]

### 3
Thou wilt keep [[H5341]] in perfect [[H7965]] peace, [[H7965]] mind [[H3336]] stayed [[H5564]] because [[H3588]] he trusteth [[H982]] in thee. [[H982]]

### 4
Trust [[H982]] ye in the Lord [[H3068]] for ever: [[H5703]] for [[H3588]] in the Lord [[H3050]] Jehovah [[H3068]] everlasting [[H5769]] strength: [[H6697]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] he bringeth down [[H7817]] them that dwell [[H3427]] on high; [[H4791]] the lofty [[H7682]] city, [[H7151]] he layeth it low; [[H8213]] he layeth it low, [[H8213]] to [[H5704]] the ground; [[H776]] he bringeth [[H5060]] it to [[H5704]] the dust. [[H6083]]

### 6
The foot [[H7272]] shall tread it down, [[H7429]] the feet [[H7272]] of the poor, [[H6041]] the steps [[H6471]] of the needy. [[H1800]]

### 7
The way [[H734]] of the just [[H6662]] uprightness: [[H4339]] thou, most upright, [[H3477]] dost weigh [[H6424]] the path [[H4570]] of the just. [[H6662]]

### 8
Yea, [[H637]] in the way [[H734]] of thy judgments, [[H4941]] O Lord, [[H3068]] have we waited [[H6960]] for thee; the desire [[H8378]] of soul [[H5315]] to thy name, [[H8034]] and to the remembrance [[H2143]] of thee. [[H2143]]

### 9
With my soul [[H5315]] have I desired [[H183]] thee in the night; [[H3915]] yea, [[H637]] with my spirit [[H7307]] within [[H7130]] me will I seek thee early: [[H7836]] for [[H3588]] when [[H834]] thy judgments [[H4941]] in the earth, [[H776]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world [[H8398]] will learn [[H3925]] righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 10
Let favour be shewed [[H2603]] to the wicked, [[H7563]] will he not [[H1077]] learn [[H3925]] righteousness: [[H6664]] in the land [[H776]] of uprightness [[H5229]] will he deal unjustly, [[H5765]] and will not [[H1077]] behold [[H7200]] the majesty [[H1348]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
Lord, [[H3068]] thy hand [[H3027]] is lifted up, [[H7311]] they will not [[H1077]] see: [[H2372]] they shall see, [[H2372]] and be ashamed [[H954]] for envy [[H7068]] at the people; [[H5971]] yea, [[H637]] the fire [[H784]] of thine enemies [[H6862]] shall devour [[H398]] them. [[H398]]

### 12
Lord, [[H3068]] thou wilt ordain [[H8239]] peace [[H7965]] for us: for [[H3588]] thou also [[H1571]] hast wrought [[H6466]] all [[H3605]] our works [[H4639]] in us. [[H4639]]

### 13
O Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] lords [[H113]] beside [[H2108]] thee have had dominion [[H1166]] over us: by thee only [[H905]] will we make mention [[H2142]] of thy name. [[H8034]]

### 14
dead, [[H4191]] they shall not [[H1077]] live; [[H2421]] deceased, [[H7496]] they shall not [[H1077]] rise: [[H6965]] therefore [[H3651]] hast thou visited [[H6485]] and destroyed [[H8045]] them, and made all [[H3605]] their memory [[H2143]] to perish. [[H6]]

### 15
Thou hast increased [[H3254]] the nation, [[H1471]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast increased [[H3254]] the nation: [[H1471]] thou art glorified: [[H3513]] thou hadst removed far [[H7368]] all [[H3605]] the ends [[H7099]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 16
Lord, [[H3068]] in trouble [[H6862]] have they visited [[H6485]] thee, they poured out [[H6694]] a prayer [[H3908]] thy chastening [[H4148]] upon them. [[H4148]]

### 17
Like as [[H3644]] a woman with child, [[H2030]] draweth near [[H7126]] the time of her delivery, [[H3205]] is in pain, [[H2342]] crieth out [[H2199]] in her pangs; [[H2256]] so [[H3651]] have we been [[H1961]] in thy sight, [[H6440]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
We have been with child, [[H2029]] we have been in pain, [[H2342]] we have as it were [[H3644]] brought forth [[H3205]] wind; [[H7307]] we have not [[H1077]] wrought [[H6213]] any deliverance [[H3444]] in the earth; [[H776]] neither [[H1077]] have the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world [[H8398]] fallen. [[H5307]]

### 19
Thy dead [[H4191]] shall live, [[H2421]] my dead body [[H5038]] shall they arise. [[H6965]] Awake [[H6974]] and sing, [[H7442]] ye that dwell [[H7931]] in dust: [[H6083]] for [[H3588]] thy dew [[H2919]] the dew [[H2919]] of herbs, [[H219]] and the earth [[H776]] shall cast out [[H5307]] the dead. [[H7496]]

### 20
Come, [[H1980]] my people, [[H5971]] enter [[H935]] thou into thy chambers, [[H2315]] and shut [[H5462]] thy doors [[H1817]] about [[H1157]] thee: hide [[H2247]] thyself as it were for a little [[H4592]] moment, [[H7281]] until [[H5704]] the indignation [[H2195]] be overpast. [[H5674]]

### 21
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] cometh out [[H3318]] of his place [[H4725]] to punish [[H6485]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth [[H776]] for their iniquity: [[H5771]] the earth [[H776]] also shall disclose [[H1540]] her blood, [[H1818]] and shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] cover [[H3680]] her slain.
