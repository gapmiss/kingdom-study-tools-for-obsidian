### 1
Arise, [[H6965]] shine; [[H215]] for [[H3588]] thy light [[H216]] is come, [[H935]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is risen [[H2224]] upon [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 2
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the darkness [[H2822]] shall cover [[H3680]] the earth, [[H776]] and gross darkness [[H6205]] the people: [[H3816]] but the Lord [[H3068]] shall arise [[H2224]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and his glory [[H3519]] shall be seen [[H7200]] upon [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 3
And the Gentiles [[H1471]] shall come [[H1980]] to thy light, [[H216]] and kings [[H4428]] to the brightness [[H5051]] of thy rising. [[H2225]]

### 4
Lift up [[H5375]] thine eyes [[H5869]] round about, [[H5439]] and see: [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] they gather themselves together, [[H6908]] they come [[H935]] to thee: thy sons [[H1121]] shall come [[H935]] from far, [[H7350]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] shall be nursed [[H539]] at [[H5921]] side. [[H6654]]

### 5
Then [[H227]] thou shalt see, [[H7200]] and flow together, [[H5102]] and thine heart [[H3824]] shall fear, [[H6342]] and be enlarged; [[H7337]] because [[H3588]] the abundance [[H1995]] of the sea [[H3220]] shall be converted [[H2015]] unto [[H5921]] thee, the forces [[H2428]] of the Gentiles [[H1471]] shall come [[H935]] unto thee. [[H935]]

### 6
The multitude [[H8229]] of camels [[H1581]] shall cover [[H3680]] thee, the dromedaries [[H1070]] of Midian [[H4080]] and Ephah; [[H5891]] all [[H3605]] they from Sheba [[H7614]] shall come: [[H935]] they shall bring [[H5375]] gold [[H2091]] and incense; [[H3828]] and they shall shew forth [[H1319]] the praises [[H8416]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] the flocks [[H6629]] of Kedar [[H6938]] shall be gathered together [[H6908]] unto thee, the rams [[H352]] of Nebaioth [[H5032]] shall minister [[H8334]] unto thee: they shall come up [[H5927]] with [[H5921]] acceptance [[H7522]] on mine altar, [[H4196]] and I will glorify [[H6286]] the house [[H1004]] of my glory. [[H8597]]

### 8
Who [[H4310]] these [[H428]] fly [[H5774]] as a cloud, [[H5645]] and as the doves [[H3123]] to [[H413]] their windows? [[H699]]

### 9
Surely [[H3588]] the isles [[H339]] shall wait [[H6960]] for me, and the ships [[H591]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] first, [[H7223]] to bring [[H935]] thy sons [[H1121]] from far, [[H7350]] their silver [[H3701]] and their gold [[H2091]] with [[H854]] them, unto the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and to the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H3588]] he hath glorified [[H6286]] thee. [[H6286]]

### 10
And the sons [[H1121]] of strangers [[H5236]] shall build up [[H1129]] thy walls, [[H2346]] and their kings [[H4428]] shall minister [[H8334]] unto thee: for [[H3588]] in my wrath [[H7110]] I smote [[H5221]] thee, but in my favour [[H7522]] have I had mercy [[H7355]] on thee. [[H7355]]

### 11
Therefore thy gates [[H8179]] shall be open [[H6605]] continually; [[H8548]] they shall not [[H3808]] be shut [[H5462]] day [[H3119]] nor night; [[H3915]] that may bring [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee the forces [[H2428]] of the Gentiles, [[H1471]] and their kings [[H4428]] brought. [[H5090]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] the nation [[H1471]] and kingdom [[H4467]] that [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] thee shall perish; [[H6]] yea, nations [[H1471]] shall be utterly [[H2717]] wasted. [[H2717]]

### 13
The glory [[H3519]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] shall come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, the fir tree, [[H1265]] the pine tree, [[H8410]] and the box [[H8391]] together, [[H3162]] to beautify [[H6286]] the place [[H4725]] of my sanctuary; [[H4720]] and I will make the place [[H4725]] of my feet [[H7272]] glorious. [[H3513]]

### 14
The sons [[H1121]] also of them that afflicted [[H6031]] thee shall come [[H1980]] bending [[H7817]] unto [[H413]] thee; and all [[H3605]] they that despised [[H5006]] thee shall bow themselves down [[H7812]] at [[H5921]] the soles [[H3709]] of thy feet; [[H7272]] and they shall call [[H7121]] thee, The city [[H5892]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] The Zion [[H6726]] of the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
Whereas [[H8478]] thou hast been [[H1961]] forsaken [[H5800]] and hated, [[H8130]] so that no man [[H369]] went through [[H5674]] I will make [[H7760]] thee an eternal [[H5769]] excellency, [[H1347]] a joy [[H4885]] of many [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 16
Thou shalt also suck [[H3243]] the milk [[H2461]] of the Gentiles, [[H1471]] and shalt suck [[H3243]] the breast [[H7699]] of kings: [[H4428]] and thou shalt know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy Saviour [[H3467]] and thy Redeemer, [[H1350]] the mighty One [[H46]] of Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 17
For [[H8478]] brass [[H5178]] I will bring [[H935]] gold, [[H2091]] and for [[H8478]] iron [[H1270]] I will bring [[H935]] silver, [[H3701]] and for [[H8478]] wood [[H6086]] brass, [[H5178]] and for [[H8478]] stones [[H68]] iron: [[H1270]] I will also make [[H7760]] thy officers [[H6486]] peace, [[H7965]] and thine exactors [[H5065]] righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 18
Violence [[H2555]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] be heard [[H8085]] in thy land, [[H776]] wasting [[H7701]] nor destruction [[H7667]] within thy borders; [[H1366]] but thou shalt call [[H7121]] thy walls [[H2346]] Salvation, [[H3444]] and thy gates [[H8179]] Praise. [[H8416]]

### 19
The sun [[H8121]] shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] thy light [[H216]] by day; [[H3119]] neither [[H3808]] for brightness [[H5051]] shall the moon [[H3394]] give light [[H216]] unto thee: but the Lord [[H3068]] shall be [[H1961]] unto thee an everlasting [[H5769]] light, [[H215]] and thy God [[H430]] thy glory. [[H8597]]

### 20
Thy sun [[H8121]] shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] go down; [[H935]] neither [[H3808]] shall thy moon [[H3391]] withdraw itself: [[H622]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall be [[H1961]] thine everlasting [[H5769]] light, [[H216]] and the days [[H3117]] of thy mourning [[H60]] shall be ended. [[H7999]]

### 21
Thy people [[H5971]] also all [[H3605]] righteous: [[H6662]] they shall inherit [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] for ever, [[H5769]] the branch [[H5342]] of my planting, [[H4302]] the work [[H4639]] of my hands, [[H3027]] that I may be glorified. [[H6286]]

### 22
A little one [[H6996]] shall become [[H1961]] a thousand, [[H505]] and a small one [[H6810]] a strong [[H6099]] nation: [[H1471]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] will hasten [[H2363]] it in his time. [[H6256]]
