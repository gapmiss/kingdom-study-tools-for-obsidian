### 1
Send [[H7971]] ye the lamb [[H3733]] to the ruler [[H4910]] of the land [[H776]] from Sela [[H5554]] to the wilderness, [[H4057]] unto [[H413]] the mount [[H2022]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion. [[H6726]]

### 2
For it shall be, [[H1961]] as a wandering [[H5074]] bird [[H5775]] cast out [[H7971]] of the nest, [[H7064]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Moab [[H4124]] shall be [[H1961]] at the fords [[H4569]] of Arnon. [[H769]]

### 3
Take [[H935]] counsel, [[H6098]] execute [[H6213]] judgment; [[H6415]] make [[H7896]] thy shadow [[H6738]] as the night [[H3915]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the noonday; [[H6672]] hide [[H5641]] the outcasts; [[H5080]] bewray [[H1540]] not [[H408]] him that wandereth. [[H5074]]

### 4
Let mine outcasts [[H5080]] dwell [[H1481]] with thee, Moab; [[H4124]] be [[H1933]] thou a covert [[H5643]] to them from the face [[H6440]] of the spoiler: [[H7703]] for [[H3588]] the extortioner [[H4160]] is at an end, [[H656]] the spoiler [[H7701]] ceaseth, [[H3615]] the oppressors [[H7429]] are consumed [[H8552]] out of [[H4480]] the land. [[H776]]

### 5
And in mercy [[H2617]] shall the throne [[H3678]] be established: [[H3559]] and he shall sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] it in truth [[H571]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of David, [[H1732]] judging, [[H8199]] and seeking [[H1875]] judgment, [[H4941]] and hasting [[H4106]] righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 6
We have heard [[H8085]] of the pride [[H1347]] of Moab; [[H4124]] very [[H3966]] proud: [[H1341]] of his haughtiness, [[H1346]] and his pride, [[H1347]] and his wrath: [[H5678]] his lies [[H907]] not [[H3808]] so. [[H3808]]

### 7
Therefore [[H3651]] shall Moab [[H4124]] howl [[H3213]] for Moab, [[H4124]] every one [[H3605]] shall howl: [[H3213]] for the foundations [[H808]] of Kir-hareseth [[H7025]] shall ye mourn; [[H1897]] surely [[H389]] stricken. [[H5218]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] the fields [[H7709]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] languish, [[H535]] the vine [[H1612]] of Sibmah: [[H7643]] the lords [[H1167]] of the heathen [[H1471]] have broken down [[H1986]] the principal plants [[H8291]] thereof, they are come [[H5060]] unto [[H5704]] Jazer, [[H3270]] they wandered [[H8582]] the wilderness: [[H4057]] her branches [[H7976]] are stretched out, [[H5203]] they are gone over [[H5674]] the sea. [[H3220]]

### 9
Therefore [[H5921]] I will bewail [[H1058]] with the weeping [[H1065]] of Jazer [[H3270]] the vine [[H1612]] of Sibmah: [[H7643]] I will water [[H7301]] thee with my tears, [[H1832]] O Heshbon, [[H2809]] and Elealeh: [[H500]] for [[H3588]] the shouting [[H1959]] for [[H5921]] thy summer fruits [[H7019]] and for [[H5921]] thy harvest [[H7105]] is fallen. [[H5307]]

### 10
And gladness [[H8057]] is taken away, [[H622]] and joy [[H1524]] out of [[H4480]] the plentiful field; [[H3759]] and in the vineyards [[H3754]] there shall be no [[H3808]] singing, [[H7442]] neither [[H3808]] shall there be shouting: [[H7321]] the treaders [[H1869]] shall tread out [[H1869]] no [[H3808]] wine [[H3196]] in presses; [[H3342]] I have made shouting [[H1959]] to cease. [[H7673]]

### 11
Wherefore [[H5921]] my bowels [[H4578]] shall sound [[H1993]] like an harp [[H3658]] for Moab, [[H4124]] and mine inward parts [[H7130]] for Kir-haresh. [[H7025]]

### 12
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] it is seen [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Moab [[H4124]] is weary [[H3811]] on [[H5921]] the high place, [[H1116]] that he shall come [[H935]] to [[H413]] his sanctuary [[H4720]] to pray; [[H6419]] but he shall not [[H3808]] prevail. [[H3201]]

### 13
This [[H2088]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] concerning [[H413]] Moab [[H4124]] since that time. [[H227]]

### 14
But now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken, [[H1696]] saying, [[H559]] Within three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] as the years [[H8141]] of an hireling, [[H7916]] and the glory [[H3519]] of Moab [[H4124]] shall be contemned, [[H7034]] with all [[H3605]] that great [[H7227]] multitude; [[H1995]] and the remnant [[H7605]] very [[H4592]] small [[H4213]] feeble.
