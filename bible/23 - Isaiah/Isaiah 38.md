### 1
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] was Hezekiah [[H2396]] sick [[H2470]] unto death. [[H4191]] And Isaiah [[H3470]] the prophet [[H5030]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] him, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Set thine house [[H1004]] in order: [[H6680]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] shalt die, [[H4191]] and not [[H3808]] live. [[H2421]]

### 2
Then Hezekiah [[H2396]] turned [[H5437]] his face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the wall, [[H7023]] and prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 3
And said, [[H559]] Remember [[H2142]] now, [[H4994]] O Lord, [[H3068]] I beseech thee, [[H577]] how [[H834]] I have walked [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] thee in truth [[H571]] and with a perfect [[H8003]] heart, [[H3820]] and have done [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] in thy sight. [[H5869]] And Hezekiah [[H2396]] wept [[H1065]] sore. [[H1419]]

### 4
Then came [[H1961]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] saying, [[H559]]

### 5
Go, [[H1980]] and say [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of David [[H1732]] thy father, [[H1]] I have heard [[H8085]] thy prayer, [[H8605]] I have seen [[H7200]] thy tears: [[H1832]] behold, [[H2005]] I will add [[H3254]] unto [[H5921]] thy days [[H3117]] fifteen [[H2568]] years. [[H8141]]

### 6
And I will deliver [[H5337]] thee and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] out of the hand [[H3709]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria: [[H804]] and I will defend [[H1598]] this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]]

### 7
And this [[H2088]] a sign [[H226]] unto thee from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he hath spoken; [[H1696]]

### 8
Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring again [[H7725]] the shadow [[H6738]] of the degrees, [[H4609]] which [[H834]] is gone down [[H3381]] in the sun [[H8121]] dial [[H4609]] of Ahaz, [[H271]] ten [[H6235]] degrees [[H4609]] backward. [[H322]] So the sun [[H8121]] returned [[H7725]] ten [[H6235]] degrees, [[H4609]] by which [[H834]] degrees [[H4609]] it was gone down. [[H3381]]

### 9
The writing [[H4385]] of Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] when he had been sick, [[H2470]] and was recovered [[H2421]] of his sickness: [[H2483]]

### 10
I [[H589]] said [[H559]] in the cutting off [[H1824]] of my days, [[H3117]] I shall go [[H1980]] to the gates [[H8179]] of the grave: [[H7585]] I am deprived [[H6485]] of the residue [[H3499]] of my years. [[H8141]]

### 11
I said, [[H559]] I shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] the Lord, [[H3050]] the Lord, [[H3050]] in the land [[H776]] of the living: [[H2416]] I shall behold [[H5027]] man [[H120]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] with [[H5973]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world. [[H2309]]

### 12
Mine age [[H1755]] is departed, [[H5265]] and is removed [[H1540]] from [[H4480]] me as a shepherd's [[H7473]] tent: [[H168]] I have cut off [[H7088]] like a weaver [[H707]] my life: [[H2416]] he will cut me off [[H1214]] with pining sickness: [[H1803]] from day [[H3117]] to [[H5704]] night [[H3915]] wilt thou make an end [[H7999]] of me. [[H7999]]

### 13
I reckoned [[H7737]] till [[H5704]] morning, [[H1242]] as a lion, [[H738]] so [[H3651]] will he break [[H7665]] all [[H3605]] my bones: [[H6106]] from day [[H3117]] to [[H5704]] night [[H3915]] wilt thou make an end [[H7999]] of me. [[H7999]]

### 14
Like a crane [[H5483]] a swallow, [[H5693]] so [[H3651]] did I chatter: [[H6850]] I did mourn [[H1897]] as a dove: [[H3123]] mine eyes [[H5869]] fail [[H1809]] upward: [[H4791]] O Lord, [[H136]] I am oppressed; [[H6234]] undertake [[H6148]] for me. [[H6148]]

### 15
What [[H4100]] shall I say? [[H1696]] he hath both spoken [[H559]] unto me, and himself [[H1931]] hath done [[H6213]] I shall go softly [[H1718]] all [[H3605]] my years [[H8141]] in [[H5921]] the bitterness [[H4751]] of my soul. [[H5315]]

### 16
O Lord, [[H136]] by [[H5921]] these live, [[H2421]] and in all [[H3605]] these [[H2004]] the life [[H2416]] of my spirit: [[H7307]] so wilt thou recover [[H2492]] me, and make me to live. [[H2421]]

### 17
Behold, [[H2009]] for peace [[H7965]] I had great bitterness: [[H4751]] but thou [[H859]] hast in love [[H2836]] to my soul [[H5315]] from the pit [[H7845]] of corruption: [[H1097]] for [[H3588]] thou hast cast [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] my sins [[H2399]] behind [[H310]] thy back. [[H1460]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] the grave [[H7585]] cannot [[H3808]] praise [[H3034]] thee, death [[H4194]] can celebrate [[H1984]] thee: they that go down [[H3381]] into the pit [[H953]] cannot [[H3808]] hope [[H7663]] for [[H413]] thy truth. [[H571]]

### 19
The living, [[H2416]] the living, [[H2416]] he [[H1931]] shall praise [[H3034]] thee, as I this day: [[H3117]] the father [[H1]] to the children [[H1121]] shall make known [[H3045]] thy truth. [[H571]]

### 20
The Lord [[H3068]] to save [[H3467]] me: therefore we will sing my songs [[H5058]] to the stringed instruments [[H5059]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of our life [[H2416]] in [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
For Isaiah [[H3470]] had said, [[H559]] Let them take [[H5375]] a lump [[H1690]] of figs, [[H8384]] and lay for a plaister [[H4799]] upon [[H5921]] the boil, [[H7822]] and he shall recover. [[H2421]]

### 22
Hezekiah [[H2396]] also had said, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] the sign [[H226]] that [[H3588]] I shall go up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]
