### 1
In the year [[H8141]] that king [[H4428]] Uzziah [[H5818]] died [[H4194]] I saw [[H7200]] also [[H853]] the Lord [[H136]] sitting [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] a throne, [[H3678]] high [[H7311]] and lifted up, [[H5375]] and his train [[H7757]] filled [[H4390]] the temple. [[H1964]]

### 2
Above [[H4605]] it stood [[H5975]] the seraphims: [[H8314]] each one [[H259]] had six [[H8337]] wings; [[H3671]] with twain [[H8147]] he covered [[H3680]] his face, [[H6440]] and with twain [[H8147]] he covered [[H3680]] his feet, [[H7272]] and with twain [[H8147]] he did fly. [[H5774]]

### 3
And one cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] another, [[H2088]] and said, [[H559]] Holy, [[H6918]] holy, [[H6918]] holy, [[H6918]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts: [[H6635]] the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] full [[H4393]] of his glory. [[H3519]]

### 4
And the posts [[H520]] of the door [[H5592]] moved [[H5128]] at the voice [[H6963]] of him that cried, [[H7121]] and the house [[H1004]] was filled [[H4390]] with smoke. [[H6227]]

### 5
Then said [[H559]] I, Woe [[H188]] me! for [[H3588]] I am undone; [[H1820]] because [[H3588]] I [[H595]] a man [[H376]] of unclean [[H2931]] lips, [[H8193]] and I dwell [[H3427]] in the midst [[H8432]] of a people [[H5971]] of unclean [[H2931]] lips: [[H8193]] for [[H3588]] mine eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] the King, [[H4428]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 6
Then flew [[H5774]] one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] the seraphims [[H8314]] unto [[H413]] me, having a live coal [[H7531]] in his hand, [[H3027]] he had taken [[H3947]] with the tongs [[H4457]] from off [[H5921]] the altar: [[H4196]]

### 7
And he laid [[H5060]] upon [[H5921]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and said, [[H559]] Lo, [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] hath touched [[H5060]] thy lips; [[H8193]] and thine iniquity [[H5771]] is taken away, [[H5493]] and thy sin [[H2403]] purged. [[H3722]]

### 8
Also I heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord, [[H136]] saying, [[H559]] Whom [[H4310]] shall I send, [[H7971]] and who [[H4310]] will go [[H1980]] for us? Then said [[H559]] I, Here I; [[H2005]] send [[H7971]] me. [[H7971]]

### 9
And he said, [[H559]] Go, [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] Hear [[H8085]] ye indeed, [[H8085]] but understand [[H995]] not; [[H408]] and see [[H7200]] ye indeed, [[H7200]] but perceive [[H3045]] not. [[H3045]]

### 10
Make the heart [[H3820]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] fat, [[H8080]] and make their ears [[H241]] heavy, [[H3513]] and shut [[H8173]] their eyes; [[H5869]] lest [[H6435]] they see [[H7200]] with their eyes, [[H5869]] and hear [[H8085]] with their ears, [[H241]] and understand [[H995]] with their heart, [[H3824]] and convert, [[H7725]] and be healed. [[H7495]]

### 11
Then said [[H559]] I, Lord, [[H136]] how long? [[H5704]] And he answered, [[H559]] Until [[H5704]] the cities [[H5892]] be wasted [[H7582]] without [[H369]] inhabitant, [[H3427]] and the houses [[H1004]] without [[H369]] man, [[H120]] and the land [[H127]] be utterly [[H8077]] desolate, [[H7582]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] have removed [[H7368]] men [[H120]]  far away, [[H853]] and a great [[H7227]] forsaking [[H5805]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 13
But yet [[H5750]] in it a tenth, [[H6224]] and shall return, [[H7725]] and shall be [[H1961]] eaten: [[H1197]] as a teil tree, [[H424]] and as an oak, [[H437]] whose [[H834]] substance [[H4678]] in them, when they cast [[H7995]] the holy [[H6944]] seed [[H2233]] the substance [[H4678]] thereof.
