# Isaiah 1

[[Song of Solomon 8|←]] • [[Isaiah 2|→]]

---

### 1
The vision [[H2377]] of Isaiah [[H3470]] the son [[H1121]] of Amoz, [[H531]] which [[H834]] he saw [[H2372]] concerning [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] in the days [[H3117]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] Jotham, [[H3147]] Ahaz, [[H271]] Hezekiah, [[H3169]] kings [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
Hear, [[H8085]] O heavens, [[H8064]] and give ear, [[H238]] O earth: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken, [[H1696]] I have nourished [[H1431]] and brought up [[H7311]] children, [[H1121]] and they [[H1992]] have rebelled [[H6586]] against me. [[H6586]]

### 3
The ox [[H7794]] knoweth [[H3045]] his owner, [[H7069]] and the ass [[H2543]] his master's [[H1167]] crib: [[H18]] Israel [[H3478]] doth not [[H3808]] know, [[H3045]] my people [[H5971]] doth not [[H3808]] consider. [[H995]]

### 4
Ah [[H1945]] sinful [[H2398]] nation, [[H1471]] a people [[H5971]] laden [[H3515]] with iniquity, [[H5771]] a seed [[H2233]] of evildoers, [[H7489]] children [[H1121]] that are corrupters: [[H7843]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] they have provoked [[H5006]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel [[H3478]] unto anger, they are gone away [[H2114]] backward. [[H268]]

### 5
Why [[H5921]] should ye be stricken [[H5221]] any more? [[H5750]] ye will revolt [[H5627]] more and more: [[H3254]] the whole [[H3605]] head [[H7218]] is sick, [[H2483]] and the whole [[H3605]] heart [[H3824]] faint. [[H1742]]

### 6
From the sole [[H3709]] of the foot [[H7272]] even unto [[H5704]] the head [[H7218]] no [[H369]] soundness [[H4974]] in it; wounds, [[H6482]] and bruises, [[H2250]] and putrifying [[H2961]] sores: [[H4347]] they have not [[H3808]] been closed, [[H2115]] neither [[H3808]] bound up, [[H2280]] neither [[H3808]] mollified [[H7401]] with ointment. [[H8081]]

### 7
Your country [[H776]] desolate, [[H8077]] your cities [[H5892]] burned [[H8313]] with fire: [[H784]] your land, [[H127]] strangers [[H2114]] devour [[H398]] it in your presence, [[H5048]] and desolate, [[H8077]] as overthrown [[H4114]] by strangers. [[H2114]]

### 8
And the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] is left [[H3498]] as a cottage [[H5521]] in a vineyard, [[H3754]] as a lodge [[H4412]] in a garden of cucumbers, [[H4750]] as a besieged [[H5341]] city. [[H5892]]

### 9
Except [[H3884]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] had left [[H3498]] unto us a very small [[H4592]] remnant, [[H8300]] we should have been [[H1961]] as Sodom, [[H5467]] we should have been like [[H1819]] unto Gomorrah. [[H6017]]

### 10
Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] ye rulers [[H7101]] of Sodom; [[H5467]] give ear [[H238]] unto the law [[H8451]] of our God, [[H430]] ye people [[H5971]] of Gomorrah. [[H6017]]

### 11
To what [[H4100]] purpose the multitude [[H7230]] of your sacrifices [[H2077]] unto me? saith [[H559]] the Lord: [[H3068]] I am full [[H7646]] of the burnt offerings [[H5930]] of rams, [[H352]] and the fat [[H2459]] of fed beasts; [[H4806]] and I delight [[H2654]] not [[H3808]] in the blood [[H1818]] of bullocks, [[H6499]] or of lambs, [[H3532]] or of he goats. [[H6260]]

### 12
When [[H3588]] ye come [[H935]] to appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] me, who [[H4310]] hath required [[H1245]] this [[H2063]] at your hand, [[H3027]] to tread [[H7429]] my courts? [[H2691]]

### 13
Bring [[H935]] no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] vain [[H7723]] oblations; [[H4503]] incense [[H7004]] is an abomination [[H8441]] unto me; the new moons [[H2320]] and sabbaths, [[H7676]] the calling [[H7121]] of assemblies, [[H4744]] I cannot [[H3808]] away with; [[H3201]] iniquity, [[H205]] even the solemn meeting. [[H6116]]

### 14
Your new moons [[H2320]] and your appointed feasts [[H4150]] my soul [[H5315]] hateth: [[H8130]] they are [[H1961]] a trouble [[H2960]] unto me; [[H5921]] I am weary [[H3811]] to bear [[H5375]]

### 15
And when ye spread forth [[H6566]] your hands, [[H3709]] I will hide [[H5956]] mine eyes [[H5869]] from [[H4480]] you: yea, [[H1571]] when [[H3588]] ye make many [[H7235]] prayers, [[H8605]] I will not [[H369]] hear: [[H8085]] your hands [[H3027]] are full [[H4390]] of blood. [[H1818]]

### 16
Wash [[H7364]] you, make you clean; [[H2135]] put away [[H5493]] the evil [[H7455]] of your doings [[H4611]] from before [[H5048]] mine eyes; [[H5869]] cease [[H2308]] to do evil; [[H7489]]

### 17
Learn [[H3925]] to do well; [[H3190]] seek [[H1875]] judgment, [[H4941]] relieve [[H833]] the oppressed, [[H2541]] judge [[H8199]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] plead [[H7378]] for the widow. [[H490]]

### 18
Come [[H1980]] now, [[H4994]] and let us reason together, [[H3198]] saith [[H559]] the Lord: [[H3068]] though [[H518]] your sins [[H2399]] be [[H1961]] as scarlet, [[H8144]] they shall be as white [[H3835]] as snow; [[H7950]] though [[H518]] they be red [[H119]] like crimson, [[H8438]] they shall be [[H1961]] as wool. [[H6785]]

### 19
If [[H518]] ye be willing [[H14]] and obedient, [[H8085]] ye shall eat [[H398]] the good [[H2898]] of the land: [[H776]]

### 20
But if [[H518]] ye refuse [[H3985]] and rebel, [[H4784]] ye shall be devoured [[H398]] with the sword: [[H2719]] for [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]]

### 21
How [[H349]] is the faithful [[H539]] city [[H7151]] become [[H1961]] an harlot! [[H2181]] it was full [[H4392]] of judgment; [[H4941]] righteousness [[H6664]] lodged [[H3885]] in it; but now [[H6258]] murderers. [[H7523]]

### 22
Thy silver [[H3701]] is become [[H1961]] dross, [[H5509]] thy wine [[H5435]] mixed [[H4107]] with water: [[H4325]]

### 23
Thy princes [[H8269]] rebellious, [[H5637]] and companions [[H2270]] of thieves: [[H1590]] every one [[H3605]] loveth [[H157]] gifts, [[H7810]] and followeth after [[H7291]] rewards: [[H8021]] they judge [[H8199]] not [[H3808]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] neither [[H3808]] doth the cause [[H7379]] of the widow [[H490]] come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 24
Therefore [[H3651]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H113]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the mighty One [[H46]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Ah, [[H1945]] I will ease [[H5162]] me of mine adversaries, [[H6862]] and avenge [[H5358]] me of mine enemies: [[H341]]

### 25
And I will turn [[H7725]] my hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and purely [[H1252]] purge away [[H6884]] thy dross, [[H5509]] and take away [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] thy tin: [[H913]]

### 26
And I will restore [[H7725]] thy judges [[H8199]] as at the first, [[H7223]] and thy counsellers [[H3289]] as at the beginning: [[H8462]] afterward [[H310]] thou shalt be called, [[H7121]] The city [[H5892]] of righteousness, [[H6664]] the faithful [[H539]] city. [[H7151]]

### 27
Zion [[H6726]] shall be redeemed [[H6299]] with judgment, [[H4941]] and her converts [[H7725]] with righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 28
And the destruction [[H7667]] of the transgressors [[H6586]] and of the sinners [[H2400]] together, [[H3162]] and they that forsake [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall be consumed. [[H3615]]

### 29
For [[H3588]] they shall be ashamed [[H954]] of the oaks [[H352]] which [[H834]] ye have desired, [[H2530]] and ye shall be confounded [[H2659]] for the gardens [[H1593]] that [[H834]] ye have chosen. [[H977]]

### 30
For [[H3588]] ye shall be [[H1961]] as an oak [[H424]] whose leaf [[H5929]] fadeth, [[H5034]] and as a garden [[H1593]] that [[H834]] hath no [[H369]] water. [[H4325]]

### 31
And the strong [[H2634]] shall be [[H1961]] as tow, [[H5296]] and the maker [[H6467]] of it as a spark, [[H5213]] and they shall both [[H8147]] burn [[H1197]] together, [[H3162]] and none [[H369]] shall quench [[H3518]]
