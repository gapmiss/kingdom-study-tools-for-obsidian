### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to the crown [[H5850]] of pride, [[H1348]] to the drunkards [[H7910]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] whose glorious [[H6643]] beauty [[H8597]] a fading [[H5034]] flower, [[H6731]] which [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the fat [[H8081]] valleys [[H1516]] of them that are overcome [[H1986]] with wine! [[H3196]]

### 2
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] hath a mighty [[H2389]] and strong one, [[H533]] as a tempest [[H2230]] of hail [[H1259]] a destroying [[H6986]] storm, [[H8178]] as a flood [[H2230]] of mighty [[H3524]] waters [[H4325]] overflowing, [[H7857]] shall cast down [[H3240]] to the earth [[H776]] with the hand. [[H3027]]

### 3
The crown [[H5850]] of pride, [[H1348]] the drunkards [[H7910]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] shall be trodden [[H7429]] under feet: [[H7272]]

### 4
And the glorious [[H6643]] beauty, [[H8597]] which [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the fat [[H8081]] valley, [[H1516]] shall be [[H1961]] a fading [[H5034]] flower, [[H6733]] as the hasty fruit [[H1061]] before [[H2962]] the summer; [[H7019]] which [[H834]] he that looketh [[H7200]] upon it seeth, [[H7200]] while it is yet [[H5750]] in his hand [[H3709]] he eateth it up. [[H1104]]

### 5
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] be [[H1961]] for a crown [[H5850]] of glory, [[H6643]] and for a diadem [[H6843]] of beauty, [[H8597]] unto the residue [[H7605]] of his people, [[H5971]]

### 6
And for a spirit [[H7307]] of judgment [[H4941]] to him that sitteth [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] judgment, [[H4941]] and for strength [[H1369]] to them that turn [[H7725]] the battle [[H4421]] to the gate. [[H8179]]

### 7
But they [[H428]] also [[H1571]] have erred [[H7686]] through wine, [[H3196]] and through strong drink [[H7941]] are out of the way; [[H8582]] the priest [[H3548]] and the prophet [[H5030]] have erred [[H7686]] through strong drink, [[H7941]] they are swallowed up [[H1104]] of [[H4480]] wine, [[H3196]] they are out of the way [[H8582]] through [[H4480]] strong drink; [[H7941]] they err [[H7686]] in vision, [[H7203]] they stumble [[H6328]] judgment. [[H6417]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] tables [[H7979]] are full [[H4390]] of vomit [[H6892]] filthiness, [[H6675]] no [[H1097]] place [[H4725]]

### 9
Whom [[H4310]] shall he teach [[H3384]] knowledge? [[H1844]] and whom [[H4310]] shall he make to understand [[H995]] doctrine? [[H8052]] weaned [[H1580]] from the milk, [[H2461]] drawn [[H6267]] from the breasts. [[H7699]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] precept [[H6673]] upon precept, [[H6673]] precept [[H6673]] upon precept; [[H6673]] line [[H6957]] upon line, [[H6957]] line [[H6957]] upon line; [[H6957]] here [[H8033]] a little, [[H2191]] there [[H8033]] a little: [[H2191]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] with stammering [[H3934]] lips [[H8193]] and another [[H312]] tongue [[H3956]] will he speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]

### 12
To [[H413]] whom [[H834]] he said, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] the rest [[H4496]] ye may cause the weary [[H5889]] to rest; [[H5117]] and this [[H2063]] the refreshing: [[H4774]] yet they would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hear. [[H8085]]

### 13
But the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] unto them precept [[H6673]] upon precept, [[H6673]] precept [[H6673]] upon precept; [[H6673]] line [[H6957]] upon line, [[H6957]] line [[H6957]] upon line; [[H6957]] here [[H8033]] a little, [[H2191]] there [[H8033]] a little; [[H2191]] that [[H4616]] they might go, [[H1980]] and fall [[H3782]] backward, [[H268]] and be broken, [[H7665]] and snared, [[H3369]] and taken. [[H3920]]

### 14
Wherefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] ye scornful [[H3944]] men, [[H376]] that rule [[H4910]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] which [[H834]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 15
Because [[H3588]] ye have said, [[H559]] We have made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] death, [[H4194]] and with [[H5973]] hell [[H7585]] are we [[H6213]] at agreement; [[H2374]] when [[H3588]] the overflowing [[H7857]] scourge [[H7752]] shall pass through, [[H5674]] it shall not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] unto us: for [[H3588]] we have made [[H7760]] lies [[H3577]] our refuge, [[H4268]] and under falsehood [[H8267]] have we hid ourselves: [[H5641]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2005]] I in Zion [[H6726]] lay for a foundation [[H3245]] a stone, [[H68]] a tried [[H976]] stone, [[H68]] a precious [[H3368]] corner [[H6438]] a sure [[H3245]] foundation: [[H4143]] he that believeth [[H539]] shall not [[H3808]] make haste. [[H2363]]

### 17
Judgment [[H4941]] also will I lay [[H7760]] to the line, [[H6957]] and righteousness [[H6666]] to the plummet: [[H4949]] and the hail [[H1259]] shall sweep away [[H3261]] the refuge [[H4268]] of lies, [[H3577]] and the waters [[H4325]] shall overflow [[H7857]] the hiding place. [[H5643]]

### 18
And your covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] death [[H4194]] shall be disannulled, [[H3722]] and your agreement [[H2380]] with [[H854]] hell [[H7585]] shall not [[H3808]] stand; [[H6965]] when [[H3588]] the overflowing [[H7857]] scourge [[H7752]] shall pass through, [[H5674]] then ye shall be [[H1961]] trodden down [[H4823]] by it. [[H4823]]

### 19
From the time [[H1767]] that it goeth forth [[H5674]] it shall take [[H3947]] you: for [[H3588]] morning [[H1242]] by morning [[H1242]] shall it pass over, [[H5674]] by day [[H3117]] and by night: [[H3915]] and it shall be [[H1961]] a vexation [[H2113]] only [[H7535]] understand [[H995]] the report. [[H8052]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] the bed [[H4702]] is shorter [[H7114]] than that can stretch [[H8311]] himself and the covering [[H4541]] narrower [[H6887]] than that he can wrap himself [[H3664]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall rise up [[H6965]] as mount [[H2022]] Perazim, [[H6559]] he shall be wroth [[H7264]] as the valley [[H6010]] of Gibeon, [[H1391]] that he may do [[H6213]] his work, [[H4639]] his strange [[H2114]] work; [[H4639]] and bring to pass [[H5647]] his act, [[H5656]] his strange [[H5237]] act. [[H5656]]

### 22
Now [[H6258]] therefore be ye not mockers, [[H3887]] lest [[H6435]] your bands [[H4147]] be made strong: [[H2388]] for [[H3588]] I have heard [[H8085]] from [[H853]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] a consumption, [[H3617]] even determined [[H2782]] upon [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]]

### 23
Give ye ear, [[H238]] and hear [[H8085]] my voice; [[H6963]] hearken, [[H7181]] and hear [[H8085]] my speech. [[H565]]

### 24
Doth the plowman [[H2790]] plow [[H2790]] all [[H3605]] day [[H3117]] to sow? [[H2232]] doth he open [[H6605]] and break the clods [[H7702]] of his ground? [[H127]]

### 25
When [[H518]] he hath made plain [[H7737]] the face [[H6440]] thereof, doth he not [[H3808]] cast abroad [[H6327]] the fitches, [[H7100]] and scatter [[H2236]] the cummin, [[H3646]] and cast [[H7760]] in the principal [[H7795]] wheat [[H2406]] and the appointed [[H5567]] barley [[H8184]] and the rie [[H3698]] in their place? [[H1367]]

### 26
For his God [[H430]] doth instruct [[H3256]] him to discretion, [[H4941]] doth teach [[H3384]] him. [[H3384]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] the fitches [[H7100]] are not [[H3808]] threshed [[H1758]] with a threshing instrument, [[H2742]] neither is a cart [[H5699]] wheel [[H212]] turned [[H5437]] about upon [[H5921]] the cummin; [[H3646]] but [[H3588]] the fitches [[H7100]] are beaten out [[H2251]] with a staff, [[H4294]] and the cummin [[H3646]] with a rod. [[H7626]]

### 28
Bread [[H3899]] is bruised; [[H1854]] because [[H3588]] he will not [[H3808]] ever [[H5331]] be threshing [[H156]] it, nor break [[H2000]] the wheel [[H1536]] of his cart, [[H5699]] nor [[H3808]] bruise [[H1854]] it his horsemen. [[H6571]]

### 29
This [[H2063]] also [[H1571]] cometh forth [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] is wonderful [[H6381]] in counsel, [[H6098]] excellent [[H1431]] in working. [[H8454]]
