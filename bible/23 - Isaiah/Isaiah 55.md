### 1
Ho, [[H1945]] every one [[H3605]] that thirsteth, [[H6771]] come [[H1980]] ye to the waters, [[H4325]] and he that [[H834]] hath no [[H369]] money; [[H3701]] come [[H1980]] ye, buy, [[H7666]] and eat; [[H398]] yea, come, [[H1980]] buy [[H7666]] wine [[H3196]] and milk [[H2461]] without [[H3808]] money [[H3701]] and without [[H3808]] price. [[H4242]]

### 2
Wherefore [[H4100]] do ye spend [[H8254]] money [[H3701]] for not [[H3808]] bread? [[H3899]] and your labour [[H3018]] for satisfieth [[H7654]] not? [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] diligently [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, and eat [[H398]] ye good, [[H2896]] and let your soul [[H5315]] delight itself [[H6026]] in fatness. [[H1880]]

### 3
Incline [[H5186]] your ear, [[H241]] and come [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] me: hear, [[H8085]] and your soul [[H5315]] shall live; [[H2421]] and I will make [[H3772]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] with you, the sure [[H539]] mercies [[H2617]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2005]] I have given [[H5414]] him a witness [[H5707]] to the people, [[H3816]] a leader [[H5057]] and commander [[H6680]] to the people. [[H3816]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2005]] thou shalt call [[H7121]] a nation [[H1471]] thou knowest [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] and nations [[H1471]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] thee shall run [[H7323]] unto [[H413]] thee because [[H4616]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] and for the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel; [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] he hath glorified [[H6286]] thee. [[H6286]]

### 6
Seek [[H1875]] ye the Lord [[H3068]] while he may be found, [[H4672]] call [[H7121]] ye upon him while he is [[H1961]] near: [[H7138]]

### 7
Let the wicked [[H7563]] forsake [[H5800]] his way, [[H1870]] and the unrighteous [[H205]] man [[H376]] his thoughts: [[H4284]] and let him return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he will have mercy [[H7355]] upon him; and to [[H413]] our God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] he will abundantly [[H7235]] pardon. [[H5545]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] my thoughts [[H4284]] not [[H3808]] your thoughts, [[H4284]] neither [[H3808]] your ways [[H1870]] my ways, [[H1870]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] the heavens [[H8064]] are higher [[H1361]] than the earth, [[H776]] so [[H3651]] are my ways [[H1870]] higher [[H1361]] than your ways, [[H1870]] and my thoughts [[H4284]] than your thoughts. [[H4284]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] as [[H834]] the rain [[H1653]] cometh down, [[H3381]] and the snow [[H7950]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] and returneth [[H7725]] not [[H3808]] thither, [[H8033]] but [[H3588]] watereth [[H7301]] the earth, [[H776]] and maketh it bring forth [[H3205]] and bud, [[H6779]] that it may give [[H5414]] seed [[H2233]] to the sower, [[H2232]] and bread [[H3899]] to the eater: [[H398]]

### 11
So [[H3651]] shall my word [[H1697]] be [[H1961]] that [[H834]] goeth forth [[H3318]] out of my mouth: [[H6310]] it shall not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] me void, [[H7387]] but [[H3588]] it shall accomplish [[H6213]] that which [[H834]] I please, [[H2654]] and it shall prosper [[H6743]] whereto [[H834]] I sent [[H7971]] it. [[H7971]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] ye shall go out [[H3318]] with joy, [[H8057]] and be led forth [[H2986]] with peace: [[H7965]] the mountains [[H2022]] and the hills [[H1389]] shall break forth [[H6476]] before [[H6440]] you into singing, [[H7440]] and all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] shall clap [[H4222]] hands. [[H3709]]

### 13
Instead [[H8478]] of the thorn [[H5285]] shall come up [[H5927]] the fir tree, [[H1265]] and instead [[H8478]] of the brier [[H5636]] shall come up [[H5927]] the myrtle tree: [[H1918]] and it shall be [[H1961]] to the Lord [[H3068]] for a name, [[H8034]] for an everlasting [[H5769]] sign [[H226]] shall not [[H3808]] be cut off.
