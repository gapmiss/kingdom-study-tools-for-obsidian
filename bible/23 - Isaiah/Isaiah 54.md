### 1
Sing, [[H7442]] O barren, [[H6135]] thou didst not [[H3808]] bear; [[H3205]] break forth [[H6476]] into singing, [[H7440]] and cry aloud, [[H6670]] thou didst not [[H3808]] travail with child: [[H2342]] for [[H3588]] more [[H7227]] the children [[H1121]] of the desolate [[H8074]] than the children [[H1121]] of the married wife, [[H1166]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
Enlarge [[H7337]] the place [[H4725]] of thy tent, [[H168]] and let them stretch forth [[H5186]] the curtains [[H3407]] of thine habitations: [[H4908]] spare [[H2820]] not, [[H408]] lengthen [[H748]] thy cords, [[H4340]] and strengthen [[H2388]] thy stakes; [[H3489]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thou shalt break forth [[H6555]] on the right hand [[H3225]] and on the left; [[H8040]] and thy seed [[H2233]] shall inherit [[H3423]] the Gentiles, [[H1471]] and make the desolate [[H8074]] cities [[H5892]] to be inhabited. [[H3427]]

### 4
Fear [[H3372]] not; [[H408]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] be ashamed: [[H954]] neither [[H408]] be thou confounded; [[H3637]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] be put to shame: [[H2659]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt forget [[H7911]] the shame [[H1322]] of thy youth, [[H5934]] and shalt not [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] the reproach [[H2781]] of thy widowhood [[H491]] any more. [[H491]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] thy Maker [[H6213]] thine husband; [[H1166]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] his name; [[H8034]] and thy Redeemer [[H1350]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel; [[H3478]] The God [[H430]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] shall he be called. [[H7121]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath called [[H7121]] thee as a woman [[H802]] forsaken [[H5800]] and grieved [[H6087]] in spirit, [[H7307]] and a wife [[H802]] of youth, [[H5271]] when [[H3588]] thou wast refused, [[H3988]] saith [[H559]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 7
For a small [[H6996]] moment [[H7281]] have I forsaken [[H5800]] thee; but with great [[H1419]] mercies [[H7356]] will I gather [[H6908]] thee. [[H6908]]

### 8
In a little [[H8241]] wrath [[H7110]] I hid [[H5641]] my face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] thee for a moment; [[H7281]] but with everlasting [[H5769]] kindness [[H2617]] will I have mercy [[H7355]] on thee, saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy Redeemer. [[H1350]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] the waters [[H4325]] of Noah [[H5146]] unto me: for [[H834]] I have sworn [[H7650]] that the waters [[H4325]] of Noah [[H5146]] should no more [[H5750]] go [[H5674]] over [[H5921]] the earth; [[H776]] so [[H3651]] have I sworn [[H7650]] that I would not be wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] thee, nor rebuke thee. [[H1605]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the mountains [[H2022]] shall depart, [[H4185]] and the hills [[H1389]] be removed; [[H4131]] but my kindness [[H2617]] shall not [[H3808]] depart [[H4185]] from [[H853]] thee, neither [[H3808]] shall the covenant [[H1285]] of my peace [[H7965]] be removed, [[H4131]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] that hath mercy [[H7355]] on thee. [[H7355]]

### 11
O thou afflicted, [[H6041]] tossed with tempest, [[H5590]] not [[H3808]] comforted, [[H5162]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will lay [[H7257]] thy stones [[H68]] with fair colours, [[H6320]] and lay thy foundations [[H3245]] with sapphires. [[H5601]]

### 12
And I will make [[H7760]] thy windows [[H8121]] of agates, [[H3539]] and thy gates [[H8179]] of carbuncles, [[H68]] and all [[H3605]] thy borders [[H1366]] of pleasant [[H2656]] stones. [[H68]]

### 13
And all [[H3605]] thy children [[H1121]] taught [[H3928]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and great [[H7227]] the peace [[H7965]] of thy children. [[H1121]]

### 14
In righteousness [[H6666]] shalt thou be established: [[H3559]] thou shalt be far [[H7368]] from oppression; [[H6233]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] fear: [[H3372]] and from terror; [[H4288]] for [[H3588]] it shall not [[H3808]] come near [[H7126]] thee. [[H413]]

### 15
Behold, [[H2005]] they shall surely [[H1481]] gather together, [[H1481]] not [[H657]] by me: [[H854]] whosoever [[H4310]] shall gather together [[H1481]] against thee [[H854]] shall fall [[H5307]] for thy sake. [[H5921]]

### 16
Behold, [[H2005]] I [[H595]] have created [[H1254]] the smith [[H2796]] that bloweth [[H5301]] the coals [[H6352]] in the fire, [[H784]] and that bringeth forth [[H3318]] an instrument [[H3627]] for his work; [[H4639]] and I [[H595]] have created [[H1254]] the waster [[H7843]] to destroy. [[H2254]]

### 17
No [[H3808]] weapon [[H3627]] that is formed [[H3335]] against [[H5921]] thee shall prosper; [[H6743]] and every [[H3605]] tongue [[H3956]] shall rise [[H6965]] against [[H854]] thee in judgment [[H4941]] thou shalt condemn. [[H7561]] This [[H2063]] the heritage [[H5159]] of the servants [[H5650]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and their righteousness [[H6666]] of me, saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
