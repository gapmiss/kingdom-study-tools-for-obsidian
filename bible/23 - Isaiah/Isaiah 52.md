### 1
Awake, [[H5782]] awake; [[H5782]] put on [[H3847]] thy strength, [[H5797]] O Zion; [[H6726]] put on [[H3847]] thy beautiful [[H8597]] garments, [[H899]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the holy [[H6944]] city: [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] henceforth [[H3254]] there shall no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] come [[H935]] into thee the uncircumcised [[H6189]] and the unclean. [[H2931]]

### 2
Shake thyself [[H5287]] from the dust; [[H6083]] arise, [[H6965]] sit down, [[H3427]] O Jerusalem: [[H3389]] loose thyself [[H6605]] from the bands [[H4147]] of thy neck, [[H6677]] O captive [[H7628]] daughter [[H1323]] of Zion. [[H6726]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Ye have sold yourselves [[H4376]] for nought; [[H2600]] and ye shall be redeemed [[H1350]] without [[H3808]] money. [[H3701]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] My people [[H5971]] went down [[H3381]] aforetime [[H7223]] into Egypt [[H4714]] to sojourn [[H1481]] there; [[H8033]] and the Assyrian [[H804]] oppressed [[H6231]] them without cause. [[H657]]

### 5
Now [[H6258]] therefore, what [[H4100]] have I here, [[H6311]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] my people [[H5971]] is taken away [[H3947]] for nought? [[H2600]] they that rule over [[H4910]] them make them to howl, [[H3213]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and my name [[H8034]] continually [[H8548]] every [[H3605]] day [[H3117]] blasphemed. [[H5006]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] my people [[H5971]] shall know [[H3045]] my name: [[H8034]] therefore [[H3651]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] he [[H1931]] that doth speak: [[H1696]] behold, [[H2005]] I. [[H2005]]

### 7
How [[H4100]] beautiful [[H4998]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] are the feet [[H7272]] of him that bringeth good tidings, [[H1319]] that publisheth [[H8085]] peace; [[H7965]] that bringeth good tidings [[H1319]] of good, [[H2896]] that publisheth [[H8085]] salvation; [[H3444]] that saith [[H559]] unto Zion, [[H6726]] Thy God [[H430]] reigneth! [[H4427]]

### 8
Thy watchmen [[H6822]] shall lift up [[H5375]] the voice; [[H6963]] with the voice [[H6963]] together [[H3162]] shall they sing: [[H7442]] for [[H3588]] they shall see [[H7200]] eye [[H5869]] to eye, [[H5869]] when the Lord [[H3068]] shall bring again [[H7725]] Zion. [[H6726]]

### 9
Break forth into joy, [[H6476]] sing [[H7442]] together, [[H3162]] ye waste places [[H2723]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath comforted [[H5162]] his people, [[H5971]] he hath redeemed [[H1350]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
The Lord [[H3068]] hath made bare [[H2834]] his holy [[H6944]] arm [[H2220]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the nations; [[H1471]] and all [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] shall see [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3444]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 11
Depart [[H5493]] ye, depart [[H5493]] ye, go ye out [[H3318]] from thence, [[H8033]] touch [[H5060]] no [[H408]] unclean [[H2931]] go ye out [[H3318]] of the midst [[H8432]] of her; be ye clean, [[H1305]] that bear [[H5375]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] ye shall not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] with haste, [[H2649]] nor [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] by flight: [[H4499]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] you; and the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] your rereward. [[H622]]

### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] my servant [[H5650]] shall deal prudently, [[H7919]] he shall be exalted [[H7311]] and extolled, [[H5375]] and be very [[H3966]] high. [[H1361]]

### 14
As [[H834]] many [[H7227]] were astonied [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] thee; his visage [[H4758]] was so [[H3651]] marred [[H4893]] more than any man, [[H376]] and his form [[H8389]] more than the sons [[H1121]] of men: [[H120]]

### 15
So [[H3651]] shall he sprinkle [[H5137]] many [[H7227]] nations; [[H1471]] the kings [[H4428]] shall shut [[H7092]] their mouths [[H6310]] at [[H5921]] him: for [[H3588]] which [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] been told [[H5608]] them shall they see; [[H7200]] and which [[H834]] they had not [[H3808]] heard [[H8085]] shall they consider.
