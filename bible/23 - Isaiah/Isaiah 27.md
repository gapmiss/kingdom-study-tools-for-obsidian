### 1
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] with his sore [[H7186]] and great [[H1419]] and strong [[H2389]] sword [[H2719]] shall punish [[H6485]] leviathan [[H3882]] the piercing [[H1281]] serpent, [[H5175]] even leviathan [[H3882]] that crooked [[H6129]] serpent; [[H5175]] and he shall slay [[H2026]] the dragon [[H8577]] that [[H834]] in the sea. [[H3220]]

### 2
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] sing [[H6031]] ye unto her, A vineyard [[H3754]] of red wine. [[H2531]]

### 3
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] do keep [[H5341]] it; I will water [[H8248]] it every moment: [[H7281]] lest [[H6435]] hurt [[H6485]] it, I will keep [[H5341]] it night [[H3915]] and day. [[H3117]]

### 4
Fury [[H2534]] not [[H369]] in me: who [[H4310]] would set [[H5414]] the briers [[H8068]] thorns [[H7898]] against me in battle? [[H4421]] I would go [[H6585]] through them, I would burn [[H6702]] them together. [[H3162]]

### 5
Or [[H176]] let him take hold [[H2388]] of my strength, [[H4581]] he may make [[H6213]] peace [[H7965]] with me; he shall make [[H6213]] peace [[H7965]] with me. [[H7965]]

### 6
He shall cause them that come [[H935]] of Jacob [[H3290]] to take root: [[H8327]] Israel [[H3478]] shall blossom [[H6692]] and bud, [[H6524]] and fill [[H4390]] the face [[H6440]] of the world [[H8398]] with fruit. [[H8570]]

### 7
Hath he smitten [[H5221]] him, as he smote [[H4347]] those that smote [[H5221]] him? is he slain [[H2026]] according to the slaughter [[H2027]] of them that are slain [[H2026]] by him? [[H2026]]

### 8
In measure, [[H5432]] when it shooteth forth, [[H7971]] thou wilt debate [[H7378]] with it: he stayeth [[H1898]] his rough [[H7186]] wind [[H7307]] in the day [[H3117]] of the east wind. [[H6921]]

### 9
By this [[H2063]] therefore [[H3651]] shall the iniquity [[H5771]] of Jacob [[H3290]] be purged; [[H3722]] and this [[H2088]] all [[H3605]] the fruit [[H6529]] to take away [[H5493]] his sin; [[H2403]] when he maketh [[H7760]] all [[H3605]] the stones [[H68]] of the altar [[H4196]] as chalkstones [[H1615]] that are beaten in sunder, [[H5310]] the groves [[H842]] and images [[H2553]] shall not [[H3808]] stand up. [[H6965]]

### 10
Yet [[H3588]] the defenced [[H1219]] city [[H5892]] desolate, [[H910]] the habitation [[H5116]] forsaken, [[H7971]] and left [[H5800]] like a wilderness: [[H4057]] there [[H8033]] shall the calf [[H5695]] feed, [[H7462]] and there [[H8033]] shall he lie down, [[H7257]] and consume [[H3615]] the branches [[H5585]] thereof. [[H5585]]

### 11
When the boughs [[H7105]] thereof are withered, [[H3001]] they shall be broken off: [[H7665]] the women [[H802]] come, [[H935]] set them on fire: [[H215]] for [[H3588]] it a people [[H5971]] of no [[H3808]] understanding: [[H998]] therefore [[H5921]] he [[H1931]] that made [[H6213]] them will not [[H3808]] have mercy [[H7355]] on them, and he that formed [[H3335]] them will shew them no favour. [[H2603]]

### 12
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall beat off [[H2251]] from the channel [[H7641]] of the river [[H5104]] unto [[H5704]] the stream [[H5158]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and ye [[H859]] shall be gathered [[H3950]] one [[H259]] by one, [[H259]] O ye children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 13
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the great [[H1419]] trumpet [[H7782]] shall be blown, [[H8628]] and they shall come [[H935]] which were ready to perish [[H6]] in the land [[H776]] of Assyria, [[H804]] and the outcasts [[H5080]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and shall worship [[H7812]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the holy [[H6944]] mount [[H2022]] at Jerusalem.
