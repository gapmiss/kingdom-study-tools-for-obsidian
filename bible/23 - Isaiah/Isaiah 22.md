### 1
The burden [[H4853]] of the valley [[H1516]] of vision. [[H2384]] What [[H4100]] aileth thee now, [[H645]] that [[H3588]] thou art wholly [[H3605]] gone up [[H5927]] to the housetops? [[H1406]]

### 2
Thou that art full [[H4393]] of stirs, [[H8663]] a tumultuous [[H1993]] city, [[H5892]] a joyous [[H5947]] city: [[H7151]] thy slain [[H2491]] not [[H3808]] slain [[H2491]] with the sword, [[H2719]] nor [[H3808]] dead [[H4191]] in battle. [[H4421]]

### 3
All [[H3605]] thy rulers [[H7101]] are fled [[H5074]] together, [[H3162]] they are bound [[H631]] by the archers: [[H7198]] all [[H3605]] that are found [[H4672]] in thee are bound [[H631]] together, [[H3162]] have fled [[H1272]] from far. [[H7350]]

### 4
Therefore [[H5921]] said [[H559]] I, Look away [[H8159]] from [[H4480]] me; I will weep [[H1065]] bitterly, [[H4843]] labour [[H213]] not [[H408]] to comfort [[H5162]] me, because [[H5921]] of the spoiling [[H7701]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people. [[H5971]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] a day [[H3117]] of trouble, [[H4103]] and of treading down, [[H4001]] and of perplexity [[H3998]] by the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts [[H6635]] in the valley [[H1516]] of vision, [[H2384]] breaking down [[H6979]] the walls, [[H7023]] and of crying [[H7771]] to [[H413]] the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 6
And Elam [[H5867]] bare [[H5375]] the quiver [[H827]] with chariots [[H7393]] of men [[H120]] horsemen, [[H6571]] and Kir [[H7024]] uncovered [[H6168]] the shield. [[H4043]]

### 7
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] thy choicest [[H4005]] valleys [[H6010]] shall be full [[H4390]] of chariots, [[H7393]] and the horsemen [[H6571]] shall set [[H7896]] themselves in array [[H7896]] at the gate. [[H8179]]

### 8
And he discovered [[H1540]] the covering [[H4539]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and thou didst look [[H5027]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] to [[H413]] the armour [[H5402]] of the house [[H1004]] of the forest. [[H3293]]

### 9
Ye have seen [[H7200]] also the breaches [[H1233]] of the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] that [[H3588]] they are many: [[H7231]] and ye gathered together [[H6908]] the waters [[H4325]] of the lower [[H8481]] pool. [[H1295]]

### 10
And ye have numbered [[H5608]] the houses [[H1004]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the houses [[H1004]] have ye broken down [[H5422]] to fortify [[H1219]] the wall. [[H2346]]

### 11
Ye made [[H6213]] also a ditch [[H4724]] between [[H996]] the two walls [[H2346]] for the water [[H4325]] of the old [[H3465]] pool: [[H1295]] but ye have not [[H3808]] looked [[H5027]] unto [[H413]] the maker [[H6213]] thereof, neither [[H3808]] had respect [[H7200]] unto him that fashioned [[H3335]] it long ago. [[H7350]]

### 12
And in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] did the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts [[H6635]] call [[H7121]] to weeping, [[H1065]] and to mourning, [[H4553]] and to baldness, [[H7144]] and to girding [[H2296]] with sackcloth: [[H8242]]

### 13
And behold [[H2009]] joy [[H8342]] and gladness, [[H8057]] slaying [[H2026]] oxen, [[H1241]] and killing [[H7819]] sheep, [[H6629]] eating [[H398]] flesh, [[H1320]] and drinking [[H8354]] wine: [[H3196]] let us eat [[H398]] and drink; [[H8354]] for [[H3588]] to morrow [[H4279]] we shall die. [[H4191]]

### 14
And it was revealed [[H1540]] in mine ears [[H241]] by the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Surely [[H518]] this [[H2088]] iniquity [[H5771]] shall not be purged [[H3722]] from you till [[H5704]] ye die, [[H4191]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 15
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts, [[H6635]] Go, [[H1980]] get [[H935]] thee unto [[H413]] this [[H2088]] treasurer, [[H5532]] unto [[H5921]] Shebna, [[H7644]] which [[H834]] over [[H5921]] the house, [[H1004]]

### 16
What [[H4100]] hast thou here? [[H6311]] and whom [[H4310]] hast thou here, [[H6311]] that [[H3588]] thou hast hewed thee out [[H2672]] a sepulchre [[H6913]] here, [[H6311]] he that heweth him out [[H2672]] a sepulchre [[H6913]] on high, [[H4791]] that graveth [[H2710]] an habitation [[H4908]] for himself in a rock? [[H5553]]

### 17
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] will carry thee away [[H2904]] with a mighty [[H1397]] captivity, [[H2925]] and will surely [[H5844]] cover [[H5844]] thee. [[H5844]]

### 18
He will surely [[H6801]] violently turn [[H6801]] and toss [[H6802]] thee a ball [[H1754]] into [[H413]] a large [[H7342]] country: [[H776]] there [[H8033]] shalt thou die, [[H4191]] and there [[H8033]] the chariots [[H4818]] of thy glory [[H3519]] the shame [[H7036]] of thy lord's [[H113]] house. [[H1004]]

### 19
And I will drive [[H1920]] thee from thy station, [[H4673]] and from thy state [[H4612]] shall he pull thee down. [[H2040]]

### 20
And it shall come to pass [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] that I will call [[H7121]] my servant [[H5650]] Eliakim [[H471]] the son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah: [[H2518]]

### 21
And I will clothe [[H3847]] him with thy robe, [[H3801]] and strengthen [[H2388]] him with thy girdle, [[H73]] and I will commit [[H5414]] thy government [[H4475]] into his hand: [[H3027]] and he shall be [[H1961]] a father [[H1]] to the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and to the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 22
And the key [[H4668]] of the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] will I lay [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] his shoulder; [[H7926]] so he shall open, [[H6605]] and none [[H369]] shall shut; [[H5462]] and he shall shut, [[H5462]] and none [[H369]] shall open. [[H6605]]

### 23
And I will fasten [[H8628]] him a nail [[H3489]] in a sure [[H539]] place; [[H4725]] and he shall be [[H1961]] for a glorious [[H3519]] throne [[H3678]] to his father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 24
And they shall hang [[H8518]] upon [[H5921]] him all [[H3605]] the glory [[H3519]] of his father's [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] the offspring [[H6631]] and the issue, [[H6849]] all [[H3605]] vessels [[H3627]] of small quantity, [[H6996]] from the vessels [[H3627]] of cups, [[H101]] even to [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the vessels [[H3627]] of flagons. [[H5035]]

### 25
In that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] shall the nail [[H3489]] that is fastened [[H8628]] in the sure [[H539]] place [[H4725]] be removed, [[H4185]] and be cut down, [[H1438]] and fall; [[H5307]] and the burden [[H4853]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] it shall be cut off: [[H3772]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]]
