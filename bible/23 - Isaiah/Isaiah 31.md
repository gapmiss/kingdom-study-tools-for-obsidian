### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to them that go down [[H3381]] to Egypt [[H4714]] for help; [[H5833]] and stay [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] horses, [[H5483]] and trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] chariots, [[H7393]] because [[H3588]] many; [[H7227]] and in [[H5921]] horsemen, [[H6571]] because [[H3588]] they are very [[H3966]] strong; [[H6105]] but they look [[H8159]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H5921]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel, [[H3478]] neither [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] the Lord! [[H3068]]

### 2
Yet he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] wise, [[H2450]] and will bring [[H935]] evil, [[H7451]] and will not [[H3808]] call back [[H5493]] his words: [[H1697]] but will arise [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the evildoers, [[H7489]] and against [[H5921]] the help [[H5833]] of them that work [[H6466]] iniquity. [[H205]]

### 3
Now the Egyptians [[H4714]] men, [[H120]] and not [[H3808]] God; [[H410]] and their horses [[H5483]] flesh, [[H1320]] and not [[H3808]] spirit. [[H7307]] When the Lord [[H3068]] shall stretch out [[H5186]] his hand, [[H3027]] both he that helpeth [[H5826]] shall fall, [[H3782]] and he that is holpen [[H5826]] shall fall down, [[H5307]] and they all [[H3605]] shall fail [[H3615]] together. [[H3162]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] spoken [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Like as [[H834]] the lion [[H738]] and the young lion [[H3715]] roaring [[H1897]] on [[H5921]] his prey, [[H2964]] when [[H834]] a multitude [[H4393]] of shepherds [[H7462]] is called forth [[H7121]] against [[H5921]] him, will not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H2865]] of their voice, [[H6963]] nor [[H3808]] abase [[H6031]] himself for the noise [[H1995]] of them: so [[H3651]] shall the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] come down [[H3381]] to fight [[H6633]] for [[H5921]] mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] and for [[H5921]] the hill [[H1389]] thereof. [[H1389]]

### 5
As birds [[H6833]] flying, [[H5774]] so [[H3651]] will the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] defend [[H1598]] Jerusalem; [[H3389]] defending [[H1598]] also he will deliver [[H5337]] passing over [[H6452]] he will preserve [[H4422]]

### 6
Turn [[H7725]] ye unto whom [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] have deeply [[H6009]] revolted. [[H5627]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] every man [[H376]] shall cast away [[H3988]] his idols [[H457]] of silver, [[H3701]] and his idols [[H457]] of gold, [[H2091]] which [[H834]] your own hands [[H3027]] have made [[H6213]] unto you a sin. [[H2399]]

### 8
Then shall the Assyrian [[H804]] fall [[H5307]] with the sword, [[H2719]] not [[H3808]] of a mighty man; [[H376]] and the sword, [[H2719]] not [[H3808]] of a mean man, [[H120]] shall devour [[H398]] him: but he shall flee [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] the sword, [[H2719]] and his young men [[H970]] shall be [[H1961]] discomfited. [[H4522]]

### 9
And he shall pass over [[H5674]] to his strong hold [[H5553]] for fear, [[H4032]] and his princes [[H8269]] shall be afraid [[H2865]] of the ensign, [[H5251]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] whose [[H834]] fire [[H217]] in Zion, [[H6726]] and his furnace [[H8574]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
