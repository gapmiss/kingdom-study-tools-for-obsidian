[[Isaiah 32|←]] • [[Isaiah 34|→]]

---

### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to thee that spoilest, [[H7703]] and thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] spoiled; [[H7703]] and dealest treacherously, [[H898]] and they dealt not treacherously [[H898]] with thee! when thou shalt cease [[H8552]] to spoil, [[H7703]] thou shalt be spoiled; [[H7703]] when thou shalt make an end [[H5239]] to deal treacherously, [[H898]] they shall deal treacherously [[H898]] with thee. [[H898]]

### 2
O Lord, [[H3068]] be gracious [[H2603]] unto us; we have waited [[H6960]] for thee: be [[H1961]] thou their arm [[H2220]] every morning, [[H1242]] our salvation [[H3444]] also [[H637]] in the time [[H6256]] of trouble. [[H6869]]

### 3
At the noise [[H6963]] of the tumult [[H1995]] the people [[H5971]] fled; [[H5074]] at the lifting up [[H7427]] of thyself the nations [[H1471]] were scattered. [[H5310]]

### 4
And your spoil [[H7998]] shall be gathered [[H622]] the gathering [[H625]] of the caterpiller: [[H2625]] as the running to and fro [[H4944]] of locusts [[H1357]] shall he run [[H8264]] upon them. [[H8264]]

### 5
The Lord [[H3068]] is exalted; [[H7682]] for [[H3588]] he dwelleth [[H7931]] on high: [[H4791]] he hath filled [[H4390]] Zion [[H6726]] with judgment [[H4941]] and righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 6
And wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge [[H1847]] shall be [[H1961]] the stability [[H530]] of thy times, [[H6256]] strength [[H2633]] of salvation: [[H3444]] the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] his treasure. [[H214]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2005]] their valiant ones [[H691]] shall cry [[H6817]] without: [[H2351]] the ambassadors [[H4397]] of peace [[H7965]] shall weep [[H1058]] bitterly. [[H4751]]

### 8
The highways [[H4546]] lie waste, [[H8074]] the wayfaring man [[H5674]] ceaseth: [[H7673]] he hath broken [[H6565]] the covenant, [[H1285]] he hath despised [[H3988]] the cities, [[H5892]] he regardeth [[H2803]] no [[H3808]] man. [[H376]]

### 9
The earth [[H776]] mourneth [[H56]] languisheth: [[H535]] Lebanon [[H3844]] is ashamed [[H2659]] hewn down: [[H7060]] Sharon [[H8289]] is [[H1961]] like a wilderness; [[H6160]] and Bashan [[H1316]] and Carmel [[H3760]] shake off [[H5287]]

### 10
Now [[H6258]] will I rise, [[H6965]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] now [[H6258]] will I be exalted; [[H7311]] now [[H6258]] will I lift up [[H5375]] myself. [[H5375]]

### 11
Ye shall conceive [[H2029]] chaff, [[H2842]] ye shall bring forth [[H3205]] stubble: [[H7179]] your breath, [[H7307]] fire, [[H784]] shall devour [[H398]] you. [[H398]]

### 12
And the people [[H5971]] shall be [[H1961]] the burnings [[H4955]] of lime: [[H7875]] thorns [[H6975]] cut up [[H3683]] shall they be burned [[H3341]] in the fire. [[H784]]

### 13
Hear, [[H8085]] ye far off, [[H7350]] what [[H834]] I have done; [[H6213]] and, ye near, [[H7138]] acknowledge [[H3045]] my might. [[H1369]]

### 14
The sinners [[H2400]] in Zion [[H6726]] are afraid; [[H6342]] fearfulness [[H7461]] hath surprised [[H270]] the hypocrites. [[H2611]] Who [[H4310]] among us shall dwell [[H1481]] with the devouring [[H398]] fire? [[H784]] who [[H4310]] among us shall dwell [[H1481]] with everlasting [[H5769]] burnings? [[H4168]]

### 15
He that walketh [[H1980]] righteously, [[H6666]] and speaketh [[H1696]] uprightly; [[H4339]] he that despiseth [[H3988]] the gain [[H1215]] of oppressions, [[H4642]] that shaketh [[H5287]] his hands [[H3709]] from holding [[H8551]] of bribes, [[H7810]] that stoppeth [[H331]] his ears [[H241]] from hearing [[H8085]] of blood, [[H1818]] and shutteth [[H6105]] his eyes [[H5869]] from seeing [[H7200]] evil; [[H7451]]

### 16
He [[H1931]] shall dwell [[H7931]] on high: [[H4791]] his place of defence [[H4869]] the munitions [[H4679]] of rocks: [[H5553]] bread [[H3899]] shall be given [[H5414]] him; his waters [[H4325]] sure. [[H539]]

### 17
Thine eyes [[H5869]] shall see [[H2372]] the king [[H4428]] in his beauty: [[H3308]] they shall behold [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] that is very far off. [[H4801]]

### 18
Thine heart [[H3820]] shall meditate [[H1897]] terror. [[H367]] Where [[H346]] the scribe? [[H5608]] where [[H346]] the receiver? [[H8254]] where [[H346]] he that counted [[H5608]] the towers? [[H4026]]

### 19
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] a fierce [[H3267]] people, [[H5971]] a people [[H5971]] of a deeper [[H6012]] speech [[H8193]] than thou canst perceive; [[H8085]] of a stammering [[H3932]] tongue, [[H3956]] not [[H369]] understand. [[H998]]

### 20
Look [[H2372]] upon Zion, [[H6726]] the city [[H7151]] of our solemnities: [[H4150]] thine eyes [[H5869]] shall see [[H7200]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a quiet [[H7600]] habitation, [[H5116]] a tabernacle [[H168]] shall not [[H1077]] be taken down; [[H6813]] not [[H1077]] one of the stakes [[H3489]] thereof shall ever [[H5331]] be removed, [[H5265]] neither [[H1077]] shall any [[H3605]] of the cords [[H2256]] thereof be broken. [[H5423]]

### 21
But [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the glorious [[H117]] Lord [[H3068]] unto us a place [[H4725]] of broad [[H7342]] rivers [[H5104]] streams; [[H2975]] wherein shall go [[H1980]] no [[H1077]] galley [[H590]] with oars, [[H7885]] neither [[H3808]] shall gallant [[H117]] ship [[H6716]] pass [[H5674]] thereby. [[H5674]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] our judge, [[H8199]] the Lord [[H3068]] our lawgiver, [[H2710]] the Lord [[H3068]] our king; [[H4428]] he [[H1931]] will save [[H3467]] us. [[H3467]]

### 23
Thy tacklings [[H2256]] are loosed; [[H5203]] they could not [[H1077]] well [[H3653]] strengthen [[H2388]] their mast, [[H8650]] they could not [[H1077]] spread [[H6566]] the sail: [[H5251]] then [[H227]] is the prey [[H5706]] of a great [[H4766]] spoil [[H7998]] divided; [[H2505]] the lame [[H6455]] take [[H962]] the prey. [[H957]]

### 24
And the inhabitant [[H7934]] shall not [[H1077]] say, [[H559]] I am sick: [[H2470]] the people [[H5971]] that dwell [[H3427]] therein forgiven [[H5375]] iniquity. [[H5771]]
