# Isaiah 59

[[Isaiah 58|←]] • [[Isaiah 60|→]]

---

### 1
Behold, [[H2005]] the Lord's [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] is not [[H3808]] shortened, [[H7114]] that it cannot save; [[H3467]] neither [[H3808]] his ear [[H241]] heavy, [[H3513]] that it cannot hear: [[H8085]]

### 2
But [[H3588]] your iniquities [[H5771]] have [[H1961]] separated [[H914]] between [[H996]] you and your God, [[H430]] and your sins [[H2403]] have hid [[H5641]] face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] you, that he will not hear. [[H8085]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] your hands [[H3709]] are defiled [[H1351]] with blood, [[H1818]] and your fingers [[H676]] with iniquity; [[H5771]] your lips [[H8193]] have spoken [[H1696]] lies, [[H8267]] your tongue [[H3956]] hath muttered [[H1897]] perverseness. [[H5766]]

### 4
None [[H369]] calleth [[H7121]] for justice, [[H6664]] nor [[H369]] pleadeth [[H8199]] for truth: [[H530]] they trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] vanity, [[H8414]] and speak [[H1696]] lies; [[H7723]] they conceive [[H2029]] mischief, [[H5999]] and bring forth [[H3205]] iniquity. [[H205]]

### 5
They hatch [[H1234]] cockatrice' [[H6848]] eggs, [[H1000]] and weave [[H707]] the spider's [[H5908]] web: [[H6980]] he that eateth [[H398]] of their eggs [[H1000]] dieth, [[H4191]] and that which is crushed [[H2116]] breaketh out [[H1234]] into a viper. [[H660]]

### 6
Their webs [[H6980]] shall not [[H3808]] become [[H1961]] garments, [[H899]] neither [[H3808]] shall they cover themselves [[H3680]] with their works: [[H4639]] their works [[H4639]] works [[H4639]] of iniquity, [[H205]] and the act [[H6467]] of violence [[H2555]] in their hands. [[H3709]]

### 7
Their feet [[H7272]] run [[H7323]] to evil, [[H7451]] and they make haste [[H4116]] to shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood: [[H1818]] their thoughts [[H4284]] thoughts [[H4284]] of iniquity; [[H205]] wasting [[H7701]] and destruction [[H7667]] in their paths. [[H4546]]

### 8
The way [[H1870]] of peace [[H7965]] they know [[H3045]] not; [[H3808]] and no [[H369]] judgment [[H4941]] in their goings: [[H4570]] they have made them crooked [[H6140]] paths: [[H5410]] whosoever [[H3605]] goeth [[H1869]] therein shall not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 9
Therefore [[H5921]] is judgment [[H4941]] far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] us, neither [[H3808]] doth justice [[H6666]] overtake [[H5381]] us: we wait [[H6960]] for light, [[H216]] but behold [[H2009]] obscurity; [[H2822]] for brightness, [[H5054]] we walk [[H1980]] in darkness. [[H653]]

### 10
We grope [[H1659]] for the wall [[H7023]] like the blind, [[H5787]] and we grope [[H1659]] as if no [[H369]] eyes: [[H5869]] we stumble [[H3782]] at noonday [[H6672]] as in the night; [[H5399]] in desolate places [[H820]] as dead [[H4191]]

### 11
We roar [[H1993]] all [[H3605]] like bears, [[H1677]] and mourn [[H1897]] sore [[H1897]] like doves: [[H3123]] we look [[H6960]] for judgment, [[H4941]] but none; [[H369]] for salvation, [[H3444]] it is far off [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] us. [[H4480]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] our transgressions [[H6588]] are multiplied [[H7231]] before [[H5048]] thee, and our sins [[H2403]] testify [[H6030]] against us: for [[H3588]] our transgressions [[H6588]] with [[H854]] us; and our iniquities, [[H5771]] we know them; [[H3045]]

### 13
In transgressing [[H6586]] and lying [[H3584]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] and departing away [[H5253]] from [[H310]] our God, [[H430]] speaking [[H1696]] oppression [[H6233]] and revolt, [[H5627]] conceiving [[H2029]] and uttering [[H1897]] from the heart [[H3820]] words [[H1697]] of falsehood. [[H8267]]

### 14
And judgment [[H4941]] is turned away [[H5253]] backward, [[H268]] and justice [[H6666]] standeth [[H5975]] afar off: [[H7350]] for [[H3588]] truth [[H571]] is fallen [[H3782]] in the street, [[H7339]] and equity [[H5229]] cannot [[H3201]] enter. [[H935]]

### 15
Yea, truth [[H571]] faileth; [[H5737]] and he departeth [[H5493]] from evil [[H7451]] maketh himself a prey: [[H7997]] and the Lord [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] and it displeased [[H7489]] him that [[H3588]] no [[H369]] judgment. [[H4941]]

### 16
And he saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] no [[H369]] man, [[H376]] and wondered [[H8074]] that [[H3588]] no [[H369]] intercessor: [[H6293]] therefore his arm [[H2220]] brought salvation [[H3467]] unto him; and his righteousness, [[H6666]] it [[H1931]] sustained [[H5564]] him. [[H5564]]

### 17
For he put on [[H3847]] righteousness [[H6666]] as a breastplate, [[H8302]] and an helmet [[H3553]] of salvation [[H3444]] upon his head; [[H7218]] and he put on [[H3847]] the garments [[H899]] of vengeance [[H5359]] clothing, [[H8516]] and was clad [[H5844]] with zeal [[H7068]] as a cloke. [[H4598]]

### 18
According to [[H5921]] deeds, [[H1578]] accordingly [[H5921]] he will repay, [[H7999]] fury [[H2534]] to his adversaries, [[H6862]] recompence [[H1576]] to his enemies; [[H341]] to the islands [[H339]] he will repay [[H7999]] recompence. [[H1576]]

### 19
So shall they fear [[H3372]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] from the west, [[H4628]]  and [[H853]] his glory [[H3519]] from the rising [[H4217]] of the sun. [[H8121]] When [[H3588]] the enemy [[H6862]] shall come in [[H935]] like a flood, [[H5104]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall lift up a standard [[H5127]] against him. [[H5127]]

### 20
And the Redeemer [[H1350]] shall come [[H935]] to Zion, [[H6726]] and unto them that turn from [[H7725]] transgression [[H6588]] in Jacob, [[H3290]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 21
As for me, [[H589]] this [[H2063]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] them, saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] My spirit [[H7307]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and my words [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I have put [[H7760]] in thy mouth, [[H6310]] shall not [[H3808]] depart [[H4185]] out of thy mouth, [[H6310]] nor out of the mouth [[H6310]] of thy seed, [[H2233]] nor out of the mouth [[H6310]] of thy seed's [[H2233]] seed, [[H2233]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] from henceforth [[H6258]] and for [[H5704]] ever.
