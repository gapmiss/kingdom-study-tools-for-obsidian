### 1
The burden [[H4853]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] rideth [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] a swift [[H7031]] cloud, [[H5645]] and shall come [[H935]] into Egypt: [[H4714]] and the idols [[H457]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall be moved [[H5128]] at his presence, [[H6440]] and the heart [[H3824]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall melt [[H4549]] in the midst [[H7130]] of it. [[H7130]]

### 2
And I will set [[H5526]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] against the Egyptians: [[H4714]] and they shall fight [[H3898]] every one [[H376]] against his brother, [[H251]] and every one [[H376]] against his neighbour; [[H7453]] city [[H5892]] against city, [[H5892]] kingdom [[H4467]] against kingdom. [[H4467]]

### 3
And the spirit [[H7307]] of Egypt [[H4714]] shall fail [[H1238]] in the midst [[H7130]] thereof; and I will destroy [[H1104]] the counsel [[H6098]] thereof: and they shall seek [[H1875]] to [[H413]] the idols, [[H457]] and to [[H413]] the charmers, [[H328]] and to [[H413]] them that have familiar spirits, [[H178]] and to [[H413]] the wizards. [[H3049]]

### 4
And [[H853]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] will I give over [[H5534]] into the hand [[H3027]] of a cruel [[H7186]] lord; [[H113]] and a fierce [[H5794]] king [[H4428]] shall rule [[H4910]] over them, saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H113]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 5
And the waters [[H4325]] shall fail [[H5405]] from the sea, [[H3220]] and the river [[H5104]] shall be wasted [[H2717]] and dried up. [[H3001]]

### 6
And they shall turn away; [[H2186]] the rivers [[H5104]] far the brooks [[H2975]] of defence [[H4693]] shall be emptied [[H1809]] and dried up: [[H2717]] the reeds [[H7070]] and flags [[H5488]] shall wither. [[H7060]]

### 7
The paper reeds [[H6169]] by [[H5921]] the brooks, [[H2975]] by [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the brooks, [[H2975]] and every thing [[H3605]] sown [[H4218]] by the brooks, [[H2975]] shall wither, [[H3001]] be driven away, [[H5086]] and be no [[H369]]

### 8
The fishers [[H1771]] also shall mourn, [[H578]] and all [[H3605]] they that cast [[H7993]] angle [[H2443]] into the brooks [[H2975]] shall lament, [[H56]] and they that spread [[H6566]] nets [[H4365]] upon [[H6440]] the waters [[H4325]] shall languish. [[H535]]

### 9
Moreover they that work [[H5647]] in fine [[H8305]] flax, [[H6593]] and they that weave [[H707]] networks, [[H2355]] shall be confounded. [[H954]]

### 10
And they shall be [[H1961]] broken [[H1792]] in the purposes [[H8356]] thereof, all [[H3605]] that make [[H6213]] sluices [[H7938]] ponds [[H99]] for fish. [[H5315]]

### 11
Surely [[H389]] the princes [[H8269]] of Zoan [[H6814]] fools, [[H196]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the wise counsellers [[H2450]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] is become brutish: [[H1197]] how [[H349]] say [[H559]] ye unto [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] I [[H589]] the son [[H1121]] of the wise, [[H2450]] the son [[H1121]] of ancient [[H6924]] kings? [[H4428]]

### 12
Where [[H335]] they? where [[H645]] thy wise [[H2450]] and let them tell [[H5046]] thee now, [[H4994]] and let them know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] hath purposed [[H3289]] upon [[H5921]] Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 13
The princes [[H8269]] of Zoan [[H6814]] are become fools, [[H2973]] the princes [[H8269]] of Noph [[H5297]] are deceived; [[H5377]] they have also seduced [[H8582]] Egypt, [[H4714]] the stay [[H6438]] of the tribes [[H7626]] thereof. [[H7626]]

### 14
The Lord [[H3068]] hath mingled [[H4537]] a perverse [[H5773]] spirit [[H7307]] in the midst [[H7130]]  thereof: and they have caused [[H853]] Egypt [[H4714]] to err [[H8582]] in every [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] thereof, as a drunken [[H7910]] staggereth [[H8582]] in his vomit. [[H6892]]

### 15
Neither [[H3808]] shall there be [[H1961]] work [[H4639]] for Egypt, [[H4714]] which [[H834]] the head [[H7218]] or tail, [[H2180]] branch [[H3712]] or rush, [[H100]] may do. [[H6213]]

### 16
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall Egypt [[H4714]] be [[H1961]] like unto women: [[H802]] and it shall be afraid [[H2729]] and fear [[H6342]] because [[H6440]] of the shaking [[H8573]] of the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] which [[H834]] he [[H1931]] shaketh [[H5130]] over [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 17
And the land [[H127]] of Judah [[H3063]] shall be [[H1961]] a terror [[H2283]] unto Egypt, [[H4714]] every one [[H3605]] that [[H834]] maketh mention [[H2142]] thereof shall be afraid [[H6342]] in [[H413]] himself, because [[H6440]] of the counsel [[H6098]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] which [[H834]] he [[H1931]] hath determined [[H3289]] against [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 18
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall [[H1961]] five [[H2568]] cities [[H5892]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] speak [[H1696]] the language [[H8193]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and swear [[H7650]] to the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts; [[H6635]] one [[H259]] shall be called, [[H559]] The city [[H5892]] of destruction. [[H2041]]

### 19
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall there be [[H1961]] an altar [[H4196]] to the Lord [[H3068]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and a pillar [[H4676]] at [[H681]] the border [[H1366]] thereof to the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
And it shall be [[H1961]] for a sign [[H226]] and for a witness [[H5707]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] for [[H3588]] they shall cry [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] because [[H6440]] of the oppressors, [[H3905]] and he shall send [[H7971]] them a saviour, [[H3467]] and a great one, [[H7227]] and he shall deliver [[H5337]] them. [[H5337]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall be known [[H3045]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall know [[H3045]] the Lord [[H3068]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and shall do [[H5647]] sacrifice [[H2077]] and oblation; [[H4503]] yea, they shall vow [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and perform [[H7999]]

### 22
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall smite [[H5062]] Egypt: [[H4714]] he shall smite [[H5062]] and heal [[H7495]] and they shall return [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he shall be intreated [[H6279]] of them, and shall heal [[H7495]] them. [[H7495]]

### 23
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall there be [[H1961]] a highway [[H4546]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] to Assyria, [[H804]] and the Assyrian [[H804]] shall come [[H935]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] and the Egyptian [[H4714]] into Assyria, [[H804]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall serve [[H5647]] with [[H853]] the Assyrians. [[H804]]

### 24
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall Israel [[H3478]] be [[H1961]] the third [[H7992]] with Egypt [[H4714]] and with Assyria, [[H804]] a blessing [[H1293]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the land: [[H776]]

### 25
Whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] shall bless, [[H1288]] saying, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] Egypt [[H4714]] my people, [[H5971]] and Assyria [[H804]] the work [[H4639]] of my hands, [[H3027]] and Israel [[H3478]] mine inheritance. [[H5159]]
