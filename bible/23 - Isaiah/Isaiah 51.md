[[Isaiah 50|←]] • [[Isaiah 52|→]]

### 1
Hearken [[H8085]] to [[H413]] me, ye that follow after [[H7291]] righteousness, [[H6664]] ye that seek [[H1245]] the Lord: [[H3068]] look [[H5027]] unto [[H413]] the rock [[H6697]] ye are hewn, [[H2672]] and to [[H413]] the hole [[H4718]] of the pit [[H953]] ye are digged. [[H5365]]

### 2
Look [[H5027]] unto [[H413]] Abraham [[H85]] your father, [[H1]] and unto [[H413]] Sarah [[H8283]] bare [[H2342]] you: for [[H3588]] I called [[H7121]] him alone, [[H259]] and blessed [[H1288]] him, and increased [[H7235]] him. [[H7235]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall comfort [[H5162]] Zion: [[H6726]] he will comfort [[H5162]] all [[H3605]] her waste places; [[H2723]] and he will make [[H7760]] her wilderness [[H4057]] like Eden, [[H5731]] and her desert [[H6160]] like the garden [[H1588]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] joy [[H8342]] and gladness [[H8057]] shall be found [[H4672]] therein, thanksgiving, [[H8426]] and the voice [[H6963]] of melody. [[H2172]]

### 4
Hearken [[H7181]] unto [[H413]] me, my people; [[H5971]] and give ear [[H238]] unto [[H413]] me, O my nation: [[H3816]] for [[H3588]] a law [[H8451]] shall proceed [[H3318]] from [[H853]] me, and I will make my judgment [[H4941]] to rest [[H7280]] for a light [[H216]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 5
My righteousness [[H6664]] near; [[H7138]] my salvation [[H3468]] is gone forth, [[H3318]] and mine arms [[H2220]] shall judge [[H8199]] the people; [[H5971]] the isles [[H339]] shall wait [[H6960]] upon [[H413]] me, and on [[H413]] mine arm [[H2220]] shall they trust. [[H3176]]

### 6
Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] to the heavens, [[H8064]] and look [[H5027]] upon [[H413]] the earth [[H776]] beneath: [[H8478]] for [[H3588]] the heavens [[H8064]] shall vanish away [[H4414]] like smoke, [[H6227]] and the earth [[H776]] shall wax old [[H1086]] like a garment, [[H899]] and they that dwell [[H3427]] therein shall die [[H4191]] in like manner: [[H3644]] but my salvation [[H3444]] shall be [[H1961]] for ever, [[H5769]] and my righteousness [[H6666]] shall not [[H3808]] be abolished. [[H2865]]

### 7
Hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, ye that know [[H3045]] righteousness, [[H6664]] the people [[H5971]] in whose heart [[H3820]] my law; [[H8451]] fear [[H3372]] ye not [[H408]] the reproach [[H2781]] of men, [[H582]] neither [[H408]] be ye afraid [[H2865]] of their revilings. [[H1421]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] the moth [[H6211]] shall eat them up [[H398]] like a garment, [[H899]] and the worm [[H5580]] shall eat [[H398]] them like wool: [[H6785]] but my righteousness [[H6666]] shall be [[H1961]] for ever, [[H5769]] and my salvation [[H3444]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]

### 9
Awake, [[H5782]] awake, [[H5782]] put on [[H3847]] strength, [[H5797]] O arm [[H2220]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] awake, [[H5782]] as in the ancient [[H6924]] days, [[H3117]] in the generations [[H1755]] of old. [[H5769]] thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] it [[H1931]] that hath cut [[H2672]] Rahab, [[H7294]] wounded [[H2490]] the dragon? [[H8577]]

### 10
thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] it [[H1931]] which hath dried [[H2717]] the sea, [[H3220]] the waters [[H4325]] of the great [[H7227]] deep; [[H8415]] that hath made [[H7760]] the depths [[H4615]] of the sea [[H3220]] a way [[H1870]] for the ransomed [[H1350]] to pass over? [[H5674]]

### 11
Therefore the redeemed [[H6299]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall return, [[H7725]] and come [[H935]] with singing [[H7440]] unto Zion; [[H6726]] and everlasting [[H5769]] joy [[H8057]] upon [[H5921]] their head: [[H7218]] they shall obtain [[H5381]] gladness [[H8342]] and joy; [[H8057]] sorrow [[H3015]] and mourning [[H585]] shall flee away. [[H5127]]

### 12
I, [[H595]] I, [[H595]] he [[H1931]] that comforteth [[H5162]] you: who [[H4310]] thou, [[H859]] that thou shouldest be afraid [[H3372]] of a man [[H582]] shall die, [[H4191]] and of the son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] shall be made [[H5414]] grass; [[H2682]]

### 13
And forgettest [[H7911]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy maker, [[H6213]] that hath stretched forth [[H5186]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and laid the foundations [[H3245]] of the earth; [[H776]] and hast feared [[H6342]] continually [[H8548]] every [[H3605]] day [[H3117]] because [[H6440]] of the fury [[H2534]] of the oppressor, [[H6693]] as if [[H834]] he were ready [[H3559]] to destroy? [[H7843]] and where [[H346]] the fury [[H2534]] of the oppressor? [[H6693]]

### 14
The captive exile [[H6808]] hasteneth [[H4116]] that he may be loosed, [[H6605]] and that he should not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] in the pit, [[H7845]] nor [[H3808]] that his bread [[H3899]] should fail. [[H2637]]

### 15
But I [[H595]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] that divided [[H7280]] the sea, [[H3220]] whose waves [[H1530]] roared: [[H1993]] The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] his name. [[H8034]]

### 16
And I have put [[H7760]] my words [[H1697]] in thy mouth, [[H6310]] and I have covered [[H3680]] thee in the shadow [[H6738]] of mine hand, [[H3027]] that I may plant [[H5193]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and lay the foundations [[H3245]] of the earth, [[H776]] and say [[H559]] unto Zion, [[H6726]] Thou [[H859]] my people. [[H5971]]

### 17
Awake, [[H5782]] awake, [[H5782]] stand up, [[H6965]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] hast drunk [[H8354]] at the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] the cup [[H3563]] of his fury; [[H2534]] thou hast drunken [[H8354]] the dregs [[H6907]] of the cup [[H3563]] of trembling, [[H8653]] wrung out. [[H4680]]

### 18
none [[H369]] to guide [[H5095]] her among all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] she hath brought forth; [[H3205]] neither [[H369]] that taketh [[H2388]] her by the hand [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] she hath brought up. [[H1431]]

### 19
These [[H2007]] two [[H8147]] are come [[H7122]] unto thee; who [[H4310]] shall be sorry [[H5110]] for thee? desolation, [[H7701]] and destruction, [[H7667]] and the famine, [[H7458]] and the sword: [[H2719]] by whom [[H4310]] shall I comfort [[H5162]] thee? [[H5162]]

### 20
Thy sons [[H1121]] have fainted, [[H5968]] they lie [[H7901]] at the head [[H7218]] of all [[H3605]] the streets, [[H2351]] as a wild bull [[H8377]] in a net: [[H4364]] they are full [[H4392]] of the fury [[H2534]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] the rebuke [[H1606]] of thy God. [[H430]]

### 21
Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] now [[H4994]] this, [[H2063]] thou afflicted, [[H6041]] and drunken, [[H7937]] but not [[H3808]] with wine: [[H3196]]

### 22
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] thy Lord [[H113]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and thy God [[H430]] pleadeth [[H7378]] the cause of his people, [[H5971]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have taken out [[H3947]] of thine hand [[H3027]] the cup [[H3563]] of trembling, [[H8653]] the dregs [[H6907]] of the cup [[H3563]] of my fury; [[H2534]] thou shalt no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] drink again: [[H8354]] it [[H8354]]

### 23
But I will put [[H7760]] it into the hand [[H3027]] of them that afflict [[H3013]] thee; which [[H834]] have said [[H559]] to thy soul, [[H5315]] Bow down, [[H7812]] that we may go over: [[H5674]] and thou hast laid [[H7760]] thy body [[H1460]] as the ground, [[H776]] and as the street, [[H2351]] to them that went over.
