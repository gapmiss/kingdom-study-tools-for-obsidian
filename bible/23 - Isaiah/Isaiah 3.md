The mighty man, [[H1368]] and the man [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] the judge, [[H8199]] and the prophet, [[H5030]] and the prudent, [[H7080]] and the ancient, [[H2205]]

### 3
The captain [[H8269]] of fifty, [[H2572]] and the honourable [[H5375]] man, [[H6440]] and the counseller, [[H3289]] and the cunning [[H2450]] artificer, [[H2791]] and the eloquent [[H995]] orator. [[H3908]]

### 5
And the people [[H5971]] shall be oppressed, [[H5065]] every one [[H376]] by another, [[H376]] and every one [[H376]] by his neighbour: [[H7453]] the child [[H5288]] shall behave himself proudly [[H7292]] against the ancient, [[H2205]] and the base [[H7034]] against the honourable. [[H3513]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] is ruined, [[H3782]] and Judah [[H3063]] is fallen: [[H5307]] because [[H3588]] their tongue [[H3956]] and their doings [[H4611]] against [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to provoke [[H4784]] the eyes [[H5869]] of his glory. [[H3519]]

### 9
The shew [[H1971]] of their countenance [[H6440]] doth witness them; [[H6030]] against and they declare [[H5046]] their sin [[H2403]] as Sodom, [[H5467]] they hide [[H3582]] not. [[H3808]] Woe [[H188]] unto their soul! [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] they have rewarded [[H1580]] evil [[H7451]] unto themselves. [[H7451]]

### 10
Say [[H559]] ye to the righteous, [[H6662]] that [[H3588]] well [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] they shall eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of their doings. [[H4611]]

Woe [[H188]] unto the wicked! [[H7563]] ill [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] the reward [[H1576]] of his hands [[H3027]] shall be given [[H6213]] him. [[H6213]]

### 12
my people, [[H5971]] children [[H5768]] their oppressors, [[H5065]] and women [[H802]] rule [[H4910]] over them. O my people, [[H5971]] they which lead [[H833]] thee cause to err, [[H8582]] and destroy [[H1104]] the way [[H1870]] of thy paths. [[H734]]

### 13
The Lord [[H3068]] standeth up [[H5324]] to plead, [[H7378]] and standeth [[H5975]] to judge [[H1777]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 14
The Lord [[H3068]] will enter [[H935]] into judgment [[H4941]] with [[H5973]] the ancients [[H2205]] of his people, [[H5971]] and the princes [[H8269]] thereof: for ye [[H859]] have eaten up [[H1197]] the vineyard; [[H3754]] the spoil [[H1500]] of the poor [[H6041]] in your houses. [[H1004]]

### 15
What mean ye [[H4100]] ye beat pieces, [[H1792]] my people [[H5971]] to and grind [[H2912]] the faces [[H6440]] of the poor? [[H6041]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 17
Therefore the Lord [[H136]] will smite with a scab [[H5596]] the crown of the head [[H6936]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] and the Lord [[H3068]] will discover [[H6168]] their secret parts. [[H6596]]

### 18
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H136]] will take away [[H5493]] the bravery [[H8597]] of tinkling ornaments [[H5914]] and cauls, [[H7636]] and round tires [[H7720]] like the moon, [[H7720]]

### 19

### 23
The glasses, [[H1549]] and the fine linen, [[H5466]] and the hoods, [[H6797]] and the vails. [[H7289]]

### 24
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] instead [[H8478]] of sweet smell [[H1314]] there shall be [[H1961]] stink; [[H4716]] and instead [[H8478]] of a girdle [[H2290]] a rent; [[H5364]] and instead [[H8478]] of well set [[H4639]] hair [[H4748]] baldness; [[H7144]] and instead [[H8478]] of a stomacher [[H6614]] a girding [[H4228]] of sackcloth; [[H8242]] burning [[H3587]] instead [[H8478]] of beauty. [[H3308]]

### 25
Thy men [[H4962]] shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and thy mighty [[H1369]] in the war. [[H4421]]

### 26
And her gates [[H6607]] shall lament [[H578]] and mourn; [[H56]] and she desolate [[H5352]] shall sit [[H3427]] upon the ground. [[H776]]
