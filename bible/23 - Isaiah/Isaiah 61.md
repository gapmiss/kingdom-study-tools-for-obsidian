### 1
The Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] upon [[H5921]] me; because [[H3282]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath anointed [[H4886]] me to preach good tidings [[H1319]] unto the meek; [[H6035]] he hath sent [[H7971]] me to bind up [[H2280]] the brokenhearted, [[H7665]] to proclaim [[H7121]] liberty [[H1865]] to the captives, [[H7617]] and the opening of the prison [[H6495]] to bound; [[H631]]

### 2
To proclaim [[H7121]] the acceptable [[H7522]] year [[H8141]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the day [[H3117]] of vengeance [[H5359]] of our God; [[H430]] to comfort [[H5162]] all [[H3605]] that mourn; [[H57]]

### 3
To appoint [[H7760]] unto them that mourn [[H57]] in Zion, [[H6726]] to give [[H5414]] unto them beauty [[H6287]] for [[H8478]] ashes, [[H665]] the oil [[H8081]] of joy [[H8342]] for [[H8478]] mourning, [[H60]] the garment [[H4594]] of praise [[H8416]] for [[H8478]] the spirit [[H7307]] of heaviness; [[H3544]] that they might be called [[H7121]] trees [[H352]] of righteousness, [[H6664]] the planting [[H4302]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that he might be glorified. [[H6286]]

### 4
And they shall build [[H1129]] the old [[H5769]] wastes, [[H2723]] they shall raise up [[H6965]] the former [[H7223]] desolations, [[H8074]] and they shall repair [[H2318]] the waste [[H2721]] cities, [[H5892]] the desolations [[H8074]] of many [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 5
And strangers [[H2114]] shall stand [[H5975]] and feed [[H7462]] your flocks, [[H6629]] and the sons [[H1121]] of the alien [[H5236]] your plowmen [[H406]] and your vinedressers. [[H3755]]

### 6
But ye [[H859]] shall be named [[H7121]] the Priests [[H3548]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] shall call [[H559]] you the Ministers [[H8334]] of our God: [[H430]] ye shall eat [[H398]] the riches [[H2428]] of the Gentiles, [[H1471]] and in their glory [[H3519]] shall ye boast [[H3235]] yourselves. [[H3235]]

### 7
For [[H8478]] your shame [[H1322]] double; [[H4932]] and confusion [[H3639]] they shall rejoice [[H7442]] in their portion: [[H2506]] therefore [[H3651]] in their land [[H776]] they shall possess [[H3423]] the double: [[H4932]] everlasting [[H5769]] joy [[H8057]] shall be [[H1961]] unto them. [[H1961]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] love [[H157]] judgment, [[H4941]] I hate [[H8130]] robbery [[H1498]] for burnt offering; [[H5930]] and I will direct [[H5414]] their work [[H6468]] in truth, [[H571]] and I will make [[H3772]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] with them. [[H1285]]

### 9
And their seed [[H2233]] shall be known [[H3045]] among the Gentiles, [[H1471]] and their offspring [[H6631]] among [[H8432]] the people: [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] that see [[H7200]] them shall acknowledge [[H5234]] them, that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] the seed [[H2233]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath blessed. [[H1288]]

### 10
I will greatly [[H7797]] rejoice [[H7797]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] my soul [[H5315]] shall be joyful [[H1523]] in my God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] he hath clothed [[H3847]] me with the garments [[H899]] of salvation, [[H3468]] he hath covered [[H3271]] me with the robe [[H4598]] of righteousness, [[H6666]] as a bridegroom [[H2860]] decketh [[H3547]] with ornaments, [[H6287]] and as a bride [[H3618]] adorneth [[H5710]] with her jewels. [[H3627]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] as the earth [[H776]] bringeth forth [[H3318]] her bud, [[H6780]] and as the garden [[H1593]] causeth the things that are sown [[H2221]] in it to spring forth; [[H6779]] so [[H3651]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3068]] will cause righteousness [[H6666]] and praise [[H8416]] to spring forth [[H6779]] before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] the nations.
