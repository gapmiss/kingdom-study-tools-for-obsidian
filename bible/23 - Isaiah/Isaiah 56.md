[[Isaiah 55|←]] • [[Isaiah 57|→]]

### 1
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Keep [[H8104]] ye judgment, [[H4941]] and do [[H6213]] justice: [[H6666]] for [[H3588]] my salvation [[H3444]] near [[H7138]] to come, [[H935]] and my righteousness [[H6666]] to be revealed. [[H1540]]

### 2
Blessed [[H835]] the man [[H376]] doeth [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] and the son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] layeth hold [[H2388]] on it; that keepeth [[H8104]] the sabbath [[H7676]] from polluting [[H2490]] it, and keepeth [[H8104]] his hand [[H3027]] from doing [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 3
Neither [[H408]] let the son [[H1121]] of the stranger, [[H5236]] that hath joined himself [[H3867]] to [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] speak, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath utterly [[H914]] separated [[H914]] me from [[H5921]] his people: [[H5971]] neither [[H408]] let the eunuch [[H5631]] say, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I [[H589]] a dry [[H3002]] tree. [[H6086]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto the eunuchs [[H5631]] that [[H834]] keep [[H8104]] my sabbaths, [[H7676]] and choose [[H977]] that [[H834]] please [[H2654]] me, and take hold [[H2388]] of my covenant; [[H1285]]

### 5
Even unto them will I give [[H5414]] in mine house [[H1004]] and within my walls [[H2346]] a place [[H3027]] and a name [[H8034]] better [[H2896]] than of sons [[H1121]] and of daughters: [[H1323]] I will give [[H5414]] them an everlasting [[H5769]] name, [[H8034]] that [[H834]] shall not [[H3808]] be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 6
Also the sons [[H1121]] of the stranger, [[H5236]] that join themselves [[H3867]] to [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to serve [[H8334]] him, and to love [[H157]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to be [[H1961]] his servants, [[H5650]] every one [[H3605]] that keepeth [[H8104]] the sabbath [[H7676]] from polluting [[H2490]] it, and taketh hold [[H2388]] of my covenant; [[H1285]]

### 7
Even them will I bring [[H935]] to [[H413]] my holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] and make them joyful [[H8055]] in my house [[H1004]] of prayer: [[H8605]] their burnt offerings [[H5930]] and their sacrifices [[H2077]] accepted [[H7522]] upon [[H5921]] mine altar; [[H4196]] for [[H3588]] mine house [[H1004]] shall be called [[H7121]] an house [[H1004]] of prayer [[H8605]] for all [[H3605]] people. [[H5971]]

### 8
The Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] which gathereth [[H6908]] the outcasts [[H1760]] of Israel [[H3478]] saith, [[H5002]] Yet [[H5750]] will I gather [[H6908]] to [[H5921]] him, beside those that are gathered [[H6908]] unto him. [[H6908]]

### 9
All [[H3605]] ye beasts [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] come [[H857]] to devour, [[H398]] all [[H3605]] ye beasts [[H2416]] in the forest. [[H3293]]

### 10
His watchmen [[H6822]] blind: [[H5787]] they are all [[H3605]] ignorant, [[H3045]] they all [[H3605]] dumb [[H483]] dogs, [[H3611]] they cannot [[H3201]] bark; [[H5024]] sleeping, [[H1957]] lying down, [[H7901]] loving [[H157]] to slumber. [[H5123]]

### 11
Yea, greedy [[H5794]] dogs [[H3611]] can never [[H3808]] have [[H3045]] enough, [[H7654]] and they [[H1992]] shepherds [[H7462]] cannot [[H3045]] understand: [[H995]] they all [[H3605]] look [[H6437]] to their own way, [[H1870]] every one [[H376]] for his gain, [[H1215]] from his quarter. [[H7097]]

### 12
Come [[H857]] ye, I will fetch [[H3947]] wine, [[H3196]] and we will fill [[H5433]] ourselves with strong drink; [[H7941]] and to morrow [[H4279]] shall be [[H1961]] as this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] much [[H3966]] more [[H3499]] abundant. [[H1419]]
