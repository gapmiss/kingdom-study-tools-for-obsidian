### 1
I am sought [[H1875]] of asked [[H7592]] not [[H3808]] I am found [[H4672]] of sought [[H1245]] me not: [[H3808]] I said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2005]] me, behold [[H2005]] me, unto [[H413]] a nation [[H1471]] was not [[H3808]] called [[H7121]] by my name. [[H8034]]

### 2
I have spread out [[H6566]] my hands [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] unto [[H413]] a rebellious [[H5637]] people, [[H5971]] which walketh [[H1980]] in a way [[H1870]] not [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] after [[H310]] their own thoughts; [[H4284]]

### 3
A people [[H5971]] that provoketh me to anger [[H3707]] continually [[H8548]] to [[H5921]] my face; [[H6440]] that sacrificeth [[H2076]] in gardens, [[H1593]] and burneth incense [[H6999]] upon [[H5921]] altars of brick; [[H3843]]

### 4
Which remain [[H3427]] among the graves, [[H6913]] and lodge [[H3885]] in the monuments, [[H5341]] which eat [[H398]] swine's [[H2386]] flesh, [[H1320]] and broth [[H6564]] of abominable [[H6292]] their vessels; [[H3627]]

### 5
Which say, [[H559]] Stand [[H7126]] by [[H413]] thyself, come not near [[H5066]] to me; for [[H3588]] I am holier [[H6942]] than thou. These [[H428]] a smoke [[H6227]] in my nose, [[H639]] a fire [[H784]] that burneth [[H3344]] all [[H3605]] the day. [[H3117]]

### 6
Behold, [[H2009]] written [[H3789]] before [[H6440]] me: I will not [[H3808]] keep silence, [[H2814]] but [[H3588]] will recompense, [[H7999]] even recompense [[H7999]] into [[H5921]] their bosom, [[H2436]]

### 7
Your iniquities, [[H5771]] and the iniquities [[H5771]] of your fathers [[H1]] together, [[H3162]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] have burned incense [[H6999]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and blasphemed [[H2778]] me upon [[H5921]] the hills: [[H1389]] therefore will I measure [[H4058]] their former [[H7223]] work [[H6468]] into [[H5921]] their bosom. [[H2436]]

### 8
Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] As [[H834]] the new wine [[H8492]] is found [[H4672]] in the cluster, [[H811]] and saith, [[H559]] Destroy [[H7843]] it not; [[H408]] for [[H3588]] a blessing [[H1293]] in it: so [[H3651]] will I do [[H6213]] for my servants' [[H5650]] sakes, [[H4616]] that I may not [[H1115]] destroy [[H7843]] them all. [[H7843]]

### 9
And I will bring forth [[H3318]] a seed [[H2233]] out of Jacob, [[H3290]] and out of Judah [[H3063]] an inheritor [[H3423]] of my mountains: [[H2022]] and mine elect [[H972]] shall inherit [[H3423]] it, and my servants [[H5650]] shall dwell [[H7931]] there. [[H7931]]

### 10
And Sharon [[H8289]] shall be [[H1961]] a fold [[H5116]] of flocks, [[H6629]] and the valley [[H6010]] of Achor [[H5911]] a place for the herds [[H1241]] to lie down in, [[H7258]] for my people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] have sought [[H1875]] me. [[H1875]]

### 11
But ye [[H859]] they that forsake [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that forget [[H7913]] my holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] that prepare [[H6186]] a table [[H7979]] for that troop, [[H1409]] and that furnish [[H4390]] the drink offering [[H4469]] unto that number. [[H4507]]

### 12
Therefore will I number [[H4487]] you to the sword, [[H2719]] and ye shall all [[H3605]] bow down [[H3766]] to the slaughter: [[H2874]] because [[H3282]] when I called, [[H7121]] ye did not [[H3808]] answer; [[H6030]] when I spake, [[H1696]] ye did not [[H3808]] hear; [[H8085]] but did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] before mine eyes, [[H5869]] and did choose [[H977]] wherein [[H834]] I delighted [[H2654]] not. [[H2654]]

### 13
Therefore [[H3651]] thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] Behold, [[H2009]] my servants [[H5650]] shall eat, [[H398]] but ye [[H859]] shall be hungry: [[H7456]] behold, [[H2009]] my servants [[H5650]] shall drink, [[H8354]] but ye [[H859]] shall be thirsty: [[H6770]] behold, [[H2009]] my servants [[H5650]] shall rejoice, [[H8055]] but ye [[H859]] shall be ashamed: [[H954]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2009]] my servants [[H5650]] shall sing [[H7442]] for joy [[H2898]] of heart, [[H3820]] but ye [[H859]] shall cry [[H6817]] for sorrow [[H3511]] of heart, [[H3820]] and shall howl [[H3213]] for vexation [[H7667]] of spirit. [[H7307]]

### 15
And ye shall leave [[H3240]] your name [[H8034]] for a curse [[H7621]] unto my chosen: [[H972]] for the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] shall slay [[H4191]] thee, and call [[H7121]] his servants [[H5650]] by another [[H312]] name: [[H8034]]

### 16
That he who [[H834]] blesseth himself [[H1288]] in the earth [[H776]] shall bless himself [[H1288]] in the God [[H430]] of truth; [[H543]] and he that sweareth [[H7650]] in the earth [[H776]] shall swear [[H7650]] by the God [[H430]] of truth; [[H543]] because [[H3588]] the former [[H7223]] troubles [[H6869]] are forgotten, [[H7911]] and because [[H3588]] they are hid [[H5641]] from mine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 17
For, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I create [[H1254]] new [[H2319]] heavens [[H8064]] and a new [[H2319]] earth: [[H776]] and the former [[H7223]] shall not [[H3808]] be remembered, [[H2142]] nor [[H3808]] come [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] mind. [[H3820]]

### 18
But [[H3588]] be ye glad [[H7797]] and rejoice [[H1523]] for ever [[H5703]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] create: [[H1254]] for, [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I create [[H1254]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] a rejoicing, [[H1525]] and her people [[H5971]] a joy. [[H4885]]

### 19
And I will rejoice [[H1523]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and joy [[H7797]] in my people: [[H5971]] and the voice [[H6963]] of weeping [[H1065]] shall be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] heard [[H8085]] in her, nor the voice [[H6963]] of crying. [[H2201]]

### 20
There shall be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] thence [[H8033]] an infant [[H5764]] of days, [[H3117]] nor an old man [[H2205]] that [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] filled [[H4390]] his days: [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] the child [[H5288]] shall die [[H4191]] an hundred [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] old; [[H1121]] but the sinner [[H2398]] an hundred [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] shall be accursed. [[H7043]]

### 21
And they shall build [[H1129]] houses, [[H1004]] and inhabit [[H3427]] and they shall plant [[H5193]] vineyards, [[H3754]] and eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of them. [[H6529]]

### 22
They shall not [[H3808]] build, [[H1129]] and another [[H312]] inhabit; [[H3427]] they shall not [[H3808]] plant, [[H5193]] and another [[H312]] eat: [[H398]] for [[H3588]] as the days [[H3117]] of a tree [[H6086]] the days [[H3117]] of my people, [[H5971]] and mine elect [[H972]] shall long enjoy [[H1086]] the work [[H4639]] of their hands. [[H3027]]

### 23
They shall not [[H3808]] labour [[H3021]] in vain, [[H7385]] nor [[H3808]] bring forth [[H3205]] for trouble; [[H928]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] the seed [[H2233]] of the blessed [[H1288]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and their offspring [[H6631]] with [[H854]] them. [[H854]]

### 24
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] that before [[H2962]] they call, [[H7121]] I [[H589]] will answer; [[H6030]] and while they [[H1992]] are yet [[H5750]] speaking, [[H1696]] I [[H589]] will hear. [[H8085]]

### 25
The wolf [[H2061]] and the lamb [[H2924]] shall feed [[H7462]] together, [[H259]] and the lion [[H738]] shall eat [[H398]] straw [[H8401]] like the bullock: [[H1241]] and dust [[H6083]] the serpent's [[H5175]] meat. [[H3899]] They shall not [[H3808]] hurt [[H7489]] nor [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] in all [[H3605]] my holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] saith [[H559]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
