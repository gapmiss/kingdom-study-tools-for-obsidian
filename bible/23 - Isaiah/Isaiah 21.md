### 1
The burden [[H4853]] of the desert [[H4057]] of the sea. [[H3220]] As whirlwinds [[H5492]] in the south [[H5045]] pass through; [[H2498]] it cometh [[H935]] from the desert, [[H4057]] from a terrible [[H3372]] land. [[H776]]

### 2
A grievous [[H7186]] vision [[H2380]] is declared [[H5046]] unto me; the treacherous dealer [[H898]] dealeth treacherously, [[H898]] and the spoiler [[H7703]] spoileth. [[H7703]] Go up, [[H5927]] O Elam: [[H5867]] besiege, [[H6696]] O Media; [[H4074]] all [[H3605]] the sighing [[H585]] thereof have I made to cease. [[H7673]]

### 3
Therefore [[H5921]] are my loins [[H4975]] filled [[H4390]] with pain: [[H2479]] pangs [[H6735]] have taken hold [[H270]] upon me, as the pangs [[H6735]] of a woman that travaileth: [[H3205]] I was bowed down [[H5753]] at the hearing [[H8085]] I was dismayed [[H926]] at the seeing [[H7200]]

### 4
My heart [[H3824]] panted, [[H8582]] fearfulness [[H6427]] affrighted [[H1204]] me: the night [[H5399]] of my pleasure [[H2837]] hath he turned [[H7760]] into fear [[H2731]] unto me. [[H2731]]

### 5
Prepare [[H6186]] the table, [[H7979]] watch [[H6823]] in the watchtower, [[H6844]] eat, [[H398]] drink: [[H8354]] arise, [[H6965]] ye princes, [[H8269]] anoint [[H4886]] the shield. [[H4043]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] hath the Lord [[H136]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Go, [[H1980]] set [[H5975]] a watchman, [[H6822]] let him declare [[H5046]] what [[H834]] he seeth. [[H7200]]

### 7
And he saw [[H7200]] a chariot [[H7393]] a couple [[H6776]] of horsemen, [[H6571]] a chariot [[H7393]] of asses, [[H2543]] a chariot [[H7393]] of camels; [[H1581]] and he hearkened [[H7181]] diligently [[H7182]] with much [[H7227]] heed: [[H7182]]

### 8
And he cried, [[H7121]] A lion: [[H738]] My lord, [[H136]] I [[H595]] stand [[H5975]] continually [[H8548]] upon [[H5921]] the watchtower [[H4707]] in the daytime, [[H3119]] and I [[H595]] am set [[H5324]] in [[H5921]] my ward [[H4931]] whole [[H3605]] nights: [[H3915]]

### 9
And, behold, [[H2009]] here [[H2088]] cometh [[H935]] a chariot [[H7393]] of men, [[H376]] a couple [[H6776]] of horsemen. [[H6571]] And he answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Babylon [[H894]] is fallen, [[H5307]] is fallen; [[H5307]] and all [[H3605]] the graven images [[H6456]] of her gods [[H430]] he hath broken [[H7665]] unto the ground. [[H776]]

### 10
O my threshing, [[H4098]] and the corn [[H1121]] of my floor: [[H1637]] that which [[H834]] I have heard [[H8085]] of [[H853]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] have I declared [[H5046]] unto you. [[H5046]]

### 11
The burden [[H4853]] of Dumah. [[H1746]] He calleth [[H7121]] to [[H413]] me out of Seir, [[H8165]] Watchman, [[H8104]] what [[H4100]] of the night? [[H3915]] Watchman, [[H8104]] what [[H4100]] of the night? [[H3915]]

### 12
The watchman [[H8104]] said, [[H559]] The morning [[H1242]] cometh, [[H857]] and also [[H1571]] the night: [[H3915]] if [[H518]] ye will inquire, [[H1158]] inquire [[H1158]] ye: return, [[H7725]] come. [[H857]]

### 13
The burden [[H4853]] upon Arabia. [[H6152]] In the forest [[H3293]] in Arabia [[H6152]] shall ye lodge, [[H3885]] O ye travelling companies [[H736]] of Dedanim. [[H1720]]

### 14
The inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] of Tema [[H8485]] brought [[H857]] water [[H4325]] to him [[H7125]] that was thirsty, [[H6771]] they prevented [[H6923]] with their bread [[H3899]] him that fled. [[H5074]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] they fled [[H5074]] from [[H6440]] the swords, [[H2719]] from [[H6440]] the drawn [[H5203]] sword, [[H2719]] and from [[H6440]] the bent [[H1869]] bow, [[H7198]] and from [[H6440]] the grievousness [[H3514]] of war. [[H4421]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] hath the Lord [[H136]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Within [[H5750]] a year, [[H8141]] according to the years [[H8141]] of an hireling, [[H7916]] and all [[H3605]] the glory [[H3519]] of Kedar [[H6938]] shall fail: [[H3615]]

### 17
And the residue [[H7605]] of the number [[H4557]] of archers, [[H7198]] the mighty men [[H1368]] of the children [[H1121]] of Kedar, [[H6938]] shall be diminished: [[H4591]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] hath spoken [[H1696]]
