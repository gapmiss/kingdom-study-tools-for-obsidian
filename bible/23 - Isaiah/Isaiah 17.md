### 1
The burden [[H4853]] of Damascus. [[H1834]] Behold, [[H2009]] Damascus [[H1834]] is taken away [[H5493]] from a city, [[H5892]] and it shall be [[H1961]] a ruinous [[H4654]] heap. [[H4596]]

### 2
The cities [[H5892]] of Aroer [[H6177]] forsaken: [[H5800]] they shall be [[H1961]] for flocks, [[H5739]] which shall lie down, [[H7257]] and none [[H369]] shall make afraid. [[H2729]]

### 3
The fortress [[H4013]] also shall cease [[H7673]] from Ephraim, [[H669]] and the kingdom [[H4467]] from Damascus, [[H1834]] and the remnant [[H7605]] of Syria: [[H758]] they shall be [[H1961]] as the glory [[H3519]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts. [[H6635]]

### 4
And in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] the glory [[H3519]] of Jacob [[H3290]] shall be made thin, [[H1809]] and the fatness [[H4924]] of his flesh [[H1320]] shall wax lean. [[H7329]]

### 5
And it shall be [[H1961]] as when the harvestman [[H7105]] gathereth [[H622]] the corn, [[H7054]] and reapeth [[H7114]] the ears [[H7641]] with his arm; [[H2220]] and it shall be [[H1961]] as he that gathereth [[H3950]] ears [[H7641]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 6
Yet gleaning grapes [[H5955]] shall be left [[H7604]] in it, as the shaking [[H5363]] of an olive tree, [[H2132]] two [[H8147]] three [[H7969]] berries [[H1620]] in the top [[H7218]] of the uppermost bough, [[H534]] four [[H702]] five [[H2568]] in the outmost fruitful [[H6509]] branches [[H5585]] thereof, saith [[H5002]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
At that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall a man [[H120]] look [[H8159]] to [[H5921]] his Maker, [[H6213]] and his eyes [[H5869]] shall have respect [[H7200]] to [[H413]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
And he shall not [[H3808]] look [[H8159]] to [[H413]] the altars, [[H4196]] the work [[H4639]] of his hands, [[H3027]] neither [[H3808]] shall respect [[H7200]] which [[H834]] his fingers [[H676]] have made, [[H6213]] either the groves, [[H842]] or the images. [[H2553]]

### 9
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] shall his strong [[H4581]] cities [[H5892]] be [[H1961]] as a forsaken [[H5800]] bough, [[H2793]] and an uppermost branch, [[H534]] which [[H834]] they left [[H5800]] because [[H6440]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and there shall be [[H1961]] desolation. [[H8077]]

### 10
Because [[H3588]] thou hast forgotten [[H7911]] the God [[H430]] of thy salvation, [[H3468]] and hast not [[H3808]] been mindful [[H2142]] of the rock [[H6697]] of thy strength, [[H4581]] therefore [[H5921]] shalt thou plant [[H5193]] pleasant [[H5282]] plants, [[H5194]] and shalt set [[H2232]] it with strange [[H2114]] slips: [[H2156]]

### 11
In the day [[H3117]] shalt thou make thy plant [[H5194]] to grow, [[H7735]] and in the morning [[H1242]] shalt thou make thy seed [[H2233]] to flourish: [[H6524]] the harvest [[H7105]] a heap [[H5067]] in the day [[H3117]] of grief [[H2470]] and of desperate [[H605]] sorrow. [[H3511]]

### 12
Woe [[H1945]] to the multitude [[H1995]] of many [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] make a noise [[H1993]] like the noise [[H1993]] of the seas; [[H3220]] and to the rushing [[H7588]] of nations, [[H3816]] make a rushing [[H7582]] like the rushing [[H7588]] of mighty [[H3524]] waters! [[H4325]]

### 13
The nations [[H3816]] shall rush [[H7582]] like the rushing [[H7588]] of many [[H7227]] waters: [[H4325]] but shall rebuke [[H1605]] them, and they shall flee [[H5127]] far off, [[H4801]] and shall be chased [[H7291]] as the chaff [[H4671]] of the mountains [[H2022]] before [[H6440]] the wind, [[H7307]] and like a rolling thing [[H1534]] before [[H6440]] the whirlwind. [[H5492]]

### 14
And behold [[H2009]] at eveningtide [[H6256]] trouble; [[H1091]] before [[H2962]] the morning [[H1242]] he not. [[H369]] This [[H2088]] the portion [[H2506]] of them that spoil [[H8154]] us, and the lot [[H1486]] of them that rob [[H962]] us. [[H962]]
