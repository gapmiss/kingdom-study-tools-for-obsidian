### 4
And he had [[H1961]] thirty [[H7970]] sons [[H1121]] that rode [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] thirty [[H7970]] ass colts, [[H5895]] and they [[H1992]] had thirty [[H7970]] cities, [[H5892]] which [[H1992]] are called [[H7121]] Havoth-jair [[H2334]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] which [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Gilead.

And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] again [[H3254]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] Baalim, [[H1168]] and Ashtaroth, [[H6252]] and the gods [[H430]] of Syria, [[H758]] and the gods [[H430]] of Zidon, [[H6721]] and the gods [[H430]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and the gods [[H430]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and the gods [[H430]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and forsook [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] not [[H3808]] him. [[H3808]]

### 7
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was hot [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and he sold [[H4376]] them into the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and into the hands [[H3027]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 8
And that [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] they vexed [[H7492]] and oppressed [[H7533]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] eighteen [[H8083]] years, [[H8141]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] in the land [[H776]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which [[H834]] in Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 9
Moreover the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] passed over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] to fight [[H3898]] also [[H1571]] against Judah, [[H3063]] and against Benjamin, [[H1144]] and against the house [[H1004]] of Ephraim; [[H669]] so that Israel [[H3478]] was sore [[H3966]] distressed. [[H3334]]

### 10
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] We have sinned [[H2398]] against thee, both because [[H3588]] we have forsaken [[H5800]] our God, [[H430]] and also served [[H5647]] Baalim. [[H1168]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] not [[H3808]] from the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and from [[H4480]] the Amorites, [[H567]] from [[H4480]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and from [[H4480]] the Philistines? [[H6430]]

### 12
The Zidonians [[H6722]] also, and the Amalekites, [[H6002]] and the Maonites, [[H4584]] did oppress [[H3905]] you; and ye cried [[H6817]] to [[H413]] me, and I delivered [[H3467]] you out of their hand. [[H3027]]

### 13
Yet ye [[H859]] have forsaken [[H5800]] me, and served [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods: [[H430]] wherefore [[H3651]] I will deliver [[H3467]] you no [[H3808]] more. [[H3254]]

### 14
Go [[H1980]] and cry [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the gods [[H430]] which [[H834]] ye have chosen; [[H977]] let them [[H1992]] deliver [[H3467]] you in the time [[H6256]] of your tribulation. [[H6869]]

### 15
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] We have sinned: [[H2398]] do [[H6213]] thou [[H859]] unto us whatsoever [[H3605]] seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] unto thee; deliver [[H5337]] us only, [[H389]] we pray thee, [[H4994]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 16
And they put away [[H5493]] the strange [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] from among [[H7130]] them, and served [[H5647]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and his soul [[H5315]] was grieved [[H7114]] for the misery [[H5999]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
Then the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] were gathered together, [[H6817]] and encamped [[H2583]] in Gilead. [[H1568]] And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] assembled themselves together, [[H622]] and encamped [[H2583]] in Mizpeh. [[H4709]]

### 18
And the people [[H5971]] princes [[H8269]] of Gilead [[H1568]] said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H7453]] What [[H4310]] man [[H376]] that [[H834]] will begin [[H2490]] to fight [[H3898]] against the children [[H1121]] of Ammon? [[H5983]] he shall be [[H1961]] head [[H7218]] over all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]
