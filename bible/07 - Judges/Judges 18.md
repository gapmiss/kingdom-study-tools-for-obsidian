### 1
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Israel: [[H3478]] and in those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the tribe [[H7626]] of the Danites [[H1839]] sought [[H1245]] them an inheritance [[H5159]] to dwell in; [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] unto [[H5704]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] inheritance [[H5159]] had not [[H3808]] fallen [[H5307]] unto them among [[H8432]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
And the children [[H1121]] of Dan [[H1835]] sent [[H7971]] of their family [[H4940]] five [[H2568]] men [[H376]] from their coasts, [[H7098]] men [[H1121]] of valour, [[H2428]] from Zorah, [[H6881]] and from Eshtaol, [[H847]] to spy out [[H7270]] the land, [[H776]] and to search [[H2713]] it; and they said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Go, [[H1980]] search [[H2713]] the land: [[H776]] who when they came [[H935]] to mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] to [[H5704]] the house [[H1004]] of Micah, [[H4318]] they lodged [[H3885]] there. [[H8033]]

### 3
When they [[H1992]] by [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of Micah, [[H4318]] they [[H1992]] knew [[H5234]] the voice [[H6963]] of the young man [[H5288]] the Levite: [[H3881]] and they turned in [[H5493]] thither, [[H8033]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Who [[H4310]] brought [[H935]] thee hither? [[H1988]] and what [[H4100]] makest [[H6213]] thou [[H859]] in this [[H2088]] and what [[H4100]] hast thou here? [[H6311]]

### 4
And he said [[H559]] unto them, [[H413]] Thus [[H2088]] and thus [[H2090]] dealeth [[H6213]] Micah [[H4318]] with me, and hath hired [[H7936]] me, and I am [[H1961]] his priest. [[H3548]]

### 5
And they said [[H559]] unto him, Ask counsel, [[H7592]] we pray thee, [[H4994]] of God, [[H430]] that we may know [[H3045]] whether our way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] we [[H587]] go [[H1980]] shall be prosperous. [[H6743]]

### 6
And the priest [[H3548]] said [[H559]] unto them, Go [[H1980]] in peace: [[H7965]] before [[H5227]] the Lord [[H3068]] your way [[H1870]] wherein [[H834]] ye go. [[H1980]]

### 7
Then the five [[H2568]] men [[H376]] departed, [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] to Laish, [[H3919]] and saw [[H7200]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] therein, [[H7130]] how they dwelt [[H3427]] careless, [[H983]] after the manner [[H4941]] of the Zidonians, [[H6722]] quiet [[H8252]] and secure; [[H982]] and no [[H369]] magistrate [[H3423]] in the land, [[H776]] that might put to shame [[H3637]] in thing; [[H1697]] and they [[H1992]] far [[H7350]] from the Zidonians, [[H6722]] and had no [[H369]] business [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] man. [[H120]]

### 8
And they came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] their brethren [[H251]] to Zorah [[H6881]] and Eshtaol: [[H847]] and their brethren [[H251]] said [[H559]] unto them, What [[H4100]] ye? [[H859]]

### 9
And they said, [[H559]] Arise, [[H6965]] that we may go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] them: for [[H3588]] we have seen [[H7200]] the land, [[H776]] and, behold, [[H2009]] it very [[H3966]] good: [[H2896]] and ye [[H859]] still? [[H2814]] be not slothful [[H6101]] to go, [[H1980]] to enter [[H935]] to possess [[H3423]] the land. [[H776]]

### 10
When ye go, [[H935]] ye shall come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] a people [[H5971]] secure, [[H982]] and to a large [[H7342]] land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] hath given [[H5414]] it into your hands; [[H3027]] a place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] no [[H369]] want [[H4270]] of any [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 11
And there went [[H5265]] from thence [[H8033]] of the family [[H4940]] of the Danites, [[H1839]] out of Zorah [[H6881]] and out of Eshtaol, [[H847]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] appointed [[H2296]] with weapons [[H3627]] of war. [[H4421]]

### 12
And they went up, [[H5927]] and pitched [[H2583]] in Kirjath-jearim, [[H7157]] in Judah: [[H3063]] wherefore [[H5921]] they called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Mahaneh-dan [[H4265]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day: [[H3117]] behold, [[H2009]] behind [[H310]] Kirjath-jearim. [[H7157]]

### 13
And they passed [[H5674]] thence [[H8033]] unto mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] the house [[H1004]] of Micah. [[H4318]]

### 14
Then answered [[H6030]] the five [[H2568]] men [[H582]] that went [[H1980]] to spy out [[H7270]] the country [[H776]] of Laish, [[H3919]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] their brethren, [[H251]] Do ye know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] in these [[H428]] houses [[H1004]] an ephod, [[H646]] and teraphim, [[H8655]] and a graven image, [[H6459]] and a molten image? [[H4541]] now [[H6258]] therefore consider [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] ye have to do. [[H6213]]

### 15
And they turned [[H5493]] thitherward, [[H8033]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the young man [[H5288]] the Levite, [[H3881]] unto the house [[H1004]] of Micah, [[H4318]] and saluted [[H7592]] him. [[H7965]]

### 16
And the six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] appointed [[H2296]] with their weapons [[H3627]] of war, [[H4421]] which [[H834]] of the children [[H1121]] of Dan, [[H1835]] stood [[H5324]] by the entering [[H6607]] of the gate. [[H8179]]

### 17
And the five [[H2568]] men [[H376]] that went [[H1980]] to spy out [[H7270]] the land [[H776]] went up, [[H5927]] came in [[H935]] thither, [[H8033]] took [[H3947]] the graven image, [[H6459]] and the ephod, [[H646]] and the teraphim, [[H8655]] and the molten image: [[H4541]] and the priest [[H3548]] stood [[H5324]] in the entering [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] with the six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] appointed [[H2296]] with weapons [[H3627]] of war. [[H4421]]

### 18
And these [[H428]] went [[H935]] into Micah's [[H4318]] house, [[H1004]] and fetched [[H3947]] the carved image, [[H6459]] the ephod, [[H646]] and the teraphim, [[H8655]] and the molten image. [[H4541]] Then said [[H559]] the priest [[H3548]] unto [[H413]] them, What [[H4100]] do [[H6213]] ye? [[H859]]

### 19
And they said [[H559]] unto him, Hold thy peace, [[H2790]] lay [[H7760]] thine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] thy mouth, [[H6310]] and go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] us, and be [[H1961]] to us a father [[H1]] and a priest: [[H3548]] better [[H2896]] for thee to be [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] unto the house [[H1004]] of one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] or [[H176]] that thou be [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] unto a tribe [[H7626]] and a family [[H4940]] in Israel? [[H3478]]

### 20
And the priest's [[H3548]] heart [[H3820]] was glad, [[H3190]] and he took [[H3947]] the ephod, [[H646]] and the teraphim, [[H8655]] and the graven image, [[H6459]] and went in [[H935]] the midst [[H7130]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 21
So they turned [[H6437]] and departed, [[H1980]] and put [[H7760]] the little ones [[H2945]] and the cattle [[H4735]] and the carriage [[H3520]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 22
when they [[H1992]] were a good way [[H7368]] from the house [[H1004]] of Micah, [[H4318]] the men [[H582]] that [[H834]] in the houses [[H1004]] near [[H5973]] to Micah's [[H4318]] house [[H1004]] were gathered together, [[H2199]] and overtook [[H1692]] the children [[H1121]] of Dan. [[H1835]]

### 23
And they cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Dan. [[H1835]] And they turned [[H5437]] their faces, [[H6440]] and said [[H559]] unto Micah, [[H4318]] What [[H4100]] aileth thee, that [[H3588]] thou comest with such a company? [[H2199]]

### 24
And he said, [[H559]] Ye have taken away [[H3947]] my gods [[H430]] which [[H834]] I made, [[H6213]] and the priest, [[H3548]] and ye are gone away: [[H1980]] and what [[H4100]] have I more? [[H5750]] and what [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] ye say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, What [[H4100]] aileth thee? [[H4100]]

### 25
And the children [[H1121]] of Dan [[H1835]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Let not [[H408]] thy voice [[H6963]] be heard [[H8085]] among [[H5973]] us, lest [[H6435]] angry [[H4751]] fellows [[H376]] run [[H6293]] upon thee, and thou lose [[H622]] thy life, [[H5315]] with the lives [[H5315]] of thy household. [[H1004]]

### 26
And the children [[H1121]] of Dan [[H1835]] went [[H1980]] their way: [[H1870]] and when Micah [[H4318]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] too strong [[H2389]] for [[H4480]] him, he turned [[H6437]] and went back [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] his house. [[H1004]]

### 27
And they [[H1992]] took [[H3947]] which [[H834]] Micah [[H4318]] had made, [[H6213]] and the priest [[H3548]] which [[H834]] he had, [[H1961]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H5921]] Laish, [[H3919]] unto [[H5921]] a people [[H5971]] at quiet [[H8252]] and secure: [[H982]] and they smote [[H5221]] them with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and burnt [[H8313]] the city [[H5892]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 28
And no [[H369]] deliverer, [[H5337]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] far [[H7350]] from Zidon, [[H6721]] and they had no [[H369]] business [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] man; [[H120]] and it [[H1931]] was in the valley [[H6010]] that [[H834]] by Beth-rehob. [[H1050]] And they built [[H1129]] a city, [[H5892]] and dwelt [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 29
And they called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] Dan, [[H1835]] after the name [[H8034]] of Dan [[H1835]] their father, [[H1]] who [[H834]] was born [[H3205]] unto Israel: [[H3478]] howbeit [[H199]] the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] Laish [[H3919]] at the first. [[H7223]]

### 30
And the children [[H1121]] of Dan [[H1835]] set up [[H6965]] the graven image: [[H6459]] and Jonathan, [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Gershom, [[H1647]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] he [[H1931]] and his sons [[H1121]] were [[H1961]] priests [[H3548]] to the tribe [[H7626]] of Dan [[H1839]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of the captivity [[H1540]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 31
And they set them up [[H7760]] Micah's [[H4318]] graven image, [[H6459]] which [[H834]] he made, [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the time [[H3117]] that the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] in Shiloh. [[H7887]]
