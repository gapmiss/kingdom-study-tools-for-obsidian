### 1
Then all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went out, [[H3318]] and the congregation [[H5712]] was gathered together [[H6950]] as one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] from Dan [[H1835]] even to [[H5704]] Beer-sheba, [[H884]] with the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] in Mizpeh. [[H4709]]

### 2
And the chief [[H6438]] of all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] of all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] presented themselves [[H3320]] in the assembly [[H6951]] of the people [[H5971]] of God, [[H430]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] footmen [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] sword. [[H2719]]

### 3
(Now the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were gone up [[H5927]] to Mizpeh.) [[H4709]] Then said [[H559]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Tell [[H1696]] how [[H349]] was [[H1961]] this [[H2063]] wickedness? [[H7451]]

### 4
And the Levite, [[H3881]] the husband [[H376]] of the woman [[H802]] that was slain, [[H7523]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] I came [[H935]] into Gibeah [[H1390]] that [[H834]] to Benjamin, [[H1144]] I [[H589]] and my concubine, [[H6370]] to lodge. [[H3885]]

### 5
And the men [[H1167]] of Gibeah [[H1390]] rose [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] me, and beset [[H5437]] the house [[H1004]]  round about [[H853]] upon [[H5921]] me by night, [[H3915]] thought [[H1819]] to have slain [[H2026]] me: and my concubine [[H6370]] have they forced, [[H6031]] that she is dead. [[H4191]]

### 6
And I took [[H270]] my concubine, [[H6370]] and cut her in pieces, [[H5408]] and sent [[H7971]] her throughout all [[H3605]] the country [[H7704]] of the inheritance [[H5159]] of Israel: [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] they have committed [[H6213]] lewdness [[H2154]] and folly [[H5039]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2009]] ye all [[H3605]] children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] give [[H3051]] here [[H1988]] your advice [[H1697]] and counsel. [[H6098]]

### 8
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] arose [[H6965]] as one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] saying, [[H559]] We will not [[H3808]] any [[H376]] go [[H1980]] to his tent, [[H168]] neither [[H3808]] will we any [[H376]] turn [[H5493]] into his house. [[H1004]]

### 9
But now [[H6258]] this [[H2088]] the thing [[H1697]] which [[H834]] we will do [[H6213]] to Gibeah; [[H1390]] by lot [[H1486]] against [[H5921]] it; [[H5921]]

### 10
And we will take [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] of an hundred [[H3967]] throughout all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and an hundred [[H3967]] of a thousand, [[H505]] and a thousand [[H505]] out of ten thousand, [[H7233]] to fetch [[H3947]] victual [[H6720]] for the people, [[H5971]] that they may do, [[H6213]] when they come [[H935]] to Gibeah [[H1387]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] according to all [[H3605]] the folly [[H5039]] that [[H834]] they have wrought [[H6213]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
So all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] were gathered [[H622]] against [[H413]] the city, [[H5892]] knit together [[H2270]] as one [[H259]] man. [[H376]]

### 12
And the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] men [[H582]] through all [[H3605]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] wickedness [[H7451]] this [[H2063]] that [[H834]] is done [[H1961]] among you? [[H1961]]

### 13
Now [[H6258]] therefore deliver [[H5414]] the men, [[H376]] the children [[H1121]] of Belial, [[H1100]] which [[H834]] in Gibeah, [[H1390]] that we may put them to death, [[H4191]] and put away [[H1197]] evil [[H7451]] from Israel. [[H3478]] But the children of Benjamin [[H1144]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of their brethren [[H251]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 14
But the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] gathered themselves together [[H622]] out of [[H4480]] the cities [[H5892]] unto Gibeah, [[H1390]] to go out [[H3318]] to battle [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
And the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] were numbered [[H6485]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] out of the cities [[H5892]] twenty [[H6242]] and six [[H8337]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] sword, [[H2719]] beside [[H905]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Gibeah, [[H1390]] which were numbered [[H6485]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] chosen [[H970]] men. [[H376]]

### 16
Among all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] chosen [[H977]] men [[H376]] lefthanded; [[H3027]] every one [[H3605]] could sling [[H7049]] stones [[H68]] at [[H413]] an hair [[H8185]] and not [[H3808]] miss. [[H2398]]

### 17
And the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] beside [[H905]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] were numbered [[H6485]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] sword: [[H2719]] all [[H3605]] these [[H2088]] men [[H376]] of war. [[H4421]]

### 18
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] arose, [[H6965]] and went up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H1008]] and asked counsel [[H7592]] of God, [[H430]] and said, [[H559]] Which [[H4310]] of us shall go up [[H5927]] first [[H8462]] to the battle [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin? [[H1144]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Judah [[H3063]] first. [[H8462]]

### 19
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] rose up [[H6965]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and encamped [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 20
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] went out [[H3318]] to battle [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] Benjamin; [[H1144]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] put themselves in array [[H6186]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H853]] them at [[H413]] Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 21
And the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] came forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] Gibeah, [[H1390]] and destroyed down [[H7843]] to the ground [[H776]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] twenty [[H6242]] and two [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 22
And the people [[H5971]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] encouraged themselves, [[H2388]] and set [[H6186]] their battle [[H4421]] again [[H3254]] in array in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] they put themselves in array [[H6186]] the first [[H7223]] day. [[H3117]]

### 23
(And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went up [[H5927]] and wept [[H1058]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] even, [[H6153]] and asked counsel [[H7592]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Shall I go up [[H5066]] again [[H3254]] to battle [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] my brother? [[H251]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Go up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] him.) [[H413]]

### 24
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] came near [[H7126]] against [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] the second [[H8145]] day. [[H3117]]

### 25
And Benjamin [[H1144]] went forth [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] them out of [[H4480]] Gibeah [[H1390]] the second [[H8145]] day, [[H3117]] and destroyed down [[H7843]] to the ground [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] again [[H5750]] eighteen [[H8083]] thousand [[H505]] men; [[H376]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] drew [[H8025]] the sword. [[H2719]]

### 26
Then all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] went up, [[H5927]] and came [[H935]] unto the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H1008]] and wept, [[H1058]] and sat [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and fasted [[H6684]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] even, [[H6153]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 27
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] inquired [[H7592]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] (for the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of God [[H430]] there [[H8033]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]]

### 28
And Phinehas, [[H6372]] the son [[H1121]] of Eleazar, [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] it in those [[H1992]] days,) [[H3117]] saying, [[H559]] Shall I yet [[H5750]] again [[H3254]] go out [[H3318]] to battle [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] my brother, [[H251]] or [[H518]] shall I cease? [[H2308]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Go up; [[H5927]] for [[H3588]] to morrow [[H4279]] I will deliver [[H5414]] them into thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 29
And Israel [[H3478]] set [[H7760]] liers in wait [[H693]] round about [[H5439]] Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 30
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] and put themselves in array [[H6186]] against [[H413]] Gibeah, [[H1390]] as at other times. [[H6471]]

### 31
And the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] went out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] the people, [[H5971]] were drawn away [[H5423]] from [[H4480]] the city; [[H5892]] and they began [[H2490]] to smite [[H5221]] of the people, [[H5971]] kill, [[H2491]] as at other times, [[H6471]] in the highways, [[H4546]] of which [[H834]] one [[H259]] goeth up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H1008]] and the other [[H259]] to Gibeah [[H1390]] in the field, [[H7704]] about thirty [[H7970]] men [[H376]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 32
And the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] said, [[H559]] They [[H1992]] smitten down [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] us, as at the first. [[H7223]] But the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] Let us flee, [[H5127]] and draw [[H5423]] them from [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] unto [[H413]] the highways. [[H4546]]

### 33
And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] rose up [[H6965]] out of their place, [[H4725]] and put themselves in array [[H6186]] at Baal-tamar: [[H1193]] and the liers in wait [[H693]] of Israel [[H3478]] came forth [[H1518]] out of their places, [[H4725]] out of the meadows [[H4629]] of Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 34
And there came [[H935]] against [[H5048]] Gibeah [[H1390]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] chosen [[H977]] men [[H376]] out of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and the battle [[H4421]] was sore: [[H3513]] but they [[H1992]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] near [[H5060]] them. [[H5060]]

### 35
And the Lord [[H3068]] smote [[H5062]] Benjamin [[H1144]] before [[H6440]] Israel: [[H3478]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] destroyed [[H7843]] of the Benjamites [[H1144]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] and an hundred [[H3967]] men: [[H376]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] drew [[H8025]] the sword. [[H2719]]

### 36
So the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they were smitten: [[H5062]] for the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] gave [[H5414]] place [[H4725]] to the Benjamites, [[H1144]] because [[H3588]] they trusted [[H982]] unto [[H413]] the liers in wait [[H693]] which [[H834]] they had set [[H7760]] beside [[H413]] Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 37
And the liers in wait [[H693]] hasted, [[H2363]] and rushed [[H6584]] upon [[H413]] Gibeah; [[H1390]] and the liers in wait [[H693]] drew along, [[H4900]] and smote [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the city [[H5892]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 38
Now there was [[H1961]] an appointed sign [[H4150]] between the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] and [[H5973]] the liers in wait, [[H693]] that they should make a great [[H7235]] flame [[H4864]] with smoke [[H6227]] rise up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 39
And when the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] retired [[H2015]] in the battle, [[H4421]] Benjamin [[H1144]] began [[H2490]] to smite [[H5221]] kill [[H2491]] of the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] about thirty [[H7970]] persons: [[H376]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] Surely [[H5062]] they [[H1931]] are smitten down [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] us, as the first [[H7223]] battle. [[H4421]]

### 40
But when the flame [[H4864]] began [[H2490]] to arise up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] with a pillar [[H5982]] of smoke, [[H6227]] the Benjamites [[H1144]] looked [[H6437]] behind [[H310]] them, and, behold, [[H2009]] the flame [[H3632]] of the city [[H5892]] ascended up [[H5927]] to heaven. [[H8064]]

### 41
And when the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] turned again, [[H2015]] the men [[H376]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] were amazed: [[H926]] for [[H3588]] they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] was come [[H5060]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 42
Therefore they turned [[H6437]] before [[H6440]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] the way [[H1870]] of the wilderness; [[H4057]] but the battle [[H4421]] overtook [[H1692]] them; and them which [[H834]] out of the cities [[H5892]] they destroyed [[H7843]] in the midst [[H8432]] of them. [[H8432]]

### 43
they inclosed round about, [[H3803]] the Benjamites [[H1144]] chased [[H7291]] them, trode them down [[H1869]] with ease [[H4496]] over against [[H5227]] Gibeah [[H1390]] toward the sunrising. [[H4217]]

### 44
And there fell [[H5307]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] eighteen [[H8083]] thousand [[H505]] men; [[H376]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] of valour. [[H2428]]

### 45
And they turned [[H6437]] and fled [[H5127]] toward the wilderness [[H4057]] unto [[H413]] the rock [[H5553]] of Rimmon: [[H7417]] and they gleaned [[H5953]] of them in the highways [[H4546]] five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] men; [[H376]] and pursued hard [[H1692]] after [[H310]] them unto [[H5704]] Gidom, [[H1440]] and slew [[H5221]] two thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of [[H4480]] them. [[H4480]]

### 46
So that all [[H3605]] which fell [[H5307]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] were [[H1961]] twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] the sword; [[H2719]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] of valour. [[H2428]]

### 47
But six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] turned [[H6437]] and fled [[H5127]] to the wilderness [[H4057]] unto [[H413]] the rock [[H5553]] Rimmon, [[H7417]] and abode [[H3427]] in the rock [[H5553]] Rimmon [[H7417]] four [[H702]] months. [[H2320]]

### 48
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] turned again [[H7725]] upon [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and smote [[H5221]] them with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] as well the men [[H4974]] of city, [[H5892]] as [[H5704]] the beast, [[H929]] and all [[H3605]] that came to hand: [[H4672]] also [[H1571]] they set [[H7971]] on fire [[H784]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] that they came to. [[H4672]]
