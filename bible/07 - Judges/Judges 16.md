### 1
Then went [[H1980]] Samson [[H8123]] to Gaza, [[H5804]] and saw [[H7200]] there [[H8033]] an harlot, [[H802]] and went in [[H935]] unto [[H413]] her. [[H413]]

### 2
the Gazites, [[H5841]] saying, [[H559]] Samson [[H8123]] is come [[H935]] hither. [[H2008]] And they compassed in, [[H5437]] and laid wait [[H693]] for him all [[H3605]] night [[H3915]] in the gate [[H8179]] of the city, [[H5892]] and were quiet [[H2790]] all [[H3605]] the night, [[H3915]] saying, [[H559]] In the morning, [[H1242]] when [[H5704]] it is day, [[H216]] we shall kill [[H2026]] him. [[H2026]]

### 3
And Samson [[H8123]] lay [[H7901]] till [[H5704]] midnight, [[H2677]] and arose [[H6965]] at midnight, [[H2677]] and took [[H270]] the doors [[H1817]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the city, [[H5892]] and the two [[H8147]] posts, [[H4201]] and went away [[H5265]] with them, bar [[H1280]] and all, [[H5973]] and put [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] his shoulders, [[H3802]] and carried them up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of an hill [[H2022]] that [[H834]] before [[H6440]] Hebron. [[H2275]]

### 4
And it came to pass [[H1961]] afterward, [[H310]] that he loved [[H157]] a woman [[H802]] in the valley [[H5158]] of Sorek, [[H7796]] whose name [[H8034]] Delilah. [[H1807]]

### 5
And the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] came up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] her, and said [[H559]] unto her, Entice [[H6601]] him, and see [[H7200]] wherein [[H4100]] his great [[H1419]] strength [[H3581]] and by what [[H4100]] we may prevail [[H3201]] against him, that we may bind [[H631]] him to afflict [[H6031]] him: and we [[H587]] will give [[H5414]] thee every one [[H376]] of us eleven hundred [[H505]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 6
And Delilah [[H1807]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samson, [[H8123]] Tell [[H5046]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] wherein [[H4100]] thy great [[H1419]] strength [[H3581]] and wherewith [[H4100]] thou mightest be bound [[H631]] to afflict [[H6031]] thee. [[H6031]]

### 7
And Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, If [[H518]] they bind [[H631]] me with seven [[H7651]] green [[H3892]] withs [[H3499]] that [[H834]] were never [[H3808]] dried, [[H2717]] then shall I be weak, [[H2470]] and be [[H1961]] as another [[H259]] man. [[H120]]

### 8
Then the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] brought up [[H5927]] to her seven [[H7651]] green [[H3892]] withs [[H3499]] which [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] been dried, [[H2717]] and she bound [[H631]] him with them. [[H631]]

### 9
Now men lying in wait, [[H693]] abiding [[H3427]] with her in the chamber. [[H2315]] And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The Philistines [[H6430]] upon [[H5921]] thee, Samson. [[H8123]] And he brake [[H5423]] the withs, [[H3499]] as [[H834]] a thread [[H6616]] of tow [[H5296]] is broken [[H5423]] when it toucheth [[H7306]] the fire. [[H784]] So his strength [[H3581]] was not [[H3808]] known. [[H3045]]

### 10
And Delilah [[H1807]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samson, [[H8123]] Behold, [[H2009]] thou hast mocked [[H2048]] me, and told [[H1696]]  me [[H413]] lies: [[H3577]] now [[H6258]] tell me, [[H5046]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] wherewith [[H4100]] thou mightest be bound. [[H631]]

### 11
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, If [[H518]] they bind [[H631]] me fast [[H631]] with new [[H2319]] ropes [[H5688]] that [[H834]] never [[H3808]] were occupied, [[H4399]] then shall I be weak, [[H2470]] and be [[H1961]] as another [[H259]] man. [[H120]]

### 12
Delilah [[H1807]] therefore took [[H3947]] new [[H2319]] ropes, [[H5688]] and bound [[H631]] him therewith, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The Philistines [[H6430]] upon [[H5921]] thee, Samson. [[H8123]] And liers in wait [[H693]] abiding [[H3427]] in the chamber. [[H2315]] And he brake [[H5423]] them from off [[H5921]] his arms [[H2220]] like a thread. [[H2339]]

### 13
And Delilah [[H1807]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Samson, [[H8123]] Hitherto [[H2008]] thou hast mocked [[H2048]] me, and told [[H1696]] me lies: [[H3576]] tell [[H5046]] me wherewith [[H4100]] thou mightest be bound. [[H631]] And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, If [[H518]] thou weavest [[H707]] the seven [[H7651]] locks [[H4253]] of my head [[H7218]] with [[H5973]] the web. [[H4545]]

### 14
And she fastened [[H8628]] with the pin, [[H3489]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The Philistines [[H6430]] upon [[H5921]] thee, Samson. [[H8123]] And he awaked [[H3364]] out of his sleep, [[H8142]] and went away [[H5265]] with the pin [[H3489]] of the beam, [[H708]] and with the web. [[H4545]]

### 15
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, How [[H349]] canst thou say, [[H559]] I love [[H157]] thee, when thine heart [[H3820]] not [[H369]] with [[H854]] me? thou hast mocked [[H2048]] me these three [[H7969]] times, [[H6471]] and hast not [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] me wherein [[H4100]] thy great [[H1419]] strength [[H3581]]

### 16
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] she pressed [[H6693]] him daily [[H3117]] with her words, [[H1697]] and urged [[H509]] him, that his soul [[H5315]] was vexed [[H7114]] unto death; [[H4191]]

### 17
That he told [[H5046]]  her [[H853]] all [[H3605]] his heart, [[H3820]] and said [[H559]] unto her, There hath not [[H3808]] come [[H5927]] a razor [[H4177]] upon [[H5921]] mine head; [[H7218]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] a Nazarite [[H5139]] unto God [[H430]] from my mother's [[H517]] womb: [[H990]] if [[H518]] I be shaven, [[H1548]] then my strength [[H3581]] will go [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] me, and I shall become weak, [[H2470]] and be [[H1961]] like any [[H3605]] man. [[H120]]

### 18
And when Delilah [[H1807]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he had told [[H5046]]  her [[H853]] all [[H3605]] his heart, [[H3820]] she sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] for the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] saying, [[H559]] Come up [[H5927]] this once, [[H6471]] for [[H3588]] he hath shewed [[H5046]]  me [[H853]] all [[H3605]] his heart. [[H3820]] Then the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] came up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] her, and brought [[H5927]] money [[H3701]] in their hand. [[H3027]]

### 19
And she made him sleep [[H3462]] upon [[H5921]] her knees; [[H1290]] and she called [[H7121]] for a man, [[H376]] and she caused him to shave off [[H1548]] the seven [[H7651]] locks [[H4253]] of his head; [[H7218]] and she began [[H2490]] to afflict [[H6031]] him, and his strength [[H3581]] went [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 20
And she said, [[H559]] The Philistines [[H6430]] upon [[H5921]] thee, Samson. [[H8123]] And he awoke [[H3364]] out of his sleep, [[H8142]] and said, [[H559]] I will go out [[H3318]] as at other times before, [[H6471]] and shake myself. [[H5287]] And he [[H1931]] wist [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] was departed [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 21
But the Philistines [[H6430]] took [[H270]] him, and put out [[H5365]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and brought him down [[H3381]] to Gaza, [[H5804]] and bound [[H631]] him with fetters of brass; [[H5178]] and he did [[H1961]] grind [[H2912]] in the prison [[H615]] house. [[H1004]]

### 22
Howbeit the hair [[H8181]] of his head [[H7218]] began [[H2490]] to grow again [[H6779]] after [[H834]] he was shaven. [[H1548]]

### 23
Then the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered them together [[H622]] for to offer [[H2076]] a great [[H1419]] sacrifice [[H2077]] unto Dagon [[H1712]] their god, [[H430]] and to rejoice: [[H8057]] for they said, [[H559]] Our god [[H430]] hath delivered [[H5414]] Samson [[H8123]] our enemy [[H341]] into our hand. [[H3027]]

### 24
And when the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] him, they praised [[H1984]] their god: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] Our god [[H430]] hath delivered [[H5414]] into our hands [[H3027]] our enemy, [[H341]] and the destroyer [[H2717]] of our country, [[H776]] which [[H834]] slew [[H2491]] many [[H7235]] of us. [[H853]]

### 25
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] their hearts [[H3820]] were merry, [[H2896]] that they said, [[H559]] Call [[H7121]] for Samson, [[H8123]] that he may make us sport. [[H7832]] And they called [[H7121]] for Samson [[H8123]] out of the prison [[H631]] house; [[H1004]] and he made them [[H6440]] sport: [[H6711]] and they set [[H5975]] him between [[H996]] the pillars. [[H5982]]

### 26
And Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the lad [[H5288]] that held [[H2388]] him by the hand, [[H3027]] Suffer [[H3240]] me [[H853]] that I may feel [[H4184]] the pillars [[H5982]] whereupon [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] standeth, [[H3559]] that I may lean [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 27
Now the house [[H1004]] was full [[H4390]] of men [[H582]] and women; [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] the lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] there; [[H8033]] and upon [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] about three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] and women, [[H802]] that beheld [[H7200]] while Samson [[H8123]] made sport. [[H7832]]

### 28
And Samson [[H8123]] called [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] remember [[H2142]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] and strengthen [[H2388]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] only [[H389]] this [[H2088]] once, [[H6471]] O God, [[H430]] that I may be at once [[H259]] avenged [[H5358]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] for my two [[H8147]] eyes. [[H5869]]

### 29
And Samson [[H8123]] took hold [[H3943]]  of [[H853]] the two [[H8147]] middle [[H8432]] pillars [[H5982]] upon [[H5921]] which [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] stood, [[H3559]] and on [[H5921]] which it was borne up, [[H5564]] of the one [[H259]] with his right hand, [[H3225]] and of the other [[H259]] with his left. [[H8040]]

### 30
And Samson [[H8123]] said, [[H559]] Let me [[H5315]] die [[H4191]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines. [[H6430]] And he bowed [[H5186]] himself with might; [[H3581]] and the house [[H1004]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] the lords, [[H5633]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] therein. So the dead [[H4191]] which [[H834]] he slew [[H4191]] at his death [[H4194]] were [[H1961]] more [[H7227]] than which [[H834]] he slew [[H4191]] in his life. [[H2416]]

### 31
Then his brethren [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of his father [[H1]] came down, [[H3381]] and took [[H5375]] him, and brought up, [[H5927]] and buried [[H6912]] him between [[H996]] Zorah [[H6881]] and Eshtaol [[H847]] in the buryingplace [[H6913]] of Manoah [[H4495]] his father. [[H1]] And he [[H1931]] judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] twenty [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]]
