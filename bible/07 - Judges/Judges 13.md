### 1
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] again [[H3254]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And there was [[H1961]] a certain [[H259]] man [[H376]] of Zorah, [[H6881]] of the family [[H4940]] of the Danites, [[H1839]] whose name [[H8034]] Manoah; [[H4495]] and his wife [[H802]] barren, [[H6135]] and bare [[H3205]] not. [[H3808]]

### 3
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] the woman, [[H802]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] thou [[H859]] barren, [[H6135]] and bearest [[H3205]] not: [[H3808]] but thou shalt conceive, [[H2029]] and bear [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 4
Now [[H6258]] therefore beware, [[H8104]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and drink [[H8354]] not [[H408]] wine [[H3196]] nor strong drink, [[H7941]] and eat [[H398]] not [[H408]] any [[H3605]] unclean [[H2931]]

### 5
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] thou shalt conceive, [[H2029]] and bear [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and no [[H3808]] razor [[H4177]] shall come [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] his head: [[H7218]] for [[H3588]] the child [[H5288]] shall be [[H1961]] a Nazarite [[H5139]] unto God [[H430]] from [[H4480]] the womb: [[H990]] and he [[H1931]] shall begin [[H2490]] to deliver [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 6
Then the woman [[H802]] came [[H935]] and told [[H559]] her husband, [[H376]] saying, [[H559]] A man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me, and his countenance [[H4758]] like the countenance [[H4758]] of an angel [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] very [[H3966]] terrible: [[H3372]] but I asked [[H7592]] him not [[H3808]] whence [[H335]] he [[H1931]] neither [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] he me his name: [[H8034]]

### 7
But he said [[H559]] unto me, Behold, [[H2009]] thou shalt conceive, [[H2029]] and bear [[H3205]] a son; [[H1121]] and now [[H6258]] drink [[H7941]] no [[H408]] wine [[H3196]] nor strong drink, [[H8354]] neither [[H408]] eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] unclean [[H2932]] for [[H3588]] the child [[H5288]] shall be [[H1961]] a Nazarite [[H5139]] to God [[H430]] from [[H4480]] the womb [[H990]] to [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of his death. [[H4194]]

### 8
Then Manoah [[H4495]] intreated [[H6279]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] O [[H994]] my Lord, [[H136]] let [[H4994]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] which [[H834]] thou didst send [[H7971]] come again [[H935]] unto [[H413]] us, and teach [[H3384]] us what [[H4100]] we shall do [[H6213]] unto the child [[H5288]] that shall be born. [[H3205]]

### 9
And God [[H430]] hearkened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of Manoah; [[H4495]] and the angel [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] came again [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] as she [[H1931]] sat [[H3427]] in the field: [[H7704]] but Manoah [[H4495]] her husband [[H376]] not [[H369]] with [[H5973]] her. [[H5973]]

### 10
And the woman [[H802]] made haste, [[H4116]] and ran, [[H7323]] and shewed [[H5046]] her husband, [[H376]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Behold, [[H2009]] the man [[H376]] hath appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] me, that [[H834]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me the day. [[H3117]]

### 11
And Manoah [[H4495]] arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] his wife, [[H802]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the man, [[H376]] and said [[H559]] unto him, thou [[H859]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] spakest [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the woman? [[H802]] And he said, [[H559]] I [[H589]]

### 12
And Manoah [[H4495]] said, [[H559]] Now [[H6258]] let thy words [[H1697]] come to pass. [[H935]] How [[H4100]] shall we order [[H4941]] the child, [[H5288]] and shall we do [[H4639]] unto him? [[H4639]]

### 13
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Manoah, [[H4495]] Of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] let her beware. [[H8104]]

### 14
She may not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of any [[H3605]] that [[H834]] cometh [[H3318]] of the vine, [[H1612]] neither [[H408]] let her drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] or strong drink, [[H7941]] nor [[H408]] eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] unclean [[H2932]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] her let her observe. [[H8104]]

### 15
And Manoah [[H4495]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] let us detain [[H6113]] thee, until we shall have made ready [[H6213]] a kid [[H1423]] for [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 16
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Manoah, [[H4495]] Though [[H518]] thou detain [[H6113]] me, I will not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of thy bread: [[H3899]] and if [[H518]] thou wilt offer [[H6213]] a burnt offering, [[H5930]] thou must offer [[H5927]] it unto the Lord. [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] Manoah [[H4495]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] an angel [[H4397]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
And Manoah [[H4495]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] What [[H4310]] thy name, [[H8034]] that when [[H3588]] thy sayings [[H1697]] come to pass [[H935]] we may do thee honour? [[H3513]]

### 18
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto him, Why [[H4100]] askest [[H7592]] thou thus [[H2088]] after my name, [[H8034]] seeing it [[H1931]] secret? [[H6383]]

### 19
So Manoah [[H4495]] took [[H3947]] a kid [[H1423]] with [[H853]] a meat offering, [[H4503]] and offered [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] a rock [[H6697]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] and did [[H6213]] wondrously; [[H6381]] and Manoah [[H4495]] and his wife [[H802]] looked on. [[H7200]]

### 20
For it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the flame [[H3851]] went up [[H5927]] toward heaven [[H8064]] from off [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] that the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] ascended [[H5927]] in the flame [[H3851]] of the altar. [[H4196]] And Manoah [[H4495]] and his wife [[H802]] looked on [[H7200]] and fell on [[H5307]] their faces [[H6440]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 21
But the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] did no [[H3808]] more [[H3254]] appear [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Manoah [[H4495]] and to [[H413]] his wife. [[H802]] Then [[H227]] Manoah [[H4495]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] an angel [[H4397]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
And Manoah [[H4495]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his wife, [[H802]] We shall surely [[H4191]] die, [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] we have seen [[H7200]] God. [[H430]]

### 23
But his wife [[H802]] said [[H559]] unto him, If [[H3863]] the Lord [[H3068]] were pleased [[H2654]] to kill [[H4191]] us, he would not [[H3808]] have received [[H3947]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] and a meat offering [[H4503]] at our hands, [[H3027]] neither [[H3808]] would he have shewed [[H7200]]  us [[H853]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] nor [[H3808]] would as at this time [[H6256]] have told [[H8085]] us as these. [[H2063]]

### 24
And the woman [[H802]] bare [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and called [[H7121]] his name [[H8034]] Samson: [[H8123]] and the child [[H5288]] grew, [[H1431]] and the Lord [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] him. [[H1288]]

### 25
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] began [[H2490]] to move times [[H6470]] him at in the camp [[H4264]] of Dan [[H1835]] between [[H996]] Zorah [[H6881]] and Eshtaol. [[H847]]
