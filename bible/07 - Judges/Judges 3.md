### 1
Now these [[H428]] the nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] left, [[H3240]] to prove [[H5254]] Israel [[H3478]]  by them, [[H853]] as many [[H3605]] as had not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] the wars [[H4421]] of Canaan; [[H3667]]

### 2
Only [[H7535]] that [[H4616]] the generations [[H1755]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] might know, [[H3045]] to teach [[H3925]] them war, [[H4421]] at the least [[H7535]] such as [[H834]] before [[H6440]] knew [[H3045]] nothing [[H3808]] thereof; [[H3808]]

### 3
five [[H2568]] lords [[H5633]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and all [[H3605]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] and the Sidonians, [[H6722]] and the Hivites [[H2340]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in mount [[H2022]] Lebanon, [[H3844]] from mount [[H2022]] Baal-hermon [[H1179]] unto [[H5704]] the entering in [[H935]] of Hamath. [[H2574]]

### 4
And they were [[H1961]] to prove [[H5254]] Israel [[H3478]] by them, to know [[H3045]] whether they would hearken [[H8085]]  unto [[H853]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] their fathers [[H1]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]

### 5
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] dwelt [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] and Amorites, [[H567]] and Perizzites, [[H6522]] and Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites: [[H2983]]

### 6
And they took [[H3947]] their daughters [[H1323]] to be their wives, [[H802]] and gave [[H5414]] their daughters [[H1323]] to their sons, [[H1121]] and served [[H5647]] their gods. [[H430]]

### 7
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and forgat [[H7911]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and served [[H5647]] Baalim [[H1168]] and the groves. [[H842]]

### 8
Therefore the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was hot [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and he sold [[H4376]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Chushan-rishathaim [[H3573]] king [[H4428]] of Mesopotamia: [[H763]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] served [[H5647]] Chushan-rishathaim [[H3573]] eight [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]]

### 9
And when the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the Lord [[H3068]] raised up [[H6965]] a deliverer [[H3467]] to the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who delivered [[H3467]]  them, [[H853]] Othniel [[H6274]] the son [[H1121]] of Kenaz, [[H7073]] Caleb's [[H3612]] younger [[H6996]] brother. [[H251]]

### 10
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he judged [[H8199]] Israel, [[H3478]] and went out [[H3318]] to war: [[H4421]] and the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] Chushan-rishathaim [[H3573]] king [[H4428]] of Mesopotamia [[H763]] into his hand; [[H3027]] and his hand [[H3027]] prevailed [[H5810]] against [[H5921]] Chushan-rishathaim. [[H3573]]

### 11
And the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] And Othniel [[H6274]] the son [[H1121]] of Kenaz [[H7073]] died. [[H4191]]

### 12
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] again [[H3254]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] strengthened [[H2388]] Eglon [[H5700]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] against [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H5921]] they had done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And he gathered [[H622]] unto [[H413]]  him [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] and Amalek, [[H6002]] and went [[H1980]] and smote [[H5221]] Israel, [[H3478]] and possessed [[H3423]] the city [[H5892]] of palm trees. [[H8558]]

### 14
So the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] served [[H5647]] Eglon [[H5700]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] eighteen [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]]

### 15
But when the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the Lord [[H3068]] raised them up [[H6965]] a deliverer, [[H3467]] Ehud [[H164]] the son [[H1121]] of Gera, [[H1617]] a Benjamite, [[H1145]] a man [[H376]] lefthanded: [[H334]] and by him [[H3027]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] a present [[H4503]] unto Eglon [[H5700]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 16
But Ehud [[H164]] made [[H6213]] him a dagger [[H2719]] which had two [[H8147]] edges, [[H6366]] of a cubit [[H1574]] length; [[H753]] and he did gird [[H2296]] it under [[H8478]] his raiment [[H4055]] upon [[H5921]] his right [[H3225]] thigh. [[H3409]]

### 17
And he brought [[H7126]] the present [[H4503]] unto Eglon [[H5700]] king [[H4428]] of Moab: [[H4124]] and Eglon [[H5700]] a very [[H3966]] fat [[H1277]] man. [[H376]]

### 18
And when [[H834]] he had made an end [[H3615]] to offer [[H7126]] the present, [[H4503]] he sent away [[H7971]] the people [[H5971]] that bare [[H5375]] the present. [[H4503]]

### 19
But he [[H1931]] himself turned again [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] the quarries [[H6456]] that [[H834]] by [[H854]] Gilgal, [[H1537]] and said, [[H559]] I have a secret [[H5643]] errand [[H1697]] unto thee, O king: [[H4428]] who said, [[H559]] Keep silence. [[H2013]] And all [[H3605]] that stood [[H5975]] by him went out [[H3318]] from [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 20
And Ehud [[H164]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] him; and he [[H1931]] was sitting [[H3427]] in a summer [[H4747]] parlour, [[H5944]] which [[H834]] he had for himself alone. [[H905]] And Ehud [[H164]] said, [[H559]] I have a message [[H1697]] from God [[H430]] unto [[H413]] thee. And he arose [[H6965]] out of [[H5921]] seat. [[H3678]]

### 21
And Ehud [[H164]] put forth [[H7971]] his left [[H8040]] hand, [[H3027]] and took [[H3947]] the dagger [[H2719]] from [[H5921]] his right [[H3225]] thigh, [[H3409]] and thrust [[H8628]] it into his belly: [[H990]]

### 22
And the haft [[H5325]] also [[H1571]] went in [[H935]] after [[H310]] the blade; [[H3851]] and the fat [[H2459]] closed [[H5462]] upon [[H1157]] the blade, [[H3851]] so that [[H3588]] he could not [[H3808]] draw [[H8025]] the dagger [[H2719]] out of his belly; [[H990]] and the dirt [[H6574]] came out. [[H3318]]

### 23
Then Ehud [[H164]] went forth [[H3318]] through the porch, [[H4528]] and shut [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] of the parlour [[H5944]] upon him, [[H1157]] and locked them. [[H5274]]

### 24
When he [[H1931]] was gone out, [[H3318]] his servants [[H5650]] came; [[H935]] and when they saw [[H7200]] that, behold, [[H2009]] the doors [[H1817]] of the parlour [[H5944]] locked, [[H5274]] they said, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] he [[H1931]] covereth [[H5526]] his feet [[H7272]] in his summer [[H4747]] chamber. [[H2315]]

### 25
And they tarried [[H2342]] till [[H5704]] they were ashamed: [[H954]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he opened [[H6605]] not [[H369]] the doors [[H1817]] of the parlour; [[H5944]] therefore they took [[H3947]] a key, [[H4668]] and opened [[H6605]] and, behold, [[H2009]] their lord [[H113]] fallen down [[H5307]] dead [[H4191]] on the earth. [[H776]]

### 26
And Ehud [[H164]] escaped [[H4422]] while [[H5704]] they tarried, [[H4102]] and passed beyond [[H5674]] the quarries, [[H6456]] and escaped [[H4422]] unto Seirath. [[H8167]]

### 27
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he was come, [[H935]] that he blew [[H8628]] a trumpet [[H7782]] in the mountain [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went down [[H3381]] with [[H5973]] him from [[H4480]] the mount, [[H2022]] and he [[H1931]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 28
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Follow [[H7291]] after [[H310]] me: for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] your enemies [[H341]] the Moabites [[H4124]] into your hand. [[H3027]] And they went down [[H3381]] after [[H310]] him, and took [[H3920]] the fords [[H4569]] of Jordan [[H3383]] toward Moab, [[H4124]] and suffered [[H5414]] not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] to pass over. [[H5674]]

### 29
And they slew [[H5221]]  of [[H853]] Moab [[H4124]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] about ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men, [[H376]] all [[H3605]] lusty, [[H8082]] and all [[H3605]] men [[H376]] of valour; [[H2428]] and there escaped [[H4422]] not [[H3808]] a man. [[H376]]

### 30
So Moab [[H4124]] was subdued [[H3665]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] fourscore [[H8084]] years. [[H8141]]

### 31
And after [[H310]] him was [[H1961]] Shamgar [[H8044]] the son [[H1121]] of Anath, [[H6067]] which slew [[H5221]]  of [[H853]] the Philistines [[H6430]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] with an ox [[H1241]] goad: [[H4451]] and he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] delivered [[H3467]] Israel.
