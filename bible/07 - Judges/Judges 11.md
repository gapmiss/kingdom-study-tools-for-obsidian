### 1
Now Jephthah [[H3316]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] was [[H1961]] a mighty man [[H1368]] of valour, [[H2428]] and he [[H1931]] the son [[H1121]] of an harlot: [[H802]] and Gilead [[H1568]] begat [[H3205]] Jephthah. [[H3316]]

### 2
And Gilead's [[H1568]] wife [[H802]] bare [[H3205]] him sons; [[H1121]] and his wife's [[H802]] sons [[H1121]] grew up, [[H1431]] and they thrust out [[H1644]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Thou shalt not [[H3808]] inherit [[H5157]] in our father's [[H1]] house; [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] the son [[H1121]] of a strange [[H312]] woman. [[H802]]

### 3
Then Jephthah [[H3316]] fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] his brethren, [[H251]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Tob: [[H2897]] and there were gathered [[H3950]] vain [[H7386]] men [[H582]] to [[H413]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] and went out [[H3318]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 4
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in process of time, [[H3117]] that the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] made war [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And it was [[H1961]] so, that when [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] made war [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel, [[H3478]] the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead [[H1568]] went [[H1980]] to fetch [[H3947]] Jephthah [[H3316]] out of the land [[H776]] of Tob: [[H2897]]

### 6
And they said [[H559]] unto Jephthah, [[H3316]] Come, [[H1980]] and be [[H1961]] our captain, [[H7101]] that we may fight [[H3898]] with the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 7
And Jephthah [[H3316]] said [[H559]] unto the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] Did not [[H3808]] ye [[H859]] hate [[H8130]] me, and expel [[H1644]] me out of my father's [[H1]] house? [[H1004]] and why [[H4069]] are ye come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me now [[H6258]] when [[H834]] ye are in distress? [[H6862]]

### 8
And the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead [[H1568]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] Therefore [[H3651]] we turn again [[H7725]] to [[H413]] thee now, [[H6258]] that thou mayest go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] us, and fight [[H3898]] against the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and be [[H1961]] our head [[H7218]] over all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 9
And Jephthah [[H3316]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] If [[H518]] ye [[H859]] bring me home again [[H7725]] to fight [[H3898]] against the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and the Lord [[H3068]] deliver [[H5414]] them before [[H6440]] me, shall I [[H595]] be [[H1961]] your head? [[H7218]]

### 10
And the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead [[H1568]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] The Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] witness [[H8085]] between [[H996]] us, if [[H518]] we do [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] so [[H3651]] according to thy words. [[H1697]]

### 11
Then Jephthah [[H3316]] went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] and the people [[H5971]] made [[H7760]] him head [[H7218]] and captain [[H7101]] over [[H5921]] them: and Jephthah [[H3316]] uttered [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] his words [[H1697]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] in Mizpeh. [[H4709]]

### 12
And Jephthah [[H3316]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] saying, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] hast thou to do with me, that [[H3588]] thou art come [[H935]] against [[H413]] me to fight [[H3898]] in my land? [[H776]]

### 13
And the king [[H4428]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] answered [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the messengers [[H4397]] of Jephthah, [[H3316]] Because [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] took away [[H3947]] my land, [[H776]] when they came up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] from Arnon [[H769]] even unto [[H5704]] Jabbok, [[H2999]] and unto [[H5704]] Jordan: [[H3383]] now [[H6258]] therefore restore those again [[H7725]] peaceably. [[H7965]]

### 14
And Jephthah [[H3316]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] again [[H3254]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon: [[H5983]]

### 15
And said [[H559]] unto him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] Israel [[H3478]] took not away [[H3947]] the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] nor the land [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon: [[H5983]]

### 16
But [[H3588]] when Israel [[H3478]] came up [[H5927]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] and walked [[H1980]] through the wilderness [[H4057]] unto [[H5704]] the Red [[H5488]] sea, [[H3220]] and came [[H935]] to Kadesh; [[H6946]]

### 17
Then Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Edom, [[H123]] saying, [[H559]] Let me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] pass through [[H5674]] thy land: [[H776]] but the king [[H4428]] of Edom [[H123]] would not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] And in like manner [[H1571]] they sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab: [[H4124]] but he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] and Israel [[H3478]] abode [[H3427]] in Kadesh. [[H6946]]

### 18
Then they went along [[H1980]] through the wilderness, [[H4057]] and compassed [[H5437]] the land [[H776]] of Edom, [[H123]] and the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and came [[H935]] by the east side [[H4217]] of the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and pitched [[H2583]] on the other side [[H5676]] of Arnon, [[H769]] but came [[H935]] not [[H3808]] within the border [[H1366]] of Moab: [[H4124]] for [[H3588]] Arnon [[H769]] the border [[H1366]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 19
And Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] the king [[H4428]] of Heshbon; [[H2809]] and Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto him, Let us pass, [[H5674]] we pray thee, [[H4994]] through thy land [[H776]] into [[H5704]] my place. [[H4725]]

### 20
But Sihon [[H5511]] trusted [[H539]] not [[H3808]] Israel [[H3478]] to pass [[H5674]] through his coast: [[H1366]] but Sihon [[H5511]] gathered together, [[H622]] all his people [[H5971]] and pitched [[H2583]] in Jahaz, [[H3096]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 21
And the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] delivered [[H5414]] Sihon [[H5511]] and all [[H3605]] his people [[H5971]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they smote [[H5221]] them: so Israel [[H3478]] possessed [[H3423]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of that [[H1931]] country. [[H776]]

### 22
And they possessed [[H3423]] all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] from Arnon [[H769]] even unto [[H5704]] Jabbok, [[H2999]] and from [[H4480]] the wilderness [[H4057]] even unto [[H5704]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 23
So now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] hath dispossessed [[H3423]] the Amorites [[H567]] from before [[H6440]] his people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and shouldest thou [[H859]] possess [[H3423]] it? [[H3423]]

### 24
Wilt not [[H3808]] thou possess [[H3423]] that which [[H834]] Chemosh [[H3645]] thy god [[H430]] giveth thee to possess? [[H3423]] So whomsoever [[H3605]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] shall drive out [[H3423]] from before [[H6440]] us, them will we possess. [[H3423]]

### 25
And now [[H6258]] thou [[H859]] any thing better [[H2896]] than Balak [[H1111]] the son [[H1121]] of Zippor, [[H6834]] king [[H4428]] of Moab? [[H4124]] did he ever [[H7378]] strive [[H7378]] against [[H5973]] Israel, [[H3478]] or [[H518]] did he ever [[H3898]] fight [[H3898]] against them, [[H3898]]

### 26
While Israel [[H3478]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Heshbon [[H2809]] and her towns, [[H1323]] and in Aroer [[H6177]] and her towns, [[H1323]] and in all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] along by [[H5921]] the coasts [[H3027]] of Arnon, [[H769]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] years? [[H8141]] why [[H4069]] therefore did ye not [[H3808]] recover [[H5337]] within that [[H1931]] time? [[H6256]]

### 27
Wherefore I [[H595]] have not [[H3808]] sinned [[H2398]] against thee, but thou [[H859]] doest [[H6213]] me wrong [[H7451]] to war [[H3898]] against me: the Lord [[H3068]] the Judge [[H8199]] be judge [[H8199]] this day [[H3117]] between [[H996]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 28
Howbeit the king [[H4428]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of Jephthah [[H3316]] which [[H834]] he sent [[H7971]] him. [[H413]]

### 29
Then the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] and he passed over [[H5674]] Gilead, [[H1568]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] and passed over [[H5674]] Mizpeh [[H4708]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] and from Mizpeh [[H4708]] of Gilead [[H1568]] he passed over [[H5674]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 30
And Jephthah [[H3316]] vowed [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou shalt without fail [[H5414]] deliver [[H5414]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] into mine hands, [[H3027]]

### 31
Then it shall be, [[H1961]] that whatsoever [[H3318]] cometh forth [[H3318]] of the doors [[H1817]] of my house [[H1004]] to meet [[H7125]] me, when I return [[H7725]] in peace [[H7965]] from the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] shall surely be [[H1961]] the Lord's, [[H3068]] and I will offer it up [[H5927]] for a burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 32
So Jephthah [[H3316]] passed over [[H5674]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] to fight [[H3898]] against them; and the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] them into his hands. [[H3027]]

### 33
And he smote [[H5221]] them from Aroer, [[H6177]] even till [[H5704]] thou come [[H935]] to Minnith, [[H4511]] twenty [[H6242]] cities, [[H5892]] and unto [[H5704]] the plain [[H58]] of the vineyards, [[H3754]] with a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] slaughter. [[H4347]] Thus the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] were subdued [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 34
And Jephthah [[H3316]] came [[H935]] to Mizpeh [[H4709]] unto [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] and, behold, [[H2009]] his daughter [[H1323]] came out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] him with timbrels [[H8596]] and with dances: [[H4246]] and she [[H1931]] only child; [[H3173]] beside [[H4480]] her he had neither [[H369]] son [[H1121]] nor [[H176]] daughter. [[H1323]]

### 35
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he saw [[H7200]] her, that he rent [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]] and said, [[H559]] Alas, [[H162]] my daughter! [[H1323]] thou hast brought very [[H3766]] me low, [[H3766]] and thou [[H859]] art [[H1961]] one of them that trouble [[H5916]] me: for I [[H595]] have opened [[H6475]] my mouth [[H6310]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and I cannot [[H3201]] go back. [[H7725]]

### 36
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, My father, [[H1]] thou hast opened [[H6475]] thy mouth [[H6310]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] to me according to that which [[H834]] hath proceeded out [[H3318]] of thy mouth; [[H6310]] forasmuch [[H310]] as the Lord [[H3068]] hath taken [[H6213]] vengeance [[H5360]] for thee of thine enemies, [[H341]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 37
And she said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her father, [[H1]] Let this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] be done [[H6213]] for me: let me alone [[H7503]] two [[H8147]] months, [[H2320]] that I may go up [[H1980]] and down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and bewail [[H1058]] my virginity, [[H1331]] I [[H595]] and my fellows. [[H7474]]

### 38
And he said, [[H559]] Go. [[H1980]] And he sent her away [[H7971]] two [[H8147]] months: [[H2320]] and she [[H1931]] went [[H1980]] with her companions, [[H7464]] and bewailed [[H1058]] her virginity [[H1331]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 39
And it came to pass [[H1961]] at the end [[H7093]] of two [[H8147]] months, [[H2320]] that she returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] her father, [[H1]] who did [[H6213]]  with her to [[H853]] his vow [[H5088]] which [[H834]] he had vowed: [[H5087]] and she [[H1931]] knew [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] man. [[H376]] And it was [[H1961]] a custom [[H2706]] in Israel, [[H3478]]

### 40
the daughters [[H1323]] of Israel [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] yearly [[H3117]] to lament [[H8567]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jephthah [[H3316]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] four [[H702]] days [[H3117]] in a year. [[H8141]]
