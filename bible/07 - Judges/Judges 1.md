### 1
Now after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Joshua [[H3091]] it came to pass, [[H1961]] that the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] asked [[H7592]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall go up [[H5927]] for us against [[H413]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] first, [[H8462]] to fight [[H3898]] against them? [[H3898]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] Judah [[H3063]] shall go up: [[H5927]] behold, [[H2009]] I have delivered [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] into his hand. [[H3027]]

### 3
And Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] unto Simeon [[H8095]] his brother, [[H251]] Come up [[H5927]] with [[H854]] me into my lot, [[H1486]] that we may fight [[H3898]] against the Canaanites; [[H3669]] and I [[H589]] likewise [[H1571]] will go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] thee into thy lot. [[H1486]] So Simeon [[H8095]] went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 4
And Judah [[H3063]] went up; [[H5927]] and the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] and the Perizzites [[H6522]] into their hand: [[H3027]] and they slew [[H5221]] of them in Bezek [[H966]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 5
And they found [[H4672]] Adoni-bezek [[H137]] in Bezek: [[H966]] and they fought [[H3898]] against him, and they slew [[H5221]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] and the Perizzites. [[H6522]]

### 6
But Adoni-bezek [[H137]] fled; [[H5127]] and they pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] him, and caught [[H270]] him, and cut off [[H7112]] his thumbs [[H931]] and his great toes. [[H7272]]

### 7
And Adoni-bezek [[H137]] said, [[H559]] Threescore and ten [[H7657]] kings, [[H4428]] having their thumbs [[H931]] and their great toes [[H7272]] cut off, [[H7112]] gathered [[H3950]] under [[H8478]] my table: [[H7979]] as [[H834]] I have done, [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] God [[H430]] hath requited [[H7999]] me. And they brought [[H935]] him to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and there [[H8033]] he died. [[H4191]]

### 8
Now the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] had fought [[H3898]] against Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and had taken [[H3920]] it, and smitten [[H5221]] it with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and set [[H7971]] the city [[H5892]] on fire. [[H784]]

### 9
And afterward [[H310]] the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] went down [[H3381]] to fight [[H3898]] against the Canaanites, [[H3669]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in the mountain, [[H2022]] and in the south, [[H5045]] and in the valley. [[H8219]]

### 10
And Judah [[H3063]] went [[H1980]] against [[H413]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in Hebron: [[H2275]] (now the name [[H8034]] of Hebron [[H2275]] before [[H6440]] Kirjath-arba:) [[H7153]] and they slew [[H5221]] Sheshai, [[H8344]] and Ahiman, [[H289]] and Talmai. [[H8526]]

### 11
And from thence [[H8033]] he went [[H1980]] against [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Debir: [[H1688]] and the name [[H8034]] of Debir [[H1688]] before [[H6440]] Kirjath-sepher: [[H7158]]

### 12
And Caleb [[H3612]] said, [[H559]] He that [[H834]] smiteth [[H5221]] Kirjath-sepher, [[H7158]] and taketh [[H3920]] it, to him will I give [[H5414]] Achsah [[H5915]] my daughter [[H1323]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 13
And Othniel [[H6274]] the son [[H1121]] of Kenaz, [[H7073]] Caleb's [[H3612]] younger [[H6996]] brother, [[H251]] took [[H3920]] it: and he gave [[H5414]]  him [[H853]] Achsah [[H5915]] his daughter [[H1323]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 14
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when she came [[H935]] that she moved [[H5496]] him to ask [[H7592]] of [[H853]] her father [[H1]] a field: [[H7704]] and she lighted [[H6795]] from off [[H5921]] ass; [[H2543]] and Caleb [[H3612]] said [[H559]] unto her, What [[H4100]] wilt thou? [[H4100]]

### 15
And she said [[H559]] unto him, Give [[H3051]] me a blessing: [[H1293]] for [[H3588]] thou hast given [[H5414]] me a south [[H5045]] land; [[H776]] give [[H5414]] me also springs [[H1543]] of water. [[H4325]] And Caleb [[H3612]] gave [[H5414]]  her [[H853]] the upper [[H5942]] springs [[H1543]] and the nether [[H8482]] springs. [[H1543]]

### 16
And the children [[H1121]] of the Kenite, [[H7017]] Moses' [[H4872]] father in law, [[H2859]] went up [[H5927]] out of the city [[H5892]] of palm trees [[H8558]] with [[H854]] the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which [[H834]] in the south [[H5045]] of Arad; [[H6166]] and they went [[H1980]] and dwelt [[H3427]] among [[H854]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 17
And Judah [[H3063]] went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Simeon [[H8095]] his brother, [[H251]] and they slew [[H5221]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] that inhabited [[H3427]] Zephath, [[H6857]] and utterly destroyed [[H2763]]  it. And [[H853]] the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] was called [[H7121]] Hormah. [[H2767]]

### 18
Also Judah [[H3063]] took [[H3920]] Gaza [[H5804]] with [[H853]] the coast [[H1366]] thereof, and Askelon [[H831]] with the coast [[H1366]] thereof, and Ekron [[H6138]] with the coast [[H1366]] thereof. [[H1366]]

### 19
And the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Judah; [[H3063]] and he drave out [[H3423]] the mountain; [[H2022]] but [[H3588]] could not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the valley, [[H6010]] because [[H3588]] they had chariots [[H7393]] of iron. [[H1270]]

### 20
And they gave [[H5414]] Hebron [[H2275]] unto Caleb, [[H3612]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] said: [[H1696]] and he expelled [[H3423]] thence [[H8033]] the three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] of Anak. [[H6061]]

### 21
And the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] did not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the Jebusites [[H2983]] that inhabited [[H3427]] Jerusalem; [[H3389]] but the Jebusites [[H2983]] dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 22
And the house [[H1004]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] went up [[H5927]] against Beth-el: [[H1008]] and the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] them. [[H5973]]

### 23
And the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] sent to descry [[H8446]] Beth-el. [[H1008]] (Now the name [[H8034]] of the city [[H5892]] before [[H6440]] Luz.) [[H3870]]

### 24
And the spies [[H8104]] saw [[H7200]] a man [[H376]] come forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] and they said [[H559]] unto him, Shew [[H7200]] us, we pray thee, [[H4994]] the entrance [[H3996]] into the city, [[H5892]] and we will shew [[H6213]] thee mercy. [[H2617]]

### 25
And when he shewed [[H7200]]  them [[H853]] the entrance [[H3996]] into the city, [[H5892]] they smote [[H5221]] the city [[H5892]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword; [[H2719]] but they let go [[H7971]] the man [[H376]] and all [[H3605]] his family. [[H4940]]

### 26
And the man [[H376]] went [[H1980]] into the land [[H776]] of the Hittites, [[H2850]] and built [[H1129]] a city, [[H5892]] and called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] thereof Luz: [[H3870]] which [[H1931]] the name [[H8034]] thereof unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 27
Neither [[H3808]] did Manasseh [[H4519]] drive out [[H3423]] Beth-shean [[H1052]] and her towns, [[H1323]] nor Taanach [[H8590]] and her towns, [[H1323]] nor the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Dor [[H1756]] and her towns, [[H1323]] nor the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Ibleam [[H2991]] and her towns, [[H1323]] nor the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Megiddo [[H4023]] and her towns: [[H1323]] but the Canaanites [[H3669]] would [[H2974]] dwell [[H3427]] in that [[H2063]] land. [[H776]]

### 28
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] was strong, [[H2388]] that they put [[H7760]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] to tribute, [[H4522]] and did not [[H3808]] utterly [[H3423]] drive them out. [[H3423]]

### 29
Neither [[H3808]] did Ephraim [[H669]] drive out [[H3423]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] that dwelt [[H3427]] in Gezer; [[H1507]] but the Canaanites [[H3669]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Gezer [[H1507]] among [[H7130]] them. [[H7130]]

### 30
Neither [[H3808]] did Zebulun [[H2074]] drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Kitron, [[H7003]] nor the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Nahalol; [[H5096]] but the Canaanites [[H3669]] dwelt [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] them, and became [[H1961]] tributaries. [[H4522]]

### 31
Neither [[H3808]] did Asher [[H836]] drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Accho, [[H5910]] nor the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Zidon, [[H6721]] nor of Ahlab, [[H303]] nor of Achzib, [[H392]] nor of Helbah, [[H2462]] nor of Aphik, [[H663]] nor of Rehob: [[H7340]]

### 32
But the Asherites [[H843]] dwelt [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] they did not [[H3808]] drive them out. [[H3423]]

### 33
Neither [[H3808]] did Naphtali [[H5321]] drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] nor the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Beth-anath; [[H1043]] but he dwelt [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land: [[H776]] nevertheless the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] and of Beth-anath [[H1043]] became [[H1961]] tributaries [[H4522]] unto them. [[H4522]]

### 34
And the Amorites [[H567]] forced [[H3905]] the children [[H1121]] of Dan [[H1835]] into the mountain: [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] they would not [[H3808]] suffer [[H5414]] them to come down [[H3381]] to the valley: [[H6010]]

### 35
But the Amorites [[H567]] would [[H2974]] dwell [[H3427]] in mount [[H2022]] Heres [[H2776]] in Aijalon, [[H357]] and in Shaalbim: [[H8169]] yet the hand [[H3027]] of the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] prevailed, [[H3513]] so that they became [[H1961]] tributaries. [[H4522]]

### 36
And the coast [[H1366]] of the Amorites [[H567]] from the going up [[H4608]] to Akrabbim, [[H4610]] from the rock, [[H5553]] and upward. [[H4605]]
