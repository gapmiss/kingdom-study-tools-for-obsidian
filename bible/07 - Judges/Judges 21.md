### 1
Now the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] had sworn [[H7650]] in Mizpeh, [[H4709]] saying, [[H559]] There shall not [[H3808]] any [[H376]] of [[H4480]] us give [[H5414]] his daughter [[H1323]] unto Benjamin [[H1144]] to wife. [[H802]]

### 2
And the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H1008]] and abode [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] till [[H5704]] even [[H6153]] before [[H6440]] God, [[H430]] and lifted up [[H5375]] their voices, [[H6963]] and wept [[H1058]] sore; [[H1419]]

### 3
And said, [[H559]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] why [[H4100]] is this [[H2063]] come to pass [[H1961]] in Israel, [[H3478]] that there should be to day [[H3117]] one [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] lacking [[H6485]] in Israel? [[H3478]]

### 4
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that the people [[H5971]] rose early, [[H7925]] and built [[H1129]] there [[H8033]] an altar, [[H4196]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings. [[H8002]]

### 5
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] among all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] came up [[H5927]] not [[H3808]] with the congregation [[H6951]] unto [[H413]] the Lord? [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] they had made [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] oath [[H7621]] concerning [[H834]] him that came up [[H5927]] not [[H3808]] to [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] to Mizpeh, [[H4709]] saying, [[H559]] He shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 6
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] repented [[H5162]] them for [[H413]] Benjamin [[H1144]] their brother, [[H251]] and said, [[H559]] There is one [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] cut off [[H1438]] from Israel [[H3478]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 7
How [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] for wives [[H802]] for them that remain, [[H3498]] seeing we [[H587]] have sworn [[H7650]] by the Lord [[H3068]] that we will not [[H1115]] give [[H5414]] them of our daughters [[H1323]] to wives? [[H802]]

### 8
And they said, [[H559]] What [[H4310]] one [[H259]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] came not up [[H5927]] to Mizpeh [[H4709]] to [[H413]] the Lord? [[H3068]] And, behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H935]] none [[H376]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] from Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] to [[H413]] the assembly. [[H6951]]

### 9
For the people [[H5971]] were numbered, [[H6485]] and, behold, [[H2009]] none [[H376]] of the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] there. [[H8033]]

### 10
And the congregation [[H5712]] sent [[H7971]] thither [[H8033]] twelve [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of the valiantest, [[H1121]] and commanded [[H6680]] them, saying, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and smite [[H5221]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] with the women [[H802]] and the children. [[H2945]]

### 11
And this [[H2088]] the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] ye shall do, [[H6213]] Ye shall utterly destroy [[H2763]] every [[H3605]] male, [[H2145]] and every [[H3605]] woman [[H802]] that hath lain [[H4904]] by man. [[H3045]]

### 12
And they found [[H4672]] among the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] young [[H5291]] virgins, [[H1330]] that [[H834]] had known [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] by lying [[H4904]] with any male: [[H2145]] and they brought [[H935]] them unto [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] to Shiloh, [[H7887]] which [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 13
And the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] sent [[H7971]] to speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] that [[H834]] in the rock [[H5553]] Rimmon, [[H7417]] and to call [[H7121]] peaceably [[H7965]] unto them. [[H7965]]

### 14
And Benjamin [[H1144]] came again [[H7725]] at that [[H1931]] time; [[H6256]] and they gave [[H5414]] them wives [[H802]] which [[H834]] they had saved alive [[H2421]] of the women [[H802]] of Jabesh-gilead: [[H3003]] and yet so [[H3651]] they sufficed [[H4672]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 15
And the people [[H5971]] repented them [[H5162]] for Benjamin, [[H1144]] because [[H3588]] that the Lord [[H3068]] had made [[H6213]] a breach [[H6556]] in the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 16
Then the elders [[H2205]] of the congregation [[H5712]] said, [[H559]] How [[H4100]] shall we do [[H6213]] for wives [[H802]] for them that remain, [[H3498]] seeing [[H3588]] the women [[H802]] are destroyed [[H8045]] out of Benjamin? [[H1144]]

### 17
And they said, [[H559]] an inheritance [[H3425]] for them that be escaped [[H6413]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] that a tribe [[H7626]] be not [[H3808]] destroyed [[H4229]] out of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 18
Howbeit we [[H587]] may [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] them wives [[H802]] of our daughters: [[H1323]] for [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] have sworn, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] Cursed [[H779]] he that giveth [[H5414]] a wife [[H802]] to Benjamin. [[H1144]]

### 19
Then they said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] a feast [[H2282]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in Shiloh [[H7887]] yearly [[H3117]] which [[H834]] on the north side [[H6828]] of Beth-el, [[H1008]] on the east side [[H4217]] of the highway [[H4546]] that goeth up [[H5927]] from Beth-el [[H1008]] to Shechem, [[H7927]] and on the south [[H5045]] of Lebonah. [[H3829]]

### 20
Therefore they commanded [[H6680]] the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] saying, [[H559]] Go [[H1980]] and lie in wait [[H693]] in the vineyards; [[H3754]]

### 21
And see, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] if [[H518]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Shiloh [[H7887]] come out [[H3318]] to dance [[H2342]] in dances, [[H4246]] then come ye out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the vineyards, [[H3754]] and catch [[H2414]] you every man [[H376]] his wife [[H802]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Shiloh, [[H7887]] and go [[H1980]] to the land [[H776]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]]

### 22
And it shall be, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] their fathers [[H1]] or [[H176]] their brethren [[H251]] come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] us to complain, [[H7378]] that we will say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Be favourable [[H2603]] unto them for our sakes: because [[H3588]] we reserved [[H3947]] not [[H3808]] to each man [[H376]] his wife [[H802]] in the war: [[H4421]] for [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] did not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] unto them at this time, [[H6256]] ye should be guilty. [[H816]]

### 23
And the children [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] did so, [[H6213]] and took [[H5375]] wives, [[H802]] according to their number, [[H4557]] of [[H4480]] them that danced, [[H2342]] whom [[H834]] they caught: [[H1497]] and they went [[H1980]] and returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] their inheritance, [[H5159]] and repaired [[H1129]] the cities, [[H5892]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in them. [[H3427]]

### 24
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] departed [[H1980]] thence [[H8033]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] every man [[H376]] to his tribe [[H7626]] and to his family, [[H4940]] and they went out [[H3318]] from thence [[H8033]] every man [[H376]] to his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 25
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Israel: [[H3478]] every man [[H376]] did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]]
