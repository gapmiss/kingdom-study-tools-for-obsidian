### 1
And it came to pass [[H1961]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] when no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Israel, [[H3478]] that there was [[H1961]] a certain [[H376]] Levite [[H3881]] sojourning [[H1481]] on the side [[H3411]] of mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] who took [[H3947]] to him a concubine [[H802]] out of Bethlehem-judah. [[H1035]]

### 2
And his concubine [[H6370]] played the whore [[H2181]] against [[H5921]] him, and went away [[H1980]] from [[H853]] him unto [[H413]] her father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] to [[H413]] Bethlehem-judah, [[H1035]] and was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] four [[H702]] whole [[H3117]] months. [[H2320]]

### 3
And her husband [[H376]] arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] her, to speak [[H1696]] friendly [[H3820]] unto her, to bring her again, [[H7725]] having his servant [[H5288]] with [[H5973]] him, and a couple [[H6776]] of asses: [[H2543]] and she brought [[H935]] him into her father's [[H1]] house: [[H1004]] and when the father [[H1]] of the damsel [[H5291]] saw [[H7200]] him, he rejoiced [[H8055]] to meet [[H7125]] him. [[H7125]]

### 4
And his father in law, [[H2859]] the damsel's [[H5291]] father, [[H1]] retained [[H2388]] him; and he abode [[H3427]] with [[H854]] him three [[H7969]] days: [[H3117]] so they did eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and lodged [[H3885]] there. [[H8033]]

### 5
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the fourth [[H7243]] day, [[H3117]] when they arose early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] that he rose up [[H6965]] to depart: [[H1980]] and the damsel's [[H5291]] father [[H1]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his son in law, [[H2860]] Comfort [[H5582]] thine heart [[H3820]] with a morsel [[H6595]] of bread, [[H3899]] and afterward [[H310]] go your way. [[H1980]]

### 6
And they sat down, [[H3427]] and did eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] both [[H8147]] of them together: [[H3162]] for the damsel's [[H5291]] father [[H1]] had said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the man, [[H376]] Be content, [[H2974]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and tarry all night, [[H3885]] and let thine heart [[H3820]] be merry. [[H3190]]

### 7
And when the man [[H376]] rose up [[H6965]] to depart, [[H1980]] his father in law [[H2859]] urged [[H6484]] him: therefore he lodged [[H3885]] there [[H8033]] again. [[H7725]]

### 8
And he arose early [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] on the fifth [[H2549]] day [[H3117]] to depart: [[H1980]] and the damsel's [[H5291]] father [[H1]] said, [[H559]] Comfort [[H5582]] thine heart, [[H3824]] I pray thee. [[H4994]] And they tarried [[H4102]] until [[H5704]] afternoon, [[H3117]] and they did eat [[H398]] both [[H8147]] of them. [[H8147]]

### 9
And when the man [[H376]] rose up [[H6965]] to depart, [[H1980]] he, [[H1931]] and his concubine, [[H6370]] and his servant, [[H5288]] his father in law, [[H2859]] the damsel's [[H5291]] father, [[H1]] said [[H559]] unto him, Behold, [[H2009]] now [[H4994]] the day [[H3117]] draweth [[H7503]] toward evening, [[H6150]] I pray you [[H4994]] tarry all night: [[H3885]] behold, [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] groweth to an end, [[H2583]] lodge [[H3885]] here, [[H6311]] that thine heart [[H3824]] may be merry; [[H3190]] and to morrow [[H4279]] get you early [[H7925]] on your way, [[H1870]] that thou mayest go [[H1980]] home. [[H168]]

### 10
But the man [[H376]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] tarry that night, [[H3885]] but he rose up [[H6965]] and departed, [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] over against [[H5227]] Jebus, [[H2982]] which [[H1931]] Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and with [[H5973]] him two [[H6776]] asses [[H2543]] saddled, [[H2280]] his concubine [[H6370]] also with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 11
when they [[H1992]] by [[H5973]] Jebus, [[H2982]] the day [[H3117]] was far [[H3966]] spent; [[H7286]] and the servant [[H5288]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his master, [[H113]] Come, [[H1980]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] and let us turn in [[H5493]] into [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] of the Jebusites, [[H2983]] and lodge [[H3885]] in it. [[H3885]]

### 12
And his master [[H113]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, We will not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] hither into [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of a stranger, [[H5237]] that [[H834]] not [[H3808]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] we will pass over [[H5674]] to [[H5704]] Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 13
And he said [[H559]] unto his servant, [[H5288]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us draw near [[H7126]] to one [[H259]] of these places [[H4725]] to lodge all night, [[H3885]] in Gibeah, [[H1390]] or [[H176]] in Ramah. [[H7414]]

### 14
And they passed on [[H5674]] and went their way; [[H1980]] and the sun [[H8121]] went down [[H935]] upon them by [[H681]] Gibeah, [[H1390]] which [[H834]] to Benjamin. [[H1144]]

### 15
And they turned aside [[H5493]] thither, [[H8033]] to go in [[H935]] to lodge [[H3885]] in Gibeah: [[H1390]] and when he went in, [[H935]] he sat him down [[H3427]] in a street [[H7339]] of the city: [[H5892]] for no [[H369]] man [[H376]] that took [[H622]] them into his house [[H1004]] to lodging. [[H3885]]

### 16
And, behold, [[H2009]] there came [[H935]] an old [[H2205]] man [[H376]] from [[H4480]] his work [[H4639]] out of [[H4480]] the field [[H7704]] at even, [[H6153]] which also [[H376]] of mount [[H2022]] Ephraim; [[H669]] and he [[H1931]] sojourned [[H1481]] in Gibeah: [[H1390]] but the men [[H376]] of the place [[H4725]] Benjamites. [[H1145]]

### 17
And when he had lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] he saw [[H7200]] a wayfaring [[H732]] man [[H376]] in the street [[H7339]] of the city: [[H5892]] and the old [[H2205]] man [[H376]] said, [[H559]] Whither [[H575]] goest [[H1980]] thou? and whence [[H370]] comest [[H935]] thou? [[H935]]

### 18
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, We [[H587]] passing [[H5674]] from Bethlehem-judah [[H1035]] toward [[H5704]] the side [[H3411]] of mount [[H2022]] Ephraim; [[H669]] from thence [[H8033]] I: [[H595]] and I went [[H1980]] to [[H5704]] Bethlehem-judah, [[H1035]] but I [[H589]] going [[H1980]] to the house [[H1004]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and there no [[H369]] man [[H376]] that receiveth [[H622]] me to house. [[H1004]]

### 19
Yet there is [[H3426]] both [[H1571]] straw [[H8401]] and [[H1571]] provender [[H4554]] for our asses; [[H2543]] and there is [[H3426]] bread [[H3899]] and wine [[H3196]] also [[H1571]] for me, and for thy handmaid, [[H519]] and for the young man [[H5288]] with [[H5973]] thy servants: [[H5650]] no [[H369]] want [[H4270]] of any [[H3605]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 20
And the old [[H2205]] man [[H376]] said, [[H559]] Peace [[H7965]] with thee; howsoever [[H7535]] all [[H3605]] thy wants [[H4270]] upon [[H5921]] me; only [[H7535]] lodge [[H3885]] not [[H408]] in the street. [[H7339]]

### 21
So he brought [[H935]] him into his house, [[H1004]] and gave provender [[H1101]] unto the asses: [[H2543]] and they washed [[H7364]] their feet, [[H7272]] and did eat [[H398]] and drink. [[H8354]]

### 22
as they [[H1992]] were making their hearts [[H3820]] merry, [[H3190]] behold, [[H2009]] the men [[H582]] of the city, [[H5892]] certain [[H582]] sons [[H1121]] of Belial, [[H1100]] beset [[H5437]] the house [[H1004]]  round about, [[H853]] beat [[H1849]] at [[H5921]] the door, [[H1817]] and spake [[H559]] to [[H413]] the master [[H1167]] of the house, [[H1004]] the old [[H2205]] man, [[H376]] saying, [[H559]] Bring forth [[H3318]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] came [[H935]] into [[H413]] thine house, [[H1004]] that we may know [[H3045]] him. [[H3045]]

### 23
And the man, [[H376]] the master [[H1167]] of the house, [[H1004]] went out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] them, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Nay, [[H408]] my brethren, [[H251]] I pray you, [[H4994]] do not wickedly; [[H7489]] seeing that [[H310]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] is come [[H935]] into [[H413]] mine house, [[H1004]] do [[H6213]] not [[H408]] this [[H2063]] folly. [[H5039]]

### 24
Behold, [[H2009]] my daughter [[H1323]] a maiden, [[H1330]] and his concubine; [[H6370]] them I will bring out [[H3318]] now, [[H4994]] and humble [[H6031]] ye them, and do [[H6213]] with them what seemeth [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] unto you: but unto this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] do [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] so [[H2063]] vile [[H5039]] a thing. [[H1697]]

### 25
But the men [[H582]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] to him: so the man [[H376]] took [[H2388]] his concubine, [[H6370]] and brought [[H3318]] her forth [[H2351]] unto [[H413]] them; and they knew [[H3045]] her, and abused [[H5953]] her all [[H3605]] the night [[H3915]] until [[H5704]] the morning: [[H1242]] and when the day [[H7837]] began to spring, [[H5927]] they let her go. [[H7971]]

### 26
Then came [[H935]] the woman [[H802]] in the dawning [[H6437]] of the day, [[H1242]] and fell down [[H5307]] at the door [[H6607]] of the man's [[H376]] house [[H1004]] where [[H834]] her lord [[H113]] till [[H5704]] it was light. [[H216]]

### 27
And her lord [[H113]] rose up [[H6965]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and opened [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of the house, [[H1004]] and went out [[H3318]] to go [[H1980]] his way: [[H1870]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the woman [[H802]] his concubine [[H6370]] was fallen down [[H5307]] the door [[H6607]] of the house, [[H1004]] and her hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the threshold. [[H5592]]

### 28
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Up, [[H6965]] and let us be going. [[H1980]] But none [[H369]] answered. [[H6030]] Then the man took her [[H3947]] upon [[H5921]] an ass, [[H2543]] and the man [[H376]] rose up, [[H6965]] and gat [[H1980]] him unto his place. [[H4725]]

### 29
And when he was come [[H935]] into [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] he took [[H3947]] a knife, [[H3979]] and laid hold [[H2388]] on his concubine, [[H6370]] and divided [[H5408]] her, with her bones, [[H6106]] into twelve [[H8147]] pieces, [[H5409]] and sent [[H7971]] her into all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 30
And it was so, [[H1961]] that all [[H3605]] that saw [[H7200]] it said, [[H559]] There was no [[H3808]] such deed [[H2063]] done [[H1961]] nor [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] from the day [[H3117]] that the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] came up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day: [[H3117]] consider [[H7760]] of [[H5921]] it, take advice, [[H5779]] and speak [[H1696]]
