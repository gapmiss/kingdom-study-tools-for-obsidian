### 1
And Abimelech [[H40]] the son [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal [[H3378]] went [[H1980]] to Shechem [[H7927]] unto [[H413]] his mother's [[H517]] brethren, [[H251]] and communed [[H1696]] with [[H413]] them, and with [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the family [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of his mother's [[H517]] father, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak, [[H1696]] I pray you, [[H4994]] in the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the men [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] Whether [[H4100]] better [[H2896]] for you, either that all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] threescore and ten [[H7657]] persons, [[H376]] reign [[H4910]] over you, or [[H518]] that one [[H259]] reign [[H4910]] over you? remember [[H2142]] also that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] your bone [[H6106]] and your flesh. [[H1320]]

### 3
And his mother's [[H517]] brethren [[H251]] spake [[H1696]] of [[H5921]] him in the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the men [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words: [[H1697]] and their hearts [[H3820]] inclined [[H5186]] to follow [[H310]] Abimelech; [[H40]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] He [[H1931]] our brother. [[H251]]

### 4
And they gave [[H5414]] him threescore and ten [[H7657]] of silver [[H3701]] out of the house [[H1004]] of Baal-berith, [[H1170]] wherewith Abimelech [[H40]] hired [[H7936]] vain [[H7386]] and light [[H6348]] persons, [[H582]] which followed [[H1980]] him. [[H310]]

### 5
And he went [[H935]] unto his father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] at Ophrah, [[H6084]] and slew [[H2026]] his brethren [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] threescore and ten [[H7657]] persons, [[H376]] upon [[H5921]] one [[H259]] stone: [[H68]] notwithstanding yet Jotham [[H3147]] the youngest [[H6996]] son [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal [[H3378]] was left; [[H3498]] for [[H3588]] he hid himself. [[H2244]]

### 6
And all [[H3605]] the men [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] gathered together, [[H622]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Millo, [[H4407]] and went, [[H1980]] and made [[H4427]] Abimelech [[H40]] king, [[H4428]] by [[H5973]] the plain [[H436]] of the pillar [[H5324]] that [[H834]] in Shechem. [[H7927]]

### 7
And when they told [[H5046]] to Jotham, [[H3147]] he went [[H1980]] and stood [[H5975]] in the top [[H7218]] of mount [[H2022]] Gerizim, [[H1630]] and lifted up [[H5375]] his voice, [[H6963]] and cried, [[H7121]] and said [[H559]] unto them, Hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] me, ye men [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] that God [[H430]] may hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 8
The trees [[H6086]] went forth [[H1980]] to anoint [[H4886]] a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] them; and they said [[H559]] unto the olive tree, [[H2132]] Reign [[H4427]] thou over [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 9
But the olive tree [[H2132]] said [[H559]] unto them, Should I leave [[H2308]] my fatness, [[H1880]] wherewith [[H834]] by me they honour [[H3513]] God [[H430]] and man, [[H376]] and go [[H1980]] to be promoted [[H5128]] over [[H5921]] the trees? [[H6086]]

### 10
And the trees [[H6086]] said [[H559]] to the fig tree, [[H8384]] Come [[H1980]] thou, [[H859]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 11
But the fig tree [[H8384]] said [[H559]] unto them, Should I forsake [[H2308]] my sweetness, [[H4987]] and my good [[H2896]] fruit, [[H8570]] and go [[H1980]] to be promoted [[H5128]] over [[H5921]] the trees? [[H6086]]

### 12
Then said [[H559]] the trees [[H6086]] unto the vine, [[H1612]] Come [[H1980]] thou, [[H859]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 13
And the vine [[H1612]] said [[H559]] unto them, Should I leave [[H2308]] my wine, [[H8492]] which cheereth [[H8055]] God [[H430]] and man, [[H376]] and go [[H1980]] to be promoted [[H5128]] over [[H5921]] the trees? [[H6086]]

### 14
Then said [[H559]] all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] unto [[H413]] the bramble, [[H329]] Come [[H1980]] thou, [[H859]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 15
And the bramble [[H329]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the trees, [[H6086]] If [[H518]] in truth [[H571]] ye [[H859]] anoint [[H4886]] me king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] you, come [[H935]] put your trust [[H2620]] in my shadow: [[H6738]] and if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] let fire [[H784]] come out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the bramble, [[H329]] and devour [[H398]] the cedars [[H730]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 16
Now [[H6258]] therefore, if [[H518]] ye have done [[H6213]] truly [[H571]] and sincerely, [[H8549]] in that ye have made Abimelech [[H40]] king, [[H4427]] and if [[H518]] ye have dealt [[H6213]] well [[H2896]] with [[H5973]] Jerubbaal [[H3378]]  and [[H5973]] his house, [[H1004]] and have done [[H6213]] unto him according to the deserving [[H1576]] of his hands; [[H3027]]

### 17
(For [[H834]] my father [[H1]] fought [[H3898]] for [[H5921]] you, and adventured [[H7993]] his life [[H5315]] far, [[H5048]] and delivered [[H5337]] you out of the hand [[H3027]] of Midian: [[H4080]]

### 18
And ye [[H859]] are risen up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] my father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] this day, [[H3117]] and have slain [[H2026]] his sons, [[H1121]] threescore and ten [[H7657]] persons, [[H376]] upon [[H5921]] one [[H259]] stone, [[H68]]  and have made [[H853]] Abimelech, [[H40]] the son [[H1121]] of his maidservant, [[H519]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] the men [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] your brother;) [[H251]]

### 19
If [[H518]] ye then have dealt [[H6213]] truly [[H571]] and sincerely [[H8549]] with [[H5973]] Jerubbaal [[H3378]] and with [[H5973]] his house [[H1004]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] rejoice [[H8055]] ye in Abimelech, [[H40]] and let him [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] rejoice [[H8055]] in you: [[H8055]]

### 20
But if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] let fire [[H784]] come out [[H3318]] from Abimelech, [[H40]] and devour [[H398]] the men [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] and the house [[H1004]] of Millo; [[H4407]] and let fire [[H784]] come out [[H3318]] from the men [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] and from the house [[H1004]] of Millo, [[H4407]] and devour [[H398]] Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 21
And Jotham [[H3147]] ran away, [[H1272]] and fled, [[H5127]] and went [[H1980]] to Beer, [[H876]] and dwelt [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] for fear [[H6440]] of Abimelech [[H40]] his brother. [[H251]]

### 22
When Abimelech [[H40]] had reigned [[H7786]] three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]]

### 23
Then God [[H430]] sent [[H7971]] an evil [[H7451]] spirit [[H7307]] between [[H996]] Abimelech [[H40]] and the men [[H1167]] of Shechem; [[H7927]] and the men [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] dealt treacherously [[H898]] with Abimelech: [[H40]]

### 24
That the cruelty [[H2555]] to the threescore and ten [[H7657]] sons [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal [[H3378]] might come, [[H935]] and their blood [[H1818]] be laid [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] Abimelech [[H40]] their brother, [[H251]] which [[H834]] slew [[H2026]] them; and upon [[H5921]] the men [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] which [[H834]] aided [[H2388]] him in the killing [[H2026]]  of [[H853]] his brethren. [[H251]]

### 25
And the men [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] set [[H7760]] liers in wait [[H693]] for him in [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of the mountains, [[H2022]] and they robbed [[H1497]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] came along [[H5674]] that way [[H1870]] by [[H5921]] them: and it was told [[H5046]] Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 26
And Gaal [[H1603]] the son [[H1121]] of Ebed [[H5651]] came [[H935]] with his brethren, [[H251]] and went over [[H5674]] to Shechem: [[H7927]] and the men [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] put their confidence [[H982]] in him. [[H982]]

### 27
And they went out [[H3318]] into the fields, [[H7704]] and gathered [[H1219]] their vineyards, [[H3754]] and trode [[H1869]] and made [[H6213]] merry, [[H1974]] and went into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of their god, [[H430]] and did eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and cursed [[H7043]] Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 28
And Gaal [[H1603]] the son [[H1121]] of Ebed [[H5651]] said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] Abimelech, [[H40]] and who [[H4310]] Shechem, [[H7927]] that [[H3588]] we should serve [[H5647]] him? not [[H3808]] the son [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal? [[H3378]] and Zebul [[H2083]] his officer? [[H6496]] serve [[H5647]] the men [[H376]] of Hamor [[H2544]] the father [[H1]] of Shechem: [[H7927]] for why [[H4069]] should we [[H587]] serve [[H5647]] him? [[H5647]]

### 29
And would to God [[H4310]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] were under [[H5414]] my hand! [[H3027]] then would I remove [[H5493]] Abimelech. [[H40]] And he said [[H559]] to Abimelech, [[H40]] Increase [[H7235]] thine army, [[H6635]] and come out. [[H3318]]

### 30
And when Zebul [[H2083]] the ruler [[H8269]] of the city [[H5892]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of Gaal [[H1603]] the son [[H1121]] of Ebed, [[H5651]] his anger [[H639]] was kindled. [[H2734]]

### 31
And he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] Abimelech [[H40]] privily, [[H8649]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] Gaal [[H1603]] the son [[H1121]] of Ebed [[H5651]] and his brethren [[H251]] be come [[H935]] to Shechem; [[H7927]] and, behold, [[H2009]] they fortify [[H6696]] the city [[H5892]] against [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 32
Now [[H6258]] therefore up [[H6965]] by night, [[H3915]] thou [[H859]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] thee, and lie in wait [[H693]] in the field: [[H7704]]

### 33
And it shall be, [[H1961]] in the morning, [[H1242]] as soon as the sun [[H8121]] is up, [[H2224]] thou shalt rise early, [[H7925]] and set [[H6584]] upon [[H5921]] the city: [[H5892]] and, behold, [[H2009]] he [[H1931]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him come out [[H3318]] against [[H413]] thee, then mayest thou do [[H6213]] to them as [[H834]] thou [[H3027]] shalt find occasion. [[H4672]]

### 34
And Abimelech [[H40]] rose up, [[H6965]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him, by night, [[H3915]] and they laid wait [[H693]] against [[H5921]] Shechem [[H7927]] in four [[H702]] companies. [[H7218]]

### 35
And Gaal [[H1603]] the son [[H1121]] of Ebed [[H5651]] went out, [[H3318]] and stood [[H5975]] in the entering [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the city: [[H5892]] and Abimelech [[H40]] rose up, [[H6965]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, from [[H4480]] lying in wait. [[H3993]]

### 36
And when Gaal [[H1603]] saw [[H7200]] the people, [[H5971]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zebul, [[H2083]] Behold, [[H2009]] there come [[H3381]] people [[H5971]] down from the top [[H7218]] of the mountains. [[H2022]] And Zebul [[H2083]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thou [[H859]] seest [[H7200]] the shadow [[H6738]] of the mountains [[H2022]] as men. [[H376]]

### 37
And Gaal [[H1603]] spake [[H1696]] again [[H3254]] and said, [[H559]] See [[H2009]] there come [[H3381]] people [[H5971]] down by [[H5973]] the middle [[H2872]] of the land, [[H776]] and another [[H259]] company [[H7218]] come [[H935]] along by the plain [[H436]] of [[H1870]] Meonenim. [[H6049]]

### 38
Then said [[H559]] Zebul [[H2083]] unto [[H413]] him, Where [[H346]] now [[H645]] thy mouth, [[H6310]] wherewith [[H834]] thou saidst, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] Abimelech, [[H40]] that [[H3588]] we should serve [[H5647]] him? not [[H3808]] this [[H2088]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] thou hast despised? [[H3988]] go out, [[H3318]] I pray now, [[H4994]] and fight [[H3898]] with them. [[H3898]]

### 39
And Gaal [[H1603]] went out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] the men [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] and fought [[H3898]] with Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 40
And Abimelech [[H40]] chased [[H7291]] him, and he fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] him, and many [[H7227]] were overthrown [[H5307]] wounded, [[H2491]] unto [[H5704]] the entering [[H6607]] of the gate. [[H8179]]

### 41
And Abimelech [[H40]] dwelt [[H3427]] at Arumah: [[H725]] and Zebul [[H2083]] thrust out [[H1644]] Gaal [[H1603]] and his brethren, [[H251]] that they should not dwell [[H3427]] in Shechem. [[H7927]]

### 42
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] that the people [[H5971]] went out [[H3318]] into the field; [[H7704]] and they told [[H5046]] Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 43
And he took [[H3947]] the people, [[H5971]] and divided [[H2673]] them into three [[H7969]] companies, [[H7218]] and laid wait [[H693]] in the field, [[H7704]] and looked, [[H7200]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the people [[H5971]] come forth [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] the city; [[H5892]] and he rose up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] them, and smote [[H5221]] them. [[H5221]]

### 44
And Abimelech, [[H40]] and the company [[H7218]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him, rushed forward, [[H6584]] and stood [[H5975]] in the entering [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the city: [[H5892]] and the two [[H8147]] companies [[H7218]] ran upon [[H6584]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in the fields, [[H7704]] and slew [[H5221]] them. [[H5221]]

### 45
And Abimelech [[H40]] fought [[H3898]] against the city [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] day; [[H3117]] and he took [[H3920]] the city, [[H5892]] and slew [[H2026]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] therein, and beat down [[H5422]] the city, [[H5892]] and sowed [[H2232]] it with salt. [[H4417]]

### 46
And when all [[H3605]] the men [[H1167]] of the tower [[H4026]] of Shechem [[H7927]] heard [[H8085]] they entered [[H935]] into [[H413]] an hold [[H6877]] of the house [[H1004]] of the god [[H410]] Berith. [[H1286]]

### 47
And it was told [[H5046]] Abimelech, [[H40]] that [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H1167]] of the tower [[H4026]] of Shechem [[H7927]] were gathered together. [[H6908]]

### 48
And Abimelech [[H40]] gat him up [[H5927]] to mount [[H2022]] Zalmon, [[H6756]] he [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him; and Abimelech [[H40]] took [[H3947]] an axe [[H7134]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and cut down [[H3772]] a bough [[H7754]] from the trees, [[H6086]] and took [[H5375]] it, and laid [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] his shoulder, [[H7926]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him, What [[H4100]] ye have seen [[H7200]] me do, [[H6213]] make haste, [[H4116]] do [[H6213]] as I [[H3644]]

### 49
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] likewise [[H1571]] cut down [[H3772]] every man [[H376]] his bough, [[H7754]] and followed [[H1980]] Abimelech, [[H40]] and put [[H7760]] to [[H5921]] the hold, [[H6877]] and set [[H3341]] the hold [[H6877]] on fire [[H784]] upon [[H5921]] them; so that all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of the tower [[H4026]] of Shechem [[H7927]] died [[H4191]] also, [[H1571]] about a thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] and women. [[H802]]

### 50
Then went [[H1980]] Abimelech [[H40]] to [[H413]] Thebez, [[H8405]] and encamped [[H2583]] against Thebez, [[H8405]] and took [[H3920]] it. [[H3920]]

### 51
But there was [[H1961]] a strong [[H5797]] tower [[H4026]] within [[H8432]] the city, [[H5892]] and thither [[H8033]] fled [[H5127]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] and women, [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] they [[H1167]] of the city, [[H5892]] and shut [[H5462]] to [[H1157]] them, and gat them up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] the top [[H1406]] of the tower. [[H4026]]

### 52
And Abimelech [[H40]] came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] the tower, [[H4026]] and fought [[H3898]] against it, and went hard [[H5066]] unto [[H5704]] the door [[H6607]] of the tower [[H4026]] to burn [[H8313]] it with fire. [[H784]]

### 53
And a certain [[H259]] woman [[H802]] cast [[H7993]] a piece [[H6400]] of a millstone [[H7393]] upon [[H5921]] Abimelech's [[H40]] head, [[H7218]] and all to brake [[H7533]] his skull. [[H1538]]

### 54
Then he called [[H7121]] hastily [[H4120]] unto [[H413]] the young man [[H5288]] his armourbearer, [[H5375]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Draw [[H8025]] thy sword, [[H2719]] and slay [[H4191]] me, that [[H6435]] men say [[H559]] not of me, A woman [[H802]] slew [[H2026]] him. And his young man [[H5288]] thrust him through, [[H1856]] and he died. [[H4191]]

### 55
And when the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Abimelech [[H40]] was dead, [[H4191]] they departed [[H1980]] every man [[H376]] unto his place. [[H4725]]

### 56
Thus God [[H430]] rendered [[H7725]] the wickedness [[H7451]] of Abimelech, [[H40]] which [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] unto his father, [[H1]] in slaying [[H2026]] his seventy [[H7657]] brethren: [[H251]]

### 57
And all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] of the men [[H376]] of Shechem [[H7927]] did God [[H430]] render [[H7725]] upon their heads: [[H7218]] and upon [[H413]] them came [[H935]] the curse [[H7045]] of Jotham [[H3147]] the son [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal. [[H3378]]
