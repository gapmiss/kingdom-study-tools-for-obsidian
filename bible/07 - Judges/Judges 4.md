### 1
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] again [[H3254]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] when Ehud [[H164]] was dead. [[H4191]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] sold [[H4376]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Jabin [[H2985]] king [[H4428]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] that [[H834]] reigned [[H4427]] in Hazor; [[H2674]] the captain [[H8269]] of whose host [[H6635]] Sisera, [[H5516]] which [[H1931]] dwelt [[H3427]] in Harosheth [[H2800]] of the Gentiles. [[H1471]]

### 3
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he had nine [[H8672]] hundred [[H3967]] chariots [[H7393]] of iron; [[H1270]] and twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] he [[H1931]] mightily [[H2394]] oppressed [[H3905]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
And Deborah, [[H1683]] a prophetess, [[H5031]] the wife [[H802]] of Lapidoth, [[H3941]] she [[H1931]] judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] at that [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

### 5
And she [[H1931]] dwelt [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] the palm tree [[H8560]] of Deborah [[H1683]] between [[H996]] Ramah [[H7414]] and Beth-el [[H1008]] in mount [[H2022]] Ephraim: [[H669]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] came up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] her for judgment. [[H4941]]

### 6
And she sent [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] Barak [[H1301]] the son [[H1121]] of Abinoam [[H42]] out of Kedesh-naphtali, [[H6943]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Hath not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] commanded, [[H6680]] Go [[H1980]] and draw [[H4900]] toward mount [[H2022]] Tabor, [[H8396]] and take [[H3947]] with [[H5973]] thee ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of the children [[H1121]] of Naphtali [[H5321]] and of the children [[H1121]] of Zebulun? [[H2074]]

### 7
And I will draw [[H4900]] unto [[H413]] thee to [[H413]] the river [[H5158]] Kishon [[H7028]] Sisera, [[H5516]] the captain [[H8269]] of Jabin's [[H2985]] army, [[H6635]] with his chariots [[H7393]] and his multitude; [[H1995]] and I will deliver [[H5414]] him into thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 8
And Barak [[H1301]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, If [[H518]] thou wilt go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] me, then I will go: [[H1980]] but if [[H518]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] me, I will not [[H3808]] go. [[H1980]]

### 9
And she said, [[H559]] I will surely [[H1980]] go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] thee: notwithstanding [[H657]] the journey [[H1870]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] takest [[H1980]] shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] for thine honour; [[H8597]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall sell [[H4376]] Sisera [[H5516]] into the hand [[H3027]] of a woman. [[H802]] And Deborah [[H1683]] arose, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] Barak [[H1301]] to Kedesh. [[H6943]]

### 10
And Barak [[H1301]] called [[H2199]] Zebulun [[H2074]] and Naphtali [[H5321]] to Kedesh; [[H6943]] and he went up [[H5927]] with ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] at his feet: [[H7272]] and Deborah [[H1683]] went up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 11
Now Heber [[H2268]] the Kenite, [[H7017]] of the children [[H1121]] of Hobab [[H2246]] the father in law [[H2859]] of Moses, [[H4872]] had severed himself [[H6504]] from the Kenites, [[H7017]] and pitched [[H5186]] his tent [[H168]] unto [[H5704]] the plain [[H436]] of Zaanaim, [[H6815]] which [[H834]] by [[H854]] Kedesh. [[H6943]]

### 12
And they shewed [[H5046]] Sisera [[H5516]] that [[H3588]] Barak [[H1301]] the son [[H1121]] of Abinoam [[H42]] was gone up [[H5927]] to mount [[H2022]] Tabor. [[H8396]]

### 13
And Sisera [[H5516]] gathered together [[H2199]] all [[H3605]] his chariots, [[H7393]] nine [[H8672]] hundred [[H3967]] chariots [[H7393]] of iron, [[H1270]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, from Harosheth [[H2800]] of the Gentiles [[H1471]] unto [[H413]] the river [[H5158]] of Kishon. [[H7028]]

### 14
And Deborah [[H1683]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Barak, [[H1301]] Up; [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] the day [[H3117]] in which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] Sisera [[H5516]] into thine hand: [[H3027]] is not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] gone out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] thee? So Barak [[H1301]] went down [[H3381]] from mount [[H2022]] Tabor, [[H8396]] and ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 15
And the Lord [[H3068]] discomfited [[H2000]] Sisera, [[H5516]] and all [[H3605]] chariots, [[H7393]] and all [[H3605]] host, [[H4264]] with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword [[H2719]] before [[H6440]] Barak; [[H1301]] so that Sisera [[H5516]] lighted down [[H3381]] off [[H5921]] chariot, [[H4818]] and fled away [[H5127]] on his feet. [[H7272]]

### 16
But Barak [[H1301]] pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] the chariots, [[H7393]] and after [[H310]] the host, [[H4264]] unto [[H5704]] Harosheth [[H2800]] of the Gentiles: [[H1471]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H4264]] of Sisera [[H5516]] fell [[H5307]] upon the edge [[H6310]] of the sword; [[H2719]] there was not [[H3808]] a man [[H259]] left. [[H7604]]

### 17
Howbeit Sisera [[H5516]] fled away [[H5127]] on his feet [[H7272]] to [[H413]] the tent [[H168]] of Jael [[H3278]] the wife [[H802]] of Heber [[H2268]] the Kenite: [[H7017]] for [[H3588]] peace [[H7965]] between [[H996]] Jabin [[H2985]] the king [[H4428]] of Hazor [[H2674]] and the house [[H1004]] of Heber [[H2268]] the Kenite. [[H7017]]

### 18
And Jael [[H3278]] went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] Sisera, [[H5516]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Turn in, [[H5493]] my lord, [[H113]] turn in [[H5493]] to [[H413]] me; fear [[H3372]] not. [[H408]] And when he had turned in [[H5493]] unto [[H413]] her into the tent, [[H168]] she covered [[H3680]] him with a mantle. [[H8063]]

### 19
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Give me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] a little [[H4592]] water [[H4325]] to drink; [[H8248]] for [[H3588]] I am thirsty. [[H6770]] And she opened [[H6605]] a bottle [[H4997]] of milk, [[H2461]] and gave him drink, [[H8248]] and covered [[H3680]] him. [[H3680]]

### 20
Again he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] her, Stand in [[H5975]] the door [[H6607]] of the tent, [[H168]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] when [[H518]] any man [[H376]] doth come [[H935]] and inquire [[H7592]] of thee, and say, [[H559]] Is there [[H3426]] any man [[H376]] here? [[H6311]] that thou shalt say, [[H559]] No. [[H369]]

### 21
Then Jael [[H3278]] Heber's [[H2268]] wife [[H802]] took [[H3947]] a nail [[H3489]] of the tent, [[H168]] and took [[H7760]] an hammer [[H4718]] in her hand, [[H3027]] and went [[H935]] softly [[H3814]] unto [[H413]] him, and smote [[H8628]] the nail [[H3489]] into his temples, [[H7541]] and fastened [[H6795]] it into the ground: [[H776]] for he [[H1931]] was fast asleep [[H7290]] and weary. [[H5774]] So he died. [[H4191]]

### 22
And, behold, [[H2009]] as Barak [[H1301]] pursued [[H7291]] Sisera, [[H5516]] Jael [[H3278]] came out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] him, and said [[H559]] unto him, Come, [[H1980]] and I will shew [[H7200]]  thee [[H853]] the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] thou [[H859]] seekest. [[H1245]] And when he came [[H935]] into [[H413]] her behold, [[H2009]] Sisera [[H5516]] lay [[H5307]] dead, [[H4191]] and the nail [[H3489]] in his temples. [[H7541]]

### 23
So God [[H430]] subdued [[H3665]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Jabin [[H2985]] the king [[H4428]] of Canaan [[H3667]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
And the hand [[H3027]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] prospered, [[H1980]] and prevailed [[H1980]] against [[H5921]] Jabin [[H2985]] the king [[H4428]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] until [[H5704]] they had destroyed [[H3772]] Jabin [[H2985]] king [[H4428]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]
