### 1
Then Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] who [[H1931]] Gideon, [[H1439]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, rose up early, [[H7925]] and pitched [[H2583]] beside [[H5921]] the well of Harod: [[H5878]] so that the host [[H4264]] of the Midianites [[H4080]] were [[H1961]] on the north side [[H6828]] of them, by the hill [[H1389]] of Moreh, [[H4176]] in the valley. [[H6010]]

### 2
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] The people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] thee too many [[H7227]] for me to give [[H5414]] the Midianites [[H4080]] into their hands, [[H3027]] lest [[H6435]] Israel [[H3478]] vaunt themselves [[H6286]] against [[H5921]] me, saying, [[H559]] Mine own hand [[H3027]] hath saved [[H3467]] me. [[H3467]]

### 3
Now [[H6258]] therefore go to, [[H4994]] proclaim [[H7121]] in the ears [[H241]] of the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Whosoever [[H4310]] fearful [[H3373]] and afraid, [[H2730]] let him return [[H7725]] and depart early [[H6852]] from mount [[H2022]] Gilead. [[H1568]] And there returned [[H7725]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] twenty [[H6242]] and two [[H8147]] thousand; [[H505]] and there remained [[H7604]] ten [[H6235]] thousand. [[H505]]

### 4
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] The people [[H5971]] yet [[H5750]] many; [[H7227]] bring them down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] the water, [[H4325]] and I will try [[H6884]] them for thee there: [[H8033]] and it shall be, [[H1961]] of whom [[H834]] I say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, This [[H2088]] shall go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] thee, the same [[H1931]] shall go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] thee; and of whomsoever [[H3605]] I say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] thee, This [[H2088]] shall not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] thee, the same [[H1931]] shall not [[H3808]] go. [[H1980]]

### 5
So he brought down [[H3381]] the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] the water: [[H4325]] and the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] Every one [[H3605]] that [[H834]] lappeth [[H3952]] of [[H4480]] the water [[H4325]] with his tongue, [[H3956]] as [[H834]] a dog [[H3611]] lappeth, [[H3952]] him shalt thou set [[H3322]] by himself; [[H905]] likewise every one [[H3605]] that [[H834]] boweth down [[H3766]] upon [[H5921]] his knees [[H1290]] to drink. [[H8354]]

### 6
And the number [[H4557]] of them that lapped, [[H3952]] their hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] their mouth, [[H6310]] were [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men: [[H376]] but all [[H3605]] the rest [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] bowed down [[H3766]] upon [[H5921]] their knees [[H1290]] to drink [[H8354]] water. [[H4325]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] By the three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] that lapped [[H3952]] will I save [[H3467]] you, and deliver [[H5414]] the Midianites [[H4080]] into thine hand: [[H3027]] and let all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] go [[H1980]] every man [[H376]] unto his place. [[H4725]]

### 8
So the people [[H5971]] took [[H3947]] victuals [[H6720]] in their hand, [[H3027]] and their trumpets: [[H7782]] and he sent [[H7971]] all [[H376]] Israel [[H3478]] every man [[H376]] unto his tent, [[H168]] and retained [[H2388]] those three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men: [[H376]] and the host [[H4264]] of Midian [[H4080]] was [[H1961]] beneath [[H8478]] him in the valley. [[H6010]]

### 9
And it came to pass [[H1961]] the same [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] that the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Arise, [[H6965]] get thee down [[H3381]] unto the host; [[H4264]] for [[H3588]] I have delivered [[H5414]] it into thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 10
But if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] fear [[H3373]] to go down, go [[H3381]] thou [[H859]] with Phurah [[H6513]] thy servant [[H5288]] down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the host: [[H4264]]

### 11
And thou shalt hear [[H8085]] what [[H4100]] they say; [[H1696]] and afterward [[H310]] shall thine hands [[H3027]] be strengthened [[H2388]] to go down [[H3381]] unto the host. [[H4264]] Then went he down [[H3381]] with Phurah [[H6513]] his servant [[H5288]] unto [[H413]] the outside [[H7097]] of the armed men [[H2571]] that [[H834]] in the host. [[H4264]]

### 12
And the Midianites [[H4080]] and the Amalekites [[H6002]] and all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of the east [[H6924]] lay [[H5307]] along in the valley [[H6010]] like grasshoppers [[H697]] for multitude; [[H7230]] and their camels [[H1581]] without [[H369]] number, [[H4557]] as the sand [[H2344]] by [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] side [[H8193]] for multitude. [[H7230]]

### 13
And when Gideon [[H1439]] was come, [[H935]] behold, [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] that told [[H5608]] a dream [[H2472]] unto his fellow, [[H7453]] and said, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] I dreamed [[H2492]] a dream, [[H2472]] and, lo, [[H2009]] a cake [[H6742]] of barley [[H8184]] bread [[H3899]] tumbled [[H2015]] into the host [[H4264]] of Midian, [[H4080]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] a tent, [[H168]] and smote [[H5221]] it that it fell, [[H5307]] and overturned [[H2015]] it, that the tent [[H168]] lay along. [[H5307]]

### 14
And his fellow [[H7453]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] This [[H2063]] nothing else [[H369]] save [[H1115]] the sword [[H2719]] of Gideon [[H1439]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash, [[H3101]] a man [[H376]] of Israel: [[H3478]] into his hand [[H3027]] hath God [[H430]] delivered [[H5414]] Midian, [[H4080]] and all [[H3605]] the host. [[H4264]]

### 15
And it was [[H1961]] when Gideon [[H1439]] heard [[H8085]] the telling [[H4557]] of the dream, [[H2472]] and the interpretation [[H7667]] thereof, that he worshipped, [[H7812]] and returned [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the host [[H4264]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and said, [[H559]] Arise; [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] into your hand [[H3027]] the host [[H4264]] of Midian. [[H4080]]

### 16
And he divided [[H2673]] the three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] three [[H7969]] companies, [[H7218]] and he put [[H5414]] a trumpet [[H7782]] in every man's [[H3605]] hand, [[H3027]] with empty [[H7386]] pitchers, [[H3537]] and lamps [[H3940]] within [[H8432]] the pitchers. [[H3537]]

### 17
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Look [[H7200]] on [[H4480]] me, and do [[H6213]] likewise: [[H3651]] and, behold, [[H2009]] when I [[H595]] come [[H935]] to the outside [[H7097]] of the camp, [[H4264]] it shall be [[H1961]] as [[H834]] I do, [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] shall ye do. [[H6213]]

### 18
When I blow [[H8628]] with a trumpet, [[H7782]] I [[H595]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] me, then blow [[H8628]] ye [[H859]] the trumpets [[H7782]] also [[H1571]] on every side [[H5439]] of all [[H3605]] the camp, [[H4264]] and say, [[H559]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and of Gideon. [[H1439]]

### 19
So Gideon, [[H1439]] and the hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, came [[H935]] unto the outside [[H7097]] of the camp [[H4264]] in the beginning [[H7218]] of the middle [[H8484]] watch; [[H821]] and they had but [[H389]] newly [[H6965]] set [[H6965]] the watch: [[H8104]] and they blew [[H8628]] the trumpets, [[H7782]] and brake [[H5310]] the pitchers [[H3537]] that [[H834]] in their hands. [[H3027]]

### 20
And the three [[H7969]] companies [[H7218]] blew [[H8628]] the trumpets, [[H7782]] and brake [[H7665]] the pitchers, [[H3537]] and held [[H2388]] the lamps [[H3940]] in their left [[H8040]] hands, [[H3027]] and the trumpets [[H7782]] in their right [[H3225]] hands [[H3027]] to blow [[H8628]] and they cried, [[H7121]] The sword [[H2719]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and of Gideon. [[H1439]]

### 21
And they stood [[H5975]] every man [[H376]] in his place [[H8478]] round about [[H5439]] the camp: [[H4264]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H4264]] ran, [[H7323]] and cried, [[H7321]] and fled. [[H5127]]

### 22
And the three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] blew [[H8628]] the trumpets, [[H7782]] and the Lord [[H3068]] set [[H7760]] every man's [[H376]] sword [[H2719]] against his fellow, [[H7453]] even throughout all [[H3605]] the host: [[H4264]] and the host [[H4264]] fled [[H5127]] to [[H5704]] Beth-shittah [[H1029]] in Zererath, [[H6888]] to [[H5704]] the border [[H8193]] of Abel-meholah, [[H65]] unto [[H5921]] Tabbath. [[H2888]]

### 23
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] gathered themselves together [[H6817]] out of Naphtali, [[H5321]] and out of [[H4480]] Asher, [[H836]] and out of [[H4480]] all [[H3605]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] and pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] the Midianites. [[H4080]]

### 24
And Gideon [[H1439]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] throughout all [[H3605]] mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] saying, [[H559]] Come down [[H3381]] against [[H7125]] the Midianites, [[H4080]] and take [[H3920]]  before them [[H853]] the waters [[H4325]] unto [[H5704]] Beth-barah [[H1012]] and Jordan. [[H3383]] Then all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Ephraim [[H669]] gathered themselves together, [[H6817]] and took [[H3920]] the waters [[H4325]] unto [[H5704]] Beth-barah [[H1012]] and Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 25
And they took [[H3920]] two [[H8147]] princes [[H8269]] of the Midianites, [[H4080]] Oreb [[H6159]] and Zeeb; [[H2062]] and they slew [[H2026]] Oreb [[H6159]] upon the rock [[H6697]] Oreb, [[H6159]] and Zeeb [[H2062]] they slew [[H2026]] at the winepress [[H3342]] of Zeeb, [[H2062]] and pursued [[H7291]] Midian, [[H4080]] and brought [[H935]] the heads [[H7218]] of Oreb [[H6159]] and Zeeb [[H2062]] to [[H413]] Gideon [[H1439]] on the other side [[H5676]] Jordan.
