### 1
And the men [[H376]] of Ephraim [[H669]] gathered themselves together, [[H6817]] and went [[H5674]] northward, [[H6828]] and said [[H559]] unto Jephthah, [[H3316]] Wherefore [[H4069]] passedst thou over [[H5674]] to fight [[H3898]] against the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and didst not [[H3808]] call [[H7121]] us to go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] thee? we will burn [[H8313]] thine house [[H1004]] upon [[H5921]] thee with fire. [[H784]]

### 2
And Jephthah [[H3316]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I [[H589]] and my people [[H5971]] were [[H1961]] at great [[H3966]] strife [[H376]] with the children [[H1121]] of Ammon; [[H5983]] and when I called [[H2199]] you, ye delivered [[H3467]] me not [[H3808]] out of their hands. [[H3027]]

### 3
And when I saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] ye delivered [[H3467]] not, [[H369]] I put [[H7760]] my life [[H5315]] in my hands, [[H3709]] and passed over [[H5674]] against [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] them into my hand: [[H3027]] wherefore [[H4100]] then are ye come up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] me this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] to fight [[H3898]] against me? [[H3898]]

### 4
Then Jephthah [[H3316]] gathered together [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] and fought [[H3898]] with [[H854]] Ephraim: [[H669]] and the men [[H376]] of Gilead [[H1568]] smote [[H5221]] Ephraim, [[H669]] because [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] Ye [[H859]] Gileadites [[H1568]] fugitives [[H6412]] of Ephraim [[H669]] among [[H8432]] the Ephraimites, [[H669]] among [[H8432]] the Manassites. [[H4519]]

### 5
And the Gileadites [[H1568]] took [[H3920]] the passages [[H4569]] of Jordan [[H3383]] before the Ephraimites: [[H669]] and it was [[H1961]] that when [[H3588]] those Ephraimites [[H669]] which were escaped [[H6412]] said, [[H559]] Let me go over; [[H5674]] that the men [[H582]] of Gilead [[H1568]] said [[H559]] unto him, thou [[H859]] an Ephraimite? [[H673]] If he said, [[H559]] Nay; [[H3808]]

### 6
Then said [[H559]] they unto him, Say [[H559]] now [[H4994]] Shibboleth: [[H7641]] and he said [[H559]] Sibboleth: [[H5451]] for he could not [[H3808]] frame [[H3559]] to pronounce [[H1696]] right. [[H3651]] Then they took [[H270]] him, and slew [[H7819]] him at [[H413]] the passages [[H4569]] of Jordan: [[H3383]] and there fell [[H5307]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] of the Ephraimites [[H669]] forty [[H705]] and two [[H8147]] thousand. [[H505]]

### 7
And Jephthah [[H3316]] judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] six [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]] Then died [[H4191]] Jephthah [[H3316]] the Gileadite, [[H1569]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 8
And after [[H310]] him Ibzan [[H78]] of Bethlehem [[H1035]] judged [[H8199]] Israel. [[H3478]]
