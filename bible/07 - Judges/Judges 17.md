### 1
And there was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of mount [[H2022]] Ephraim, [[H669]] whose name [[H8034]] Micah. [[H4321]]

### 2
And he said [[H559]] unto his mother, [[H517]] The eleven hundred [[H505]] of silver [[H3701]] that [[H834]] were taken [[H3947]] from thee, about which thou [[H859]] cursedst, [[H422]] and spakest [[H559]] of also [[H1571]] in mine ears, [[H241]] behold, [[H2009]] the silver [[H3701]] with [[H854]] me; I [[H589]] took [[H3947]] it. And his mother [[H517]] said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] my son. [[H1121]]

### 3
And when he had restored [[H7725]] the eleven hundred [[H505]] of silver [[H3701]] to his mother, [[H517]] his mother [[H517]] said, [[H559]] I had wholly [[H6942]] dedicated [[H6942]] the silver [[H3701]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] from my hand [[H3027]] for my son, [[H1121]] to make [[H6213]] a graven image [[H6459]] and a molten image: [[H4541]] now [[H6258]] therefore I will restore [[H7725]] it unto thee. [[H7725]]

### 4
Yet he restored [[H7725]] the money [[H3701]] unto his mother; [[H517]] and his mother [[H517]] took [[H3947]] two hundred [[H3967]] of silver, [[H3701]] and gave [[H5414]] them to the founder, [[H6884]] who made [[H6213]] thereof a graven image [[H6459]] and a molten image: [[H4541]] and they were [[H1961]] in the house [[H1004]] of Micah. [[H4321]]

### 5
And the man [[H376]] Micah [[H4318]] had an house [[H1004]] of gods, [[H430]] and made [[H6213]] an ephod, [[H646]] and teraphim, [[H8655]] and consecrated [[H4390]] one [[H259]] of his sons, [[H1121]] who became [[H1961]] his priest. [[H3548]]

### 6
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Israel, [[H3478]] every man [[H376]] did [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]]

### 7
And there was [[H1961]] a young man [[H5288]] out of Bethlehem-judah [[H1035]] of the family [[H4940]] of Judah, [[H3063]] who [[H1931]] a Levite, [[H3881]] and he [[H1931]] sojourned [[H1481]] there. [[H8033]]

### 8
And the man [[H376]] departed [[H1980]] out of the city [[H5892]] from Bethlehem-judah [[H1035]] to sojourn [[H1481]] where [[H834]] he could find [[H4672]] and he came [[H935]] to mount [[H2022]] Ephraim [[H669]] to [[H5704]] the house [[H1004]] of Micah, [[H4318]] as he journeyed. [[H6213]]

### 9
And Micah [[H4318]] said [[H559]] unto him, Whence [[H370]] comest [[H935]] thou? And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I [[H595]] a Levite [[H3881]] of Bethlehem-judah, [[H1035]] and I [[H595]] go [[H1980]] to sojourn [[H1481]] where [[H834]] I may find [[H4672]]

### 10
And Micah [[H4318]] said [[H559]] unto him, Dwell [[H3427]] with [[H5978]] me, and be [[H1961]] unto me a father [[H1]] and a priest, [[H3548]] and I [[H595]] will give [[H5414]] thee ten [[H6235]] of silver [[H3701]] by the year, [[H3117]] and a suit [[H6187]] of apparel, [[H899]] and thy victuals. [[H4241]] So the Levite [[H3881]] went in. [[H1980]]

### 11
And the Levite [[H3881]] was content [[H2974]] to dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] the man; [[H376]] and the young man [[H5288]] was [[H1961]] unto him as one [[H259]] of his sons. [[H1121]]

### 12
And Micah [[H4318]] consecrated [[H4390]] the Levite; [[H3881]] and the young man [[H5288]] became [[H1961]] his priest, [[H3548]] and was [[H1961]] in the house [[H1004]] of Micah. [[H4318]]

### 13
Then said [[H559]] Micah, [[H4318]] Now [[H6258]] know [[H3045]] I that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will do me good, [[H3190]] seeing [[H3588]] I have [[H1961]] a Levite [[H3881]] to priest. [[H3548]]
