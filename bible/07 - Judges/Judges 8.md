### 1
And the men [[H376]] of Ephraim [[H669]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Why [[H4100]] hast thou served [[H6213]] us thus, [[H1697]] that thou calledst [[H7121]] us not, [[H1115]] when [[H3588]] thou wentest [[H1980]] to fight [[H3898]] with the Midianites? [[H4080]] And they did chide [[H7378]] with [[H854]] him sharply. [[H2394]]

### 2
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, What [[H4100]] have I done [[H6213]] now [[H6258]] in comparison of you? not [[H3808]] the gleaning [[H5955]] of the grapes of Ephraim [[H669]] better [[H2896]] than the vintage [[H1210]] of Abiezer? [[H44]]

### 3
God [[H430]] hath delivered [[H5414]] into your hands [[H3027]] the princes [[H8269]] of Midian, [[H4080]] Oreb [[H6159]] and Zeeb: [[H2062]] and what [[H4100]] was I able [[H3201]] to do [[H6213]] in comparison of you? Then [[H227]] their anger [[H7307]] was abated [[H7503]] toward [[H5921]] him, when he had said [[H1697]] that. [[H1696]]

### 4
And Gideon [[H1439]] came [[H935]] to Jordan, [[H3383]] passed over, [[H5674]] he, [[H1931]] and the three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him, faint, [[H5889]] yet pursuing [[H7291]]

### 5
And he said [[H559]] unto the men [[H582]] of Succoth, [[H5523]] Give, [[H5414]] I pray you, [[H4994]] loaves [[H3603]] of bread [[H3899]] unto the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] follow [[H7272]] me; for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] faint, [[H5889]] and I [[H595]] am pursuing [[H7291]] after [[H310]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] kings [[H4428]] of Midian. [[H4080]]

### 6
And the princes [[H8269]] of Succoth [[H5523]] said, [[H559]] the hands [[H3709]] of Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] now [[H6258]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] that [[H3588]] we should give [[H5414]] bread [[H3899]] unto thine army? [[H6635]]

### 7
And Gideon [[H1439]] said, [[H559]] Therefore [[H3651]] when the Lord [[H3068]] hath delivered [[H5414]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] into mine hand, [[H3027]] then I will tear [[H1758]] your flesh [[H1320]] with [[H854]] the thorns [[H6975]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] and with [[H854]] briers. [[H1303]]

### 8
And he went up [[H5927]] thence [[H8033]] to Penuel, [[H6439]] and spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them likewise: [[H2063]] and the men [[H376]] of Penuel [[H6439]] answered [[H6030]] him as [[H834]] the men [[H376]] of Succoth [[H5523]] had answered [[H6030]]

### 9
And he spake [[H559]] also [[H1571]] unto the men [[H376]] of Penuel, [[H6439]] saying, [[H559]] When I come again [[H7725]] in peace, [[H7965]] I will break down [[H5422]] this [[H2088]] tower. [[H4026]]

### 10
Now Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] in Karkor, [[H7174]] and their hosts [[H4264]] with [[H5973]] them, about fifteen [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] all [[H3605]] that were left [[H3498]] of all [[H3605]] the hosts [[H4264]] of the children [[H1121]] of the east: [[H6924]] for there fell [[H5307]] an hundred [[H3967]] and twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] sword. [[H2719]]

### 11
And Gideon [[H1439]] went up [[H5927]] by the way [[H1870]] of them that dwelt [[H7931]] in tents [[H168]] on the east [[H6924]] of Nobah [[H5025]] and Jogbehah, [[H3011]] and smote [[H5221]] the host: [[H4264]] for the host [[H4264]] was [[H1961]] secure. [[H983]]

### 12
And when Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] fled, [[H5127]] he pursued [[H7291]] after [[H310]] them, and took [[H3920]] the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of Midian, [[H4080]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] and discomfited [[H2729]] all [[H3605]] the host. [[H4264]]

### 13
And Gideon [[H1439]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] returned [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] battle [[H4421]] before [[H4608]] the sun [[H2775]]

### 14
And caught [[H3920]] a young man [[H5288]] of the men [[H582]] of Succoth, [[H5523]] and inquired [[H7592]] of him: and he described [[H3789]] unto [[H413]]  him [[H853]] the princes [[H8269]] of Succoth, [[H5523]] and the elders [[H2205]] thereof, threescore and seventeen [[H7657]] men. [[H376]]

### 15
And he came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Succoth, [[H5523]] and said, [[H559]] Behold [[H2009]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] with whom [[H834]] ye did upbraid [[H2778]] me, saying, [[H559]] the hands [[H3709]] of Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] now [[H6258]] in thine hand, [[H3027]] that [[H3588]] we should give [[H5414]] bread [[H3899]] unto thy men [[H376]] weary? [[H3287]]

### 16
And he took [[H3947]] the elders [[H2205]] of the city, [[H5892]] and thorns [[H6975]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] and briers, [[H1303]] and with them he taught [[H3045]] the men [[H376]] of Succoth. [[H5523]]

### 17
And he beat down [[H5422]] the tower [[H4026]] of Penuel, [[H6439]] and slew [[H2026]] the men [[H376]] of the city. [[H5892]]

### 18
Then said [[H559]] he unto [[H413]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] What manner [[H375]] of men [[H376]] whom [[H834]] ye slew [[H2026]] at Tabor? [[H8396]] And they answered, [[H559]] As thou [[H3644]] so they; each one [[H259]] resembled [[H8389]] the children [[H1121]] of a king. [[H4428]]

### 19
And he said, [[H559]] They [[H1992]] my brethren, [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of my mother: [[H517]] the Lord [[H3068]] liveth, [[H2416]] if [[H3863]] ye had saved them alive, [[H2421]] I would not [[H3808]] slay [[H2026]] you. [[H2026]]

### 20
And he said [[H559]] unto Jether [[H3500]] his firstborn, [[H1060]] Up, [[H6965]] slay [[H2026]] them. But the youth [[H5288]] drew [[H8025]] not [[H3808]] his sword: [[H2719]] for [[H3588]] he feared, [[H3372]] because [[H3588]] he yet [[H5750]] a youth. [[H5288]]

### 21
Then Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna [[H6759]] said, [[H559]] Rise [[H6965]] thou, [[H859]] and fall [[H6293]] upon us: for [[H3588]] as the man [[H376]] his strength. [[H1369]] And Gideon [[H1439]] arose, [[H6965]] and slew [[H2026]] Zebah [[H2078]] and Zalmunna, [[H6759]] and took away [[H3947]] the ornaments [[H7720]] that [[H834]] on their camels' [[H1581]] necks. [[H6677]]

### 22
Then the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] Rule [[H4910]] thou over us, both [[H1571]] thou, [[H859]] and [[H1571]] thy son, [[H1121]] and thy son's [[H1121]] son [[H1121]] also: [[H1571]] for [[H3588]] thou hast delivered [[H3467]] us from the hand [[H3027]] of Midian. [[H4080]]

### 23
And Gideon [[H1439]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I [[H589]] will not [[H3808]] rule [[H4910]] over you, neither [[H3808]] shall my son [[H1121]] rule [[H4910]] over you: the Lord [[H3068]] shall rule [[H4910]] over you. [[H4910]]

### 24
And Gideon [[H1439]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, I would desire [[H7592]] a request [[H7596]] of [[H4480]] you, that ye would give [[H5414]] me every man [[H376]] the earrings [[H5141]] of his prey. [[H7998]] (For [[H3588]] they had golden [[H2091]] earrings, [[H5141]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] Ishmaelites.) [[H3459]]

### 25
And they answered, [[H559]] We will willingly [[H5414]] give [[H5414]] And they spread [[H6566]] a garment, [[H8071]] and did cast [[H7993]] therein [[H8033]] every man [[H376]] the earrings [[H5141]] of his prey. [[H7998]]

### 26
And the weight [[H4948]] of the golden [[H2091]] earrings [[H5141]] that [[H834]] he requested [[H7592]] was [[H1961]] a thousand [[H505]] and seven [[H7651]] hundred [[H3967]] of gold; [[H2091]] beside [[H905]] ornaments, [[H7720]] and collars, [[H5188]] and purple [[H713]] raiment [[H899]] that on [[H5921]] the kings [[H4428]] of Midian, [[H4080]] and beside [[H905]] the chains [[H6060]] that [[H834]] about their camels' [[H1581]] necks. [[H6677]]

### 27
And Gideon [[H1439]] made [[H6213]] an ephod [[H646]] thereof, and put [[H3322]] it in his city, [[H5892]] in Ophrah: [[H6084]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] went thither a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] it: which thing became [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] unto Gideon, [[H1439]] and to his house. [[H1004]]

### 28
Thus was Midian [[H4080]] subdued [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] so that they lifted up [[H5375]] their heads [[H7218]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H3254]] And the country [[H776]] was in quietness [[H8252]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] in the days [[H3117]] of Gideon. [[H1439]]

### 29
And Jerubbaal [[H3378]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] went [[H1980]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in his own house. [[H1004]]

### 30
And Gideon [[H1439]] had [[H1961]] threescore and ten [[H7657]] sons [[H1121]] of his body [[H3409]] begotten: [[H3318]] for [[H3588]] he had [[H1961]] many [[H7227]] wives. [[H802]]

### 31
And his concubine [[H6370]] that [[H834]] in Shechem, [[H7927]] she [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] bare [[H3205]] him a son, [[H1121]] whose name [[H8034]] he called [[H7760]] Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 32
And Gideon [[H1439]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] died [[H4191]] in a good [[H2896]] old age, [[H7872]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the sepulchre [[H6913]] of Joash [[H3101]] his father, [[H1]] in Ophrah [[H6084]] of the Abi-ezrites. [[H33]]

### 33
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as soon as [[H834]] Gideon [[H1439]] was dead, [[H4191]] that the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] turned again, [[H7725]] and went a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] Baalim, [[H1168]] and made [[H7760]] Baal-berith [[H1170]] their god. [[H430]]

### 34
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] remembered [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] who had delivered [[H5337]] them out of the hands [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] their enemies [[H341]] on every side: [[H5439]]

### 35
Neither [[H3808]] shewed [[H6213]] they kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] the house [[H1004]] of Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] Gideon, [[H1439]] according to all [[H3605]] the goodness [[H2896]] which [[H834]] he had shewed [[H6213]] unto [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]
