### 1
And an angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal [[H1537]] to [[H413]] Bochim, [[H1066]] and said, [[H559]] I made you to go up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and have brought [[H935]] you unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto your fathers; [[H1]] and I said, [[H559]] I will never [[H5769]] break [[H6565]] my covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] you. [[H854]]

### 2
And ye [[H859]] shall make [[H3772]] no [[H3808]] league [[H1285]] with the inhabitants [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] land; [[H776]] ye shall throw down [[H5422]] their altars: [[H4196]] but ye have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] my voice: [[H6963]] why [[H4100]] have ye done [[H6213]] this? [[H2063]]

### 3
Wherefore I also [[H1571]] said, [[H559]] I will not [[H3808]] drive them out [[H1644]] from before [[H6440]] you; but they shall be [[H1961]] in your sides, [[H6654]] and their gods [[H430]] shall be [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] unto you. [[H4170]]

### 4
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that the people [[H5971]] lifted up [[H5375]] their voice, [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 5
And they called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Bochim: [[H1066]] and they sacrificed [[H2076]] there [[H8033]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And when Joshua [[H3091]]  had let [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] every man [[H376]] unto his inheritance [[H5159]] to possess [[H3423]] the land. [[H776]]

### 7
And the people [[H5971]] served [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Joshua, [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the elders [[H2205]] that [[H834]] outlived [[H3117]] Joshua, [[H3091]] who [[H834]] had seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the great [[H1419]] works [[H4639]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
And Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] died, [[H4191]] an hundred [[H3967]] and ten [[H6235]] years [[H8141]] old. [[H1121]]

### 9
And they buried [[H6912]] him in the border [[H1366]] of his inheritance [[H5159]] in Timnath-heres, [[H8556]] in the mount [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] on the north side [[H6828]] of the hill [[H2022]] Gaash. [[H1608]]

### 10
And also [[H1571]] all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] generation [[H1755]] were gathered [[H622]] unto [[H413]] their fathers: [[H1]] and there arose [[H6965]] another [[H312]] generation [[H1755]] after [[H310]] them, which [[H834]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the Lord, [[H3068]] nor yet [[H1571]] the works [[H4639]] which [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] Baalim: [[H1168]]

### 12
And they forsook [[H5800]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] which brought them out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and followed [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] of the gods [[H430]] of the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] them, and bowed themselves [[H7812]] unto them, and provoked [[H3707]] the Lord [[H3068]] to anger. [[H3068]]

### 13
And they forsook [[H5800]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] Baal [[H1168]] and Ashtaroth. [[H6252]]

### 14
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was hot [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and he delivered [[H5414]] them into the hands [[H3027]] of spoilers [[H8154]] that spoiled [[H8155]] them, and he sold [[H4376]] them into the hands [[H3027]] of their enemies [[H341]] round about, [[H5439]] so that they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] any longer [[H5750]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] their enemies. [[H341]]

### 15
Whithersoever [[H3605]] they went out, [[H3318]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] against them for evil, [[H7451]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said, [[H1696]] and as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had sworn [[H7650]] unto them: and they were greatly [[H3966]] distressed. [[H3334]]

### 16
Nevertheless the Lord [[H3068]] raised up [[H6965]] judges, [[H8199]] which delivered [[H3467]] them out of the hand [[H3027]] of those that spoiled [[H8154]] them. [[H8154]]

### 17
And yet [[H1571]] they would not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] unto [[H413]] their judges, [[H8199]] but [[H3588]] they went a whoring [[H2181]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and bowed themselves [[H7812]] unto them: they turned [[H5493]] quickly [[H4118]] out of [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] which [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] walked in, [[H1980]] obeying [[H8085]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] they did [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] so. [[H3651]]

### 18
And when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] raised [[H6965]] them up judges, [[H8199]] then the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] the judge, [[H8199]] and delivered [[H3467]] them out of the hand [[H3027]] of their enemies [[H341]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the judge: [[H8199]] for [[H3588]] it repented [[H5162]] the Lord [[H3068]] because [[H6440]] of their groanings [[H5009]] by reason of them that oppressed [[H3905]] them and vexed [[H1766]] them. [[H1766]]

### 19
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the judge [[H8199]] was dead, [[H4191]] they returned, [[H7725]] and corrupted [[H7843]] more than their fathers, [[H1]] in following [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve [[H5647]] them, and to bow down [[H7812]] unto them; they ceased [[H5307]] not [[H3808]] from their own doings, [[H4611]] nor from their stubborn [[H7186]] way. [[H1870]]

### 20
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was hot [[H2734]] against Israel; [[H3478]] and he said, [[H559]] Because [[H3282]] that [[H834]] this [[H2088]] people [[H1471]] hath transgressed [[H5674]] my covenant [[H1285]] which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] their fathers, [[H1]] and have not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] unto my voice; [[H6963]]

### 21
I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] will not [[H3808]] henceforth [[H3254]] drive out [[H3423]] any [[H376]] from before [[H6440]] them of [[H4480]] the nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] left [[H5800]] when he died: [[H4191]]

### 22
That [[H4616]] through them I may prove [[H5254]] Israel, [[H3478]] whether they [[H1992]] will keep [[H8104]] the way [[H1870]] of the Lord [[H3068]] to walk [[H1980]] therein, as [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] did keep [[H8104]] or [[H518]] not. [[H3808]]

### 23
Therefore the Lord [[H3068]] left [[H3240]] those [[H428]] nations, [[H1471]] without [[H1115]] driving them out [[H3423]] hastily; [[H4118]] neither [[H3808]] delivered [[H5414]] he them into the hand [[H3027]] of Joshua. [[H3091]]
