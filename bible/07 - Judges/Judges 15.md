### 1
But it came to pass [[H1961]] within a while [[H3117]] after, in the time [[H3117]] of wheat [[H2406]] harvest, [[H7105]] that Samson [[H8123]] visited [[H6485]] his wife [[H802]] with a kid; [[H1423]] and he said, [[H559]] I will go in [[H935]] to [[H413]] my wife [[H802]] into the chamber. [[H2315]] But her father [[H1]] would not [[H3808]] suffer [[H5414]] him to go in. [[H935]]

### 2
And her father [[H1]] said, [[H559]] I verily [[H559]] thought [[H559]] that [[H3588]] thou hadst utterly [[H8130]] hated [[H8130]] her; therefore I gave [[H5414]] her to thy companion: [[H4828]] not [[H3808]] her younger [[H6996]] sister [[H269]] fairer [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] she? take [[H1961]] her, I pray thee, [[H4994]] instead [[H8478]] of her. [[H8478]]

### 3
And Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] concerning them, Now [[H6471]] shall I be more blameless [[H5352]] than the Philistines, [[H6430]] though [[H3588]] I [[H589]] do [[H6213]] them a displeasure. [[H7451]]

### 4
And Samson [[H8123]] went [[H1980]] and caught [[H3920]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] foxes, [[H7776]] and took [[H3947]] firebrands, [[H3940]] and turned [[H6437]] tail [[H2180]] to [[H413]] tail, [[H2180]] and put [[H7760]] a [[H259]] firebrand [[H3940]] in the midst [[H8432]] between [[H996]] two [[H8147]] tails. [[H2180]]

### 5
And when he had set [[H1197]] the brands [[H3940]] on fire, [[H784]] he let go [[H7971]] into the standing corn [[H7054]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and burnt up [[H1197]] both the shocks, [[H1430]] and also [[H5704]] the standing corn, [[H7054]] with [[H5704]] the vineyards [[H3754]] olives. [[H2132]]

### 6
Then the Philistines [[H6430]] said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] hath done [[H6213]] this? [[H2063]] And they answered, [[H559]] Samson, [[H8123]] the son in law [[H2860]] of the Timnite, [[H8554]] because [[H3588]] he had taken [[H3947]] his wife, [[H802]] and given [[H5414]] her to his companion. [[H4828]] And the Philistines [[H6430]] came up, [[H5927]] and burnt [[H8313]] her and her father [[H1]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 7
And Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] unto them, Though [[H518]] ye have done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] yet [[H3588]] will I be avenged [[H5358]] of you, and after that [[H310]] I will cease. [[H2308]]

### 8
And he smote [[H5221]] them hip [[H7785]] and [[H5921]] thigh [[H3409]] with a great [[H1419]] slaughter: [[H4347]] and he went down [[H3381]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in the top [[H5585]] of the rock [[H5553]] Etam. [[H5862]]

### 9
Then the Philistines [[H6430]] went up, [[H5927]] and pitched [[H2583]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and spread themselves [[H5203]] in Lehi. [[H3896]]

### 10
And the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] said, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] are ye come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] us? And they answered, [[H559]] To bind [[H631]] Samson [[H8123]] are we come up, [[H5927]] to do [[H6213]] to him as [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] to us. [[H6213]]

### 11
Then three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] went [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the top [[H5585]] of the rock [[H5553]] Etam, [[H5862]] and said [[H559]] to Samson, [[H8123]] Knowest [[H3045]] thou not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] the Philistines [[H6430]] rulers [[H4910]] over us? what [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] thou hast done [[H6213]] unto us? And he said [[H559]] unto them, As [[H834]] they did [[H6213]] unto me, so [[H3651]] have I done [[H6213]] unto them. [[H6213]]

### 12
And they said [[H559]] unto him, We are come down [[H3381]] to bind [[H631]] thee, that we may deliver [[H5414]] thee into the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] And Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] unto them, Swear [[H7650]] unto me, that [[H6435]] ye will not fall upon [[H6293]] me yourselves. [[H859]]

### 13
And they spake [[H559]] unto him, saying, [[H559]] No; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] we will bind [[H631]] thee fast, [[H631]] and deliver [[H5414]] thee into their hand: [[H3027]] but surely [[H4191]] we will not kill [[H4191]] thee. And they bound [[H631]] him with two [[H8147]] new [[H2319]] cords, [[H5688]] and brought him up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the rock. [[H5553]]

### 14
when he [[H1931]] came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] Lehi, [[H3896]] the Philistines [[H6430]] shouted [[H7321]] against [[H7125]] him: and the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came mightily [[H6743]] upon [[H5921]] him, and the cords [[H5688]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] his arms [[H2220]] became [[H1961]] as flax [[H6593]] that [[H834]] was burnt [[H1197]] with fire, [[H784]] and his bands [[H612]] loosed [[H4549]] from off [[H5921]] his hands. [[H3027]]

### 15
And he found [[H4672]] a new [[H2961]] jawbone [[H3895]] of an ass, [[H2543]] and put forth [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] and took [[H3947]] it, and slew [[H5221]] a thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] therewith. [[H376]]

### 16
And Samson [[H8123]] said, [[H559]] With the jawbone [[H3895]] of an ass, [[H2543]] heaps [[H2565]] upon heaps, [[H2565]] with the jaw [[H3895]] of an ass [[H2543]] have I slain [[H5221]] a thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 17
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when he had made an end [[H3615]] of speaking, [[H1696]] that he cast away [[H7993]] the jawbone [[H3895]] out of his hand, [[H3027]] and called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Ramath-lehi. [[H7437]]

### 18
And he was sore [[H3966]] athirst, [[H6770]] and called [[H7121]] on [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] hast given [[H5414]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] deliverance [[H8668]] into the hand [[H3027]] of thy servant: [[H5650]] and now [[H6258]] shall I die [[H4191]] for thirst, [[H6772]] and fall [[H5307]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the uncircumcised? [[H6189]]

### 19
But God [[H430]] clave [[H1234]] an hollow place [[H4388]] that [[H834]] in the jaw, [[H3895]] and there came [[H3318]] water [[H4325]] thereout; [[H4480]] and when he had drunk, [[H8354]] his spirit [[H7307]] came again, [[H7725]] and he revived: [[H2421]] wherefore [[H5921]] he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] thereof En-hakkore, [[H5875]] which [[H834]] in Lehi [[H3896]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 20
And he judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] in the days [[H3117]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] twenty [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]]
