### 1
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Midian [[H4080]] seven [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And the hand [[H3027]] of Midian [[H4080]] prevailed [[H5810]] against [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] because [[H6440]] of the Midianites [[H4080]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] made [[H6213]]  them [[H853]] the dens [[H4492]] which [[H834]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] and caves, [[H4631]] and strong holds. [[H4679]]

### 3
And it was, [[H1961]] when [[H518]] Israel [[H3478]] had sown, [[H2232]] that the Midianites [[H4080]] came up, [[H5927]] and the Amalekites, [[H6002]] and the children [[H1121]] of the east, [[H6924]] even they came up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] them; [[H5921]]

### 4
And they encamped [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] them, and destroyed [[H7843]] the increase [[H2981]] of the earth, [[H776]] till [[H5704]] thou come [[H935]] unto Gaza, [[H5804]] and left [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] sustenance [[H4241]] for Israel, [[H3478]] neither sheep, [[H7716]] nor ox, [[H7794]] nor ass. [[H2543]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] came up [[H5927]] with their cattle [[H4735]] and their tents, [[H168]] and they came [[H935]] as [[H1767]] grasshoppers [[H697]] for multitude; [[H7230]] both they [[H1992]] and their camels [[H1581]] were without [[H369]] number: [[H4557]] and they entered [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] to destroy [[H7843]] it. [[H7843]]

### 6
And Israel [[H3478]] was greatly [[H3966]] impoverished [[H1809]] because [[H6440]] of the Midianites; [[H4080]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] because [[H182]] of [[H5921]] the Midianites, [[H4080]]

### 8
That the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] a prophet [[H376]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which said [[H559]] unto them, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] I [[H595]] brought you up [[H5927]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] and brought you forth [[H3318]] out of the house [[H1004]] of bondage; [[H5650]]

### 9
And I delivered [[H5337]] you out of the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians, [[H4714]] and out of the hand [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] that oppressed [[H3905]] you, and drave them out [[H1644]] from before [[H6440]] you, and gave [[H5414]]  you [[H853]] their land; [[H776]]

### 10
And I said [[H559]] unto you, I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] fear [[H3372]] not [[H3808]] the gods [[H430]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] in whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] ye [[H859]] dwell: [[H3427]] but ye have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] my voice. [[H6963]]

### 11
And there came [[H935]] an angel [[H4397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and sat [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] an oak [[H424]] which [[H834]] in Ophrah, [[H6084]] that [[H834]] unto Joash [[H3101]] the Abi-ezrite: [[H33]] and his son [[H1121]] Gideon [[H1439]] threshed [[H2251]] wheat [[H2406]] by the winepress, [[H1660]] to hide [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] the Midianites. [[H4080]]

### 12
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] him, and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, The Lord [[H3068]] with [[H5973]] thee, thou mighty man [[H1368]] of valour. [[H2428]]

### 13
And Gideon [[H1439]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Oh [[H994]] my Lord, [[H113]] if the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H3426]] with [[H5973]] us, why [[H4100]] then is all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] befallen [[H4672]] us? and where [[H346]] all [[H3605]] his miracles [[H6381]] which [[H834]] our fathers [[H1]] told [[H5608]] us of, saying, [[H559]] Did not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] bring us up [[H5927]] from Egypt? [[H4714]] but now [[H6258]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath forsaken [[H5203]] us, and delivered [[H5414]] us into the hands [[H3709]] of the Midianites. [[H4080]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] looked [[H6437]] upon [[H413]] him, and said, [[H559]] Go [[H3212]] in this [[H2088]] thy might, [[H3581]] and thou shalt save [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] from the hand [[H3709]] of the Midianites: [[H4080]] have not [[H3808]] I sent [[H7971]] thee? [[H7971]]

### 15
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Oh [[H994]] my Lord, [[H136]] wherewith [[H4100]] shall I save [[H3467]] Israel? [[H3478]] behold, [[H2009]] my family [[H504]] poor [[H1800]] in Manasseh, [[H4519]] and I [[H595]] the least [[H6810]] in my father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 16
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Surely [[H3588]] I will be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee, and thou shalt smite [[H5221]] the Midianites [[H4080]] as one [[H259]] man. [[H376]]

### 17
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, If [[H518]] now [[H4994]] I have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] then shew [[H6213]] me a sign [[H226]] that thou [[H859]] talkest [[H1696]] with me. [[H5973]]

### 18
Depart [[H4185]] not [[H408]] hence, [[H2088]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] until [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee, and bring forth [[H3318]] my present, [[H4503]] and set [[H3240]] before [[H6440]] thee. And he said, [[H559]] I [[H595]] will tarry [[H3427]] until [[H5704]] thou come again. [[H7725]]

### 19
And Gideon [[H1439]] went in, [[H935]] and made ready [[H6213]] a kid, [[H5795]] and unleavened cakes [[H4682]] of an ephah [[H374]] of flour: [[H7058]] the flesh [[H1320]] he put [[H7760]] in a basket, [[H5536]] and he put [[H7760]] the broth [[H4839]] in a pot, [[H6517]] and brought out [[H3318]] unto [[H413]] him under [[H413]] the oak, [[H424]] and presented [[H5066]]

### 20
And the angel [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Take [[H3947]] the flesh [[H1320]] and the unleavened cakes, [[H4682]] and lay [[H3240]] upon [[H413]] this [[H1975]] rock, [[H5553]] and pour out [[H8210]] the broth. [[H4839]] And he did [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]]

### 21
Then the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] put forth [[H7971]] the end [[H7097]] of the staff [[H4938]] that [[H834]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and touched [[H5060]] the flesh [[H1320]] and the unleavened cakes; [[H4682]] and there rose up [[H5927]] fire [[H784]] out of [[H4480]] the rock, [[H6697]] and consumed [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] and the unleavened cakes. [[H4682]] Then the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] departed [[H1980]] out of his sight. [[H5869]]

### 22
And when Gideon [[H1439]] perceived [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] an angel [[H4397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] Gideon [[H1439]] said, [[H559]] Alas, [[H162]] O Lord [[H136]] God! [[H3069]] for [[H3588]] because [[H3651]] I have seen [[H7200]] an angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face. [[H6440]]

### 23
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto him, Peace [[H7965]] unto thee; fear [[H3372]] not: [[H408]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 24
Then Gideon [[H1439]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] there [[H8033]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and called [[H7121]] it Jehovah-shalom: [[H3068]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] it yet [[H5750]] in Ophrah [[H6084]] of the Abi-ezrites. [[H33]]

### 25
And it came to pass [[H1961]] the same [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] that the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto him, Take [[H3947]] thy father's [[H1]] young [[H6499]] bullock, [[H7794]] even the second [[H8145]] bullock [[H6499]] of seven [[H7651]] years old, [[H8141]] and throw down [[H2040]] the altar [[H4196]] of Baal [[H1168]] that [[H834]] thy father [[H1]] hath, and cut down [[H3772]] the grove [[H842]] that [[H834]] by [[H5921]] it: [[H5921]]

### 26
And build [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] upon [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of this [[H2088]] rock, [[H4581]] in the ordered place, [[H4634]] and take [[H3947]] the second [[H8145]] bullock, [[H6499]] and offer [[H5927]] a burnt sacrifice [[H5930]] with the wood [[H6086]] of the grove [[H842]] which [[H834]] thou shalt cut down. [[H3772]]

### 27
Then Gideon [[H1439]] took [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] of his servants, [[H5650]] and did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him: and it was, [[H1961]] because [[H834]] he feared [[H3372]] his father's [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] and the men [[H376]] of the city, [[H5892]] that he could not do [[H6213]] by day, [[H3119]] that he did [[H6213]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 28
And when the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] arose early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] behold, [[H2009]] the altar [[H4196]] of Baal [[H1168]] was cast down, [[H5422]] and the grove [[H842]] was cut down [[H3772]] that [[H834]] by [[H5921]] it, and the second [[H8145]] bullock [[H6499]] was offered [[H5927]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] built. [[H1129]]

### 29
And they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H7453]] Who [[H4310]] hath done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing? [[H1697]] And when they inquired [[H1875]] and asked, [[H1245]] they said, [[H559]] Gideon [[H1439]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] hath done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing. [[H1697]]

### 30
Then the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Joash, [[H3101]] Bring out [[H3318]] thy son, [[H1121]] that he may die: [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] he hath cast down [[H5422]] the altar [[H4196]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and because [[H3588]] he hath cut down [[H3772]] the grove [[H842]] that [[H834]] by [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 31
And Joash [[H3101]] said [[H559]] unto all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] stood [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] him, Will ye [[H859]] plead [[H7378]] for Baal? [[H1168]] will ye [[H859]] save [[H3467]] him? he that [[H834]] will plead [[H7378]] for him, let him be put to death [[H4191]] whilst [[H5704]] morning: [[H1242]] if [[H518]] he [[H1931]] a god, [[H430]] let him plead [[H7378]] for himself, because [[H3588]] hath cast down [[H5422]] his altar. [[H4196]]

### 32
Therefore on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] he called [[H7121]] him Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] saying, [[H559]] Let Baal [[H1168]] plead [[H7378]] against him, because [[H3588]] he hath thrown down [[H5422]] his altar. [[H4196]]

### 33
Then all [[H3605]] the Midianites [[H4080]] and the Amalekites [[H6002]] and the children [[H1121]] of the east [[H6924]] were gathered [[H622]] together, [[H3162]] and went over, [[H5674]] and pitched [[H2583]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 34
But the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came upon [[H3847]] Gideon, [[H1439]] and he blew [[H8628]] a trumpet; [[H7782]] and Abiezer [[H44]] was gathered [[H2199]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 35
And he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] throughout all [[H3605]] Manasseh; [[H4519]] who [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] was gathered [[H2199]] after [[H310]] him: and he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto Asher, [[H836]] and unto Zebulun, [[H2074]] and unto Naphtali; [[H5321]] and they came up [[H5927]] to meet [[H7125]] them. [[H7125]]

### 36
And Gideon [[H1439]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] If [[H518]] thou wilt [[H3426]] save [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] by mine hand, [[H3027]] as [[H834]] thou hast said, [[H1696]]

### 37
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will put [[H3322]] a fleece [[H1492]] of wool [[H6785]] in the floor; [[H1637]] if [[H518]] the dew [[H2919]] be [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the fleece [[H1492]] only, [[H905]] and dry [[H2721]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] then shall I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou wilt save [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] by mine hand, [[H3027]] as [[H834]] thou hast said. [[H1696]]

### 38
And it was [[H1961]] so: [[H3651]] for he rose up early [[H7925]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] and thrust together, [[H2115]] the fleece [[H1492]] and wringed [[H4680]] the dew [[H2919]] out of [[H4480]] the fleece, [[H1492]] a bowl [[H5602]] full [[H4393]] of water. [[H4325]]

### 39
And Gideon [[H1439]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] Let not [[H408]] thine anger [[H639]] be hot [[H2734]] against me, and I will speak [[H1696]] but [[H389]] this once: [[H6471]] let me prove, [[H5254]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] but [[H7535]] this once [[H6471]] with the fleece; [[H1492]] let it now [[H4994]] be [[H1961]] dry [[H2721]] only [[H905]] upon [[H413]] the fleece, [[H1492]] and upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the ground [[H776]] let there be [[H1961]] dew. [[H2919]]

### 40
And God [[H430]] did [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] that [[H1931]] night: [[H3915]] for it was [[H1961]] dry [[H2721]] upon [[H413]] the fleece [[H1492]] only, [[H905]] and there was [[H1961]] dew [[H2919]] on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the ground. [[H776]]
