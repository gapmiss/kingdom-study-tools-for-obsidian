### 1
And Samson [[H8123]] went down [[H3381]] to Timnath, [[H8553]] and saw [[H7200]] a woman [[H802]] in Timnath [[H8553]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 2
And he came up, [[H5927]] and told [[H5046]] his father [[H1]] and his mother, [[H517]] and said, [[H559]] I have seen [[H7200]] a woman [[H802]] in Timnath [[H8553]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of the Philistines: [[H6430]] now [[H6258]] therefore get [[H3947]] her for me to wife. [[H802]]

### 3
Then his father [[H1]] and his mother [[H517]] said [[H559]] unto him, never [[H369]] a woman [[H802]] among the daughters [[H1323]] of thy brethren, [[H251]] or among all [[H3605]] my people, [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] goest [[H1980]] to take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] of the uncircumcised [[H6189]] Philistines? [[H6430]] And Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] Get [[H3947]] her for me; for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] pleaseth me well. [[H3474]]

### 4
But his father [[H1]] and his mother [[H517]] knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] sought [[H1245]] an occasion [[H8385]] against the Philistines: [[H6430]] for at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had dominion [[H4910]] over Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Then went [[H3381]] Samson [[H8123]] down, and his father [[H1]] and his mother, [[H517]] to Timnath, [[H8553]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the vineyards [[H3754]] of Timnath: [[H8553]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a young [[H3715]] lion [[H738]] roared [[H7580]] against [[H7125]] him. [[H7125]]

### 6
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came mightily [[H6743]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he rent [[H8156]] him as he would have rent [[H8156]] a kid, [[H1423]] and nothing [[H3972]] in his hand: [[H3027]] but he told [[H5046]] not [[H3808]] his father [[H1]] or his mother [[H517]] what [[H834]] he had done. [[H6213]]

### 7
And he went down, [[H3381]] and talked [[H1696]] with the woman; [[H802]] and she pleased [[H3474]] Samson [[H8123]] well. [[H8123]]

### 8
And after a time [[H3117]] he returned [[H7725]] to take [[H3947]] her, and he turned aside [[H5493]] to see [[H7200]] the carcase [[H4658]] of the lion: [[H738]] and, behold, [[H2009]] a swarm [[H5712]] of bees [[H1682]] and honey [[H1706]] in the carcase [[H1472]] of the lion. [[H738]]

### 9
And he took [[H7287]] thereof in [[H413]] his hands, [[H3709]] and went on [[H1980]] eating, [[H398]] and came [[H1980]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] and mother, [[H517]] and he gave [[H5414]] them, and they did eat: [[H398]] but he told [[H5046]] not [[H3808]] them that [[H3588]] he had taken [[H7287]] the honey [[H1706]] out of the carcase [[H1472]] of the lion. [[H738]]

### 10
So his father [[H1]] went down [[H3381]] unto [[H413]] the woman: [[H802]] and Samson [[H8123]] made [[H6213]] there [[H8033]] a feast; [[H4960]] for [[H3588]] so [[H3651]] used the young men [[H970]] to do. [[H6213]]

### 11
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when they saw [[H7200]] him, that they brought [[H3947]] thirty [[H7970]] companions [[H4828]] to be [[H1961]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 12
And Samson [[H8123]] said [[H559]] unto them, I will now [[H4994]] put forth [[H2330]] a riddle [[H2420]] unto you: if [[H518]] ye can certainly [[H5046]] declare [[H5046]] it me within the seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] of the feast, [[H4960]] and find out, [[H4672]] then I will give [[H5414]] you thirty [[H7970]] sheets [[H5466]] and thirty [[H7970]] change [[H2487]] of garments: [[H899]]

### 13
But if [[H518]] ye cannot [[H3201]] declare [[H5046]] me, then shall ye [[H859]] give [[H5414]] me thirty [[H7970]] sheets [[H5466]] and thirty [[H7970]] change [[H2487]] of garments. [[H899]] And they said [[H559]] unto him, Put forth [[H2330]] thy riddle, [[H2420]] that we may hear [[H8085]] it. [[H8085]]

### 14
And he said [[H559]] unto them, Out of the eater [[H398]] came forth [[H3318]] meat, [[H3978]] and out of the strong [[H5794]] came forth [[H3318]] sweetness. [[H4966]] And they could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] in three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] expound [[H5046]] the riddle. [[H2420]]

### 15
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] that they said [[H559]] unto Samson's [[H8123]] wife, [[H802]] Entice [[H6601]] thy husband, [[H376]] that he may declare [[H5046]]  unto us [[H853]] the riddle, [[H2420]] lest [[H6435]] we burn [[H8313]] thee and thy father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] with fire: [[H784]] have ye called [[H7121]] us to take that we have? [[H3423]] not [[H3808]]

### 16
And Samson's [[H8123]] wife [[H802]] wept [[H1058]] before [[H5921]] him, and said, [[H559]] Thou dost but [[H7535]] hate [[H8130]] me, and lovest [[H157]] me not: [[H3808]] thou hast put forth [[H2330]] a riddle [[H2420]] unto the children [[H1121]] of my people, [[H5971]] and hast not [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] me. And he said [[H559]] unto her, Behold, [[H2009]] I have not [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] my father [[H1]] nor my mother, [[H517]] and shall I tell [[H5046]] thee? [[H5046]]

### 17
And she wept [[H1058]] before [[H5921]] him the seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] while [[H834]] their feast [[H4960]] lasted: [[H1961]] and it came to pass [[H1961]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] that he told [[H5046]] her, because [[H3588]] she lay sore [[H6693]] upon him: and she told [[H5046]] the riddle [[H2420]] to the children [[H1121]] of her people. [[H5971]]

### 18
And the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] said [[H559]] unto him on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] before [[H2962]] the sun [[H2775]] went down, [[H935]] What [[H4100]] sweeter [[H4966]] than honey? [[H1706]] and what [[H4100]] stronger [[H5794]] than a lion? [[H738]] And he said [[H559]] unto them, If [[H3884]] ye had not plowed [[H2790]] with my heifer, [[H5697]] ye had not [[H3808]] found out [[H4672]] my riddle. [[H2420]]

### 19
And the Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H6743]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he went down [[H3381]] to Ashkelon, [[H831]] and slew [[H5221]] thirty [[H7970]] men [[H376]] of them, and took [[H3947]] their spoil, [[H2488]] and gave [[H5414]] change [[H2487]] of garments unto them which expounded [[H5046]] the riddle. [[H2420]] And his anger [[H639]] was kindled, [[H2734]] and he went up [[H5927]] to his father's [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 20
But Samson's [[H8123]] wife [[H802]] was [[H1961]] to his companion, [[H4828]] whom [[H834]] he had used as his friend. [[H7462]]
