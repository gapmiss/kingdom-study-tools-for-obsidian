And David [[H1732]] assembled [[H6950]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the princes [[H8269]] of the tribes, [[H7626]] and the captains [[H8269]] of the companies [[H4256]] that ministered [[H8334]] to the king [[H4428]] by course, and the captains [[H8269]] over the thousands, [[H505]] and captains [[H8269]] over the hundreds, [[H3967]] and the stewards [[H8269]] over all [[H3605]] the substance [[H7399]] and possession [[H4735]] of the king, [[H4428]] and of his sons, [[H1121]] with [[H5973]] the officers, [[H5631]] and with the mighty men, [[H1368]] and with all [[H3605]] the valiant men, [[H2428]] unto [[H413]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 2
Then David [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] stood up [[H6965]] upon [[H5921]] his feet, [[H7272]] and said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] me, my brethren, [[H251]] and my people: [[H5971]] I [[H589]] in [[H5973]] mine heart [[H3824]] to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] of rest [[H4496]] for the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and for the footstool [[H1916]] of our God, [[H430]] and had made ready [[H3559]] for the building: [[H1129]]

### 3
But God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto me, Thou shalt not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for my name, [[H8034]] because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] a man [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] and hast shed [[H8210]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 4
Howbeit the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] chose [[H977]] me before all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of my father [[H1]] to be [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] for ever: [[H5769]] for [[H3588]] he hath chosen [[H977]] Judah [[H3063]] the ruler; [[H5057]] and of the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the house [[H1004]] of my father; [[H1]] and among the sons [[H1121]] of my father [[H1]] he liked [[H7521]] me to make king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]]

### 5
And of all [[H3605]] my sons, [[H1121]] (for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]] me many [[H7227]] sons,) [[H1121]] he hath chosen [[H977]] Solomon [[H8010]] my son [[H1121]] to sit [[H3427]] upon [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of the kingdom [[H4438]] of the Lord [[H3068]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
And he said [[H559]] unto me, Solomon [[H8010]] thy son, [[H1121]] he [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] my house [[H1004]] and my courts: [[H2691]] for [[H3588]] I have chosen [[H977]] him my son, [[H1121]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] his father. [[H1]]

### 7
Moreover I will establish [[H3559]] his kingdom [[H4438]] for ever, [[H5769]] if [[H518]] he be constant [[H2388]] to do [[H6213]] my commandments [[H4687]] and my judgments, [[H4941]] as at this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 8
Now [[H6258]] therefore in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and in the audience [[H241]] of our God, [[H430]] keep [[H8104]] and seek [[H1875]] for all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]] that [[H4616]] ye may possess [[H3423]] this good [[H2896]] land, [[H776]] and leave for an inheritance [[H5157]] for your children [[H1121]] after [[H310]] you for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 9
And thou, [[H859]] Solomon [[H8010]] my son, [[H1121]] know [[H3045]]  thou [[H853]] the God [[H430]] of thy father, [[H1]] and serve [[H5647]] him with a perfect [[H8003]] heart [[H3820]] and with a willing [[H2655]] mind: [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] searcheth [[H1875]] all [[H3605]] hearts, [[H3824]] and understandeth [[H995]] all [[H3605]] the imaginations [[H3336]] of the thoughts: [[H4284]] if [[H518]] thou seek [[H1875]] him, he will be found [[H4672]] of thee; but if [[H518]] thou forsake [[H5800]] him, he will cast thee off [[H2186]] for ever. [[H5703]]

### 10
Take heed [[H7200]] now; [[H6258]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath chosen [[H977]] thee to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for the sanctuary: [[H4720]] be strong, [[H2388]] and do [[H6213]]
