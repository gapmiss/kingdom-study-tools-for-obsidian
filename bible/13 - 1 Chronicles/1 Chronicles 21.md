### 1
And Satan [[H7854]] stood up [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and provoked [[H5496]] David [[H1732]] to number [[H4487]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab [[H3097]] and to [[H413]] the rulers [[H8269]] of the people, [[H5971]] Go, [[H1980]] number [[H5608]] Israel [[H3478]] from Beer-sheba [[H884]] even to [[H5704]] Dan; [[H1835]] and bring [[H935]] the number [[H4557]] of them to [[H413]] me, that I may know [[H3045]]

### 3
And Joab [[H3097]] answered, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] make his people [[H5971]] an hundred [[H3967]] times [[H6471]] so many more [[H3254]] as they [[H1992]] but, my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] they not [[H3808]] all [[H3605]] my lord's [[H113]] servants? [[H5650]] why [[H4100]] then doth my lord [[H113]] require [[H1245]] this thing? [[H2063]] why [[H4100]] will he be [[H1961]] a cause of trespass [[H819]] to Israel? [[H3478]]

### 4
Nevertheless the king's [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] prevailed [[H2388]] against [[H5921]] Joab. [[H3097]] Wherefore Joab [[H3097]] departed, [[H3318]] and went [[H1980]] throughout all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and came [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 5
And Joab [[H3097]] gave [[H5414]] the sum [[H4557]] of the number [[H4662]] of the people [[H5971]] unto [[H413]] David. [[H1732]] And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] were [[H1961]] a thousand [[H505]] thousand [[H505]] and an hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] sword: [[H2719]] and Judah [[H3063]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] threescore and ten [[H7657]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] that drew [[H8025]] sword. [[H2719]]

### 6
But Levi [[H3878]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] counted [[H6485]] he not [[H3808]] among [[H8432]] them: for [[H3588]] the king's [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] was abominable [[H8581]] to Joab. [[H3097]]

### 7
And God [[H430]] was displeased [[H3415]] with [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] thing; [[H1697]] therefore he smote [[H5221]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] I have sinned [[H2398]] greatly, [[H3966]] because [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing: [[H1697]] but now, [[H6258]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] do away [[H5674]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of thy servant; [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I have done very [[H3966]] foolishly. [[H5528]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Gad, [[H1410]] David's [[H1732]] seer, [[H2374]] saying, [[H559]]

### 10
Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H1696]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] I [[H589]] offer [[H5186]] thee three [[H7969]] choose [[H977]] thee one [[H259]] of them, [[H2007]] that I may do [[H6213]] unto thee. [[H6213]]

### 11
So Gad [[H1410]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and said [[H559]] unto him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Choose [[H6901]] thee [[H6901]]

### 12
Either [[H518]] three [[H7969]] years' [[H8141]] famine; [[H7458]] or [[H518]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] to be destroyed [[H5595]] before [[H6440]] thy foes, [[H6862]] while that the sword [[H2719]] of thine enemies [[H341]] overtaketh [[H5381]] or else [[H518]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] the sword [[H2719]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] even the pestilence, [[H1698]] in the land, [[H776]] and the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] destroying [[H7843]] throughout all [[H3605]] the coasts [[H1366]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Now [[H6258]] therefore advise [[H7200]] thyself what [[H4100]] word [[H1697]] I shall bring again [[H7725]] to him that sent me. [[H7971]]

### 13
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Gad, [[H1410]] I am in a great [[H3966]] strait: [[H6887]] let me fall [[H5307]] now [[H4994]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] very [[H3966]] great [[H7227]] his mercies: [[H7356]] but let me not [[H408]] fall [[H5307]] into the hand [[H3027]] of man. [[H120]]

### 14
So the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H5414]] pestilence [[H1698]] upon Israel: [[H3478]] and there fell [[H5307]] of Israel [[H3478]] seventy [[H7657]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 15
And God [[H430]] sent [[H7971]] an angel [[H4397]] unto Jerusalem [[H3389]] to destroy [[H7843]] it: and as he was destroying, [[H7843]] the Lord [[H3068]] beheld, [[H7200]] and he repented him [[H5162]] of [[H5921]] the evil, [[H7451]] and said [[H559]] to the angel [[H4397]] that destroyed, [[H7843]] It is enough, [[H7227]] stay [[H7503]] now [[H6258]] thine hand. [[H3027]] And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] stood [[H5975]] by [[H5973]] the threshingfloor [[H1637]] of Ornan [[H771]] the Jebusite. [[H2983]]

### 16
And David [[H1732]] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] stand [[H5975]] between [[H996]] the earth [[H776]] and the heaven, [[H8064]] having a drawn [[H8025]] sword [[H2719]] in his hand [[H3027]] stretched out [[H5186]] over [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Then David [[H1732]] and the elders [[H2205]] clothed [[H3680]] in sackcloth, [[H8242]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] their faces. [[H6440]]

### 17
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] not [[H3808]] I [[H589]] commanded [[H559]] the people [[H5971]] to be numbered? [[H4487]] even I [[H589]] it [[H1931]] is that [[H834]] have sinned [[H2398]] and done evil [[H7489]] indeed; [[H7489]] but these [[H428]] sheep, [[H6629]] what [[H4100]] have they done? [[H6213]] let thine hand, [[H3027]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] be [[H1961]] on me, and on my father's [[H1]] house; [[H1004]] but not [[H3808]] on thy people, [[H5971]] that they should be plagued. [[H4046]]

### 18
Then the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H559]] Gad [[H1410]] to say [[H559]] to David, [[H1732]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] should go up, [[H5927]] and set up [[H6965]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] in the threshingfloor [[H1637]] of Ornan [[H771]] the Jebusite. [[H2983]]

### 19
And David [[H1732]] went up [[H5927]] at the saying [[H1697]] of Gad, [[H1410]] which [[H834]] he spake [[H1696]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
And Ornan [[H771]] turned back, [[H7725]] and saw [[H7200]] the angel; [[H4397]] and his four [[H702]] sons [[H1121]] with [[H5973]] him hid themselves. [[H2244]] Now Ornan [[H771]] was threshing [[H1758]] wheat. [[H2406]]

### 21
And as David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Ornan, [[H771]] Ornan [[H771]] looked [[H5027]] and saw [[H7200]] David, [[H1732]] and went out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the threshingfloor, [[H1637]] and bowed himself [[H7812]] to David [[H1732]] with face [[H639]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 22
Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ornan, [[H771]] Grant [[H5414]] me the place [[H4725]] of threshingfloor, [[H1637]] that I may build [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] therein unto the Lord: [[H3068]] thou shalt grant [[H5414]] it me for the full [[H4392]] price: [[H3701]] that the plague [[H4046]] may be stayed [[H6113]] from [[H5921]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 23
And Ornan [[H771]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Take [[H3947]] to thee, and let my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] do [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] in his eyes: [[H5869]] lo, [[H7200]] I give [[H5414]] the oxen [[H1241]] for burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and the threshing instruments [[H4173]] for wood, [[H6086]] and the wheat [[H2406]] for the meat offering; [[H4503]] I give [[H5414]] it all. [[H3605]]

### 24
And king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Ornan, [[H771]] Nay; [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] I will verily [[H7069]] buy [[H7069]] it for the full [[H4392]] price: [[H3701]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] take [[H5375]] which [[H834]] thine for the Lord, [[H3068]] nor offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] without cost. [[H2600]]

### 25
So David [[H1732]] gave [[H5414]] to Ornan [[H771]] for the place [[H4725]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] of gold [[H2091]] by weight. [[H4948]]

### 26
And David [[H1732]] built [[H1129]] there [[H8033]] an altar [[H4196]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings, [[H8002]] and called [[H7121]] upon [[H413]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and he answered [[H6030]] him from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] by fire [[H784]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 27
And the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H559]] the angel; [[H4397]] and he put up his sword [[H2719]] again [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the sheath [[H5084]] thereof. [[H5084]]

### 28
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] when David [[H1732]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had answered [[H6030]] him in the threshingfloor [[H1637]] of Ornan [[H771]] the Jebusite, [[H2983]] then he sacrificed [[H2076]] there. [[H8033]]

### 29
For the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] made [[H6213]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and the altar [[H4196]] of the burnt offering, [[H5930]] at that [[H1931]] season [[H6256]] in the high place [[H1116]] at Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 30
But David [[H1732]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] it to inquire [[H1875]] of God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] he was afraid [[H1204]] because [[H6440]] of the sword [[H2719]] of the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
