### 1
Then David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] This [[H2088]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] and this [[H2088]] the altar [[H4196]] of the burnt offering [[H5930]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] commanded [[H559]] to gather together [[H3664]] the strangers [[H1616]] that [[H834]] in the land [[H776]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and he set [[H5975]] masons [[H2672]] to hew [[H2672]] wrought [[H1496]] stones [[H68]] to build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

### 3
And David [[H1732]] prepared [[H3559]] iron [[H1270]] in abundance [[H7230]] for the nails [[H4548]] for the doors [[H1817]] of the gates, [[H8179]] and for the joinings; [[H4226]] and brass [[H5178]] in abundance [[H7230]] without [[H369]] weight; [[H4948]]

### 4
Also cedar [[H730]] trees [[H6086]] in abundance: [[H369]] for [[H3588]] the Zidonians [[H6722]] and they of Tyre [[H6876]] brought [[H935]] much [[H7230]] cedar [[H730]] wood [[H6086]] to David. [[H1732]]

### 5
And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Solomon [[H8010]] my son [[H1121]] young [[H5288]] and tender, [[H7390]] and the house [[H1004]] to be builded [[H1129]] for the Lord [[H3068]] exceeding [[H4605]] magnifical, [[H1431]] of fame [[H8034]] and of glory [[H8597]] throughout all [[H3605]] countries: [[H776]] I will now [[H4994]] make preparation [[H3559]] for it. So David [[H1732]] prepared [[H3559]] abundantly [[H7230]] before [[H6440]] his death. [[H4194]]

### 6
Then he called [[H7121]] for Solomon [[H8010]] his son, [[H1121]] and charged [[H6680]] him to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Solomon, [[H8010]] My son, [[H1121]] as for me, [[H589]] it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] my mind [[H3824]] to build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] unto the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] my God: [[H430]]

### 8
But the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H5921]] me, saying, [[H559]] Thou hast shed [[H8210]] blood [[H1818]] abundantly, [[H7230]] and hast made [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] wars: [[H4421]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] unto my name, [[H8034]] because [[H3588]] thou hast shed [[H8210]] much [[H7227]] blood [[H1818]] upon the earth [[H776]] in my sight. [[H6440]]

### 9
Behold, [[H2009]] a son [[H1121]] shall be born [[H3205]] to thee, who [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of rest; [[H4496]] and I will give him rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] his enemies [[H341]] round about: [[H5439]] for [[H3588]] his name [[H8034]] shall be [[H1961]] Solomon, [[H8010]] and I will give [[H5414]] peace [[H7965]] and quietness [[H8253]] unto [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in his days. [[H3117]]

### 10
He [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] an house [[H1004]] for my name; [[H8034]] and he [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] my son, [[H1121]] and I [[H589]] his father; [[H1]] and I will establish [[H3559]] the throne [[H3678]] of his kingdom [[H4438]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 11
Now, [[H6258]] my son, [[H1121]] the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee; and prosper [[H6743]] thou, and build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] as [[H834]] he hath said [[H1696]] of [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 12
Only [[H389]] the Lord [[H3068]] give [[H5414]] thee wisdom [[H7922]] and understanding, [[H998]] and give thee charge [[H6680]] concerning [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] that thou mayest keep [[H8104]] the law [[H8451]] of the Lord [[H3068]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 13
Then [[H227]] shalt thou prosper, [[H6743]] if [[H518]] thou takest heed [[H8104]] to fulfil [[H6213]] the statutes [[H2706]] and judgments [[H4941]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] charged [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] with concerning [[H5921]] Israel: [[H3478]] be strong, [[H2388]] and of good courage; [[H553]] dread [[H3372]] not, [[H408]] nor [[H408]] be dismayed. [[H2865]]

### 14
Now, behold, [[H2009]] in my trouble [[H6040]] I have prepared [[H3559]] for the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] an hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]] and a thousand [[H505]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of silver; [[H3701]] and of brass [[H5178]] and iron [[H1270]] without [[H369]] weight; [[H4948]] for [[H3588]] it is [[H1961]] in abundance: [[H7230]] timber [[H6086]] also and stone [[H68]] have I prepared; [[H3559]] and thou mayest add [[H3254]] thereto. [[H5921]]

### 15
Moreover workmen [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] thee in abundance, [[H7230]] hewers [[H2672]] and workers [[H2796]] of stone [[H68]] and timber, [[H6086]] and all manner [[H3605]] of cunning men [[H2450]] for every manner [[H3605]] of work. [[H4399]]

### 16
Of the gold, [[H2091]] the silver, [[H3701]] and the brass, [[H5178]] and the iron, [[H1270]] no [[H369]] number. [[H4557]] Arise [[H6965]] and be doing, [[H6213]] and the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 17
David [[H1732]] also commanded [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] of Israel [[H3478]] to help [[H5826]] Solomon [[H8010]] his son, [[H1121]]

### 18
not [[H3808]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] you? and hath he given you rest [[H5117]] on every side? [[H5439]] for [[H3588]] he hath given [[H5414]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] into mine hand; [[H3027]] and the land [[H776]] is subdued [[H3533]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and before [[H6440]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 19
Now [[H6258]] set [[H5414]] your heart [[H3824]] and your soul [[H5315]] to seek [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] arise [[H6965]] therefore, and build [[H1129]]  ye [[H853]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] to bring [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and the holy [[H6944]] vessels [[H3627]] of God, [[H430]] into the house [[H1004]] that is to be built [[H1129]] to the name [[H8034]] of the Lord.
