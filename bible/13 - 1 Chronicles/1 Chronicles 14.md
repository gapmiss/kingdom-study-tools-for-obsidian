### 1
Now Hiram [[H2438]] king [[H4428]] of Tyre [[H6865]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and timber [[H6086]] of cedars, [[H730]] with masons [[H7023]] and carpenters, [[H2796]] to build [[H1129]] him an house. [[H1004]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] perceived [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had confirmed [[H3559]] him king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] his kingdom [[H4438]] was lifted up [[H5375]] on high, [[H4605]] because of [[H5668]] his people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] more [[H5750]] wives [[H802]] at Jerusalem: [[H3389]] and David [[H1732]] begat [[H3205]] more [[H5750]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

### 4
Now these [[H428]] the names [[H8034]] of children [[H3205]] which [[H834]] he had [[H1961]] in Jerusalem; [[H3389]] Shammua, [[H8051]] and Shobab, [[H7727]] Nathan, [[H5416]] and Solomon, [[H8010]]

### 5
And Ibhar, [[H2984]] and Elishua, [[H474]] and Elpalet, [[H467]]

### 6
And Nogah, [[H5052]] and Nepheg, [[H5298]] and Japhia, [[H3309]]

### 7
And Elishama, [[H476]] and Beeliada, [[H1182]] and Eliphalet. [[H467]]

### 8
And when the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] was anointed [[H4886]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the Philistines [[H6430]] went up [[H5927]] to seek [[H1245]] David. [[H1732]] And David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] and went out [[H3318]] against [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 9
And the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] and spread [[H6584]] themselves in the valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 10
And David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of God, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]] Shall I go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] the Philistines? [[H6430]] and wilt thou deliver [[H5414]] them into mine hand? [[H3027]] And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto him, Go up; [[H5927]] for I will deliver [[H5414]] them into thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
So they came up [[H5927]] to Baal-perazim; [[H1188]] and David [[H1732]] smote [[H5221]] them there. [[H8033]] Then David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] God [[H430]] hath broken in [[H6555]] upon mine enemies [[H341]] by mine hand [[H3027]] like the breaking forth [[H6556]] of waters: [[H4325]] therefore [[H5921]] they called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Baal-perazim. [[H1188]]

### 12
And when they had left [[H5800]] their gods [[H430]] there, [[H8033]] David [[H1732]] gave a commandment, [[H559]] and they were burned [[H8313]] with fire. [[H784]]

### 13
And the Philistines [[H6430]] yet [[H5750]] again [[H3254]] spread themselves abroad [[H6584]] in the valley. [[H6010]]

### 14
Therefore David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] again [[H5750]] of God; [[H430]] and God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto him, Go not up [[H5927]] after [[H310]] them; turn away [[H5437]] from [[H5921]] them, and come [[H935]] upon them over against [[H4136]] the mulberry trees. [[H1057]]

### 15
And it shall be, [[H1961]] when thou shalt hear [[H8085]] a sound [[H6963]] of going [[H6807]] in the tops [[H7218]] of the mulberry trees, [[H1057]] then [[H227]] thou shalt go out [[H3318]] to battle: [[H4421]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] is gone forth [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] thee to smite [[H5221]] the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 16
David [[H1732]] therefore did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] God [[H430]] commanded [[H6680]] him: and they smote [[H5221]] the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] from Gibeon [[H1391]] even to [[H5704]] Gazer. [[H1507]]

### 17
And the fame [[H8034]] of David [[H1732]] went out [[H3318]] into all [[H3605]] lands; [[H776]] and the Lord [[H3068]] brought [[H5414]] the fear [[H6343]] of him upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] nations. [[H1471]]
