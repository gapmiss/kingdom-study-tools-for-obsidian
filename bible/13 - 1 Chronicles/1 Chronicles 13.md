### 1
And David [[H1732]] consulted [[H3289]] with [[H5973]] the captains [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and hundreds, [[H3967]] with every [[H3605]] leader. [[H5057]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] unto all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] If [[H518]] good [[H2895]] unto [[H5921]] you, and of [[H4480]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] let us send [[H7971]] abroad [[H6555]] unto [[H5921]] our brethren [[H251]] every where, left [[H7604]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and with [[H5973]] them to the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] in their cities [[H5892]] suburbs, [[H4054]] that they may gather themselves [[H6908]] unto [[H413]] us: [[H413]]

### 3
And let us bring again [[H5437]] the ark [[H727]] of our God [[H430]] to [[H413]] us: for [[H3588]] we inquired [[H1875]] not [[H3808]] at it in the days [[H3117]] of Saul. [[H7586]]

### 4
And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] said [[H559]] that they would do so: [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] the thing [[H1697]] was right [[H3474]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 5
So David [[H1732]] gathered together, [[H6950]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] from [[H4480]] Shihor [[H7883]] of Egypt [[H4714]] even unto [[H5704]] the entering [[H935]] of Hemath, [[H2574]] to bring [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] from Kirjath-jearim. [[H7157]]

### 6
And David [[H1732]] went up, [[H5927]] and all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] to Baalah, [[H1173]] to [[H413]] Kirjath-jearim, [[H7157]] which [[H834]] to Judah, [[H3063]] to bring up [[H5927]] thence [[H8033]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that dwelleth [[H3427]] the cherubims, [[H3742]] whose [[H834]] name [[H8034]] is called [[H7121]]

### 7
And they carried [[H7392]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] in [[H5921]] a new [[H2319]] cart [[H5699]] out of the house [[H1004]] of Abinadab: [[H41]] and Uzza [[H5798]] and Ahio [[H283]] drave [[H5090]] the cart. [[H5699]]

### 8
And David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] played [[H7832]] before [[H6440]] God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] might, [[H5797]] and with singing, [[H7892]] and with harps, [[H3658]] and with psalteries, [[H5035]] and with timbrels, [[H8596]] and with cymbals, [[H4700]] and with trumpets. [[H2689]]

### 9
And when they came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] the threshingfloor [[H1637]] of Chidon, [[H3592]] Uzza [[H5798]] put forth [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] to hold [[H270]] the ark; [[H727]] for [[H3588]] the oxen [[H1241]] stumbled. [[H8058]]

### 10
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Uzza, [[H5798]] and he smote [[H5221]] him, because [[H5921]] he put [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] to [[H5921]] the ark: [[H727]] and there [[H8033]] he died [[H4191]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]]

### 11
And David [[H1732]] was displeased, [[H2734]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] had made [[H6555]] a breach [[H6556]] upon Uzza: [[H5798]] wherefore that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] is called [[H7121]] Perez-uzza [[H6560]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 12
And David [[H1732]] was afraid [[H3372]] of God [[H430]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saying, [[H559]] How [[H1963]] shall I bring [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] to me? [[H854]]

### 13
So David [[H1732]] brought [[H5493]] not [[H3808]] the ark [[H727]] to [[H413]] himself to [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] but carried it aside [[H5186]] into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] the Gittite. [[H1663]]

### 14
And the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] remained [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the family [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] in his house [[H1004]] three [[H7969]] months. [[H2320]] And the Lord [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom, [[H5654]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he had. [[H834]]
