### 1
Now it came to pass, [[H1961]] as [[H834]] David [[H1732]] sat [[H3427]] in his house, [[H1004]] that David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] Lo, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] dwell [[H3427]] in an house [[H1004]] of cedars, [[H730]] but the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] under [[H8478]] curtains. [[H3407]]

### 2
Then Nathan [[H5416]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] Do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] in thine heart; [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 3
And it came to pass [[H1961]] the same [[H1931]] night, [[H3915]] that the word [[H1697]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Nathan, [[H5416]] saying, [[H559]]

### 4
Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] David [[H1732]] my servant, [[H5650]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Thou [[H859]] shalt not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] me an house [[H1004]] to dwell in: [[H3427]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] dwelt in [[H3427]] an house [[H1004]] since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] I brought up [[H5927]] Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day; [[H3117]] but have gone [[H1961]] from tent [[H168]] to [[H413]] tent, [[H168]] and from tabernacle [[H4908]]

### 6
Wheresoever [[H3605]] I have walked [[H1980]] with all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] spake [[H1696]] I a word [[H1697]] to [[H854]] any [[H259]] of the judges [[H8199]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] to feed [[H7462]] my people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] have ye not [[H3808]] built [[H1129]] me an house [[H1004]] of cedars? [[H730]]

### 7
Now [[H6258]] therefore thus [[H3541]] shalt thou say [[H559]] unto my servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] I [[H589]] took [[H3947]] thee from [[H4480]] the sheepcote, [[H5116]] from [[H4480]] following [[H310]] the sheep, [[H6629]] that thou shouldest be [[H1961]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel: [[H3478]]

### 8
And I have been [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] thee whithersoever [[H3605]] thou hast walked, [[H1980]] and have cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] thine enemies [[H341]] from before [[H6440]] thee, and have made [[H6213]] thee a name [[H8034]] like the name [[H8034]] of the great men [[H1419]] that [[H834]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 9
Also I will ordain [[H7760]] a place [[H4725]] for my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and will plant [[H5193]] them, and they shall dwell [[H7931]] in their place, [[H8478]] and shall be moved [[H7264]] no [[H3808]] more; [[H5750]] neither [[H3808]] shall the children [[H1121]] of wickedness [[H5766]] waste [[H1086]] them any more, [[H3254]] as [[H834]] at the beginning, [[H7223]]

### 10
And since the time [[H3117]] that [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] judges [[H8199]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] Moreover I will subdue [[H3665]] all [[H3605]] thine enemies. [[H341]] Furthermore I tell [[H5046]] thee that the Lord [[H3068]] will build [[H1129]] thee an house. [[H1004]]

### 11
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] thy days [[H3117]] be expired [[H4390]] that thou must go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] thy fathers, [[H1]] that I will raise up [[H6965]] thy seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] thee, which [[H834]] shall be [[H1961]] of thy sons; [[H1121]] and I will establish [[H3559]] his kingdom. [[H4438]]

### 12
He [[H1931]] shall build [[H1129]] me an house, [[H1004]] and I will stablish [[H3559]] his throne [[H3678]] for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 13
I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] his father, [[H1]] and he [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] my son: [[H1121]] and I will not [[H3808]] take [[H5493]] my mercy [[H2617]] away from [[H5973]] him, as [[H834]] I took [[H5493]] from that [[H834]] was [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] thee: [[H6440]]

### 14
But I will settle [[H5975]] him in mine house [[H1004]] and in my kingdom [[H4438]] for ever: [[H5769]] and his throne [[H3678]] shall be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] for [[H5704]] evermore. [[H5769]]

### 15
According to all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] and according to all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] vision, [[H2377]] so [[H3651]] did Nathan [[H5416]] speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] David. [[H1732]]

### 16
And David [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] came [[H935]] and sat [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] I, [[H589]] O Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] and what [[H4310]] mine house, [[H1004]] that [[H3588]] thou hast brought [[H935]] me hitherto? [[H1988]]

### 17
And this [[H2063]] was a small thing [[H6994]] in thine eyes, [[H5869]] O God; [[H430]] for thou hast spoken [[H1696]] of [[H5921]] thy servant's [[H5650]] house [[H1004]] for a great while to come, [[H7350]] and hast regarded [[H7200]] me according to the estate [[H8448]] of a man [[H120]] of high degree, [[H4609]] O Lord [[H3068]] God. [[H430]]

### 18
What [[H4100]] can David [[H1732]] more [[H3254]] to [[H413]] thee for the honour [[H3519]]  of [[H853]] thy servant? [[H5650]] for thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] thy servant. [[H5650]]

### 19
O Lord, [[H3068]] for thy servant's [[H5650]] sake, [[H5668]] and according to thine own heart, [[H3820]] hast thou done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] greatness, [[H1420]] in making known [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] great things. [[H1420]]

### 20
O Lord, [[H3068]] none [[H369]] like thee, [[H3644]] neither [[H369]] God [[H430]] beside [[H2108]] thee, according to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] we have heard [[H8085]] with our ears. [[H241]]

### 21
And what [[H4310]] one [[H259]] nation [[H1471]] in the earth [[H776]] like thy people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] God [[H430]] went [[H1980]] to redeem [[H6299]] his own people, [[H5971]] to make [[H7760]] thee a name [[H8034]] of greatness [[H1420]] and terribleness, [[H3372]] by driving out [[H1644]] nations [[H1471]] from before [[H6440]] thy people, [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] thou hast redeemed [[H6299]] out of Egypt? [[H4714]]

### 22
For [[H853]] thy people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] didst thou make [[H5414]] thine own people [[H5971]] for [[H5704]] ever; [[H5769]] and thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H3068]] becamest [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]]

### 23
Therefore now, [[H6258]] Lord, [[H3068]] let the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] thou hast spoken [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] thy servant [[H5650]] and concerning [[H5921]] his house [[H1004]] be established [[H539]] for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] and do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] thou hast said. [[H1696]]

### 24
Let it even be established, [[H539]] that thy name [[H8034]] may be magnified [[H1431]] for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] saying, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] a God [[H430]] to Israel: [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] thy servant [[H5650]] established [[H3559]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] O my God, [[H430]] hast told [[H1540]] thy servant [[H5650]] that thou wilt build [[H1129]] him an house: [[H1004]] therefore [[H5921]] thy servant [[H5650]] hath found [[H4672]] to pray [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 26
And now, [[H6258]] Lord, [[H3068]] thou [[H859]] art God, [[H430]] and hast promised [[H1696]] this [[H2063]] goodness [[H2896]] unto [[H5921]] thy servant: [[H5650]]

### 27
Now [[H6258]] therefore let it please [[H2974]] thee to bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of thy servant, [[H5650]] that it may be [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] thee for ever: [[H5769]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] blessest, [[H1288]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and blessed [[H1288]] for ever. [[H5769]]
