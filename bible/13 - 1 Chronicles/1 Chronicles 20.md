And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that after [[H6256]] the year [[H8141]] was expired, [[H8666]] at the time [[H6256]] that kings [[H4428]] go out [[H3318]] Joab [[H3097]] led forth [[H5090]] the power [[H2428]] of the army, [[H6635]] and wasted [[H7843]] the country [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon, [[H5983]] and came [[H935]] and besieged [[H6696]] Rabbah. [[H7237]] But David [[H1732]] tarried [[H3427]] at Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And Joab [[H3097]] smote [[H5221]] Rabbah, [[H7237]] and destroyed [[H2040]] it. [[H2040]]

And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the crown [[H5850]] of their king [[H4428]] from off [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and found [[H4672]] it to weigh [[H4948]] a talent [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]] and precious [[H3368]] stones [[H68]] in it; and it was set [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] David's [[H1732]] head: [[H7218]] and he brought [[H3318]] also exceeding [[H3966]] much [[H7235]] spoil [[H7998]] out of the city. [[H5892]]

And he brought out [[H3318]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] in it, and cut [[H7787]] with saws, [[H4050]] and with harrows [[H2757]] of iron, [[H1270]] and with axes. [[H4050]] Even so [[H3651]] dealt [[H6213]] David [[H1732]] with all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]] And David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 4
And it came to pass [[H1961]] after this, [[H310]] that there arose [[H5975]] war [[H4421]] at Gezer [[H1507]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines; [[H6430]] at which time [[H227]] Sibbechai [[H5444]] the Hushathite [[H2843]] slew [[H5221]] Sippai, [[H5598]] of the children [[H3211]] of the giant: [[H7497]] and they were subdued. [[H3665]]

### 5
And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] again [[H5750]] with [[H854]] the Philistines; [[H6430]] and Elhanan [[H445]] the son [[H1121]] of Jair [[H3265]] slew [[H5221]] Lahmi [[H3902]] the brother [[H251]] of Goliath [[H1555]] the Gittite, [[H1663]] whose spear [[H2595]] staff [[H6086]] like a weaver's [[H707]] beam. [[H4500]]

### 6
And yet again [[H5750]] there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] at Gath, [[H1661]] where was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of stature, [[H4060]] whose fingers and toes [[H676]] four [[H702]] and twenty, [[H6242]] six [[H8337]] and six [[H8337]] and he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] was the son [[H3205]] of the giant. [[H7497]]

### 7
But when he defied [[H2778]] Israel, [[H3478]] Jonathan [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Shimea [[H8092]] David's [[H1732]] brother [[H251]] slew [[H5221]] him. [[H5221]]

### 8
These [[H411]] were born [[H3205]] unto the giant [[H7497]] in Gath; [[H1661]] and they fell [[H5307]] by the hand [[H3027]] of David, [[H1732]] and by the hand [[H3027]] of his servants. [[H5650]]
