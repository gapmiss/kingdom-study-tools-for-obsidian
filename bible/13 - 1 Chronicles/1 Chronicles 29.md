### 1
Furthermore David [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] unto all [[H3605]] the congregation, [[H6951]] Solomon [[H8010]] my son, [[H1121]] whom alone [[H259]] God [[H430]] hath chosen, [[H977]] young [[H5288]] and tender, [[H7390]] and the work [[H4399]] great: [[H1419]] for [[H3588]] the palace [[H1002]] not [[H3808]] for man, [[H120]] but [[H3588]] for the Lord [[H3068]] God. [[H430]]

### 2
Now I have prepared [[H3559]] with all [[H3605]] my might [[H3581]] for the house [[H1004]] of my God [[H430]] the gold [[H2091]] for of gold, [[H2091]] and the silver [[H3701]] for of silver, [[H3701]] and the brass [[H5178]] for of brass, [[H5178]] the iron [[H1270]] for of iron, [[H1270]] and wood [[H6086]] for of wood; [[H6086]] onyx [[H7718]] stones, [[H68]] and to be set, [[H4394]] glistering [[H6320]] stones, [[H68]] and of divers colours, [[H7553]] and all manner [[H3605]] of precious [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] and marble [[H7893]] stones [[H68]] in abundance. [[H7230]]

### 3
Moreover, [[H5750]] because I have set my affection [[H7521]] to the house [[H1004]] of my God, [[H430]] I have [[H3426]] of mine own proper good, [[H5459]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver, [[H3701]] I have given [[H5414]] to the house [[H1004]] of my God, [[H430]] over and above [[H4605]] all [[H3605]] that I have prepared [[H3559]] for the holy [[H6944]] house, [[H1004]]

### 4
three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]] of the gold [[H2091]] of Ophir, [[H211]] and seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of refined [[H2212]] silver, [[H3701]] to overlay [[H2902]] the walls [[H7023]] of the houses [[H1004]]

### 5
The gold [[H2091]] for of gold, [[H2091]] and the silver [[H3701]] for of silver, [[H3701]] and for all manner [[H3605]] of work [[H4399]] by the hands [[H3027]] of artificers. [[H2796]] And who [[H4310]] is willing [[H5068]] to consecrate [[H4390]] his service [[H3027]] this day [[H3117]] unto the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 6
Then the chief [[H8269]] of the fathers [[H1]] and princes [[H8269]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the captains [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of hundreds, [[H3967]] with the rulers [[H8269]] of the king's [[H4428]] work, [[H4399]] offered willingly, [[H5068]]

### 7
And gave [[H5414]] for the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] of gold [[H2091]] five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] and ten thousand [[H7239]] drams, [[H150]] and of silver [[H3701]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] talents, [[H3603]] and of brass [[H5178]] eighteen [[H8083]] thousand [[H505]] talents, [[H3603]] and one hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of iron. [[H1270]]

### 8
And they with [[H854]] whom stones [[H68]] were found [[H4672]] gave [[H5414]] to the treasure [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] by [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of Jehiel [[H3171]] the Gershonite. [[H1649]]

### 9
Then the people [[H5971]] rejoiced, [[H8055]] for [[H5921]] that they offered willingly, [[H5068]] because [[H3588]] with perfect [[H8003]] heart [[H3820]] they offered willingly [[H5068]] to the Lord: [[H3068]] and David [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] also [[H1571]] rejoiced [[H8055]] with great [[H1419]] joy. [[H8057]]

### 10
Wherefore David [[H1732]] blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] before [[H5869]] all [[H3605]] the congregation: [[H6951]] and David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Blessed [[H1288]] thou, [[H859]] Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] our father, [[H1]] for [[H5704]] ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5769]]

### 11
Thine, O Lord, [[H3068]] the greatness, [[H1420]] and the power, [[H1369]] and the glory, [[H8597]] and the victory, [[H5331]] and the majesty: [[H1935]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] in the heaven [[H8064]] and in the earth [[H776]] thine the kingdom, [[H4467]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and thou art exalted [[H4984]] as head [[H7218]] above all. [[H3605]]

### 12
Both riches [[H6239]] and honour [[H3519]] of [[H6440]] thee, and thou [[H859]] reignest [[H4910]] over all; [[H3605]] and in thine hand [[H3027]] power [[H3581]] and might; [[H1369]] and in thine hand [[H3027]] to make great, [[H1431]] and to give strength [[H2388]] unto all. [[H3605]]

### 13
Now [[H6258]] therefore, our God, [[H430]] we [[H587]] thank [[H3034]] thee, and praise [[H1984]] thy glorious [[H8597]] name. [[H8034]]

### 14
But [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] I, [[H589]] and what [[H4310]] my people, [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] we should be [[H6113]] able [[H3581]] to offer so willingly [[H5068]] after this sort? [[H2063]] for [[H3588]] all things [[H3605]] of [[H4480]] thee, and of thine own [[H3027]] have we given [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] we [[H587]] strangers [[H1616]] before [[H6440]] thee, and sojourners, [[H8453]] as all [[H3605]] our fathers: [[H1]] our days [[H3117]] on [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] as a shadow, [[H6738]] and none [[H369]] abiding. [[H4723]]

### 16
O Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] store [[H1995]] that [[H834]] we have prepared [[H3559]] to build [[H1129]] thee an house [[H1004]] for thine holy [[H6944]] name [[H8034]] of thine hand, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] thine own. [[H3605]]

### 17
I know [[H3045]] also, my God, [[H430]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] triest [[H974]] the heart, [[H3824]] and hast pleasure [[H7521]] in uprightness. [[H3476]] As for me, [[H589]] in the uprightness [[H4339]] of mine heart [[H3824]] I have willingly offered [[H5068]] all [[H3605]] these things: [[H428]] and now [[H6258]] have I seen [[H7200]] with joy [[H8057]] thy people, [[H5971]] which are present [[H4672]] here, [[H6311]] to offer willingly [[H5068]] unto thee. [[H5068]]

### 18
O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and of Israel, [[H3478]] our fathers, [[H1]] keep [[H8104]] this [[H2063]] for ever [[H5769]] in the imagination [[H3336]] of the thoughts [[H4284]] of the heart [[H3824]] of thy people, [[H5971]] and prepare [[H3559]] their heart [[H3824]] unto [[H413]] thee: [[H413]]

### 19
And give [[H5414]] unto Solomon [[H8010]] my son [[H1121]] a perfect [[H8003]] heart, [[H3824]] to keep [[H8104]] thy commandments, [[H4687]] thy testimonies, [[H5715]] and thy statutes, [[H2706]] and to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] and to build [[H1129]] the palace, [[H1002]] the which [[H834]] I have made provision. [[H3559]]

### 20
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to all [[H3605]] the congregation, [[H6951]] Now [[H4994]] bless [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H6951]] blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] and bowed down their heads, [[H6915]] and worshipped [[H7812]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and the king. [[H4428]]

### 21
And they sacrificed [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] on the morrow [[H4283]] after that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] a thousand [[H505]] bullocks, [[H6499]] a thousand [[H505]] rams, [[H352]] a thousand [[H505]] lambs, [[H3532]] with their drink offerings, [[H5262]] and sacrifices [[H2077]] in abundance [[H7230]] for all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]]

### 22
And did eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] with great [[H1419]] gladness. [[H8057]] And they made Solomon [[H8010]] the son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] king [[H4427]] the second time, [[H8145]] and anointed [[H4886]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] the chief governor, [[H5057]] and Zadok [[H6659]] priest. [[H3548]]

### 23
Then Solomon [[H8010]] sat on [[H3427]] the throne [[H3678]] of the Lord [[H3068]] as king [[H4428]] instead of [[H8478]] David [[H1732]] his father, [[H1]] and prospered; [[H6743]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] obeyed [[H8085]] him. [[H413]]

### 24
And all [[H3605]] the princes, [[H8269]] and the mighty men, [[H1368]] and all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] likewise [[H1571]] of king [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] submitted [[H5414]] themselves [[H3027]] unto [[H8478]] Solomon [[H8010]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 25
And the Lord [[H3068]] magnified [[H1431]] Solomon [[H8010]] exceedingly [[H4605]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and bestowed [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] him royal [[H4438]] majesty [[H1935]] as [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] been [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] any [[H3605]] king [[H4428]] before [[H6440]] him in [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 26
Thus David [[H1732]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
And the time [[H3117]] that [[H834]] he reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] forty [[H705]] years; [[H8141]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] reigned [[H4427]] he in Hebron, [[H2275]] and thirty [[H7970]] and three [[H7969]] reigned [[H4427]] he in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 28
And he died [[H4191]] in a good [[H2896]] old age, [[H7872]] full [[H7649]] of days, [[H3117]] riches, [[H6239]] and honour: [[H3519]] and Solomon [[H8010]] his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 29
Now the acts [[H1697]] of David [[H1732]] the king, [[H4428]] first [[H7223]] and last, [[H314]] behold, [[H2009]] they written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the book [[H1697]] of Samuel [[H8050]] the seer, [[H7200]] and in [[H5921]] the book [[H1697]] of Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and in [[H5921]] the book [[H1697]] of Gad [[H1410]] the seer, [[H2374]]

### 30
With [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] his reign [[H4438]] and his might, [[H1369]] and the times [[H6256]] that [[H834]] went over [[H5674]] him, and over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the countries. [[H776]]
