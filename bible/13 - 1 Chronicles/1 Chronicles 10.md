### 1
Now the Philistines [[H6430]] fought [[H3898]] against Israel; [[H3478]] and the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] fled [[H5127]] from before [[H6440]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and fell down [[H5307]] slain [[H2491]] in mount [[H2022]] Gilboa. [[H1533]]

### 2
And the Philistines [[H6430]] followed hard [[H1692]] after [[H310]] Saul, [[H7586]] and after [[H310]] his sons; [[H1121]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] slew [[H5221]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] and Abinadab, [[H41]] and Malchi-shua, [[H4444]] the sons [[H1121]] of Saul. [[H7586]]

### 3
And the battle [[H4421]] went sore [[H3513]] against [[H5921]] Saul, [[H7586]] and the archers [[H3384]] hit [[H4672]] him, and he was wounded [[H2342]] of [[H4480]] the archers. [[H3384]]

### 4
Then said [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] to [[H413]] his armourbearer, [[H5375]] Draw [[H8025]] thy sword, [[H2719]] and thrust me through [[H1856]] therewith; lest [[H6435]] these [[H428]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] come [[H935]] and abuse [[H5953]] me. But his armourbearer [[H5375]] would [[H14]] not; [[H3808]] for [[H3588]] he was sore [[H3966]] afraid. [[H3372]] So Saul [[H7586]] took [[H3947]] a sword, [[H2719]] and fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 5
And when his armourbearer [[H5375]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] was dead, [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] fell [[H5307]] likewise [[H1571]] on [[H5921]] the sword, [[H2719]] and died. [[H4191]]

### 6
So Saul [[H7586]] died, [[H4191]] and his three [[H7969]] sons, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] his house [[H1004]] died [[H4191]] together. [[H3162]]

### 7
And when all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] in the valley [[H6010]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they fled, [[H5127]] and that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] and his sons [[H1121]] were dead, [[H4191]] then they forsook [[H5800]] their cities, [[H5892]] and fled: [[H5127]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] and dwelt [[H3427]] in them. [[H3427]]

### 8
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H4283]] when the Philistines [[H6430]] came [[H935]] to strip [[H6584]] the slain, [[H2491]] that they found [[H4672]] Saul [[H7586]] and his sons [[H1121]] fallen [[H5307]] in mount [[H2022]] Gilboa. [[H1533]]

### 9
And when they had stripped [[H6584]] him, they took [[H5375]] his head, [[H7218]] and his armour, [[H3627]] and sent [[H7971]] into the land [[H776]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] round about, [[H5439]] to carry tidings [[H1319]] unto their idols, [[H6091]] and to the people. [[H5971]]

### 10
And they put [[H7760]] his armour [[H3627]] in the house [[H1004]] of their gods, [[H430]] and fastened [[H8628]] his head [[H1538]] in the temple [[H1004]] of Dagon. [[H1712]]

### 11
And when all [[H3605]] Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had done [[H6213]] to Saul, [[H7586]]

### 12
They arose, [[H6965]] all [[H3605]] the valiant [[H2428]] men, [[H376]] and took away [[H5375]] the body [[H1480]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and the bodies [[H1480]] of his sons, [[H1121]] and brought [[H935]] them to Jabesh, [[H3003]] and buried [[H6912]] their bones [[H6106]] under [[H8478]] the oak [[H424]] in Jabesh, [[H3003]] and fasted [[H6684]] seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]

### 13
So Saul [[H7586]] died [[H4191]] for his transgression [[H4604]] which [[H834]] he committed [[H4603]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] against [[H5921]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he kept [[H8104]] not, [[H3808]] and also [[H1571]] for asking [[H7592]] of a familiar spirit, [[H178]] to inquire [[H1875]]

### 14
And inquired [[H1875]] not [[H3808]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] therefore he slew [[H4191]] him, and turned [[H5437]] the kingdom [[H4410]] unto David [[H1732]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse. [[H3448]]
