And said [[H559]] unto them, Ye [[H859]] the chief [[H7218]] of the fathers [[H1]] of the Levites: [[H3881]] sanctify yourselves, [[H6942]] ye [[H859]] and your brethren, [[H251]] that ye may bring up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] I have prepared [[H3559]] for it. [[H3559]]

### 13
For because [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] not [[H3808]] at the first, [[H7223]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] made a breach [[H6555]] upon us, for [[H3588]] that we sought [[H1875]] him not [[H3808]] after the due order. [[H4941]]

### 14
So the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites [[H3881]] sanctified themselves [[H6942]] to bring up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

And the children [[H1121]] of the Levites [[H3881]] bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] upon their shoulders [[H3802]] with the staves [[H4133]] thereon, [[H5921]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

[[H8057]]

### 17
So the Levites [[H3881]] appointed [[H5975]] Heman [[H1968]] the son [[H1121]] of Joel; [[H3100]] and of [[H4480]] his brethren, [[H251]] Asaph [[H623]] the son [[H1121]] of Berechiah; [[H1296]] and of [[H4480]] the sons [[H1121]] of Merari [[H4847]] their brethren, [[H251]] Ethan [[H387]] the son [[H1121]] of Kushaiah; [[H6984]]

So the singers, [[H7891]] Heman, [[H1968]] Asaph, [[H623]] and Ethan, [[H387]] to sound [[H8085]] with cymbals [[H4700]] of brass; [[H5178]]

### 20
And Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Aziel, [[H5815]] and Shemiramoth, [[H8070]] and Jehiel, [[H3171]] and Unni, [[H6042]] and Eliab, [[H446]] and Maaseiah, [[H4641]] and Benaiah, [[H1141]] with psalteries [[H5035]] on [[H5921]] Alamoth; [[H5961]]

### 21
And Mattithiah, [[H4993]] and Elipheleh, [[H466]] and Mikneiah, [[H4737]] and Obed-edom, [[H5654]] and Jeiel, [[H3273]] and Azaziah, [[H5812]] with harps [[H3658]] on [[H5921]] the Sheminith [[H8067]] to excel. [[H5329]]

### 22
And Chenaniah, [[H3663]] chief [[H8269]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] for song: [[H4853]] he instructed [[H3256]] about the song, [[H4853]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] skilful. [[H995]]

### 23
And Berechiah [[H1296]] and Elkanah [[H511]] doorkeepers [[H7778]] for the ark. [[H727]]

### 24
And Shebaniah, [[H7645]] and Jehoshaphat, [[H3146]] and Nethaneel, [[H5417]] and Amasai, [[H6022]] and Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Benaiah, [[H1141]] and Eliezer, [[H461]] the priests, [[H3548]] did blow [[H2690]] with the trumpets [[H2689]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of God: [[H430]] and Obed-edom [[H5654]] and Jehiah [[H3174]] doorkeepers [[H7778]] for the ark. [[H727]]

### 25
So [[H1961]] David, [[H1732]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the captains [[H8269]] over thousands, [[H505]] went [[H1980]] to bring up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] out of [[H4480]] the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] with joy. [[H8057]]

### 26
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when God [[H430]] helped [[H5826]] the Levites [[H3881]] that bare [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] that they offered [[H2076]] seven [[H7651]] bullocks [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams. [[H352]]

### 27

[[H906]]

### 28
Thus all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] brought up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with shouting, [[H8643]] and with sound [[H6963]] of the cornet, [[H7782]] and with trumpets, [[H2689]] and with cymbals, [[H4700]] making a noise [[H8085]] with psalteries [[H5035]] and harps. [[H3658]]

### 29
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the city [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] that Michal [[H4324]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Saul [[H7586]] looking out [[H8259]] at [[H1157]] a window [[H2474]] saw [[H7200]] king [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] dancing [[H7540]] and playing: [[H7832]] and she despised [[H959]] him in her heart.
