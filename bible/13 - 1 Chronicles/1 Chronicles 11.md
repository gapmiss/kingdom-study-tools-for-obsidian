### 1
Then all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] gathered themselves [[H6908]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] unto Hebron, [[H2275]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] thy bone [[H6106]] and thy flesh. [[H1320]]

### 2
And moreover [[H1571]] in time [[H8543]] past, [[H8032]] even [[H1571]] when Saul [[H7586]] was [[H1961]] king, [[H4428]] thou [[H859]] he that leddest out [[H3318]] and broughtest in [[H935]] Israel: [[H3478]] and the Lord [[H3068]] thy God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto thee, Thou [[H859]] shalt feed [[H7462]] my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and thou [[H859]] shalt be [[H1961]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] my people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
Therefore came [[H935]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] to Hebron; [[H2275]] and David [[H1732]] made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with them in Hebron [[H2275]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and they anointed [[H4886]] David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] by [[H3027]] Samuel. [[H8050]]

### 4
And David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H1931]] Jebus; [[H2982]] where [[H8033]] the Jebusites [[H2983]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 5
And the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jebus [[H2982]] said [[H559]] to David, [[H1732]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] hither. [[H2008]] Nevertheless David [[H1732]] took [[H3920]] the castle [[H4686]] of Zion, [[H6726]] which [[H1931]] the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 6
And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] Whosoever [[H3605]] smiteth [[H5221]] the Jebusites [[H2983]] first [[H7223]] shall be [[H1961]] chief [[H7218]] and captain. [[H8269]] So Joab [[H3097]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] went up, [[H5927]] first [[H7223]] and was [[H1961]] chief. [[H7218]]

### 7
And David [[H1732]] dwelt [[H3427]] in the castle; [[H4679]] therefore [[H5921]] they called [[H7121]] it the city [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 8
And he built [[H1129]] the city [[H5892]] round about, [[H5439]] even from [[H4480]] Millo [[H4407]] round about: [[H5439]] and Joab [[H3097]] repaired [[H2421]] the rest [[H7605]] of the city. [[H5892]]

### 9
So David [[H1732]] waxed [[H3212]] greater and greater: [[H1419]] for the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] with him. [[H5973]]

### 10
These [[H428]] also the chief [[H7218]] of the mighty men [[H1368]] whom [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had, who strengthened themselves [[H2388]] with [[H5973]] him in his kingdom, [[H4438]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] to make him king, [[H4427]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] concerning [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
And this [[H428]] the number [[H4557]] of the mighty men [[H1368]] whom [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had; Jashobeam, [[H3434]] an Hachmonite, [[H2453]] the chief [[H7218]] of the captains: [[H7970]] he [[H1931]] lifted up [[H5782]] his spear [[H2595]] against [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] slain [[H2491]] at one [[H259]] time. [[H6471]]

### 12
And after [[H310]] him Eleazar [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Dodo, [[H1734]] the Ahohite, [[H266]] who [[H1931]] of the three [[H7969]] mighties. [[H1368]]

### 13
He [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] at Pas-dammim, [[H6450]] and there [[H8033]] the Philistines [[H6430]] were gathered together [[H622]] to battle, [[H4421]] where was [[H1961]] a parcel [[H2513]] of ground [[H7704]] full [[H4392]] of barley; [[H8184]] and the people [[H5971]] fled [[H5127]] from before [[H6440]] the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 14
And they set themselves [[H3320]] in the midst [[H8432]] of parcel, [[H2513]] and delivered [[H5337]] it, and slew [[H5221]] the Philistines; [[H6430]] and the Lord [[H3068]] saved [[H3467]] by a great [[H1419]] deliverance. [[H8668]]

### 15
Now three [[H7969]] of [[H4480]] the thirty [[H7970]] captains [[H7218]] went down [[H3381]] to [[H5921]] the rock [[H6697]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] into [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] of Adullam; [[H5725]] and the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] encamped [[H2583]] in the valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 16
And David [[H1732]] then [[H227]] in the hold, [[H4686]] and the Philistines' [[H6430]] garrison [[H5333]] then [[H227]] at Bethlehem. [[H1035]]

### 17
And David [[H1732]] longed, [[H183]] and said, [[H559]] Oh that [[H4310]] one would give me drink [[H8248]] of the water [[H4325]] of the well [[H953]] of Bethlehem, [[H1035]] that [[H834]] at the gate! [[H8179]]

### 18
And the three [[H7969]] brake through [[H1234]] the host [[H4264]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and drew [[H7579]] water [[H4325]] out of the well [[H953]] of Bethlehem, [[H1035]] that [[H834]] by the gate, [[H8179]] and took [[H5375]] and brought [[H935]] to [[H413]] David: [[H1732]] but David [[H1732]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] it, but poured it out [[H5258]] to the Lord, [[H3068]]

### 19
And said, [[H559]] My God [[H430]] forbid it [[H2486]] me, that I should do [[H6213]] this thing: [[H2063]] shall I drink [[H8354]] the blood [[H1818]] of these [[H428]] men [[H582]] that have put their lives [[H5315]] in jeopardy? for [[H3588]] with their lives [[H5315]] they brought [[H935]] it. Therefore he would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] it. These things [[H428]] did [[H6213]] these three [[H7969]] mightiest. [[H1368]]

### 20
And Abishai [[H52]] the brother [[H251]] of Joab, [[H3097]] he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] chief [[H7218]] of the three: [[H7969]] for lifting up [[H5782]] his spear [[H2595]] against [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] hundred, [[H3967]] he [[H1931]] slew [[H2491]] and had a name [[H8034]] among the three. [[H7969]]

### 21
Of [[H4480]] the three, [[H7969]] he was more honourable [[H3513]] than the two; [[H8147]] for he was [[H1961]] their captain: [[H8269]] howbeit he attained [[H935]] not [[H3808]] to [[H5704]] the three. [[H7969]]

### 22
Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] the son [[H1121]] of a valiant [[H2428]] man [[H376]] of [[H4480]] Kabzeel, [[H6909]] who had done many [[H7227]] acts; [[H6467]] he [[H1931]] slew [[H5221]] two [[H8147]] lionlike men [[H739]] of Moab: [[H4124]] also he [[H1931]] went down [[H3381]] and slew [[H5221]] a lion [[H738]] in [[H8432]] a pit [[H953]] in a snowy [[H7950]] day. [[H3117]]

### 23
And he [[H1931]] slew [[H5221]] an Egyptian, [[H4713]] a man [[H376]] of stature, [[H4060]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] high; and in the Egyptian's [[H4713]] hand [[H3027]] a spear [[H2595]] like a weaver's [[H707]] beam; [[H4500]] and he went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] him with a staff, [[H7626]] and plucked [[H1497]] the spear [[H2595]] out of the Egyptian's [[H4713]] hand, [[H3027]] and slew [[H2026]] him with his own spear. [[H2595]]

### 24
These [[H428]] did [[H6213]] Benaiah [[H1141]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] and had the name [[H8034]] among the three [[H7969]] mighties. [[H1368]]

### 25
Behold, [[H2005]] he [[H1931]] was honourable [[H3513]] among [[H4480]] the thirty, [[H7970]] but attained [[H935]] not [[H3808]] to [[H413]] the three: [[H7969]] and David [[H1732]] set [[H7760]] him over [[H5921]] his guard. [[H4928]]
