### 1
Now it came to pass [[H1961]] after this, [[H310]] that Nahash [[H5176]] the king [[H4428]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] died, [[H4191]] and his son [[H1121]] reigned [[H4427]] in his stead. [[H8478]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] I will shew [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] unto [[H5973]] Hanun [[H2586]] the son [[H1121]] of Nahash, [[H5176]] because [[H3588]] his father [[H1]] shewed [[H6213]] kindness [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] me. And David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to comfort [[H5162]] him concerning [[H5921]] his father. [[H1]] So the servants [[H5650]] of David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] to [[H413]] Hanun, [[H2586]] to comfort [[H5162]] him. [[H5162]]

### 3
But the princes [[H8269]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] said [[H559]] to Hanun, [[H2586]] Thinkest [[H5869]] thou that David [[H1732]] doth honour [[H3513]] thy father, [[H1]] that [[H3588]] he hath sent [[H7971]] comforters [[H5162]] unto thee? are not [[H3808]] his servants [[H5650]] come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee for [[H5668]] to search, [[H2713]] and to overthrow, [[H2015]] and to spy out [[H7270]] the land? [[H776]]

### 4
Wherefore Hanun [[H2586]] took [[H3947]] David's [[H1732]] servants, [[H5650]] and shaved [[H1548]] them, and cut off [[H3772]] their garments [[H4063]] in the midst [[H2677]] hard by [[H5704]] their buttocks, [[H4667]] and sent them away. [[H7971]]

### 5
Then there went [[H1980]] and told [[H5046]] David [[H1732]] how [[H5921]] the men [[H582]] were served. And he sent [[H7971]] to meet [[H7125]] them: for [[H3588]] the men [[H582]] were [[H1961]] greatly [[H3966]] ashamed. [[H3637]] And the king [[H4428]] said, [[H559]] Tarry [[H3427]] at Jericho [[H3405]] until [[H5704]] your beards [[H2206]] be grown, [[H6779]] and return. [[H7725]]

### 6
And when the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they had made themselves odious [[H887]] to [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] Hanun [[H2586]] and the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] sent [[H7971]] a thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] to hire [[H7936]] them chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] out of [[H4480]] Mesopotamia, [[H763]] and out of [[H4480]] Syria-maachah, [[H758]] and out of Zobah. [[H6678]]

### 7
So they hired [[H7936]] thirty [[H7970]] and two [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] chariots, [[H7393]] and the king [[H4428]] of Maachah [[H4601]] and his people; [[H5971]] who came [[H935]] and pitched [[H2583]] before [[H6440]] Medeba. [[H4311]] And the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] gathered themselves together [[H622]] from their cities, [[H5892]] and came [[H935]] to battle. [[H4421]]

### 8
And when David [[H1732]] heard [[H8085]] he sent [[H7971]] Joab, [[H3097]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of the mighty men. [[H1368]]

### 9
And the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] came out, [[H3318]] and put the battle [[H4421]] in array [[H6186]] before the gate [[H6607]] of the city: [[H5892]] and the kings [[H4428]] that [[H834]] were come [[H935]] by themselves [[H905]] in the field. [[H7704]]

### 10
Now when Joab [[H3097]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the battle [[H4421]] was set [[H1961]] against [[H413]] him before [[H6440]] and behind, [[H268]] he chose out [[H977]] of all [[H3605]] the choice [[H977]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and put in array [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the Syrians. [[H758]]

### 11
And the rest [[H3499]] of the people [[H5971]] he delivered [[H5414]] unto the hand [[H3027]] of Abishai [[H52]] his brother, [[H251]] and they set in array [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon. [[H5983]]

### 12
And he said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] the Syrians [[H758]] be too strong [[H2388]] for [[H4480]] me, then thou shalt help [[H8668]] me: but if [[H518]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] be too strong [[H2388]] for [[H4480]] thee, then I will help [[H3467]] thee. [[H3467]]

### 13
Be of good courage, [[H2388]] and let us behave ourselves valiantly [[H2388]] for [[H1157]] our people, [[H5971]] and for [[H1157]] the cities [[H5892]] of our God: [[H430]] and let the Lord [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] in his sight. [[H5869]]

### 14
So Joab [[H3097]] and the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] with [[H5973]] him drew nigh [[H5066]] before [[H6440]] the Syrians [[H758]] unto the battle; [[H4421]] and they fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 15
And when the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Syrians [[H758]] were fled, [[H5127]] they [[H1992]] likewise [[H1571]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Abishai [[H52]] his brother, [[H251]] and entered [[H935]] into the city. [[H5892]] Then Joab [[H3097]] came [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 16
And when the Syrians [[H758]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they were put to the worse [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] they sent [[H7971]] messengers, [[H4397]] and drew forth [[H3318]] the Syrians [[H758]] that [[H834]] beyond [[H5676]] the river: [[H5104]] and Shophach [[H7780]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host [[H6635]] of Hadarezer [[H1928]] before [[H6440]] them. [[H6440]]

### 17
And it was told [[H5046]] David; [[H1732]] and he gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and passed over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and came [[H935]] upon [[H413]] them, and set in array [[H6186]] against [[H413]] them. So when David [[H1732]] had put the battle [[H4421]] in array [[H6186]] against [[H7125]] the Syrians, [[H758]] they fought [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 18
But the Syrians [[H758]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Israel; [[H3478]] and David [[H1732]] slew [[H2026]] of the Syrians [[H758]] seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] chariots, [[H7393]] and forty [[H705]] thousand [[H505]] footmen, [[H376]] and killed [[H4191]] Shophach [[H7780]] the captain [[H8269]] of the host. [[H6635]]

### 19
And when the servants [[H5650]] of Hadarezer [[H1928]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] they were put to the worse [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] they made peace [[H7999]] with [[H5973]] David, [[H1732]] and became his servants: [[H5647]] neither [[H3808]] would [[H14]] the Syrians [[H758]] help [[H3467]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] any more.
