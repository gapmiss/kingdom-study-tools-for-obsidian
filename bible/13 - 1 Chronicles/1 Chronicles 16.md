### 1
So they brought [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] and set [[H3322]] it in the midst [[H8432]] of the tent [[H168]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had pitched [[H5186]] for it: and they offered [[H7126]] burnt sacrifices [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]]

### 2
And when David [[H1732]] had made an end [[H3615]] of offering [[H5927]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] and the peace offerings, [[H8002]] he blessed [[H1288]] the people [[H5971]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 3
And he dealt [[H2505]] to every one [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] both man [[H376]] and woman, [[H802]] to every one [[H376]] a loaf [[H3603]] of bread, [[H3899]] and a good piece of flesh, [[H829]] and a flagon [[H809]]

### 4
And he appointed [[H5414]] of [[H4480]] the Levites [[H3881]] to minister [[H8334]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and to record, [[H2142]] and to thank [[H3034]] and praise [[H1984]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 5
Asaph [[H623]] the chief, [[H7218]] and next [[H4932]] to him Zechariah, [[H2148]] Jeiel, [[H3273]] and Shemiramoth, [[H8070]] and Jehiel, [[H3171]] and Mattithiah, [[H4993]] and Eliab, [[H446]] and Benaiah, [[H1141]] and Obed-edom: [[H5654]] and Jeiel [[H3273]] with psalteries [[H5035]] and with harps; [[H3658]] but Asaph [[H623]] made a sound [[H8085]] with cymbals; [[H4700]]

### 6
Benaiah [[H1141]] also and Jahaziel [[H3166]] the priests [[H3548]] with trumpets [[H2689]] continually [[H8548]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of God. [[H430]]

### 7
Then [[H227]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] delivered [[H5414]] first [[H7218]] to thank [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Asaph [[H623]] and his brethren. [[H251]]

### 8
Give thanks [[H3034]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] call [[H7121]] upon his name, [[H8034]] make known [[H3045]] his deeds [[H5949]] among the people. [[H5971]]

### 9
Sing [[H7891]] unto him, sing psalms [[H2167]] unto him, talk [[H7878]] ye of all [[H3605]] his wondrous works. [[H6381]]

### 10
Glory [[H1984]] ye in his holy [[H6944]] name: [[H8034]] let the heart [[H3820]] of them rejoice [[H8055]] that seek [[H1245]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
Seek [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] and his strength, [[H5797]] seek [[H1245]] his face [[H6440]] continually. [[H8548]]

### 12
Remember [[H2142]] his marvellous works [[H6381]] that [[H834]] he hath done, [[H6213]] his wonders, [[H4159]] and the judgments [[H4941]] of his mouth; [[H6310]]

### 13
O ye seed [[H2233]] of Israel [[H3478]] his servant, [[H5650]] ye children [[H1121]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] his chosen ones. [[H972]]

### 14
He [[H1931]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] his judgments [[H4941]] in all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 15
Be ye mindful [[H2142]] always [[H5769]] of his covenant; [[H1285]] the word [[H1697]] he commanded [[H6680]] to a thousand [[H505]] generations; [[H1755]]

### 16
which [[H834]] he made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] Abraham, [[H85]] and of his oath [[H7621]] unto Isaac; [[H3327]]

### 17
And hath confirmed [[H5975]] the same to Jacob [[H3290]] for a law, [[H2706]] to Israel [[H3478]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant, [[H1285]]

### 18
Saying, [[H559]] Unto thee will I give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] the lot [[H2256]] of your inheritance; [[H5159]]

### 19
When ye were [[H1961]] but few, [[H4557]] even a few, [[H4592]] and strangers [[H1481]] in it. [[H1481]]

### 20
And they went [[H1980]] from nation [[H1471]] to [[H413]] nation, [[H1471]] and from kingdom [[H4467]] to [[H413]] another [[H312]] people; [[H5971]]

### 21
He suffered [[H3240]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] to do them wrong: [[H6231]] yea, he reproved [[H3198]] kings [[H4428]] for their sakes, [[H5921]]

### 22
Touch [[H5060]] not [[H408]] mine anointed, [[H4899]] and do my prophets [[H5030]] no [[H408]] harm. [[H7489]]

### 23
Sing [[H7891]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the earth; [[H776]] shew forth [[H1319]] from day [[H3117]] to [[H413]] day [[H3117]] his salvation. [[H3444]]

### 24
Declare [[H5608]] his glory [[H3519]] among the heathen; [[H1471]] his marvellous works [[H6381]] among all [[H3605]] nations. [[H5971]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and greatly [[H3966]] to be praised: [[H1984]] he [[H1931]] also to be feared [[H3372]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of the people [[H5971]] idols: [[H457]] but the Lord [[H3068]] made [[H6213]] the heavens. [[H8064]]

### 27
Glory [[H1935]] and honour [[H1926]] in his presence; [[H6440]] strength [[H5797]] and gladness [[H2304]] in his place. [[H4725]]

### 28
Give [[H3051]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] ye kindreds [[H4940]] of the people, [[H5971]] give [[H3051]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] glory [[H3519]] and strength. [[H5797]]

### 29
Give [[H3051]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] the glory [[H3519]] unto his name: [[H8034]] bring [[H5375]] an offering, [[H4503]] and come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] him: worship [[H7812]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the beauty [[H1927]] of holiness. [[H6944]]

### 30
Fear [[H2342]] before [[H6440]] him, all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] the world [[H8398]] also [[H637]] shall be stable, [[H3559]] that it be not [[H1077]] moved. [[H4131]]

### 31
Let the heavens [[H8064]] be glad, [[H8055]] and let the earth [[H776]] rejoice: [[H1523]] and let say [[H559]] among the nations, [[H1471]] The Lord [[H3068]] reigneth. [[H4427]]

### 32
Let the sea [[H3220]] roar, [[H7481]] and the fulness [[H4393]] thereof: let the fields [[H7704]] rejoice, [[H5970]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein. [[H834]]

### 33
Then [[H227]] shall the trees [[H6086]] of the wood [[H3293]] sing out [[H7442]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] he cometh [[H935]] to judge [[H8199]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 34
O give thanks [[H3034]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] good; [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] his mercy [[H2617]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 35
And say [[H559]] ye, Save [[H3467]] us, O God [[H430]] of our salvation, [[H3468]] and gather us together, [[H6908]] and deliver [[H5337]] us from [[H4480]] the heathen, [[H1471]] that we may give thanks [[H3034]] to thy holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] glory [[H7623]] in thy praise. [[H8416]]

### 36
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5769]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] said, [[H559]] Amen, [[H543]] and praised [[H1984]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 37
So he left [[H5800]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H3068]] Asaph [[H623]] and his brethren, [[H251]] to minister [[H8334]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] continually, [[H8548]] as every day's [[H3117]] work [[H1697]] required: [[H3117]]

### 38
And Obed-edom [[H5654]] with their brethren, [[H251]] threescore [[H8346]] and eight; [[H8083]] Obed-edom [[H5654]] also the son [[H1121]] of Jeduthun [[H3038]] and Hosah [[H2621]] porters: [[H7778]]

### 39
And Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] and his brethren [[H251]] the priests, [[H3548]] before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the high place [[H1116]] that [[H834]] at Gibeon, [[H1391]]

To offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the burnt offering [[H5930]] continually [[H8548]] morning [[H1242]] and evening, [[H6153]] and according to all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] Israel; [[H3478]]

### 41
And with [[H5973]] them Heman [[H1968]] and Jeduthun, [[H3038]] and the rest [[H7605]] that were chosen, [[H1305]] who [[H834]] were expressed [[H5344]] by name, [[H8034]] to give thanks [[H3034]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] his mercy [[H2617]] for ever; [[H5769]]
