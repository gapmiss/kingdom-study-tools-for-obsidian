And David [[H1732]] smote [[H5221]] Hadarezer [[H1928]] king [[H4428]] of Zobah [[H6678]] unto Hamath, [[H2574]] as he went [[H1980]] to stablish [[H5324]] his dominion [[H3027]] by the river [[H5104]] Euphrates. [[H6578]]

### 7
And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the shields [[H7982]] of gold [[H2091]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the servants [[H5650]] of Hadarezer, [[H1928]] and brought [[H935]] them to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
He sent [[H7971]] Hadoram [[H1913]] his son [[H1121]] to [[H413]] king [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] to inquire [[H7592]] of his welfare, [[H7965]] and to congratulate [[H1288]] him, because [[H5921]] he had fought [[H3898]] against Hadarezer, [[H1928]] and smitten [[H5221]] him; (for [[H3588]] Hadarezer [[H1928]] had war [[H376]] with Tou;) [[H8583]] and all manner [[H3605]] of vessels [[H3627]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] and brass.

### 14
So David [[H1732]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and executed [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] and justice [[H6666]] among all [[H3605]] his people. [[H5971]]
