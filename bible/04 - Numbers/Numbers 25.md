And they called [[H7121]] the people [[H5971]] unto the sacrifices [[H2077]] of their gods: [[H430]] and the people [[H5971]] did eat, [[H398]] and bowed down [[H7812]] to their gods. [[H430]]

And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Take [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the heads [[H7218]] of the people, [[H5971]] and hang them up [[H3363]] before [[H5048]] the Lord [[H3068]] against the sun, [[H8121]] that the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] may be turned away [[H7725]] from Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the judges [[H8199]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Slay [[H2026]] ye every [[H376]] one his men [[H582]] that were joined [[H6775]] unto Baal-peor. [[H1187]]

### 6

### 8
And he went [[H935]] after [[H310]] the man [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] into [[H413]] the tent, [[H6898]] and thrust [[H1856]] both [[H8147]]  of them through, [[H853]] the man [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the woman [[H802]] through [[H413]] her belly. [[H6897]] So the plague [[H4046]] was stayed [[H6113]] from [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 9
And those that died [[H4191]] in the plague [[H4046]] were [[H1961]] twenty [[H6242]] and four [[H702]] thousand. [[H505]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 11
Phinehas, [[H6372]] the son [[H1121]] of Eleazar, [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest, [[H3548]] hath turned away [[H7725]] my wrath [[H2534]] from [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] while he was zealous [[H7068]] for my sake [[H7068]] among [[H8432]] them, that I consumed [[H3615]] not [[H3808]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in my jealousy. [[H7068]]

### 12
Wherefore [[H3651]] say, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I give [[H5414]]  unto him [[H853]] my covenant [[H1285]] of peace: [[H7965]]

### 13
And he shall have [[H1961]] it, and his seed [[H2233]] after [[H310]] him, the covenant [[H1285]] of an everlasting [[H5769]] priesthood; [[H3550]] because [[H834]] he was zealous [[H7065]] for his God, [[H430]] and made an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 14

And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 17
Vex [[H6887]] the Midianites, [[H4084]] and smite [[H5221]] them: [[H5221]]
