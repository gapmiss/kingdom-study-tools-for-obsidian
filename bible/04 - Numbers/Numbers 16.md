### 1
Now Korah, [[H7141]] the son [[H1121]] of Izhar, [[H3324]] the son [[H1121]] of Kohath, [[H6955]] the son [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] and Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] the sons [[H1121]] of Eliab, [[H446]] and On, [[H203]] the son [[H1121]] of Peleth, [[H6431]] sons [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] took [[H3947]]

### 2
And they rose up [[H6965]] before [[H6440]] Moses, [[H4872]] with certain [[H582]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] two hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] princes [[H5387]] of the assembly, [[H5712]] famous [[H7148]] in the congregation, [[H4150]] men [[H582]] of renown: [[H8034]]

### 3
And they gathered themselves together [[H6950]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and against [[H5921]] Aaron, [[H175]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, too much [[H7227]] upon you, seeing [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] holy, [[H6918]] every one [[H3605]] of them, and the Lord [[H3068]] among [[H8432]] them: wherefore [[H4069]] then lift ye up yourselves [[H5375]] above [[H5921]] the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 4
And when Moses [[H4872]] heard [[H8085]] he fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] his face: [[H6440]]

### 5
And he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Korah [[H7141]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] his company, [[H5712]] saying, [[H559]] Even to morrow [[H1242]] the Lord [[H3068]] will shew [[H3045]] who [[H834]] his, and holy; [[H6918]] and will cause to come near [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] him: even whom [[H834]] he hath chosen [[H977]] will he cause to come near [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 6
This [[H2063]] do; [[H6213]] Take [[H3947]] you censers, [[H4289]] Korah, [[H7141]] and all [[H3605]] his company; [[H5712]]

### 7
And put [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] therein, [[H2004]] and put [[H7760]] incense [[H7004]] in [[H5921]] them before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] to morrow: [[H4279]] and it shall be [[H1961]] the man [[H376]] whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] doth choose, [[H977]] he [[H1931]] holy: [[H6918]] too much [[H7227]] upon you, ye sons [[H1121]] of Levi. [[H3878]]

### 8
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Korah, [[H7141]] Hear, [[H8085]] I pray you, [[H4994]] ye sons [[H1121]] of Levi: [[H3878]]

### 9
a small thing [[H4592]] unto [[H4480]] you, that [[H3588]] the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] hath separated [[H914]] you from the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to bring you near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] himself to do [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and to stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the congregation [[H5712]] to minister [[H8334]] unto them? [[H8334]]

### 10
And he hath brought thee near [[H7126]] and all [[H3605]] thy brethren [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] with [[H854]] thee: and seek [[H1245]] ye the priesthood [[H3550]] also? [[H1571]]

### 11
For which cause [[H3651]] thou [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] thy company [[H5712]] gathered together [[H3259]] against [[H5921]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and what [[H4100]] Aaron, [[H175]] that [[H3588]] ye murmur [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] him? [[H5921]]

### 12
And Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] to call [[H7121]] Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] the sons [[H1121]] of Eliab: [[H446]] which said, [[H559]] We will not [[H3808]] come up: [[H5927]]

### 13
a small thing [[H4592]] that [[H3588]] thou hast brought us up [[H5927]] out of a land [[H776]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] to kill [[H4191]] us in the wilderness, [[H4057]] except [[H3588]] thou make thyself a prince [[H8323]]  altogether [[H8323]] over [[H5921]] us? [[H5921]]

### 14
Moreover [[H637]] thou hast not [[H3808]] brought [[H935]] us into [[H413]] a land [[H776]] that floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] or given [[H5414]] us inheritance [[H5159]] of fields [[H7704]] and vineyards: [[H3754]] wilt thou put out [[H5365]] the eyes [[H5869]] of these [[H1992]] men? [[H376]] we will not [[H3808]] come up. [[H5927]]

### 15
And Moses [[H4872]] was very [[H3966]] wroth, [[H2734]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Respect [[H6437]] not [[H408]] thou their offering: [[H4503]] I have not [[H3808]] taken [[H5375]] one [[H259]] ass [[H2543]] from them, neither [[H3808]] have I hurt [[H7489]] one [[H259]] of them. [[H259]]

### 16
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Korah, [[H7141]] Be [[H1961]] thou [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] thy company [[H5712]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] thou, [[H859]] and they, [[H1992]] and Aaron, [[H175]] to morrow: [[H4279]]

### 17
And take [[H3947]] every man [[H376]] his censer, [[H4289]] and put [[H5414]] incense [[H7004]] in [[H5921]] them, and bring [[H7126]] ye before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] every man [[H376]] his censer, [[H4289]] two hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] censers; [[H4289]] thou [[H859]] also, and Aaron, [[H175]] each [[H376]] his censer. [[H4289]]

### 18
And they took [[H3947]] every man [[H376]] his censer, [[H4289]] and put [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] in them, [[H5921]] and laid [[H7760]] incense [[H7004]] thereon, [[H5921]] and stood [[H5975]] in the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] with Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron. [[H175]]

### 19
And Korah [[H7141]] gathered [[H6950]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] against [[H5921]] them unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation: [[H4150]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the congregation. [[H5712]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] saying, [[H559]]

### 21
Separate yourselves [[H914]] from among [[H8432]] this [[H2063]] congregation, [[H5712]] that I may consume [[H3615]] them in a moment. [[H7281]]

### 22
And they fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] their faces, [[H6440]] and said, [[H559]] O God, [[H410]] the God [[H430]] of the spirits [[H7307]] of all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] shall one [[H259]] man [[H376]] sin, [[H2398]] and wilt thou be wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the congregation? [[H5712]]

### 23
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 24
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the congregation, [[H5712]] saying, [[H559]] Get you up [[H5927]] from about [[H5439]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of Korah, [[H7141]] Dathan, [[H1885]] and Abiram. [[H48]]

### 25
And Moses [[H4872]] rose up [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram; [[H48]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] followed [[H1980]] him. [[H310]]

### 26
And he spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the congregation, [[H5712]] saying, [[H559]] Depart, [[H5493]] I pray you, [[H4994]] from [[H5921]] the tents [[H168]] of these [[H428]] wicked [[H7563]] men, [[H376]] and touch [[H5060]] nothing [[H408]] of theirs, lest [[H6435]] ye be consumed [[H5595]] in all [[H3605]] their sins. [[H2403]]

### 27
So they gat up [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of Korah, [[H7141]] Dathan, [[H1885]] and Abiram, [[H48]] on every side: [[H5439]] and Dathan [[H1885]] and Abiram [[H48]] came out, [[H3318]] and stood [[H5324]] in the door [[H6607]] of their tents, [[H168]] and their wives, [[H802]] and their sons, [[H1121]] and their little children. [[H2945]]

### 28
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] Hereby [[H2063]] ye shall know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath sent [[H7971]] me to do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] works; [[H4639]] for [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] of mine own mind. [[H3820]]

### 29
If [[H518]] these [[H428]] men die [[H4191]] the common death [[H4194]] of all [[H3605]] men, [[H120]] or if they be visited [[H6485]] after [[H5921]] the visitation [[H6486]] of all [[H3605]] men; [[H120]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] me. [[H7971]]

### 30
But if [[H518]] the Lord [[H3068]] make [[H1254]] a new thing, [[H1278]] and the earth [[H127]] open [[H6475]] her mouth, [[H6310]] and swallow them up, [[H1104]] with all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] unto them, and they go down [[H3381]] quick [[H2416]] into the pit; [[H7585]] then ye shall understand [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] have provoked [[H5006]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 31
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] as he had made an end [[H3615]] of speaking [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] that the ground [[H127]] clave asunder [[H1234]] that [[H834]] under [[H8478]] them: [[H8478]]

### 32
And the earth [[H776]] opened [[H6605]] her mouth, [[H6310]] and swallowed them up, [[H1104]] and their houses, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H120]] that [[H834]] unto Korah, [[H7141]] and all [[H3605]] goods. [[H7399]]

### 33
They, [[H1992]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] to them, went down [[H3381]] alive [[H2416]] into the pit, [[H7585]] and the earth [[H776]] closed [[H3680]] upon [[H5921]] them: and they perished [[H6]] from among [[H8432]] the congregation. [[H6951]]

### 34
And all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] round about [[H5439]] them fled [[H5127]] at the cry [[H6963]] of them: for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] Lest [[H6435]] the earth [[H776]] swallow us up [[H1104]]

### 35
And there came out [[H3318]] a fire [[H784]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and consumed [[H398]]  the [[H853]] two hundred [[H3967]] and fifty [[H2572]] men [[H376]] that offered [[H7126]] incense. [[H7004]]

### 36
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 37
Speak [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Eleazar [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest, [[H3548]] that he take up [[H7311]] the censers [[H4289]] out [[H996]] of the burning, [[H8316]] and scatter [[H2219]] thou the fire [[H784]] yonder; [[H1973]] for [[H3588]] they are hallowed. [[H6942]]

### 38
The censers [[H4289]] of these [[H428]] sinners [[H2400]] against their own souls, [[H5315]] let them make [[H6213]] them broad [[H7555]] plates [[H6341]] a covering [[H6826]] of the altar: [[H4196]] for [[H3588]] they offered [[H7126]] them before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] therefore they are hallowed: [[H6942]] and they shall be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 39
And Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] took [[H3947]] the brasen [[H5178]] censers, [[H4289]] wherewith [[H834]] they that were burnt [[H8313]] had offered; [[H7126]] and they were made broad [[H7554]] a covering [[H6826]] of the altar: [[H4196]]

### 40
a memorial [[H2146]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H834]] no [[H3808]] stranger, [[H376]] which [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] of the seed [[H2233]] of Aaron, [[H175]] come near [[H7126]] to offer [[H6999]] incense [[H7004]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] that he be [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] as Korah, [[H7141]] and as his company: [[H5712]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to him by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]

### 41
But on the morrow [[H4283]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] murmured [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and against [[H5921]] Aaron, [[H175]] saying, [[H559]] Ye [[H859]] have killed [[H4191]] the people [[H5971]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 42
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the congregation [[H5712]] was gathered [[H6950]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and against [[H5921]] Aaron, [[H175]] that they looked [[H6437]] toward [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation: [[H4150]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the cloud [[H6051]] covered [[H3680]] it, and the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] appeared. [[H7200]]

### 43
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 44
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 45
Get you up [[H7426]] from among [[H8432]] this [[H2063]] congregation, [[H5712]] that I may consume [[H3615]] them as in a moment. [[H7281]] And they fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] their faces. [[H6440]]

### 46
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Take [[H3947]] a censer, [[H4289]] and put [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] therein [[H5921]] from off [[H6440]] the altar, [[H4196]] and put on [[H7760]] incense, [[H7004]] and go [[H1980]] quickly [[H4120]] unto [[H413]] the congregation, [[H5712]] and make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] them: for [[H3588]] there is wrath [[H7110]] gone out [[H3318]] from the Lord; [[H3068]] the plague [[H5063]] is begun. [[H2490]]

### 47
And Aaron [[H175]] took [[H3947]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] commanded, [[H1696]] and ran [[H7323]] into [[H413]] the midst [[H8432]] of the congregation; [[H6951]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the plague [[H5063]] was begun [[H2490]] among the people: [[H5971]] and he put on [[H5414]] incense, [[H7004]] and made an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 48
And he stood [[H5975]] between [[H996]] the dead [[H4191]] and the living; [[H2416]] and the plague [[H4046]] was stayed. [[H6113]]

### 49
Now they that died [[H4191]] in the plague [[H4046]] were [[H1961]] fourteen [[H702]] thousand [[H505]] and seven [[H7651]] hundred, [[H3967]] beside [[H905]] them that died [[H4191]] about [[H5921]] the matter [[H1697]] of Korah. [[H7141]]

### 50
And Aaron [[H175]] returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation: [[H4150]] and the plague [[H4046]] was stayed. [[H6113]]
