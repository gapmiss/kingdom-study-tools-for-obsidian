### 1
Then came [[H935]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation, [[H5712]] into the desert [[H4057]] of Zin [[H6790]] in the first [[H7223]] month: [[H2320]] and the people [[H5971]] abode [[H3427]] in Kadesh; [[H6946]] and Miriam [[H4813]] died [[H4191]] there, [[H8033]] and was buried [[H6912]] there. [[H8033]]

### 2
And there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] water [[H4325]] for the congregation: [[H5712]] and they gathered [[H6950]] themselves together against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and against [[H5921]] Aaron. [[H175]]

### 3
And the people [[H5971]] chode [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] Moses, [[H4872]] and spake, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]] Would God that [[H3863]] we had died [[H1478]] when our brethren [[H251]] died [[H1478]] before [[H6440]] the Lord! [[H3068]]

### 4
And why [[H4100]] have ye brought up [[H935]] the congregation [[H6951]] of the Lord [[H3068]] into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] wilderness, [[H4057]] that we [[H587]] and our cattle [[H1165]] should die [[H4191]] there? [[H8033]]

### 5
And wherefore [[H4100]] have ye made us to come up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] to bring [[H935]]  us in [[H853]] unto [[H413]] this [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] place? [[H4725]] it no [[H3808]] place [[H4725]] of seed, [[H2233]] or of figs, [[H8384]] or of vines, [[H1612]] or of pomegranates; [[H7416]] neither [[H369]] there any water [[H4325]] to drink. [[H8354]]

### 6
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went [[H935]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the assembly [[H6951]] unto [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and they fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] their faces: [[H6440]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] them. [[H413]]

### 7
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 8
Take [[H3947]] the rod, [[H4294]] and gather [[H6950]] thou the assembly [[H5712]]  together, [[H853]] thou, [[H859]] and Aaron [[H175]] thy brother, [[H251]] and speak [[H1696]] ye unto [[H413]] the rock [[H5553]] before their eyes; [[H5869]] and it shall give forth [[H5414]] his water, [[H4325]] and thou shalt bring forth [[H3318]] to them water [[H4325]] out of [[H4480]] the rock: [[H5553]]  so thou shalt give [[H853]] the congregation [[H5712]] and their beasts [[H1165]] drink. [[H8248]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the rod [[H4294]] from before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H6680]]

### 10
And Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] gathered [[H6950]] the congregation [[H6951]]  together [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the rock, [[H5553]] and he said [[H559]] unto them, Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] ye rebels; [[H4784]] must we fetch [[H3318]] you water [[H4325]] out of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] rock? [[H5553]]

### 11
And Moses [[H4872]] lifted up [[H7311]] his hand, [[H3027]] and with his rod [[H4294]] he smote [[H5221]] the rock [[H5553]] twice: [[H6471]] and the water [[H4325]] came out [[H3318]] abundantly, [[H7227]] and the congregation [[H5712]] drank, [[H8354]] and their beasts [[H1165]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] Because [[H3282]] ye believed [[H539]] me not, [[H3808]] to sanctify [[H6942]] me in the eyes [[H5869]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] therefore [[H3651]] ye shall not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] this [[H2088]] congregation [[H6951]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] them. [[H5414]]

### 13
This [[H1992]] the water [[H4325]] of Meribah; [[H4809]] because [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] strove [[H7378]] with [[H854]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he was sanctified [[H6942]] in them. [[H6942]]

### 14
And Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] from Kadesh [[H6946]] unto [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Edom, [[H123]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] thy brother [[H251]] Israel, [[H3478]] Thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] the travail [[H8513]] that [[H834]] hath befallen [[H4672]] us: [[H4672]]

### 15
How our fathers [[H1]] went down [[H3381]] into Egypt, [[H4714]] and we have dwelt [[H3427]] in Egypt [[H4714]] a long [[H7227]] time; [[H3117]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] vexed [[H7489]] us, and our fathers: [[H1]]

### 16
And when we cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] he heard [[H8085]] our voice, [[H6963]] and sent [[H7971]] an angel, [[H4397]] and hath brought us forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt: [[H4714]] and, behold, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] in Kadesh, [[H6946]] a city [[H5892]] in the uttermost [[H7097]] of thy border: [[H1366]]

### 17
Let us pass, [[H5674]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] through thy country: [[H776]] we will not [[H3808]] pass through [[H5674]] the fields, [[H7704]] or through the vineyards, [[H3754]] neither [[H3808]] will we drink [[H8354]] the water [[H4325]] of the wells: [[H875]] we will go [[H1980]] by the king's [[H4428]] way, [[H1870]] we will not [[H3808]] turn [[H5186]] to the right hand [[H3225]] nor to the left, [[H8040]] until [[H5704]] we have passed [[H5674]] thy borders. [[H1366]]

### 18
And Edom [[H123]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Thou shalt not [[H3808]] pass [[H5674]] by me, lest [[H6435]] I come out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] thee with the sword. [[H2719]]

### 19
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, We will go [[H5927]] by the high way: [[H4546]] and if [[H518]] I [[H589]] and my cattle [[H4735]] drink [[H8354]] of thy water, [[H4325]] then I will pay [[H5414]] for it: I will only, [[H7535]] without [[H369]] any thing [[H1697]] go through [[H5674]] on my feet. [[H7272]]

### 20
And he said, [[H559]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] go through. [[H5674]] And Edom [[H123]] came out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] him with much [[H3515]] people, [[H5971]] and with a strong [[H2389]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 21
Thus Edom [[H123]] refused [[H3985]] to give [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] passage [[H5674]] through his border: [[H1366]] wherefore Israel [[H3478]] turned away [[H5186]] from [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 22
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation, [[H5712]] journeyed [[H5265]] from Kadesh, [[H6946]] and came [[H935]] unto mount [[H2022]] Hor. [[H2023]]

### 23
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] in mount [[H2022]] Hor, [[H2023]] by [[H5921]] the coast [[H1366]] of the land [[H776]] of Edom, [[H123]] saying, [[H559]]

### 24
Aaron [[H175]] shall be gathered [[H622]] unto [[H413]] his people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] he shall not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H5921]] ye rebelled against [[H4784]] my word [[H6310]] at the water [[H4325]] of Meribah. [[H4809]]

### 25
Take [[H3947]] Aaron [[H175]] and Eleazar [[H499]] his son, [[H1121]] and bring them up [[H5927]] unto mount [[H2022]] Hor: [[H2023]]

### 26
And strip [[H6584]] Aaron [[H175]] of his garments, [[H899]] and put [[H3847]]  them upon [[H853]] Eleazar [[H499]] his son: [[H1121]] and Aaron [[H175]] shall be gathered [[H622]] and shall die [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]]

### 27
And Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded: [[H6680]] and they went up [[H5927]] into [[H413]] mount [[H2022]] Hor [[H2023]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the congregation. [[H5712]]

### 28
And Moses [[H4872]] stripped [[H6584]] Aaron [[H175]] of his garments, [[H899]] and put [[H3847]]  them upon [[H854]] Eleazar [[H499]] his son; [[H1121]] and Aaron [[H175]] died [[H4191]] there [[H8033]] in the top [[H7218]] of the mount: [[H2022]] and Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mount. [[H2022]]

### 29
And when all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Aaron [[H175]] was dead, [[H1478]] they mourned [[H1058]]  for [[H853]] Aaron [[H175]] thirty [[H7970]] days, [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]
