### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Thou [[H859]] and thy sons [[H1121]] and thy father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] with [[H854]] thee shall bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the sanctuary: [[H4720]] and thou [[H859]] and thy sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] thee shall bear [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of your priesthood. [[H3550]]

### 2
And [[H853]] thy brethren [[H251]] also [[H1571]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Levi, [[H3878]] the tribe [[H7626]] of thy father, [[H1]] bring [[H7126]] thou with [[H854]] thee, that they may be joined [[H3867]] unto [[H5921]] thee, and minister [[H8334]] unto thee: but thou [[H859]] and thy sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] thee before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of witness. [[H5715]]

### 3
And they shall keep [[H8104]] thy charge, [[H4931]] and the charge [[H4931]] of all [[H3605]] the tabernacle: [[H168]] only [[H389]] they shall not [[H3808]] come nigh [[H7126]] the vessels [[H3627]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] and the altar, [[H4196]] that neither [[H3808]] they, [[H1992]] nor ye [[H859]] also, [[H1571]] die. [[H4191]]

### 4
And they shall be joined [[H3867]] unto [[H5921]] thee, and keep [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] for all [[H3605]] the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle: [[H168]] and a stranger [[H2114]] shall not [[H3808]] come nigh [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] you. [[H413]]

### 5
And ye shall keep [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] of the sanctuary, [[H6944]] and the charge [[H4931]] of the altar: [[H4196]] that there be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] wrath [[H7110]] any more [[H5750]] upon [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
And I, [[H589]] behold, [[H2009]] I have taken [[H3947]] your brethren [[H251]] the Levites [[H3881]] from among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] to you given [[H5414]] a gift [[H4979]] for the Lord, [[H3068]] to do [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 7
Therefore thou [[H859]] and thy sons [[H1121]] with [[H854]] thee shall keep [[H8104]] your priest's office [[H3550]] for every [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] of the altar, [[H4196]] and within [[H1004]] the vail; [[H6532]] and ye shall serve: [[H5647]] I have given [[H5414]] your priest's office [[H3550]] a service [[H5656]] of gift: [[H4979]] and the stranger [[H2114]] that cometh nigh [[H7131]] shall be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] also have given [[H5414]]  thee [[H853]] the charge [[H4931]] of mine heave offerings [[H8641]] of all [[H3605]] the hallowed things [[H6944]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] unto thee have I given [[H5414]] them by reason of the anointing, [[H4888]] and to thy sons, [[H1121]] by an ordinance [[H2706]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 9
This [[H2088]] shall be [[H1961]] thine of the most [[H6944]] holy things, [[H6944]] from [[H4480]] the fire: [[H784]] every [[H3605]] oblation [[H7133]] of theirs, every [[H3605]] meat offering [[H4503]] of theirs, and every [[H3605]] sin offering [[H2403]] of theirs, and every [[H3605]] trespass offering [[H817]] of theirs, which [[H834]] they shall render [[H7725]] unto me, most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] for thee and for thy sons. [[H1121]]

### 10
In the most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] shalt thou eat [[H398]] it; every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] shall eat [[H398]] it: it shall be [[H1961]] holy [[H6944]] unto thee. [[H6944]]

### 11
And this [[H2088]] thine; the heave offering [[H8641]] of their gift, [[H4976]] with all [[H3605]] the wave offerings [[H8573]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] I have given [[H5414]] them unto thee, and to thy sons [[H1121]] and to thy daughters [[H1323]] with [[H854]] thee, by a statute [[H2706]] for ever: [[H5769]] every one [[H3605]] that is clean [[H2889]] in thy house [[H1004]] shall eat [[H398]] of it. [[H398]]

### 12
All [[H3605]] the best [[H2459]] of the oil, [[H3323]] and all [[H3605]] the best [[H2459]] of the wine, [[H8492]] and of the wheat, [[H1715]] the firstfruits [[H7225]] of them which [[H834]] they shall offer [[H5414]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] them have I given [[H5414]] thee. [[H5414]]

### 13
whatsoever [[H3605]] is first ripe [[H1061]] in the land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] they shall bring [[H935]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] shall be [[H1961]] thine; every one [[H3605]] that is clean [[H2889]] in thine house [[H1004]] shall eat [[H398]] it. [[H398]]

### 14
Every thing [[H3605]] devoted [[H2764]] in Israel [[H3478]] shall be [[H1961]] thine. [[H1961]]

### 15
Every thing [[H3605]] that openeth [[H6363]] the matrix [[H7358]] in all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] which [[H834]] they bring [[H7126]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] of men [[H120]] or beasts, [[H929]] shall be [[H1961]] thine: nevertheless [[H389]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of man [[H120]] shalt thou surely [[H6299]] redeem, [[H6299]] and the firstling [[H1060]] of unclean [[H2931]] beasts [[H929]] shalt thou redeem. [[H6299]]

### 16
And those that are to be redeemed [[H6299]] from a month [[H2320]] old [[H1121]] shalt thou redeem, [[H6299]] according to thine estimation, [[H6187]] for the money [[H3701]] of five [[H2568]] shekels, [[H8255]] after the shekel [[H8255]] of the sanctuary, [[H6944]] which [[H1931]] twenty [[H6242]] gerahs. [[H1626]]

### 17
But [[H389]] the firstling [[H1060]] of a cow, [[H7794]] or [[H176]] the firstling [[H1060]] of a sheep, [[H3775]] or [[H176]] the firstling [[H1060]] of a goat, [[H5795]] thou shalt not [[H3808]] redeem; [[H6299]] they [[H1992]] holy: [[H6944]] thou shalt sprinkle [[H2236]] their blood [[H1818]] upon [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and shalt burn [[H6999]] their fat [[H2459]] an offering made by fire, [[H801]] for a sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
And the flesh [[H1320]] of them shall be [[H1961]] thine, as the wave [[H8573]] breast [[H2373]] and as the right [[H3225]] shoulder [[H7785]] are [[H1961]] thine. [[H1961]]

### 19
All [[H3605]] the heave offerings [[H8641]] of the holy things, [[H6944]] which [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] offer [[H7311]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] have I given [[H5414]] thee, and thy sons [[H1121]] and thy daughters [[H1323]] with [[H854]] thee, by a statute [[H2706]] for ever: [[H5769]] it [[H1931]] a covenant [[H1285]] of salt [[H4417]] for ever [[H5769]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto thee and to thy seed [[H2233]] with [[H854]] thee. [[H854]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] Thou shalt have no inheritance [[H5157]] in their land, [[H776]] neither [[H3808]] shalt thou have [[H1961]] any part [[H2506]] among [[H8432]] them: I [[H589]] thy part [[H2506]] and thine inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 21
And, behold, [[H2009]] I have given [[H5414]] the children [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] all [[H3605]] the tenth [[H4643]] in Israel [[H3478]] for an inheritance, [[H5159]] for [[H2500]] their service [[H5656]] which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] serve, [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 22
Neither [[H3808]] must the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] henceforth [[H5750]] come nigh [[H7126]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] lest they bear [[H5375]] sin, [[H2399]] and die. [[H4191]]

### 23
But the Levites [[H3881]] shall do [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and they [[H1992]] shall bear [[H5375]] their iniquity: [[H5771]] a statute [[H2708]] for ever [[H5769]] throughout your generations, [[H1755]] that among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] they have [[H5157]] no [[H3808]] inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 24
But [[H3588]] the tithes [[H4643]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] they offer [[H7311]] an heave offering [[H8641]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] I have given [[H5414]] to the Levites [[H3881]] to inherit: [[H5159]] therefore [[H5921]] I have said [[H559]] unto them, Among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] they shall have [[H5157]] no [[H3808]] inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 25
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 26
Thus speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the Levites, [[H3881]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, When [[H3588]] ye take [[H3947]] of [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] the tithes [[H4643]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] you from [[H853]] them for your inheritance, [[H5159]] then ye shall offer up [[H7311]] an heave offering [[H8641]] of [[H4480]] it for the Lord, [[H3068]] a tenth [[H4643]] of [[H4480]] the tithe. [[H4643]]

### 27
And your heave offering [[H8641]] shall be reckoned [[H2803]] unto you, as though the corn [[H1715]] of [[H4480]] the threshingfloor, [[H1637]] and as the fulness [[H4395]] of [[H4480]] the winepress. [[H3342]]

### 28
Thus [[H3651]] ye [[H859]] also [[H1571]] shall offer [[H7311]] an heave offering [[H8641]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] of all [[H3605]] your tithes, [[H4643]] which [[H834]] ye receive [[H3947]] of [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] and ye shall give [[H5414]] thereof [[H853]] the Lord's [[H3068]] heave offering [[H8641]] to Aaron [[H175]] the priest. [[H3548]]

### 29
Out of all [[H3605]] your gifts [[H4979]] ye shall offer [[H7311]] every [[H3605]] heave offering [[H8641]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] of all [[H3605]] the best [[H2459]]  thereof, [[H853]] the hallowed part [[H4720]] thereof out of [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]

### 30
Therefore thou shalt say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, When ye have heaved [[H7311]] the best [[H2459]] thereof from [[H4480]] it, then it shall be counted [[H2803]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] as the increase [[H8393]] of the threshingfloor, [[H1637]] and as the increase [[H8393]] of the winepress. [[H3342]]

### 31
And ye shall eat [[H398]] it in every [[H3605]] place, [[H4725]] ye [[H859]] and your households: [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] your reward [[H7939]] for [[H2500]] your service [[H5656]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 32
And ye shall bear [[H5375]] no [[H3808]] sin [[H2399]] by reason of [[H5921]] it, when ye have heaved [[H7311]]  from it [[H853]] the best [[H2459]] of [[H4480]] it: neither [[H3808]] shall ye pollute [[H2490]] the holy things [[H6944]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] lest [[H3808]] ye die.
