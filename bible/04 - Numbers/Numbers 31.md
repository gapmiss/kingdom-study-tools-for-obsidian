And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Avenge [[H5358]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] of [[H853]] the Midianites: [[H4084]] afterward [[H310]] shalt thou be gathered [[H622]] unto [[H413]] thy people. [[H5971]]

### 3

Of every tribe [[H4294]] a thousand, [[H505]] throughout all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H4294]] of Israel, [[H3478]] shall ye send [[H7971]] to the war. [[H6635]]

[[H3027]]

### 7
And they warred [[H6633]] against [[H5921]] the Midianites, [[H4080]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses; [[H4872]] and they slew [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the males. [[H2145]]

### 12
And they brought [[H935]] the captives, [[H7628]] and the prey, [[H4455]] and the spoil, [[H7998]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and unto [[H413]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] at [[H413]] the plains [[H6160]] of Moab, [[H4124]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] Jordan [[H3383]] Jericho.

### 14
And Moses [[H4872]] was wroth [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] the officers [[H6485]] of the host, [[H2428]] the captains [[H8269]] over thousands, [[H505]] and captains [[H8269]] over hundreds, [[H3967]] which came [[H935]] from [[H6635]] the battle. [[H4421]]

### 15
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Have ye saved [[H2421]] all [[H3605]] the women [[H5347]] alive? [[H5347]]

### 16
Behold, [[H2005]] these [[H2007]] caused [[H1961]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] through the counsel [[H1697]] of Balaam, [[H1109]] to commit [[H4560]] trespass [[H4604]] against the Lord [[H3068]] in [[H5921]] the matter [[H1697]] of Peor, [[H6465]] and there was [[H1961]] a plague [[H4046]] among the congregation [[H5712]] of the Lord.

### 18
But all [[H3605]] the women [[H802]] children, [[H2945]] that [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] a man [[H2145]] by lying [[H4904]] with him, keep alive [[H2421]] for yourselves. [[H2421]]

### 19
And do ye [[H859]] abide [[H2583]] without [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] seven [[H7651]] days: [[H3117]] whosoever [[H3605]] hath killed [[H2026]] any person, [[H5315]] and whosoever [[H3605]] hath touched [[H5060]] any slain, [[H2491]] purify [[H2398]] yourselves [[H859]] and your captives [[H7628]] on the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] and on the seventh [[H7637]] day. [[H3117]]

### 20
And purify [[H2398]] all [[H3605]] raiment, [[H899]] and all [[H3605]] that is made [[H3627]] of skins, [[H5785]] and all [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] of goats' [[H5795]] and all [[H3605]] things made [[H3627]] of wood. [[H6086]]

### 21
And Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the men [[H582]] of war [[H6635]] which went [[H935]] to the battle, [[H4421]] This [[H2063]] the ordinance [[H2708]] of the law [[H8451]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses; [[H4872]]

### 23
Every [[H3605]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] may abide [[H935]] the fire, [[H784]] ye shall make go through [[H5674]] the fire, [[H784]] and it shall be clean: [[H2891]] nevertheless [[H389]] it shall be purified [[H2398]] with the water [[H4325]] of separation: [[H5079]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] abideth [[H935]] not [[H3808]] the fire [[H784]] ye shall make go through [[H5674]] the water. [[H4325]]

### 24
And ye shall wash [[H3526]] your clothes [[H899]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] and ye shall be clean, [[H2891]] and afterward [[H310]] ye shall come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the camp. [[H4264]]

### 25
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 27
And divide [[H2673]] the prey [[H4455]] into two parts; between [[H996]] them that took [[H8610]] the war [[H4421]] upon them, who went out [[H3318]] to battle, [[H6635]] and between [[H996]] all [[H3605]] the congregation: [[H5712]]
