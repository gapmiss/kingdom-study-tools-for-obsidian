And Miriam [[H4813]] and Aaron [[H175]] spake [[H1696]] against Moses [[H4872]] because [[H5921]] of [[H182]] the Ethiopian [[H3571]] woman [[H802]] whom [[H834]] he had married: [[H3947]] for [[H3588]] he had married [[H3947]] an Ethiopian [[H3571]] woman. [[H802]]

### 2
And they said, [[H559]] Hath the Lord [[H3068]] indeed [[H389]] spoken [[H1696]] only [[H7535]] by Moses? [[H4872]] hath he not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] also [[H1571]] by us? And the Lord [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]]

### 3
(Now the man [[H376]] Moses [[H4872]] very [[H3966]] meek, [[H6035]] above all [[H3605]] the men [[H120]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth.) [[H127]]

### 4
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] suddenly [[H6597]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] and unto [[H413]] Miriam, [[H4813]] Come out [[H3318]] ye three [[H7969]] unto [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]] And they three [[H7969]] came out. [[H3318]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] came down [[H3381]] in the pillar [[H5982]] of the cloud, [[H6051]] and stood [[H5975]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle, [[H168]] and called [[H7121]] Aaron [[H175]] and Miriam: [[H4813]] and they both [[H8147]] came forth. [[H3318]]

### 6
And he said, [[H559]] Hear [[H8085]] now [[H4994]] my words: [[H1697]] If [[H518]] there be [[H1961]] a prophet [[H5030]] among you, the Lord [[H3068]] will make myself known [[H3045]] unto [[H413]] him in a vision, [[H4759]] will speak [[H1696]] unto him in a dream. [[H2472]]

### 7
My servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] not [[H3808]] so, [[H3651]] who [[H1931]] faithful [[H539]] in all [[H3605]] mine house. [[H1004]]

### 8
With him will I speak [[H1696]] mouth [[H6310]] to [[H413]] mouth, [[H6310]] even apparently, [[H4758]] and not [[H3808]] in dark speeches; [[H2420]] and the similitude [[H8544]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall he behold: [[H5027]] wherefore [[H4069]] then were ye not afraid [[H3372]] to speak [[H1696]] against my servant [[H5650]] Moses? [[H4872]]

### 9
And the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against them; and he departed. [[H1980]]

### 10
And the cloud [[H6051]] departed [[H5493]] from off [[H5921]] the tabernacle; [[H168]] and, behold, [[H2009]] Miriam [[H4813]] leprous, [[H6879]] as snow: [[H7950]] and Aaron [[H175]] looked [[H6437]] upon [[H413]] Miriam, [[H4813]] and, behold, [[H2009]] leprous. [[H6879]]

### 11
And Aaron [[H175]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Alas, [[H994]] my lord, [[H113]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] lay [[H7896]] not [[H408]] the sin [[H2403]] upon [[H5921]] us, wherein [[H834]] we have done foolishly, [[H2973]] and wherein [[H834]] we have sinned. [[H2398]]

### 12
Let her [[H4994]] not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] as one dead, [[H4191]] of whom [[H834]] the flesh [[H1320]] is half [[H2677]] consumed [[H398]] when he cometh out [[H3318]] of his mother's [[H517]] womb. [[H7358]]

### 13
And Moses [[H4872]] cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Heal [[H7495]] her now, [[H4994]] O God, [[H410]] I beseech thee. [[H4994]]

### 14
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] If her father [[H1]] had but [[H3417]] spit [[H3417]] in her face, [[H6440]] should she not [[H3808]] be ashamed [[H3637]] seven [[H7651]] days? [[H3117]] let her be shut [[H5462]] out [[H2351]] from the camp [[H4264]] seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and after that [[H310]] let her be received in [[H622]]

### 15
And Miriam [[H4813]] was shut [[H5462]] out [[H2351]] from the camp [[H4264]] seven [[H7651]] days: [[H3117]] and the people [[H5971]] journeyed [[H5265]] not [[H3808]] till [[H5704]] Miriam [[H4813]] was brought in [[H622]]

### 16
And afterward [[H310]] the people [[H5971]] removed [[H5265]] from Hazeroth, [[H2698]] and pitched [[H2583]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran. [[H6290]]
