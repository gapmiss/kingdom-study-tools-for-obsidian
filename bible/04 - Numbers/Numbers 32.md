### 1
Now the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] and the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] had [[H1961]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H6099]] multitude [[H7227]] of cattle: [[H4735]] and when they saw [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] of Jazer, [[H3270]] and the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] that, behold, [[H2009]] the place [[H4725]] a place [[H4725]] for cattle; [[H4735]]

### 2
The children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] came [[H935]] and spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and to [[H413]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and unto [[H413]] the princes [[H5387]] of the congregation, [[H5712]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
Ataroth, [[H5852]] and Dibon, [[H1769]] and Jazer, [[H3270]] and Nimrah, [[H5247]] and Heshbon, [[H2809]] and Elealeh, [[H500]] and Shebam, [[H7643]] and Nebo, [[H5015]] and Beon, [[H1194]]

### 4
the country [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] smote [[H5221]] before [[H6440]] the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] a land [[H776]] for cattle, [[H4735]] and thy servants [[H5650]] have cattle: [[H4735]]

### 5
Wherefore, said [[H559]] they, if [[H518]] we have found [[H4672]] grace [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]]  let [[H853]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] be given [[H5414]] unto thy servants [[H5650]] for a possession, [[H272]] bring us not over [[H5674]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 6
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and to the children [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] Shall your brethren [[H251]] go [[H935]] to war, [[H4421]] and shall ye [[H859]] sit [[H3427]] here? [[H6311]]

### 7
And wherefore [[H4100]] discourage ye [[H5106]] the heart [[H3820]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] from going over [[H5674]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath given [[H5414]] them? [[H5414]]

### 8
Thus [[H3541]] did [[H6213]] your fathers, [[H1]] when I sent [[H7971]] them from Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] to see [[H7200]] the land. [[H776]]

### 9
For when they went up [[H5927]] unto [[H5704]] the valley [[H5158]] of Eshcol, [[H812]] and saw [[H7200]] the land, [[H776]] they discouraged [[H5106]] the heart [[H3820]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they should not [[H1115]] go [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had given [[H5414]] them. [[H5414]]

### 10
And the Lord's [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] the same [[H1931]] time, [[H3117]] and he sware, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]]

### 11
Surely [[H518]] none of the men [[H376]] that came up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] from twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] and upward, [[H4605]] shall see [[H7200]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto Abraham, [[H85]] unto Isaac, [[H3327]] and unto Jacob; [[H3290]] because [[H3588]] they have not [[H3808]] wholly [[H4390]] followed [[H310]] me: [[H310]]

### 12
Save [[H1115]] Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] the Kenezite, [[H7074]] and Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun: [[H5126]] for [[H3588]] they have wholly [[H4390]] followed [[H310]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 13
And the Lord's [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and he made them wander [[H5128]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the generation, [[H1755]] that had done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] was consumed. [[H8552]]

### 14
And, behold, [[H2009]] ye are risen up [[H6965]] in your fathers' [[H1]] stead, [[H8478]] an increase [[H8635]] of sinful [[H2400]] men, [[H582]] to augment [[H5595]] yet [[H5750]] the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] toward [[H413]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] if ye turn away [[H7725]] from after [[H310]] him, he will yet [[H5750]] again [[H3254]] leave [[H3240]] them in the wilderness; [[H4057]] and ye shall destroy [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]

### 16
And they came near [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] him, and said, [[H559]] We will build [[H1129]] sheepfolds [[H1448]] here [[H6311]] for our cattle, [[H4735]] and cities [[H5892]] for our little ones: [[H2945]]

### 17
But we ourselves [[H587]] will go ready [[H2363]] armed [[H2502]] before [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] until [[H5704]] we have brought [[H935]] them unto [[H413]] their place: [[H4725]] and our little ones [[H2945]] shall dwell [[H3427]] in the fenced [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] because [[H6440]] of the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 18
We will not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] our houses, [[H1004]] until [[H5704]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] have inherited [[H5157]] every man [[H376]] his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] we will not [[H3808]] inherit [[H5157]] with [[H854]] them on yonder side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] or forward; [[H1973]] because [[H3588]] our inheritance [[H5159]] is fallen [[H935]] to [[H413]] us on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] eastward. [[H4217]]

### 20
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, If [[H518]] ye will do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing, [[H1697]] if [[H518]] ye will go armed [[H2502]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] to war, [[H4421]]

### 21
And will go [[H5674]] all [[H3605]] of you armed [[H2502]]  over [[H853]] Jordan [[H3383]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] he hath driven out [[H3423]] his enemies [[H341]] from before [[H6440]] him, [[H6440]]

### 22
And the land [[H776]] be subdued [[H3533]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] then afterward [[H310]] ye shall return, [[H7725]] and be [[H1961]] guiltless [[H5355]] before the Lord, [[H3068]] and before Israel; [[H3478]] and this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] shall be [[H1961]] your possession [[H272]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
But if [[H518]] ye will not [[H3808]] do so, [[H6213]] behold, [[H2009]] ye have sinned [[H2398]] against the Lord: [[H3068]] and be sure [[H3045]] your sin [[H2403]] will find you out. [[H4672]]

### 24
Build [[H1129]] you cities [[H5892]] for your little ones, [[H2945]] and folds [[H1448]] for your sheep; [[H6792]] and do [[H6213]] that which hath proceeded out [[H3318]] of your mouth. [[H6310]]

### 25
And the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]] Thy servants [[H5650]] will do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] commandeth. [[H6680]]

### 26
Our little ones, [[H2945]] our wives, [[H802]] our flocks, [[H4735]] and all [[H3605]] our cattle, [[H929]] shall be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Gilead: [[H1568]]

### 27
But thy servants [[H5650]] will pass over, [[H5674]] every man [[H3605]] armed [[H2502]] for war, [[H6635]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] to battle, [[H4421]] as [[H834]] my lord [[H113]] saith. [[H1696]]

### 28
So concerning them Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and the chief [[H7218]] fathers [[H1]] of the tribes [[H4294]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 29
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, If [[H518]] the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] will pass with you over [[H5674]] Jordan, [[H3383]] every man [[H3605]] armed [[H2502]] to battle, [[H4421]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and the land [[H776]] shall be subdued [[H3533]] before [[H6440]] you; then ye shall give [[H5414]]  them [[H853]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] for a possession: [[H272]]

### 30
But if [[H518]] they will not [[H3808]] pass over [[H5674]] with [[H854]] you armed, [[H2502]] they shall have possessions [[H270]] among [[H8432]] you in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 31
And the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] and the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] answered, [[H6030]] saying, [[H559]] As [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thy servants, [[H5650]] so [[H3651]] will we do. [[H6213]]

### 32
We will [[H5168]] pass over [[H5674]] armed [[H2502]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] into the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] that the possession [[H272]] of our inheritance [[H5159]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] ours. [[H3383]]

### 33
And Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H5414]] unto them, to the children [[H1121]] of Gad, [[H1410]] and to the children [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] and unto half [[H2677]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] the son [[H1121]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] the kingdom [[H4467]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] and the kingdom [[H4467]] of Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] the land, [[H776]] with the cities [[H5892]] thereof in the coasts, [[H1367]] the cities [[H5892]] of the country [[H776]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 34
And the children [[H1121]] of Gad [[H1410]] built [[H1129]] Dibon, [[H1769]] and Ataroth, [[H5852]] and Aroer, [[H6177]]

### 35
And [[H853]] Atroth, [[H5852]] Shophan, [[H5855]] and Jaazer, [[H3270]] and Jogbehah, [[H3011]]

### 36
And Beth-nimrah, [[H1039]] and Beth-haran, [[H1028]] fenced [[H4013]] cities: [[H5892]] and folds [[H1448]] for sheep. [[H6629]]

### 37
And the children [[H1121]] of Reuben [[H7205]] built [[H1129]] Heshbon, [[H2809]] and Elealeh, [[H500]] and Kirjathaim, [[H7156]]

### 38
And Nebo, [[H5015]] and Baal-meon, [[H1186]] (their names [[H8034]] being changed,) [[H5437]] and [[H853]] Shibmah: [[H7643]] and gave [[H7121]] other names [[H8034]] unto the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] they builded. [[H1129]]

### 39
And the children [[H1121]] of Machir [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] went [[H1980]] to Gilead, [[H1568]] and took [[H3920]] it, and dispossessed [[H3423]] the Amorite [[H567]] which [[H834]] in it. [[H834]]

### 40
And Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H5414]] Gilead [[H1568]] unto Machir [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh; [[H4519]] and he dwelt [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 41
And Jair [[H2971]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] went [[H1980]] and took [[H3920]] the small towns [[H2333]] thereof, and called [[H7121]] them Havoth-jair. [[H2334]]

### 42
And Nobah [[H5025]] went [[H1980]] and took [[H3920]] Kenath, [[H7079]] and the villages [[H1323]] thereof, and called [[H7121]] it Nobah, [[H5025]] after his own name. [[H8034]]
