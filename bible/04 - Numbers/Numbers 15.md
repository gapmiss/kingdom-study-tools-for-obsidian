And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, When [[H3588]] ye be come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of your habitations, [[H4186]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] give [[H5414]] unto you, [[H5414]]

### 3
And will make [[H6213]] an offering by fire [[H801]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] a burnt offering, [[H5930]] or [[H176]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] in performing [[H6381]] a vow, [[H5088]] or [[H176]] in a freewill offering, [[H5071]] or [[H176]] in your solemn feasts, [[H4150]] to make [[H6213]] a sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] of [[H4480]] the herd, [[H1241]] or [[H176]] of [[H4480]] the flock: [[H6629]]

### 4
Then shall he that offereth [[H7126]] his offering [[H7133]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] bring [[H7126]] a meat offering [[H4503]] of a tenth deal [[H6241]] of flour [[H5560]] mingled [[H1101]] with the fourth [[H7243]] of an hin [[H1969]] of oil. [[H8081]]

### 5
And the fourth [[H7243]] of an hin [[H1969]] of wine [[H3196]] for a drink offering [[H5262]] shalt thou prepare [[H6213]] with [[H5921]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] or [[H176]] sacrifice, [[H2077]] for one [[H259]] lamb. [[H3532]]

### 6
Or [[H176]] for a ram, [[H352]] thou shalt prepare [[H6213]] a meat offering [[H4503]] two [[H8147]] tenth deals [[H6241]] of flour [[H5560]] mingled [[H1101]] with the third [[H7992]] of an hin [[H1969]] of oil. [[H8081]]

### 7
And for a drink offering [[H5262]] thou shalt offer [[H7126]] the third [[H7992]] of an hin [[H1969]] of wine, [[H3196]] a sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
And when [[H3588]] thou preparest [[H6213]] a bullock [[H1121]] a burnt offering, [[H5930]] or [[H176]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] in performing [[H6381]] a vow, [[H5088]] or [[H176]] peace offerings [[H8002]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 9
Then shall he bring [[H7126]] with [[H5921]] a bullock [[H1241]] a meat offering [[H4503]] of three [[H7969]] tenth deals [[H6241]] of flour [[H5560]] mingled [[H1101]] with half [[H2677]] an hin [[H1969]] of oil. [[H8081]]

### 10
And thou shalt bring [[H7126]] for a drink offering [[H5262]] half [[H2677]] an hin [[H1969]] of wine, [[H3196]] an offering made by fire, [[H801]] of a sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 11
Thus [[H3602]] shall it be done [[H6213]] for one [[H259]] bullock, [[H7794]] or [[H176]] for one [[H259]] ram, [[H352]] or [[H176]] for a lamb, [[H3532]] or [[H176]] a kid. [[H5795]]

### 12
According to the number [[H4557]] that [[H834]] ye shall prepare, [[H6213]] so [[H3602]] shall ye do [[H6213]] to every one [[H259]] according to their number. [[H4557]]

### 13
All [[H3605]] that are born of the country [[H249]] shall do [[H6213]] these things [[H428]] after this manner, [[H3602]] in offering [[H7126]] an offering made by fire, [[H801]] of a sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
And if [[H3588]] a stranger [[H1616]] sojourn [[H1481]] with [[H854]] you, or [[H176]] whosoever [[H834]] among [[H8432]] you in your generations, [[H1755]] and will offer [[H6213]] an offering made by fire, [[H801]] of a sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] as [[H834]] ye do, [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] he shall do. [[H6213]]

### 15
One [[H259]] ordinance [[H2708]] for you of the congregation, [[H6951]] and also for the stranger [[H1616]] that sojourneth [[H1481]] an ordinance [[H2708]] for ever [[H5769]] in your generations: [[H1755]] as ye so shall the stranger [[H1616]] be [[H1961]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 16
One [[H259]] law [[H8451]] and one [[H259]] manner [[H4941]] shall be [[H1961]] for you, and for the stranger [[H1616]] that sojourneth [[H1481]] with [[H854]] you. [[H854]]

### 17
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 18
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, When ye come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] I [[H589]] bring [[H935]] you, [[H935]]

### 19
Then it shall be, [[H1961]] that, when ye eat [[H398]] of the bread [[H3899]] of the land, [[H776]] ye shall offer up [[H7311]] an heave offering [[H8641]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 20
Ye shall offer up [[H7311]] a cake [[H2471]] of the first [[H7225]] of your dough [[H6182]] an heave offering: [[H8641]] as the heave offering [[H8641]] of the threshingfloor, [[H1637]] so [[H3651]] shall ye heave [[H7311]] it. [[H7311]]

### 21
Of the first [[H7225]] of your dough [[H6182]] ye shall give [[H5414]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] an heave offering [[H8641]] in your generations. [[H1755]]

### 22
And if [[H3588]] ye have erred, [[H7686]] and not [[H3808]] observed [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 23
all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath commanded [[H6680]] you by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses, [[H4872]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] and henceforward [[H1973]] among your generations; [[H1755]]

### 24
Then it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] be committed [[H6213]] by ignorance [[H7684]] without the knowledge [[H5869]] of the congregation, [[H5712]] that all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] shall offer [[H6213]] one [[H259]] young [[H1121]] bullock [[H6499]] for a burnt offering, [[H5930]] for a sweet [[H5207]] savour [[H7381]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] with his meat offering, [[H4503]] and his drink offering, [[H5262]] according to the manner, [[H4941]] and one [[H259]] kid [[H8163]] of the goats [[H5795]] for a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 25
And the priest [[H3548]] shall make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and it shall be forgiven [[H5545]] them; for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] ignorance: [[H7684]] and they [[H1992]] shall bring [[H935]] their offering, [[H7133]] a sacrifice made by fire [[H801]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and their sin offering [[H2403]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] for [[H5921]] their ignorance: [[H7684]]

### 26
And it shall be forgiven [[H5545]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and the stranger [[H1616]] that sojourneth [[H1481]] among [[H8432]] them; seeing [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] in ignorance. [[H7684]]

### 27
And if [[H518]] any [[H259]] soul [[H5315]] sin [[H2398]] through ignorance, [[H7684]] then he shall bring [[H7126]] a she goat [[H5795]] of the first [[H1323]] year [[H8141]] for a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 28
And the priest [[H3548]] shall make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the soul [[H5315]] that sinneth ignorantly, [[H7683]] when he sinneth [[H2398]] by ignorance [[H7684]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] to make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] him; and it shall be forgiven [[H5545]] him. [[H5545]]

### 29
Ye shall have [[H1961]] one [[H259]] law [[H8451]] for him that sinneth [[H6213]] through ignorance, [[H7684]] him that is born [[H249]] among the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and for the stranger [[H1616]] that sojourneth [[H1481]] among [[H8432]] them. [[H8432]]

### 30
But the soul [[H5315]] that [[H834]] doeth [[H6213]] presumptuously, [[H7311]] born in the land, [[H249]] or a stranger, [[H1616]] the same [[H1931]] reproacheth [[H1442]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and that [[H1931]] soul [[H5315]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from among [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 31
Because [[H3588]] he hath despised [[H959]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and hath broken [[H6565]] his commandment, [[H4687]] that [[H1931]] soul [[H5315]] shall utterly [[H3772]] be cut off; [[H3772]] his iniquity [[H5771]] upon him. [[H5771]]

### 32
And while the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] were [[H1961]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] they found [[H4672]] a man [[H376]] that gathered [[H7197]] sticks [[H6086]] upon the sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]]

### 33
And they that found [[H4672]] him gathering [[H7197]] sticks [[H6086]] brought [[H7126]] him unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] and unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the congregation. [[H5712]]

### 34
And they put [[H3240]] him in ward, [[H4929]] because [[H3588]] it was not [[H3808]] declared [[H6567]] what [[H4100]] should be done [[H6213]] to him. [[H6213]]

### 35
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] The man [[H376]] shall be surely [[H4191]] put to death: [[H4191]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] shall stone [[H7275]] him with stones [[H68]] without [[H2351]] the camp. [[H4264]]

### 36
And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] brought [[H3318]] him without [[H2351]] the camp, [[H4264]] and stoned [[H7275]] him with stones, [[H68]] and he died; [[H4191]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 37
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 38
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and bid [[H559]] them that they make [[H6213]] them fringes [[H6734]] in [[H5921]] the borders [[H3671]] of their garments [[H899]] throughout their generations, [[H1755]] and that they put [[H5414]] upon [[H5921]] the fringe [[H6734]] of the borders [[H3671]] a ribband [[H6616]] of blue: [[H8504]]

### 39
And it shall be [[H1961]] unto you for a fringe, [[H6734]] that ye may look upon [[H7200]] it, and remember [[H2142]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and do [[H6213]] them; and that ye seek [[H8446]] not [[H3808]] after [[H310]] your own heart [[H3824]] and your own eyes, [[H5869]] after [[H310]] which [[H834]] ye [[H859]] use to go a whoring: [[H2181]]

### 40
That [[H4616]] ye may remember, [[H2142]] and do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] my commandments, [[H4687]] and be [[H1961]] holy [[H6918]] unto your God. [[H430]]

### 41
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] to be [[H1961]] your God: [[H430]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]
