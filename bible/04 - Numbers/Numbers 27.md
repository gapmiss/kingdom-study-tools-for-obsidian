### 1
Then came [[H7126]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Zelophehad, [[H6765]] the son [[H1121]] of Hepher, [[H2660]] the son [[H1121]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] the son [[H1121]] of Machir, [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] of the families [[H4940]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] the son [[H1121]] of Joseph: [[H3130]] and these [[H428]] the names [[H8034]] of his daughters; [[H1323]] Mahlah, [[H4244]] Noah, [[H5270]] and Hoglah, [[H2295]] and Milcah, [[H4435]] and Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 2
And they stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Moses, [[H4872]] and before [[H6440]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and before [[H6440]] the princes [[H5387]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation, [[H5712]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
Our father [[H1]] died [[H4191]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] in [[H8432]] the company [[H5712]] of them that gathered themselves together [[H3259]] against [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the company [[H5712]] of Korah; [[H7141]] but [[H3588]] died [[H4191]] in his own sin, [[H2399]] and had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sons. [[H1121]]

### 4
Why [[H4100]] should the name [[H8034]] of our father [[H1]] be done away [[H1639]] from among [[H8432]] his family, [[H4940]] because [[H3588]] he hath no [[H369]] son? [[H1121]] Give [[H5414]] unto us a possession [[H272]] among [[H8432]] the brethren [[H251]] of our father. [[H1]]

### 5
And Moses [[H4872]] brought [[H7126]] their cause [[H4941]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 7
The daughters [[H1323]] of Zelophehad [[H6765]] speak [[H1696]] right: [[H3651]] thou shalt surely [[H5414]] give [[H5414]] them a possession [[H272]] of an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] their father's [[H1]] brethren; [[H251]]  and thou shalt cause [[H853]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of their father [[H1]] to pass [[H5674]] unto them. [[H5674]]

### 8
And thou shalt speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] die, [[H4191]] and have no [[H369]] son, [[H1121]]  then ye shall cause [[H853]] his inheritance [[H5159]] to pass [[H5674]] unto his daughter. [[H1323]]

### 9
And if [[H518]] he have no [[H369]] daughter, [[H1323]] then ye shall give [[H5414]] his inheritance [[H5159]] unto his brethren. [[H251]]

### 10
And if [[H518]] he have no [[H369]] brethren, [[H251]] then ye shall give [[H5414]] his inheritance [[H5159]] unto his father's [[H1]] brethren. [[H251]]

### 11
And if [[H518]] his father [[H1]] have no [[H369]] brethren, [[H251]] then ye shall give [[H5414]] his inheritance [[H5159]] unto his kinsman [[H7607]] that is next [[H7138]] to [[H413]] him of his family, [[H4940]] and he shall possess [[H3423]] it: and it shall be [[H1961]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] a statute [[H2708]] of judgment, [[H4941]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 12
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Get thee up [[H5927]] into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] mount [[H2022]] Abarim, [[H5682]] and see [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I have given [[H5414]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 13
And when thou hast seen [[H7200]] it, thou [[H859]] also [[H1571]] shalt be gathered [[H622]] unto [[H413]] thy people, [[H5971]] as [[H834]] Aaron [[H175]] thy brother [[H251]] was gathered. [[H622]]

### 14
For [[H834]] ye rebelled against [[H4784]] my commandment [[H6310]] in the desert [[H4057]] of Zin, [[H6790]] in the strife [[H4808]] of the congregation, [[H5712]] to sanctify [[H6942]] me at the water [[H4325]] before their eyes: [[H5869]] that [[H1992]] the water [[H4325]] of Meribah [[H4809]] in Kadesh [[H6946]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin. [[H6790]]

### 15
And Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Let the Lord, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of the spirits [[H7307]] of all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] set [[H6485]] a man [[H376]] over [[H5921]] the congregation, [[H5712]]

### 17
Which [[H834]] may go out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] them, and which [[H834]] may go in [[H935]] before [[H6440]] them, and which [[H834]] may lead them out, [[H3318]] and which [[H834]] may bring them in; [[H935]] that the congregation [[H5712]] of the Lord [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] as sheep [[H6629]] which [[H834]] have no [[H369]] shepherd. [[H7462]]

### 18
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Take [[H3947]]  thee [[H853]] Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] a man [[H376]] in whom [[H834]] the spirit, [[H7307]] and lay [[H5564]] thine hand [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] him; [[H5921]]

### 19
And set [[H5975]] him before [[H6440]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and before [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the congregation; [[H5712]] and give him a charge [[H6680]] in their sight. [[H5869]]

### 20
And thou shalt put [[H5414]] of thine honour [[H1935]] upon [[H5921]] him, that [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] may be obedient. [[H8085]]

### 21
And he shall stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] who shall ask [[H7592]] for him after the judgment [[H4941]] of Urim [[H224]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] at [[H5921]] his word [[H6310]] shall they go out, [[H3318]] and at [[H5921]] his word [[H6310]] they shall come in, [[H935]] he, [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] with [[H854]] him, even all [[H3605]] the congregation. [[H5712]]

### 22
And Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] him: and he took [[H3947]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and set [[H5975]] him before [[H6440]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and before [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the congregation: [[H5712]]

### 23
And he laid [[H5564]] his hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] him, and gave him a charge, [[H6680]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H1696]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses. [[H4872]]
