### 17
And Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] them to spy out [[H8446]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Get you up [[H5927]] this [[H2088]] southward, [[H5045]] and go up [[H5927]] into [[H853]] the mountain: [[H2022]]

### 18
And see [[H7200]] the land, [[H776]] what [[H4100]] it [[H1931]] and the people [[H5971]] that dwelleth [[H3427]] therein, [[H5921]] whether they [[H1931]] strong [[H2389]] or weak, [[H7504]] few [[H4592]] or [[H518]] many; [[H7227]]

### 19
And what [[H4100]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] they [[H1931]] dwell in, [[H3427]] whether it [[H1931]] good [[H2896]] or [[H518]] bad; [[H7451]] and what [[H4100]] cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] they [[H1931]] dwell [[H3427]] in, [[H2007]] whether in tents, [[H4264]] or [[H518]] in strong holds; [[H4013]]

### 20
And what [[H4100]] the land [[H776]] whether it [[H1931]] fat [[H8082]] or [[H518]] lean, [[H7330]] whether there be [[H3426]] wood [[H6086]] therein, or [[H518]] not. [[H369]] And be ye of good courage, [[H2388]] and bring [[H3947]] of the fruit [[H6529]] of the land. [[H776]] Now the time [[H3117]] the time [[H3117]] of the firstripe [[H1061]] grapes. [[H6025]]

### 21
So they went up, [[H5927]] and searched [[H8446]] the land [[H776]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin [[H6790]] unto [[H5704]] Rehob, [[H7340]] as men come [[H935]] to Hamath. [[H2574]]

### 22
And they ascended [[H5927]] by the south, [[H5045]] and came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] Hebron; [[H2275]] where [[H8033]] Ahiman, [[H289]] Sheshai, [[H8344]] and Talmai, [[H8526]] the children [[H3211]] of Anak, [[H6061]] (Now Hebron [[H2275]] was built [[H1129]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] before [[H6440]] Zoan [[H6814]] in Egypt.) [[H4714]]

### 23
And they came [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] the brook [[H5158]] of Eshcol, [[H812]] and cut down [[H3772]] from thence [[H8033]] a branch [[H2156]] with one [[H259]] cluster [[H811]] of grapes, [[H6025]] and they bare [[H5375]] it between two [[H8147]] upon a staff; [[H4132]] and of [[H4480]] the pomegranates, [[H7416]] and of [[H4480]] the figs. [[H8384]]

### 24
The place [[H4725]] was called [[H7121]] the brook [[H5158]] Eshcol, [[H812]] because [[H5921]] of [[H182]] the cluster of grapes [[H811]] which [[H834]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] cut down [[H3772]] from thence. [[H8033]]

### 25
And they returned [[H7725]] from searching [[H8446]] of the land [[H776]] after [[H7093]] forty [[H705]] days. [[H3117]]

### 26
And they went [[H1980]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] unto [[H413]] the wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran, [[H6290]] to Kadesh; [[H6946]] and brought back [[H7725]] word [[H1697]] unto them, and unto all [[H3605]] the congregation, [[H5712]] and shewed [[H7200]]  them [[H853]] the fruit [[H6529]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 27
And they told [[H5608]] him, and said, [[H559]] We came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the land [[H776]] whither [[H834]] thou sentest [[H7971]] us, and surely [[H1571]] it [[H1931]] floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey; [[H1706]] and this [[H2088]] the fruit [[H6529]] of it. [[H6529]]

### 28
Nevertheless [[H657]] the people [[H5971]] strong [[H5794]] that dwell [[H3427]] in the land, [[H776]] and the cities [[H5892]] walled, [[H1219]] very [[H3966]] great: [[H1419]] and moreover [[H1571]] we saw [[H7200]] the children [[H3211]] of Anak [[H6061]] there. [[H8033]]

### 29
The Amalekites [[H6002]] dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of the south: [[H5045]] and the Hittites, [[H2850]] and the Jebusites, [[H2983]] and the Amorites, [[H567]] dwell [[H3427]] in the mountains: [[H2022]] and the Canaanites [[H3669]] dwell [[H3427]] by [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] and by [[H5921]] the coast [[H3027]] of Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 30
And Caleb [[H3612]] stilled [[H2013]] the people [[H5971]] before [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] Let us go up [[H5927]] at once, [[H5927]] and possess [[H3423]] it; for [[H3588]] we are well able [[H3201]] to overcome [[H3201]] it. [[H3201]]

### 31
But the men [[H376]] that [[H834]] went up [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] him said, [[H559]] We be not able [[H3201]] to go up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] the people; [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] stronger [[H2389]] than [[H4480]] we. [[H4480]]

### 32
And they brought up [[H3318]] an evil report [[H1681]] of the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] they had searched [[H8446]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] The land, [[H776]] through which [[H834]] we have gone [[H5674]] to search [[H8446]] it, a land [[H776]] that [[H1931]] eateth up [[H398]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof; and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] that [[H834]] we saw [[H7200]] in it [[H8432]] men [[H376]] of a great stature. [[H4060]]

### 33
And there [[H8033]] we saw [[H7200]] the giants, [[H5303]] the sons [[H1121]] of Anak, [[H6061]] of [[H4480]] the giants: [[H5303]] and we were [[H1961]] in our own sight [[H5869]] as grasshoppers, [[H2284]] and so [[H3651]] we were [[H1961]] in their sight. [[H5869]]
