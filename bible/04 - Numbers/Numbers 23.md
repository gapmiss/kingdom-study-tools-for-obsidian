### 1
And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] Build [[H1129]] me here [[H2088]] seven [[H7651]] altars, [[H4196]] and prepare [[H3559]] me here [[H2088]] seven [[H7651]] oxen [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams. [[H352]]

### 2
And Balak [[H1111]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Balaam [[H1109]] had spoken; [[H1696]] and Balak [[H1111]] and Balaam [[H1109]] offered [[H5927]] on altar [[H4196]] a bullock [[H6499]] and a ram. [[H352]]

### 3
And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] unto Balak, [[H1111]] Stand [[H3320]] by [[H5921]] thy burnt offering, [[H5930]] and I will go: [[H1980]] peradventure [[H194]] the Lord [[H3068]] will come [[H7136]] to meet [[H7125]] me: and whatsoever [[H1697]] he sheweth [[H7200]] me I will tell [[H5046]] thee. And he went [[H1980]] to an high place. [[H8205]]

### 4
And God [[H430]] met [[H7136]] Balaam: [[H1109]] and he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, I have prepared [[H6186]] seven [[H7651]] altars, [[H4196]] and I have offered [[H5927]] upon altar [[H4196]] a bullock [[H6499]] and a ram. [[H352]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] put [[H7760]] a word [[H1697]] in Balaam's [[H1109]] mouth, [[H6310]] and said, [[H559]] Return [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] and thus [[H3541]] thou shalt speak. [[H1696]]

### 6
And he returned [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] him, and, lo, [[H2009]] he stood [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] his burnt sacrifice, [[H5930]] he, [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 7
And he took up [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]] Balak [[H1111]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] hath brought [[H5148]] me from [[H4480]] Aram, [[H758]] out of the mountains [[H2042]] of the east, [[H6924]] Come, [[H1980]] curse [[H779]] me Jacob, [[H3290]] and come, [[H1980]] defy [[H2194]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
How [[H4100]] shall I curse, [[H5344]] whom God [[H410]] hath not [[H3808]] cursed? [[H6895]] or how [[H4100]] shall I defy, [[H2194]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath not [[H3808]] defied? [[H2194]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] from the top [[H7218]] of the rocks [[H6697]] I see [[H7200]] him, and from the hills [[H1389]] I behold [[H7789]] him: lo, [[H2005]] the people [[H5971]] shall dwell [[H7931]] alone, [[H910]] and shall not [[H3808]] be reckoned [[H2803]] among the nations. [[H1471]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] can count [[H4487]] the dust [[H6083]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and the number [[H4557]]  of [[H853]] the fourth [[H7255]] of Israel? [[H3478]] Let me [[H5315]] die [[H4191]] the death [[H4194]] of the righteous, [[H3477]] and let my last end [[H319]] be [[H1961]] like his! [[H3644]]

### 11
And Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] What [[H4100]] hast thou done [[H6213]] unto me? I took [[H3947]] thee to curse [[H6895]] mine enemies, [[H341]] and, behold, [[H2009]] thou hast blessed [[H1288]] altogether. [[H1288]]

### 12
And he answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] Must I not [[H3808]] take heed [[H8104]] to speak [[H1696]]  that [[H853]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath put [[H7760]] in my mouth? [[H6310]]

### 13
And Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Come, [[H1980]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] with [[H854]] me unto [[H413]] another [[H312]] place, [[H4725]] from whence [[H834]] thou mayest see [[H7200]] them: thou shalt see [[H7200]] but [[H657]] the utmost part [[H7097]] of them, and shalt not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] them all: [[H3605]] and curse [[H6895]] me them from thence. [[H8033]]

### 14
And he brought [[H3947]] him into the field [[H7704]] of Zophim, [[H6839]] to [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of Pisgah, [[H6449]] and built [[H1129]] seven [[H7651]] altars, [[H4196]] and offered [[H5927]] a bullock [[H6499]] and a ram [[H352]] on altar. [[H4196]]

### 15
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] Stand [[H3320]] here [[H3541]] by [[H5921]] thy burnt offering, [[H5930]] while I [[H595]] meet [[H7136]] yonder. [[H3541]]

### 16
And the Lord [[H3068]] met [[H7136]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and put [[H7760]] a word [[H1697]] in his mouth, [[H6310]] and said, [[H559]] Go again [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] and say [[H1696]] thus. [[H3541]]

### 17
And when he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] him, behold, [[H2009]] he stood [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] his burnt offering, [[H5930]] and the princes [[H8269]] of Moab [[H4124]] with [[H854]] him. And Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] unto him, What [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] spoken? [[H1696]]

### 18
And he took up [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]] Rise up, [[H6965]] Balak, [[H1111]] and hear; [[H8085]] hearken [[H238]] unto [[H5704]] me, thou son [[H1121]] of Zippor: [[H6834]]

### 19
God [[H410]] not [[H3808]] a man, [[H376]] that he should lie; [[H3576]] neither the son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] that he should repent: [[H5162]] hath he [[H1931]] said, [[H559]] and shall he not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] or hath he spoken, [[H1696]] and shall he not [[H3808]] make it good? [[H6965]]

### 20
Behold, [[H2009]] I have received [[H3947]] to bless: [[H1288]] and he hath blessed; [[H1288]] and I cannot [[H3808]] reverse [[H7725]] it. [[H7725]]

### 21
He hath not [[H3808]] beheld [[H5027]] iniquity [[H205]] in Jacob, [[H3290]] neither [[H3808]] hath he seen [[H7200]] perverseness [[H5999]] in Israel: [[H3478]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] him, and the shout [[H8643]] of a king [[H4428]] among them. [[H4428]]

### 22
God [[H410]] brought them out [[H3318]] of Egypt; [[H4714]] he hath as it were the strength [[H8443]] of an unicorn. [[H7214]]

### 23
Surely [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] enchantment [[H5173]] against Jacob, [[H3290]] neither [[H3808]] any divination [[H7081]] against Israel: [[H3478]] according to this time [[H6256]] it shall be said [[H559]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and of Israel, [[H3478]] What [[H4100]] hath God [[H410]] wrought! [[H6466]]

### 24
Behold, [[H2005]] the people [[H5971]] shall rise up [[H6965]] as a great lion, [[H3833]] and lift up himself [[H5375]] as a young lion: [[H738]] he shall not [[H3808]] lie down [[H7901]] until [[H5704]] he eat [[H398]] the prey, [[H2964]] and drink [[H8354]] the blood [[H1818]] of the slain. [[H2491]]

### 25
And Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] Neither [[H1571]] curse [[H5344]] them at all, [[H6895]] nor [[H1571]] bless [[H1288]] them at all. [[H1288]]

### 26
But Balaam [[H1109]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] Told [[H1696]] not [[H3808]] I thee, saying, [[H559]] All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] speaketh, [[H1696]] that I must do? [[H6213]]

### 27
And Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] Come, [[H1980]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] I will bring [[H3947]] thee unto [[H413]] another [[H312]] place; [[H4725]] peradventure [[H194]] it will please [[H3477]] God [[H430]] that thou mayest curse [[H6895]] me them from thence. [[H8033]]

### 28
And Balak [[H1111]] brought [[H3947]] Balaam [[H1109]] unto the top [[H7218]] of Peor, [[H6465]] that looketh [[H8259]] toward [[H6440]] Jeshimon. [[H3452]]

### 29
And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] Build [[H1129]] me here [[H2088]] seven [[H7651]] altars, [[H4196]] and prepare [[H3559]] me here [[H2088]] seven [[H7651]] bullocks [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams. [[H352]]

### 30
And Balak [[H1111]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Balaam [[H1109]] had said, [[H559]] and offered [[H5927]] a bullock [[H6499]] and a ram [[H352]] on altar. [[H4196]]
