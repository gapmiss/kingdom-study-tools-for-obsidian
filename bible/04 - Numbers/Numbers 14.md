### 1
And all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] lifted up [[H5375]] their voice, [[H6963]] and cried; [[H5414]] and the people [[H5971]] wept [[H1058]] that [[H1931]] night. [[H3915]]

### 2
And all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] murmured [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and against [[H5921]] Aaron: [[H175]] and the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Would God that [[H3863]] we had died [[H4191]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt! [[H4714]] or [[H176]] would God [[H3863]] we had died [[H4191]] in this [[H2088]] wilderness! [[H4057]]

### 3
And wherefore [[H4100]] hath the Lord [[H3068]] brought [[H935]] us unto [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] to fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] that our wives [[H802]] and our children [[H2945]] should be [[H1961]] a prey? [[H957]] were it not [[H3808]] better [[H2896]] for us to return [[H7725]] into Egypt? [[H4714]]

### 4
And they said [[H559]] one [[H376]] to [[H413]] another, [[H251]] Let us make [[H5414]] a captain, [[H7218]] and let us return [[H7725]] into Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 5
Then Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] their faces [[H6440]] before [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the assembly [[H6951]] of the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
And Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh, [[H3312]] of [[H4480]] them that searched [[H8446]] the land, [[H776]] rent [[H7167]] their clothes: [[H899]]

### 7
And they spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the company [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] The land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] we passed through [[H5674]] to search [[H8446]] it, an exceeding [[H3966]] good [[H2896]] land. [[H776]]

### 8
If [[H518]] the Lord [[H3068]] delight [[H2654]] in us, then he will bring [[H935]] us into [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] and give [[H5414]] it us; a land [[H776]] which [[H834]] floweth [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

### 9
Only [[H389]] rebel [[H4775]] not [[H408]] ye against the Lord, [[H3068]] neither [[H408]] fear [[H3372]] ye [[H859]] the people [[H5971]] of the land; [[H776]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] bread [[H3899]] for us: their defence [[H6738]] is departed [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] them, and the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H854]] us: fear [[H3372]] them not. [[H408]]

### 10
But all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] bade [[H559]] stone [[H7275]] them with stones. [[H68]] And the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] before [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] How long [[H5704]] will this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] provoke [[H5006]] me? and how long [[H5704]] will it be ere [[H3808]] they believe [[H539]] me, for all [[H3605]] the signs [[H226]] which [[H834]] I have shewed [[H6213]] among [[H7130]] them? [[H7130]]

### 12
I will smite [[H5221]] them with the pestilence, [[H1698]] and disinherit [[H3423]] them, and will make [[H6213]] of thee a greater [[H1419]] nation [[H1471]] and mightier [[H6099]] than [[H4480]] they. [[H4480]]

### 13
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Then the Egyptians [[H4714]] shall hear [[H8085]] (for [[H3588]] thou broughtest up [[H5927]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] in thy might [[H3581]] from among [[H7130]] them;) [[H7130]]

### 14
And they will tell [[H559]] to [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] land: [[H776]] they have heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] Lord [[H3068]] among [[H7130]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] that [[H834]] thou [[H859]] Lord [[H3068]] art seen [[H7200]] face [[H5869]] to face, [[H5869]] and thy cloud [[H6051]] standeth [[H5975]] over [[H5921]] them, and thou [[H859]] goest [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] them, by day time [[H3119]] in a pillar [[H5982]] of a cloud, [[H6051]] and in a pillar [[H5982]] of fire [[H784]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 15
Now thou shalt kill [[H4191]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] as one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] then the nations [[H1471]] which [[H834]] have heard [[H8085]] the fame [[H8088]] of thee will speak, [[H559]] saying, [[H559]]

### 16
Because the Lord [[H3068]] was not [[H1115]] able [[H3201]] to bring [[H935]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto them, therefore he hath slain [[H7819]] them in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 17
And now, [[H6258]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] let the power [[H3581]] of my Lord [[H136]] be great, [[H1431]] according as [[H834]] thou hast spoken, [[H1696]] saying, [[H559]]

### 18
The Lord [[H3068]] longsuffering, [[H750]] and of great [[H7227]] mercy, [[H2617]] forgiving [[H5375]] iniquity [[H5771]] and transgression, [[H6588]] and by no means [[H5352]] clearing [[H5352]] visiting [[H6485]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] upon [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] unto [[H5921]] the third [[H8029]] and fourth [[H7256]]

### 19
Pardon, [[H5545]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] according unto the greatness [[H1433]] of thy mercy, [[H2617]] and as [[H834]] thou hast forgiven [[H5375]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] from Egypt [[H4714]] even until [[H5704]] now. [[H2008]]

### 20
And the Lord [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] I have pardoned [[H5545]] according to thy word: [[H1697]]

### 21
But truly [[H199]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] shall be filled [[H4390]] with the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 22
Because [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] those men [[H582]] which have seen [[H7200]] my glory, [[H3519]] and my miracles, [[H226]] which [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] in Egypt [[H4714]] and in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and have tempted [[H5254]] me now these [[H2088]] ten [[H6235]] times, [[H6471]] and have not [[H3808]] hearkened [[H8085]] to my voice; [[H6963]]

### 23
Surely [[H518]] they shall not see [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] unto their fathers, [[H1]] neither [[H3808]] shall any [[H3605]] of them that provoked [[H5006]] me see [[H7200]] it: [[H7200]]

### 24
But my servant [[H5650]] Caleb, [[H3612]] because [[H6118]] he had [[H1961]] another [[H312]] spirit [[H7307]] with [[H5973]] him, and hath followed [[H310]] me fully, [[H4390]] him will I bring [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] whereinto [[H834]] he went; [[H935]] and his seed [[H2233]] shall possess [[H3423]] it. [[H3423]]

### 25
(Now the Amalekites [[H6003]] and the Canaanites [[H3669]] dwelt [[H3427]] in the valley.) [[H6010]] To morrow [[H4279]] turn [[H6437]] you, and get [[H5265]] you into the wilderness [[H4057]] by the way [[H1870]] of the Red [[H5488]] sea. [[H3220]]

### 26
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] saying, [[H559]]

### 27
How long [[H5704]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] congregation, [[H5712]] which [[H834]] murmur [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] me? I have heard [[H8085]] the murmurings [[H8519]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] murmur [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 28
Say [[H559]] unto them, [[H413]] I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] ye have spoken [[H1696]] in mine ears, [[H241]] so [[H3651]] will I do [[H6213]] to you: [[H6213]]

### 29
Your carcases [[H6297]] shall fall [[H5307]] in this [[H2088]] wilderness; [[H4057]] and all [[H3605]] that were numbered [[H6485]] of you, according to your whole [[H3605]] number, [[H4557]] from twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] and upward, [[H4605]] which [[H834]] have murmured [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] me, [[H5921]]

### 30
Doubtless [[H518]] ye [[H859]] shall not [[H518]] come [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land, [[H776]] which [[H834]] I sware [[H5375]] to make you dwell [[H7931]] therein, save [[H3588]] Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh, [[H3312]] and Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun. [[H5126]]

### 31
But your little ones, [[H2945]] which [[H834]] ye said [[H559]] should be [[H1961]] a prey, [[H957]] them will I bring in, [[H935]] and they shall know [[H3045]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] ye have despised. [[H3988]]

### 32
But you, [[H859]] your carcases, [[H6297]] they shall fall [[H5307]] in this [[H2088]] wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 33
And your children [[H1121]] shall wander [[H7462]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] and bear [[H5375]] your whoredoms, [[H2184]] until [[H5704]] your carcases [[H6297]] be wasted [[H8552]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 34
After the number [[H4557]] of the days [[H3117]] in which [[H834]] ye searched [[H8446]] the land, [[H776]] forty [[H705]] days, [[H3117]] each day [[H3117]] for a year, [[H3117]] shall ye bear [[H5375]] your iniquities, [[H5771]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] and ye shall know [[H3045]] my breach of promise. [[H8569]]

### 35
I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] have said, [[H1696]] I will surely [[H518]] do [[H6213]] it [[H2063]] unto all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] congregation, [[H5712]] that are gathered together [[H3259]] against [[H5921]] me: in this [[H2088]] wilderness [[H4057]] they shall be consumed, [[H8552]] and there [[H8033]] they shall die. [[H4191]]

### 36
And the men, [[H376]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] to search [[H8446]] the land, [[H776]] who returned, [[H7725]]  and made [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] to murmur [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] him, by bringing up [[H3318]] a slander [[H1681]] upon [[H5921]] the land, [[H776]]

### 37
Even those men [[H582]] that did bring up [[H3318]] the evil [[H7451]] report [[H1681]] upon the land, [[H776]] died [[H4191]] by the plague [[H4046]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 38
But Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh, [[H3312]] of [[H4480]] the men [[H1992]] that went [[H1980]] to search [[H8446]] the land, [[H776]] lived [[H2421]]

### 39
And Moses [[H4872]] told [[H1696]] these [[H428]] sayings [[H1697]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and the people [[H5971]] mourned [[H56]] greatly. [[H3966]]

### 40
And they rose up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and gat them up [[H5927]] into [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of the mountain, [[H2022]] saying, [[H559]] Lo, [[H2005]] we and will go up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath promised: [[H559]] for [[H3588]] we have sinned. [[H2398]]

### 41
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] Wherefore [[H4100]] now [[H2088]] do ye [[H859]] transgress [[H5674]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord? [[H3068]] but it [[H1931]] shall not [[H3808]] prosper. [[H6743]]

### 42
Go not up, [[H5927]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] not [[H369]] among [[H7130]] you; that ye be not [[H3808]] smitten [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] your enemies. [[H341]]

### 43
For [[H3588]] the Amalekites [[H6003]] and the Canaanites [[H3669]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] you, and ye shall fall [[H5307]] by the sword: [[H2719]] because [[H3588]] ye are turned [[H7725]] away [[H310]] from the Lord, [[H3068]] therefore the Lord [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] you. [[H5973]]

### 44
But they presumed [[H6075]] to go up [[H5927]] unto [[H413]] the hill [[H2022]] top: [[H7218]] nevertheless the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and Moses, [[H4872]] departed [[H4185]] not [[H3808]] out [[H7130]] of the camp. [[H4264]]

### 45
Then the Amalekites [[H6003]] came down, [[H3381]] and the Canaanites [[H3669]] which dwelt [[H3427]] in that [[H1931]] hill, [[H2022]] and smote [[H5221]] them, and discomfited [[H3807]] them, unto [[H5704]] Hormah. [[H2767]]
