And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Make [[H6213]] thee two [[H8147]] trumpets [[H2689]] of silver; [[H3701]] of a whole piece [[H4749]] shalt thou make [[H6213]] them: that thou mayest use [[H1961]] them for the calling [[H4744]] of the assembly, [[H5712]] and for the journeying [[H4550]] of the camps. [[H4264]]

### 3
And when they shall blow [[H8628]] with them, [[H2004]] all [[H3605]] the assembly [[H5712]] shall assemble themselves [[H3259]] to [[H413]] thee at [[H413]] the door [[H6607]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation. [[H4150]]

### 4
And if [[H518]] they blow [[H8628]] with one [[H259]] then the princes, [[H5387]] heads [[H7218]] of the thousands [[H505]] of Israel, [[H3478]] shall gather themselves [[H3259]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 5
When ye blow [[H8628]] an alarm, [[H8643]] then the camps [[H4264]] that lie [[H2583]] on the east parts [[H6924]] shall go forward. [[H5265]]

### 6
When ye blow [[H8628]] an alarm [[H8643]] the second time, [[H8145]] then the camps [[H4264]] that lie [[H2583]] on the south side [[H8486]] shall take their journey: [[H5265]] they shall blow [[H8628]] an alarm [[H8643]] for their journeys. [[H4550]]

### 7

### 8
And the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] the priests, [[H3548]] shall blow [[H8628]] with the trumpets; [[H2689]] and they shall be [[H1961]] to you for an ordinance [[H2708]] for ever [[H5769]] throughout your generations. [[H1755]]

[[H341]]

### 10
Also in the day [[H3117]] of your gladness, [[H8057]] and in your solemn days, [[H4150]] and in the beginnings [[H7218]] of your months, [[H2320]] ye shall blow [[H8628]] with the trumpets [[H2689]] over [[H5921]] your burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and over [[H5921]] the sacrifices [[H2077]] of your peace offerings; [[H8002]] that they may be [[H1961]] to you for a memorial [[H2146]] before [[H6440]] your God: [[H430]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

[[H3478]]

### 30

### 31
And he said, [[H559]] Leave [[H5800]] us not, [[H408]] I pray thee; [[H4994]] forasmuch [[H3588]] as thou knowest [[H3651]] how we are to encamp [[H2583]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and thou mayest be [[H1961]] to us instead of eyes. [[H5869]]

### 32
And it shall be, [[H1961]] if [[H3588]] thou go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] us, yea, it shall be, [[H1961]] that what [[H834]] goodness [[H2896]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall do [[H3190]] unto [[H5973]] us, the same will we do [[H3190]] unto thee. [[H3190]]
