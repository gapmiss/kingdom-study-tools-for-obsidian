And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] by [[H5921]] Jordan [[H3383]] Jericho, [[H3405]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Command [[H6680]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they give [[H5414]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] of the inheritance [[H5159]] of their possession [[H272]] cities [[H5892]] to dwell in; [[H3427]] and ye shall give [[H5414]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] suburbs [[H4054]] for the cities [[H5892]] round about [[H5439]] them. [[H5439]]

### 3
And the cities [[H5892]] shall they have [[H1961]] to dwell in; [[H3427]] and the suburbs [[H4054]] of them shall be [[H1961]] for their cattle, [[H929]] and for their goods, [[H7399]] and for all [[H3605]] their beasts. [[H2416]]

### 4
And the suburbs [[H4054]] of the cities, [[H5892]] which [[H834]] ye shall give [[H5414]] unto the Levites, [[H3881]] from the wall [[H7023]] of the city [[H5892]] and outward [[H2351]] a thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 5
And ye shall measure [[H4058]] from without [[H2351]] the city [[H5892]]  on [[H853]] the east [[H6924]] side [[H6285]] two thousand [[H505]] cubits, [[H520]] and on the south [[H5045]] side [[H6285]] two thousand [[H505]] cubits, [[H520]] and on the west [[H3220]] side [[H6285]] two thousand [[H505]] cubits, [[H520]] and on the north [[H6828]] side [[H6285]] two thousand [[H505]] cubits; [[H520]] and the city [[H5892]] in the midst: [[H8432]] this [[H2088]] shall be [[H1961]] to them the suburbs [[H4054]] of the cities. [[H5892]]

### 6
And among [[H853]] the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] ye shall give [[H5414]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] six [[H8337]] cities [[H5892]] for refuge, [[H4733]] which [[H834]] ye shall appoint [[H5414]] for the manslayer, [[H7523]] that he may flee [[H5127]] thither: [[H8033]] and to [[H5921]] them ye shall add [[H5414]] forty [[H705]] and two [[H8147]] cities. [[H5892]]

### 7
all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] ye shall give [[H5414]] to the Levites [[H3881]] forty [[H705]] and eight [[H8083]] cities: [[H5892]] them with [[H853]] their suburbs. [[H4054]]

### 8
And the cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] ye shall give [[H5414]] of the possession [[H272]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] from [[H853]] many [[H7227]] ye shall give many; [[H7235]] but from [[H853]] few [[H4592]] ye shall give few: [[H4591]] every one [[H376]] shall give [[H5414]] of his cities [[H5892]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] according to [[H6310]] his inheritance [[H5159]] which [[H834]] he inheriteth. [[H5157]]

### 9
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 10
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, When [[H3588]] ye [[H859]] be come over [[H5674]] Jordan [[H3383]] into the land [[H776]] of Canaan; [[H3667]]

### 11
Then ye shall appoint [[H7136]] you cities [[H5892]] to be [[H1961]] cities [[H5892]] of refuge [[H4733]] for you; that the slayer [[H7523]] may flee [[H5127]] thither, [[H8033]] which killeth [[H5221]] any person [[H5315]] at unawares. [[H7684]]

### 12
And they shall be [[H1961]] unto you cities [[H5892]] for refuge [[H4733]] from the avenger; [[H1350]] that the manslayer [[H7523]] die [[H4191]] not, [[H3808]] until [[H5704]] he stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the congregation [[H5712]] in judgment. [[H4941]]

### 13
And of these cities [[H5892]] which [[H834]] ye shall give [[H5414]] six [[H8337]] cities [[H5892]] shall ye have [[H1961]] for refuge. [[H4733]]

### 14
Ye shall give [[H5414]] three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan, [[H3383]] and three [[H7969]] cities [[H5892]] shall ye give [[H5414]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] shall be [[H1961]] cities [[H5892]] of refuge. [[H4733]]

### 15
These [[H428]] six [[H8337]] cities [[H5892]] shall be [[H1961]] a refuge, [[H4733]] for the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and for the stranger, [[H1616]] and for the sojourner [[H8453]] among [[H8432]] them: that every one [[H3605]] that killeth [[H5221]] any person [[H5315]] unawares [[H7684]] may flee [[H5127]] thither. [[H8033]]

### 16
And if [[H518]] he smite [[H5221]] him with an instrument [[H3627]] of iron, [[H1270]] so that he die, [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] a murderer: [[H7523]] the murderer [[H7523]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 17
And if [[H518]] he smite [[H5221]] him with throwing [[H3027]] a stone, [[H68]] wherewith [[H834]] he may die, [[H4191]] and he die, [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] a murderer: [[H7523]] the murderer [[H7523]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 18
Or [[H176]] he smite [[H5221]] him with an hand [[H3027]] weapon [[H3627]] of wood, [[H6086]] wherewith [[H834]] he may die, [[H4191]] and he die, [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] a murderer: [[H7523]] the murderer [[H7523]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 19
The revenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] himself [[H1931]] shall slay [[H4191]] the murderer: [[H7523]] when he meeteth [[H6293]] him, he [[H1931]] shall slay [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 20
But if [[H518]] he thrust [[H1920]] him of hatred, [[H8135]] or [[H176]] hurl [[H7993]] at [[H5921]] him by laying of wait, [[H6660]] that he die; [[H4191]]

### 21
Or [[H176]] in enmity [[H342]] smite [[H5221]] him with his hand, [[H3027]] that he die: [[H4191]] he that smote [[H5221]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death; [[H4191]] he [[H1931]] a murderer: [[H7523]] the revenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] shall slay [[H4191]] the murderer, [[H7523]] when he meeteth [[H6293]] him. [[H6293]]

### 22
But if [[H518]] he thrust [[H1920]] him suddenly [[H6621]] without [[H3808]] enmity, [[H342]] or [[H176]] have cast [[H7993]] upon [[H5921]] him any thing [[H3627]] without [[H3808]] laying of wait, [[H6660]]

### 23
Or [[H176]] with any [[H3605]] stone, [[H68]] wherewith [[H834]] a man may die, [[H4191]] seeing [[H7200]] not, [[H3808]] and cast [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] him, that he die, [[H4191]] and not [[H3808]] his enemy, [[H341]] neither [[H3808]] sought [[H1245]] his harm: [[H7451]]

### 24
Then the congregation [[H5712]] shall judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] the slayer [[H5221]] and the revenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] according to [[H5921]] these [[H428]] judgments: [[H4941]]

### 25
And the congregation [[H5712]] shall deliver [[H5337]] the slayer [[H7523]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the revenger [[H1350]] of blood, [[H1818]] and the congregation [[H5712]] shall restore [[H7725]] him to [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of his refuge, [[H4733]] whither [[H834]] he was fled: [[H5127]] and he shall abide [[H3427]] in it unto [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] which [[H834]] was anointed [[H4886]] with the holy [[H6944]] oil. [[H8081]]

### 26
But if [[H518]] the slayer [[H7523]] shall at any come without [[H3318]]  time [[H3318]] the border [[H1366]] of the city [[H5892]] of his refuge, [[H4733]] whither [[H834]] he was fled; [[H5127]]

### 27
And the revenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] find [[H4672]] him without [[H2351]] the borders [[H1366]] of the city [[H5892]] of his refuge, [[H4733]] and the revenger [[H1350]] of blood [[H1818]] kill [[H7523]] the slayer; [[H7523]] he shall not [[H369]] be guilty of blood: [[H1818]]

### 28
Because [[H3588]] he should have remained [[H3427]] in the city [[H5892]] of his refuge [[H4733]] until [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of the high [[H1419]] priest: [[H3548]] but after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] the slayer [[H7523]] shall return [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of his possession. [[H272]]

### 29
So these [[H428]] shall be [[H1961]] for a statute [[H2708]] of judgment [[H4941]] unto you throughout your generations [[H1755]] in all [[H3605]] your dwellings. [[H4186]]

### 30
Whoso [[H3605]] killeth [[H5221]] any person, [[H5315]] the murderer [[H7523]] shall be put to death [[H7523]] by the mouth [[H6310]] of witnesses: [[H5707]] but one [[H259]] witness [[H5707]] shall not [[H3808]] testify [[H6030]] against any person [[H5315]] to die. [[H4191]]

### 31
Moreover ye shall take [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] satisfaction [[H3724]] for the life [[H5315]] of a murderer, [[H7523]] which [[H834]] guilty [[H7563]] of death: [[H4191]] but [[H3588]] he shall be surely [[H4191]] put to death. [[H4191]]

### 32
And ye shall take [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] satisfaction [[H3724]] for him that is fled [[H5127]] to [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of his refuge, [[H4733]] that he should come again [[H7725]] to dwell [[H3427]] in the land, [[H776]] until [[H5704]] the death [[H4194]] of the priest. [[H3548]]

### 33
So ye shall not [[H3808]] pollute [[H2610]] the land [[H776]] wherein [[H834]] ye [[H859]] for [[H3588]] blood [[H1818]] it [[H1931]] defileth [[H2610]] the land: [[H776]] and the land [[H776]] cannot [[H3808]] be cleansed [[H3722]] of the blood [[H1818]] that [[H834]] is shed [[H8210]] therein, but [[H3588]] by the blood [[H1818]] of him that shed [[H8210]] it. [[H8210]]

### 34
Defile [[H2930]] not [[H3808]]  therefore [[H853]] the land [[H776]] which [[H834]] ye [[H859]] shall inhabit, [[H3427]] wherein [[H8432]] I [[H589]] dwell: [[H7931]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] the Lord [[H3068]] dwell [[H7931]] among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]
