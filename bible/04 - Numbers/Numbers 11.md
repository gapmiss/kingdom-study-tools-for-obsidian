### 1
And the people [[H5971]] complained, [[H596]] it displeased [[H7451]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and the Lord [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] and his anger [[H639]] was kindled; [[H2734]] and the fire [[H784]] of the Lord [[H3068]] burnt [[H1197]] among them, and consumed [[H398]] in the uttermost parts [[H7097]] of the camp. [[H4264]]

### 2
And the people [[H5971]] cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] Moses; [[H4872]] and when Moses [[H4872]] prayed [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the fire [[H784]] was quenched. [[H8257]]

### 3
And he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Taberah: [[H8404]] because [[H3588]] the fire [[H784]] of the Lord [[H3068]] burnt [[H1197]] among them. [[H1197]]

### 4
And the mixt multitude [[H628]] that [[H834]] among [[H7130]] them fell a lusting: [[H183]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] also [[H1571]] wept [[H1058]] again, [[H7725]] and said, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall give us flesh [[H1320]] to eat? [[H398]]

### 5
We remember [[H2142]] the fish, [[H1710]] which [[H834]] we did eat [[H398]] in Egypt [[H4714]] freely; [[H2600]] the cucumbers, [[H7180]] and the melons, [[H20]] and the leeks, [[H2682]] and the onions, [[H1211]] and the garlick: [[H7762]]

### 6
But now [[H6258]] our soul [[H5315]] dried away: [[H3002]] nothing [[H369]] at all, [[H3605]] beside [[H1115]] this manna, [[H4478]] our eyes. [[H5869]]

### 7
And the manna [[H4478]] as coriander [[H1407]] seed, [[H2233]] and the colour [[H5869]] thereof as the colour [[H5869]] of bdellium. [[H916]]

### 8
the people [[H5971]] went about, [[H7751]] and gathered [[H3950]] and ground [[H2912]] in mills, [[H7347]] or [[H176]] beat [[H1743]] in a mortar, [[H4085]] and baked [[H1310]] in pans, [[H6517]] and made [[H6213]] cakes [[H5692]] of it: and the taste [[H2940]] of it was [[H1961]] as the taste [[H2940]] of fresh [[H3955]] oil. [[H8081]]

### 9
And when the dew [[H2919]] fell [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] the camp [[H4264]] in the night, [[H3915]] the manna [[H4478]] fell [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] it. [[H5921]]

### 10
Then Moses [[H4872]] heard [[H8085]] the people [[H5971]] weep [[H1058]] throughout their families, [[H4940]] every man [[H376]] in the door [[H6607]] of his tent: [[H168]] and the anger [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] greatly; [[H3966]] Moses [[H4872]] also was displeased. [[H7451]]

### 11
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] Wherefore [[H4100]] hast thou afflicted [[H7489]] thy servant? [[H5650]] and wherefore [[H4100]] have I not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in thy sight, [[H5869]] that thou layest [[H7760]] the burden [[H4853]] of all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] upon [[H5921]] me? [[H5921]]

### 12
Have I [[H595]] conceived [[H2029]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] have I [[H595]] begotten [[H3205]] them, that [[H3588]] thou shouldest say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Carry [[H5375]] them in thy bosom, [[H2436]] as [[H834]] a nursing father [[H539]] beareth [[H5375]] the sucking child, [[H3243]] unto [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] which [[H834]] thou swarest [[H7650]] unto their fathers? [[H1]]

### 13
Whence [[H370]] should I have flesh [[H1320]] to give [[H5414]] unto all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people? [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] they weep [[H1058]] unto [[H5921]] me, saying, [[H559]] Give [[H5414]] us flesh, [[H1320]] that we may eat. [[H398]]

### 14
I [[H595]] am not able [[H3201]] to bear [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] alone, [[H905]] because [[H3588]] too heavy [[H3515]] for [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 15
And if [[H518]] thou [[H859]] deal [[H6213]] thus [[H3602]] with me, kill [[H2026]] me, I pray thee, [[H4994]] out of hand, [[H2026]] if [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favour [[H2580]] in thy sight; [[H5869]] and let me not [[H408]] see [[H7200]] my wretchedness. [[H7451]]

### 16
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Gather [[H622]] unto me seventy [[H7657]] men [[H376]] of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] thou knowest [[H3045]] to be the elders [[H2205]] of the people, [[H5971]] and officers [[H7860]] over them; and bring [[H3947]] them unto [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] that they may stand [[H3320]] there [[H8033]] with [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 17
And I will come down [[H3381]] and talk [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] thee there: [[H8033]] and I will take [[H680]] of [[H4480]] the spirit [[H7307]] which [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] thee, and will put [[H7760]] upon [[H5921]] them; and they shall bear [[H5375]] the burden [[H4853]] of the people [[H5971]] with [[H854]] thee, that thou [[H859]] bear [[H5375]] not [[H3808]] thyself alone. [[H905]]

### 18
And say [[H559]] thou unto [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] Sanctify yourselves [[H6942]] against to morrow, [[H4279]] and ye shall eat [[H398]] flesh: [[H1320]] for [[H3588]] ye have wept [[H1058]] in the ears [[H241]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall give us flesh [[H1320]] to eat? [[H398]] for [[H3588]] well [[H2895]] with us in Egypt: [[H4714]] therefore the Lord [[H3068]] will give [[H5414]] you flesh, [[H1320]] and ye shall eat. [[H398]]

### 19
Ye shall not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] one [[H259]] day, [[H3117]] nor [[H3808]] two days, [[H3117]] nor [[H3808]] five [[H2568]] days, [[H3117]] neither [[H3808]] ten [[H6235]] days, [[H3117]] nor [[H3808]] twenty [[H6242]] days; [[H3117]]

### 20
even [[H5704]] a whole [[H3117]] month, [[H2320]] until [[H5704]] it [[H834]] come out [[H3318]] at your nostrils, [[H639]] and it be [[H1961]] loathsome [[H2214]] unto you: because [[H3282]] that [[H3588]] ye have despised [[H3988]] the Lord [[H3068]] which [[H834]] among [[H7130]] you, and have wept [[H1058]] before [[H6440]] him, saying, [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] came we forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt? [[H4714]]

### 21
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] The people, [[H5971]] among [[H7130]] whom [[H834]] I [[H595]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] footmen; [[H7273]] and thou [[H859]] hast said, [[H559]] I will give [[H5414]] them flesh, [[H1320]] that they may eat [[H398]] a whole [[H3117]] month. [[H2320]]

### 22
Shall the flocks [[H6629]] and the herds [[H1241]] be slain [[H7819]] for them, to suffice [[H4672]] them? or [[H518]] shall all [[H3605]] the fish [[H1709]] of the sea [[H3220]] be gathered together [[H622]] for them, to suffice [[H4672]] them? [[H4672]]

### 23
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Is the Lord's [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] waxed short? [[H7114]] thou shalt see [[H7200]] now [[H6258]] whether my word [[H1697]] shall come to pass [[H7136]] unto thee or [[H518]] not. [[H3808]]

### 24
And Moses [[H4872]] went out, [[H3318]] and told [[H1696]] the people [[H5971]] the words [[H1697]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and gathered [[H622]] the seventy [[H7657]] men [[H582]] of the elders [[H2205]] of the people, [[H5971]] and set [[H5975]] them round about [[H5439]] the tabernacle. [[H168]]

### 25
And the Lord [[H3068]] came down [[H3381]] in a cloud, [[H6051]] and spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him, and took [[H680]] of [[H4480]] the spirit [[H7307]] that [[H834]] upon [[H5921]] him, and gave [[H5414]] unto [[H5921]] the seventy [[H7657]] elders: [[H2205]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] when the spirit [[H7307]] rested [[H5117]] upon [[H5921]] them, they prophesied, [[H5012]] and did not [[H3808]] cease. [[H3254]]

### 26
But there remained [[H7604]] two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] in the camp, [[H4264]] the name [[H8034]] of the one [[H259]] Eldad, [[H419]] and the name [[H8034]] of the other [[H8145]] Medad: [[H4312]] and the spirit [[H7307]] rested [[H5117]] upon [[H5921]] them; and they [[H1992]] of them that were written, [[H3789]] but went not out [[H3318]] unto the tabernacle: [[H168]] and they prophesied [[H5012]] in the camp. [[H4264]]

### 27
And there ran [[H7323]] a young man, [[H5288]] and told [[H5046]] Moses, [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] Eldad [[H419]] and Medad [[H4312]] do prophesy [[H5012]] in the camp. [[H4264]]

### 28
And Joshua [[H3091]] the son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] the servant [[H8334]] of Moses, [[H4872]] of his young men, [[H979]] answered [[H6030]] and said, [[H559]] My lord [[H113]] Moses, [[H4872]] forbid [[H3607]] them. [[H3607]]

### 29
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] unto him, Enviest [[H7065]] thou [[H859]] for my sake? would God [[H4310]] that all [[H3605]] the [[H5414]] Lord's [[H3068]] people [[H5971]] were prophets, [[H5030]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] would put [[H5414]] his spirit [[H7307]] upon [[H5921]] them! [[H5921]]

### 30
And Moses [[H4872]] gat [[H622]] him into [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] he [[H1931]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 31
And there went forth [[H5265]] a wind [[H7307]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and brought [[H1468]] quails [[H7958]] from [[H4480]] the sea, [[H3220]] and let fall [[H5203]] by [[H5921]] the camp, [[H4264]] as it were a day's [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] on this side, [[H3541]] and as it were a day's [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] on the other side, [[H3541]] round about [[H5439]] the camp, [[H4264]] and as it were two cubits [[H520]] upon [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 32
And the people [[H5971]] stood up [[H6965]] all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and all [[H3605]] night, [[H3915]] and all [[H3605]] the next [[H4283]] day, [[H3117]] and they gathered [[H622]] the quails: [[H7958]] he that gathered least [[H4591]] gathered [[H622]] ten [[H6235]] homers: [[H2563]] and they spread [[H7849]] all abroad [[H7849]] for themselves round about [[H5439]] the camp. [[H4264]]

### 33
And while the flesh [[H1320]] yet [[H5750]] between [[H996]] their teeth, [[H8127]] ere [[H2962]] it was chewed, [[H3772]] the wrath [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] was kindled [[H2734]] against the people, [[H5971]] and the Lord [[H3068]] smote [[H5221]] the people [[H5971]] with a very [[H3966]] great [[H7227]] plague. [[H4347]]

### 34
And he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Kibroth-hattaavah: [[H6914]] because [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] they buried [[H6912]] the people [[H5971]] that lusted. [[H183]]

### 35
the people [[H5971]] journeyed [[H5265]] from Kibroth-hattaavah [[H6914]] unto Hazeroth; [[H2698]] and abode [[H1961]] at Hazeroth. [[H2698]]
