### 1
And when Balaam [[H1109]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] it pleased [[H5869]] the Lord [[H3068]] to bless [[H1288]] Israel, [[H3478]] he went [[H1980]] not, [[H3808]] as at other times, [[H6471]] to seek [[H7125]] for enchantments, [[H5173]] but he set [[H7896]] his face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 2
And Balaam [[H1109]] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and he saw [[H7200]] Israel [[H3478]] abiding [[H7931]] according to their tribes; [[H7626]] and the spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 3
And he took up [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]] Balaam [[H1109]] the son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] hath said, [[H5002]] and the man [[H1397]] whose eyes [[H5869]] are open [[H8365]] hath said: [[H5002]]

### 4
He hath said, [[H5002]] which heard [[H8085]] the words [[H561]] of God, [[H410]] which [[H834]] saw [[H2372]] the vision [[H4236]] of the Almighty, [[H7706]] falling [[H5307]] but having his eyes [[H5869]] open: [[H1540]]

### 5
How [[H4100]] goodly [[H2895]] are thy tents, [[H168]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] thy tabernacles, [[H4908]] O Israel! [[H3478]]

### 6
As the valleys [[H5158]] are they spread forth, [[H5186]] as gardens [[H1593]] by [[H5921]] the river's side, [[H5104]] as the trees of lign aloes [[H174]] which the Lord [[H3068]] hath planted, [[H5193]] as cedar trees [[H730]] beside [[H5921]] the waters. [[H4325]]

### 7
He shall pour out [[H5140]] the water [[H4325]] of his buckets, [[H1805]] and his seed [[H2233]] in many [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] and his king [[H4428]] shall be higher [[H7311]] than Agag, [[H90]] and his kingdom [[H4438]] shall be exalted. [[H5375]]

### 8
God [[H410]] brought him forth [[H3318]] out of Egypt; [[H4714]] he hath as it were the strength [[H8443]] of an unicorn: [[H7214]] he shall eat up [[H398]] the nations [[H1471]] his enemies, [[H6862]] and shall break [[H1633]] their bones, [[H6106]] and pierce [[H4272]] through with his arrows. [[H2671]]

### 9
He couched, [[H3766]] he lay down [[H7901]] as a lion, [[H738]] and as a great lion: [[H3833]] who [[H4310]] shall stir him up? [[H6965]] Blessed [[H1288]] he that blesseth [[H1288]] thee, and cursed [[H779]] he that curseth [[H779]] thee. [[H779]]

### 10
And Balak's [[H1111]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] against [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and he smote together: [[H5606]] his hands [[H3709]] and Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] I called [[H7121]] thee to curse [[H6895]] mine enemies, [[H341]] and, behold, [[H2009]] thou hast altogether [[H1288]] blessed [[H1288]] these [[H2088]] three [[H7969]] times. [[H6471]]

### 11
Therefore now [[H6258]] flee [[H1272]] thou to [[H413]] thy place: [[H4725]] I thought [[H559]] to promote great [[H3513]] thee unto honour; [[H3513]] but, lo, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath kept thee back [[H4513]] from honour. [[H3519]]

### 12
And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] Spake [[H1696]] I not [[H3808]] also [[H1571]] to [[H413]] thy messengers [[H4397]] which [[H834]] thou sentest [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] me, saying, [[H559]]

### 13
If [[H518]] Balak [[H1111]] would give [[H5414]] me his house [[H1004]] full [[H4393]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] I cannot [[H3201]] go beyond [[H5674]] the commandment [[H6310]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] to do [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] or [[H176]] bad [[H7451]] of mine own mind; [[H3820]] what [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] saith, [[H1696]] that will I speak? [[H1696]]

### 14
And now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2005]] I go [[H1980]] unto my people: [[H5971]] come [[H1980]] I will advertise [[H3289]] thee what [[H834]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] shall do [[H6213]] to thy people [[H5971]] in the latter [[H319]] days. [[H3117]]

### 15
And he took up [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]] Balaam [[H1109]] the son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] hath said, [[H5002]] and the man [[H1397]] whose eyes [[H5869]] are open [[H8365]] hath said: [[H5002]]

### 16
He hath said, [[H5002]] which heard [[H8085]] the words [[H561]] of God, [[H410]] and knew [[H3045]] the knowledge [[H1847]] of the most High, [[H5945]] saw [[H2372]] the vision [[H4236]] of the Almighty, [[H7706]] falling [[H5307]] but having his eyes [[H5869]] open: [[H1540]]

### 17
I shall see [[H7200]] him, but not [[H3808]] now: [[H6258]] I shall behold [[H7789]] him, but not [[H3808]] nigh: [[H7138]] there shall come [[H1869]] a Star [[H3556]] out of Jacob, [[H3290]] and a Sceptre [[H7626]] shall rise [[H6965]] out of Israel, [[H3478]] and shall smite [[H4272]] the corners [[H6285]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and destroy [[H6979]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Sheth. [[H8351]]

### 18
And Edom [[H123]] shall be [[H1961]] a possession, [[H3424]] Seir [[H8165]] also shall be [[H1961]] a possession [[H3424]] for his enemies; [[H341]] and Israel [[H3478]] shall do [[H6213]] valiantly. [[H2428]]

### 19
Out of Jacob [[H3290]] shall come he that shall have dominion, [[H7287]] and shall destroy [[H6]] him that remaineth [[H8300]] of the city. [[H5892]]

### 20
And when he looked on [[H7200]] Amalek, [[H6002]] he took up [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]] Amalek [[H6002]] the first [[H7225]] of the nations; [[H1471]] but his latter end [[H319]] that he perish [[H8]] for ever. [[H5703]]

### 21
And he looked on [[H7200]] the Kenites, [[H7017]] and took up [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]] Strong [[H386]] is thy dwellingplace, [[H4186]] and thou puttest [[H7760]] thy nest [[H7064]] in a rock. [[H5553]]

### 22
Nevertheless [[H3588]] the Kenite [[H7014]] shall [[H518]] be [[H1961]] wasted, [[H1197]] until [[H5704]] Asshur [[H804]] shall carry thee away captive. [[H7617]]

### 23
And he took up [[H5375]] his parable, [[H4912]] and said, [[H559]] Alas, [[H188]] who [[H4310]] shall live [[H2421]] when God [[H410]] doeth [[H7760]] this! [[H7760]]

### 24
And ships [[H6716]] from the coast [[H3027]] of Chittim, [[H3794]] and shall afflict [[H6031]] Asshur, [[H804]] and shall afflict [[H6031]] Eber, [[H5677]] and he [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] shall perish [[H8]] for ever. [[H5703]]

### 25
And Balaam [[H1109]] rose up, [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] and returned [[H7725]] to his place: [[H4725]] and Balak [[H1111]] also [[H1571]] went [[H1980]] his way. [[H1870]]
