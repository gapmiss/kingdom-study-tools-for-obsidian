### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and take [[H3947]] of [[H853]] every one of them a rod [[H4294]] according to the house [[H1004]] of fathers, [[H1]] of [[H853]] all [[H3605]] their princes [[H5387]] according to the house [[H1004]] of their fathers [[H1]] twelve [[H8147]] rods: [[H4294]] write [[H3789]]  thou [[H853]] every man's [[H376]] name [[H8034]] upon [[H5921]] his rod. [[H4294]]

### 3
And thou shalt write [[H3789]] Aaron's [[H175]] name [[H8034]] upon [[H5921]] the rod [[H4294]] of Levi: [[H3878]] for [[H3588]] one [[H259]] rod [[H4294]] for the head [[H7218]] of the house [[H1004]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 4
And thou shalt lay them up [[H3240]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] before [[H6440]] the testimony, [[H5715]] where [[H834]] I will meet [[H3259]] with you. [[H3259]]

### 5
And it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] the man's [[H376]] rod, [[H4294]] whom [[H834]] I shall choose, [[H977]] shall blossom: [[H6524]] and I will make to cease [[H7918]] from [[H5921]]  me [[H853]] the murmurings [[H8519]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] whereby [[H834]] they [[H1992]] murmur [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] you. [[H5921]]

### 6
And Moses [[H4872]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and every one [[H3605]] of their princes [[H5387]] gave [[H5414]] him a [[H259]] rod [[H4294]] apiece, [[H5387]] for each prince [[H5387]] one, [[H259]] according to their fathers' [[H1]] houses, [[H1004]] twelve [[H6240]] rods: [[H4294]] and the rod [[H4294]] of Aaron [[H175]] among [[H8432]] their rods. [[H4294]]

### 7
And Moses [[H4872]] laid up [[H3240]] the rods [[H4294]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of witness. [[H5715]]

### 8
And it came to pass, [[H1961]] that on the morrow [[H4283]] Moses [[H4872]] went [[H935]] into [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of witness; [[H5715]] and, behold, [[H2009]] the rod [[H4294]] of Aaron [[H175]] for the house [[H1004]] of Levi [[H3878]] was budded, [[H6524]] and brought forth [[H3318]] buds, [[H6525]] and bloomed [[H6692]] blossoms, [[H6731]] and yielded [[H1580]] almonds. [[H8247]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] brought out [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] the rods [[H4294]] from before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and they looked, [[H7200]] and took [[H3947]] every man [[H376]] his rod. [[H4294]]

### 10
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Bring [[H7725]] Aaron's [[H175]] rod [[H4294]] again before [[H6440]] the testimony, [[H5715]] to be kept [[H4931]] for a token [[H226]] against the rebels; [[H4805]] and thou shalt quite take away [[H3615]] their murmurings [[H8519]] from [[H5921]] me, that they die [[H4191]] not. [[H3808]]

### 11
And Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] him, so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] he. [[H6213]]

### 12
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] spake [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] we die, [[H1478]] we perish, [[H6]] we all [[H3605]] perish. [[H6]]

### 13
Whosoever [[H3605]] cometh any thing near [[H7131]] unto [[H413]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall die: [[H4191]] shall we be consumed [[H8552]] with dying? [[H1478]]
