### 1
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
Command [[H6680]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they put out [[H7971]] of [[H4480]] the camp [[H4264]] every [[H3605]] leper, [[H6879]] and every one [[H3605]] that hath an issue, [[H2100]] and whosoever [[H3605]] is defiled [[H2931]] by the dead: [[H5315]]

### 3
Both male [[H2145]] and [[H5704]] female [[H5347]] shall ye put out, [[H7971]] without [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] shall ye put [[H7971]] them; that they defile [[H2930]] not [[H3808]] their camps, [[H4264]] in the midst [[H8432]] whereof [[H834]] I [[H589]] dwell. [[H7931]]

### 4
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did so, [[H6213]] and put them out [[H7971]] without [[H2351]] the camp: [[H4264]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 6
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] When [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman [[H802]] shall commit [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] sin [[H2403]] that men [[H120]] commit, [[H4603]] to do a trespass [[H4604]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] and that [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] be guilty; [[H816]]

### 7
Then they shall confess [[H3034]] their sin [[H2403]] which [[H834]] they have done: [[H6213]] and he shall recompense [[H7725]]  his [[H853]] trespass [[H817]] with the principal [[H7218]] thereof, and add [[H3254]] unto [[H5921]] it the fifth [[H2549]] thereof, and give [[H5414]] unto against whom [[H834]] he hath trespassed. [[H816]]

### 8
But if [[H518]] the man [[H376]] have no [[H369]] kinsman [[H1350]] to recompense [[H7725]] the trespass [[H817]] unto, [[H413]] let the trespass [[H817]] be recompensed [[H7725]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] to the priest; [[H3548]] beside [[H905]] the ram [[H352]] of the atonement, [[H3725]] whereby [[H834]] an atonement shall be made [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 9
And every [[H3605]] offering [[H8641]] of all [[H3605]] the holy things [[H6944]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] they bring [[H7126]] unto the priest, [[H3548]] shall be [[H1961]] his. [[H1961]]

### 10
And every man's [[H376]] hallowed things [[H6944]] shall be [[H1961]] his: whatsoever [[H834]] any man [[H376]] giveth [[H5414]] the priest, [[H3548]] it shall be [[H1961]] his. [[H1961]]

### 11
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 12
Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, If [[H3588]] any [[H376]] man's [[H376]] wife [[H802]] go aside, [[H7847]] and commit [[H4603]] a trespass [[H4604]] against him, [[H4604]]

### 13
And a man [[H376]] lie [[H7901]] with [[H854]] her carnally, [[H7902]] and it be hid [[H5956]] from the eyes [[H5869]] of her husband, [[H376]] and be kept close, [[H5641]] and she [[H1931]] be defiled, [[H2930]] and no [[H369]] witness [[H5707]] against her, neither [[H3808]] she [[H1931]] be taken [[H8610]]

### 14
And the spirit [[H7307]] of jealousy [[H7068]] come [[H5674]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he be jealous [[H7065]] of his wife, [[H802]] and she [[H1931]] be defiled: [[H2930]] or [[H176]] if the spirit [[H7307]] of jealousy [[H7068]] come [[H5674]] upon [[H5921]] him, and he be jealous [[H7065]] of his wife, [[H802]] and she [[H1931]] be not [[H3808]] defiled: [[H2930]]

### 15
Then shall the man [[H376]] bring [[H935]] his wife [[H802]] unto [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] and he shall bring [[H935]] her offering [[H7133]] for [[H5921]] her, the tenth [[H6224]] of an ephah [[H374]] of barley [[H8184]] meal; [[H7058]] he shall pour [[H3332]] no [[H3808]] oil [[H8081]] upon [[H5921]] it, nor [[H3808]] put [[H5414]] frankincense [[H3828]] thereon; [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] an offering [[H4503]] of jealousy, [[H7068]] an offering [[H4503]] of memorial, [[H2146]] bringing iniquity [[H5771]] to remembrance. [[H2142]]

### 16
And the priest [[H3548]] shall bring her near, [[H7126]] and set [[H5975]] her before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]]

### 17
And the priest [[H3548]] shall take [[H3947]] holy [[H6918]] water [[H4325]] in an earthen [[H2789]] vessel; [[H3627]] and of [[H4480]] the dust [[H6083]] that [[H834]] is [[H1961]] in the floor [[H7172]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]] the priest [[H3548]] shall take, [[H3947]] and put [[H5414]] into [[H413]] the water: [[H4325]]

### 18
And the priest [[H3548]] shall set [[H5975]] the woman [[H802]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and uncover [[H6544]] the woman's [[H802]] head, [[H7218]] and put [[H5414]] the offering [[H4503]] of memorial [[H2146]] in [[H5921]] her hands, [[H3709]] which [[H1931]] the jealousy [[H7068]] offering: [[H4503]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall have [[H1961]] in his hand [[H3027]] the bitter [[H4751]] water [[H4325]] that causeth the curse: [[H779]]

### 19
And the priest [[H3548]] shall charge her by an oath, [[H7650]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the woman, [[H802]] If [[H518]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] have lain [[H7901]] with [[H854]] thee, and if [[H518]] thou hast not [[H3808]] gone aside [[H7847]] to uncleanness [[H2932]] instead of [[H8478]] thy husband, [[H376]] be thou free [[H5352]] from this [[H428]] bitter [[H4751]] water [[H4325]] that causeth the curse: [[H779]]

### 20
But if [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast gone aside [[H7847]] instead of [[H8478]] thy husband, [[H376]] and if [[H3588]] thou be defiled, [[H2930]] and some man [[H376]] have [[H5414]] lain [[H7903]] with thee beside [[H1107]] thine husband: [[H376]]

### 21
Then the priest [[H3548]] shall charge [[H7650]] the woman [[H802]] with an oath [[H7621]] of cursing, [[H423]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall say [[H559]] unto the woman, [[H802]] The Lord [[H3068]] make [[H5414]] thee a curse [[H423]] and an oath [[H7621]] among [[H8432]] thy people, [[H5971]] when the Lord [[H3068]] doth make [[H5414]] thy thigh [[H3409]] to rot, [[H5307]] and thy belly [[H990]] to swell; [[H6639]]

### 22
And this [[H428]] water [[H4325]] that causeth the curse [[H779]] shall go [[H935]] into thy bowels, [[H4578]] to make belly [[H990]] to swell, [[H6638]] and thigh [[H3409]] to rot: [[H5307]] And the woman [[H802]] shall say, [[H559]] Amen, [[H543]] amen. [[H543]]

### 23
And the priest [[H3548]] shall write [[H3789]] these [[H428]] curses [[H423]] in a book, [[H5612]] and he shall blot [[H4229]] out with [[H413]] the bitter [[H4751]] water: [[H4325]]

### 24
And he shall cause [[H853]] the woman [[H802]] to drink [[H8248]] the bitter [[H4751]] water [[H4325]] that causeth the curse: [[H779]] and the water [[H4325]] that causeth the curse [[H779]] shall enter [[H935]] into her, bitter. [[H4751]]

### 25
Then the priest [[H3548]] shall take [[H3947]] the jealousy [[H7068]] offering [[H4503]] out of the woman's [[H802]] hand, [[H3027]] and shall wave [[H5130]] the offering [[H4503]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and offer [[H7126]] it upon [[H413]] the altar: [[H4196]]

### 26
And the priest [[H3548]] shall take an handful [[H7061]] of [[H4480]] the offering, [[H4503]] the memorial [[H234]] thereof, and burn [[H6999]] upon the altar, [[H4196]] and afterward [[H310]]  shall cause [[H853]] the woman [[H802]] to drink [[H8248]] the water. [[H4325]]

### 27
And when he hath made her to drink [[H8248]] the water, [[H4325]] then it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] if [[H518]] she be defiled, [[H2930]] and have done [[H4603]] trespass [[H4604]] against her husband, [[H376]] that the water [[H4325]] that causeth the curse [[H779]] shall enter [[H935]] into her, bitter, [[H4751]] and her belly [[H990]] shall swell, [[H6638]] and her thigh [[H3409]] shall rot: [[H5307]] and the woman [[H802]] shall be [[H1961]] a curse [[H423]] among [[H7130]] her people. [[H5971]]

### 28
And if [[H518]] the woman [[H802]] be not [[H3808]] defiled, [[H2930]] but be clean; [[H2889]] then she shall be free, [[H5352]] and shall conceive [[H2232]] seed. [[H2233]]

### 29
This [[H2063]] the law [[H8451]] of jealousies, [[H7068]] when [[H834]] a wife [[H802]] goeth aside [[H7847]] instead of [[H8478]] her husband, [[H376]] and is defiled; [[H2930]]

### 30
Or [[H176]] when [[H834]] the spirit [[H7307]] of jealousy [[H7068]] cometh [[H5674]] upon [[H5921]] him, [[H376]] and he be jealous [[H7065]] over his wife, [[H802]] and shall set [[H5975]] the woman [[H802]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall execute [[H6213]]  upon her [[H853]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] law. [[H8451]]

### 31
Then shall the man [[H376]] be guiltless [[H5352]] from iniquity, [[H5771]] and this [[H1931]] woman [[H802]] shall bear [[H5375]] her iniquity. [[H5771]]
