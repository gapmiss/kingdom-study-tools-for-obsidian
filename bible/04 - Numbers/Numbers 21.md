### 1
And king [[H4428]] Arad [[H6166]] the Canaanite, [[H3669]] which dwelt [[H3427]] in the south, [[H5045]] heard tell [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] by the way [[H1870]] of the spies; [[H871]] then he fought [[H3898]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and took [[H7617]] of [[H4480]] them prisoners. [[H7628]]

### 2
And Israel [[H3478]] vowed [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] If [[H518]] thou wilt indeed [[H5414]] deliver [[H5414]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] into my hand, [[H3027]] then I will utterly destroy [[H2763]] their cities. [[H5892]]

### 3
And the Lord [[H3068]] hearkened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and delivered up [[H5414]] the Canaanites; [[H3669]] and they utterly destroyed [[H2763]] them and their cities: [[H5892]] and he called [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the place [[H4725]] Hormah. [[H2767]]

### 4
And they journeyed [[H5265]] from mount [[H2022]] Hor [[H2023]] by the way [[H1870]] of the Red [[H5488]] sea, [[H3220]] to compass [[H5437]] the land [[H776]] of Edom: [[H123]] and the soul [[H5315]] of the people [[H5971]] was much discouraged [[H7114]] because of the way. [[H1870]]

### 5
And the people [[H5971]] spake [[H1696]] against God, [[H430]] and against Moses, [[H4872]] Wherefore [[H4100]] have ye brought us up [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] to die [[H4191]] in the wilderness? [[H4057]] for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] bread, [[H3899]] neither [[H369]] water; [[H4325]] and our soul [[H5315]] loatheth [[H6973]] this light [[H7052]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 6
And the Lord [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] fiery [[H8314]] serpents [[H5175]] among the people, [[H5971]] and they bit [[H5391]] the people; [[H5971]] and much [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] of Israel [[H3478]] died. [[H4191]]

### 7
Therefore the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] We have sinned, [[H2398]] for [[H3588]] we have spoken [[H1696]] against the Lord, [[H3068]] and against thee; pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that he take away [[H5493]] the serpents [[H5175]] from [[H5921]] us. And Moses [[H4872]] prayed [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 8
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Make [[H6213]] thee a fiery serpent, [[H8314]] and set [[H7760]] it upon [[H5921]] a pole: [[H5251]] and it shall come to pass, [[H1961]] that every one [[H3605]] that is bitten, [[H5391]] when he looketh upon [[H7200]] it, shall live. [[H2425]]

### 9
And Moses [[H4872]] made [[H6213]] a serpent [[H5175]] of brass, [[H5178]] and put [[H7760]] it upon [[H5921]] a pole, [[H5251]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] that if [[H518]] a serpent [[H5175]] had bitten [[H5391]] any man, [[H376]] when he beheld [[H5027]] the serpent [[H5175]] of brass, [[H5178]] he lived. [[H2425]]

### 10
And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] set forward, [[H5265]] and pitched [[H2583]] in Oboth. [[H88]]

### 11
And they journeyed [[H5265]] from Oboth, [[H88]] and pitched [[H2583]] at Ije-abarim, [[H5863]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] which [[H834]] before [[H6440]] Moab, [[H4124]] toward the sunrising. [[H4217]]

### 12
From thence [[H8033]] they removed, [[H5265]] and pitched [[H2583]] in the valley [[H5158]] of Zared. [[H2218]]

### 13
From thence [[H8033]] they removed, [[H5265]] and pitched [[H2583]] on the other side [[H5676]] of Arnon, [[H769]] which [[H834]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] that cometh out [[H3318]] of the coasts [[H1366]] of the Amorites: [[H567]] for [[H3588]] Arnon [[H769]] the border [[H1366]] of Moab, [[H4124]] between [[H996]] Moab [[H4124]] and the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 14
Wherefore [[H5921]] it is said [[H559]] in the book [[H5612]] of the wars [[H4421]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] What he did [[H2052]] in the Red sea, [[H5492]] and in the brooks [[H5158]] of Arnon, [[H769]]

### 15
And at the stream [[H793]] of the brooks [[H5158]] that [[H834]] goeth down [[H5186]] to the dwelling [[H3427]] of Ar, [[H6144]] and lieth [[H8172]] upon the border [[H1366]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 16
And from thence [[H8033]] to Beer: [[H876]] that [[H1931]] the well [[H875]] whereof [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H559]] unto Moses, [[H4872]] Gather together, [[H622]] the people [[H5971]] and I will give [[H5414]] them water. [[H4325]]

### 17
Then [[H227]] Israel [[H3478]] sang [[H7891]] this [[H2063]] song, [[H7892]] Spring up, [[H5927]] O well; [[H875]] sing [[H6030]] ye unto it: [[H6030]]

### 18
The princes [[H8269]] digged [[H2658]] the well, [[H875]] the nobles [[H5081]] of the people [[H5971]] digged [[H3738]] it, by the lawgiver, [[H2710]] with their staves. [[H4938]] And from the wilderness [[H4057]] to Mattanah: [[H4980]]

### 19
And from Mattanah [[H4980]] to Nahaliel: [[H5160]] and from Nahaliel [[H5160]] to Bamoth: [[H1120]]

### 20
And from Bamoth [[H1120]] the valley, [[H1516]] that [[H834]] in the country [[H7704]] of Moab, [[H4124]] to the top [[H7218]] of Pisgah, [[H6449]] which looketh [[H8259]] toward [[H6440]] Jeshimon. [[H3452]]

### 21
And Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] unto [[H413]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] saying, [[H559]]

### 22
Let me pass [[H5674]] through thy land: [[H776]] we will not [[H3808]] turn [[H5186]] into the fields, [[H7704]] or into the vineyards; [[H3754]] we will not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] the waters [[H4325]] of the well: [[H875]] we will go along [[H1980]] by the king's [[H4428]] way, [[H1870]] until [[H5704]] we be past [[H5674]] thy borders. [[H1366]]

### 23
And Sihon [[H5511]] would not [[H3808]] suffer [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] to pass [[H5674]] through his border: [[H1366]] but Sihon [[H5511]] gathered together, [[H622]] all his people [[H5971]] and went out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] Israel [[H3478]] into the wilderness: [[H4057]] and he came [[H935]] to Jahaz, [[H3096]] and fought [[H3898]] against Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
And Israel [[H3478]] smote [[H5221]] him with the edge [[H6310]] of the sword, [[H2719]] and possessed [[H3423]] his land [[H776]] from Arnon [[H769]] unto [[H5704]] Jabbok, [[H2999]] even unto [[H5704]] the children [[H1121]] of Ammon: [[H5983]] for [[H3588]] the border [[H1366]] of the children [[H1121]] of Ammon [[H5983]] strong. [[H5794]]

### 25
And Israel [[H3478]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] cities: [[H5892]] and Israel [[H3478]] dwelt [[H3427]] in all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] in Heshbon, [[H2809]] and in all [[H3605]] the villages [[H1323]] thereof. [[H1323]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] Heshbon [[H2809]] the city [[H5892]] of Sihon [[H5511]] the king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who [[H1931]] had fought [[H3898]] against the former [[H7223]] king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and taken [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] his land [[H776]] out of his hand, [[H3027]] even unto [[H5704]] Arnon. [[H769]]

### 27
Wherefore [[H5921]] they that speak in proverbs [[H4911]] say, [[H559]] Come [[H935]] into Heshbon, [[H2809]] let the city [[H5892]] of Sihon [[H5511]] be built [[H1129]] and prepared: [[H3559]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] there is a fire [[H784]] gone out [[H3318]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] a flame [[H3852]] from the city [[H7151]] of Sihon: [[H5511]] it hath consumed [[H398]] Ar [[H6144]] of Moab, [[H4124]] the lords [[H1167]] of the high places [[H1116]] of Arnon. [[H769]]

### 29
Woe [[H188]] to thee, Moab! [[H4124]] thou art undone, [[H6]] O people [[H5971]] of Chemosh: [[H3645]] he hath given [[H5414]] his sons [[H1121]] that escaped, [[H6412]] and his daughters, [[H1323]] into captivity [[H7628]] unto Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 30
We have shot [[H3384]] at them; Heshbon [[H2809]] is perished [[H6]] even unto [[H5704]] Dibon, [[H1769]] and we have laid them waste [[H8074]] even unto [[H5704]] Nophah, [[H5302]] which [[H834]] unto [[H5704]] Medeba. [[H4311]]

### 31
Thus Israel [[H3478]] dwelt [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 32
And Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] to spy out [[H7270]] Jaazer, [[H3270]] and they took [[H3920]] the villages [[H1323]] thereof, and drove out [[H3423]] the Amorites [[H567]] that [[H834]] there. [[H8033]]

### 33
And they turned [[H6437]] and went up [[H5927]] by the way [[H1870]] of Bashan: [[H1316]] and Og [[H5747]] the king [[H4428]] of Bashan [[H1316]] went out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] them, he, [[H1931]] and all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] to the battle [[H4421]] at Edrei. [[H154]]

### 34
And the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Fear [[H3372]] him not: [[H408]] for [[H3588]] I have delivered [[H5414]] him into thy hand, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] and his land; [[H776]] and thou shalt do [[H6213]] to him as [[H834]] thou didst [[H6213]] unto Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which [[H834]] dwelt [[H3427]] at Heshbon. [[H2809]]

### 35
So they smote [[H5221]] him, and his sons, [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] until [[H5704]] there was none [[H1115]] left [[H7604]] him alive: [[H8300]] and they possessed [[H3423]] his land. [[H776]]
