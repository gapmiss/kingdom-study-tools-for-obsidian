And the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] set forward, [[H5265]] and pitched [[H2583]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] on this side [[H5676]] Jordan [[H3383]] Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 2
And Balak [[H1111]] the son [[H1121]] of Zippor [[H6834]] saw [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Israel [[H3478]] had done [[H6213]] to the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 3
And Moab [[H4124]] was sore [[H3966]] afraid [[H1481]] of [[H6440]] the people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] many: [[H7227]] and Moab [[H4124]] was distressed [[H6973]] because of [[H6440]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
And Moab [[H4124]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] of Midian, [[H4080]] Now [[H6258]] shall this company [[H6951]] lick up [[H3897]] all [[H3605]] round about [[H5439]] us, as the ox [[H7794]] licketh up [[H3897]] the grass [[H3418]] of the field. [[H7704]] And Balak [[H1111]] the son [[H1121]] of Zippor [[H6834]] king [[H4428]] of the Moabites [[H4124]] at that [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

### 5
He sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] therefore unto [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] the son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] to Pethor, [[H6604]] which [[H834]] by [[H5921]] the river [[H5104]] of the land [[H776]] of the children [[H1121]] of his people, [[H5971]] to call [[H7121]] him, saying, [[H559]] Behold, [[H2009]] there is a people [[H5971]] come out [[H3318]] from Egypt: [[H4714]] behold, [[H2009]] they cover [[H3680]] the face [[H5869]] of the earth, [[H776]] and they [[H1931]] abide [[H3427]] over against [[H4136]] me: [[H4136]]

### 6
Come [[H1980]] now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] curse [[H779]]  me [[H853]] this [[H2088]] people; [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] too mighty for [[H6099]] me: peradventure [[H194]] I shall prevail, [[H3201]] we may smite [[H5221]] them, and I may drive them out [[H1644]] of [[H4480]] the land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] I wot [[H3045]] that he whom [[H834]] thou blessest [[H1288]] blessed, [[H1288]] and he whom [[H834]] thou cursest [[H779]] is cursed. [[H779]]

### 7
And the elders [[H2205]] of Moab [[H4124]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Midian [[H4080]] departed [[H1980]] with the rewards of divination [[H7081]] in their hand; [[H3027]] and they came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] him the words [[H1697]] of Balak. [[H1111]]

### 8
And he said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] them, Lodge [[H3885]] here [[H6311]] this night, [[H3915]] and I will bring [[H7725]] you word [[H1697]] again, as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] me: and the princes [[H8269]] of Moab [[H4124]] abode [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] Balaam. [[H1109]]

### 9
And God [[H430]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and said, [[H559]] What [[H4310]] men [[H582]] these [[H428]] with [[H5973]] thee? [[H5973]]

### 10
And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] God, [[H430]] Balak [[H1111]] the son [[H1121]] of Zippor, [[H6834]] king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] hath sent [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] me, [[H413]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2009]] a people [[H5971]] come out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] which covereth [[H3680]] the face [[H5869]] of the earth: [[H776]] come [[H1980]] now, [[H6258]] curse [[H6895]] me them; peradventure [[H194]] I shall be able [[H3201]] to overcome [[H3898]] them, and drive them out. [[H1644]]

### 12
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] Thou shalt not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] them; thou shalt not [[H3808]] curse [[H779]] the people: [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] blessed. [[H1288]]

### 13
And Balaam [[H1109]] rose up [[H6965]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the princes [[H8269]] of Balak, [[H1111]] Get [[H1980]] you into [[H413]] your land: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] refuseth [[H3985]] to give me leave [[H5414]] to go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] you. [[H5973]]

### 14
And the princes [[H8269]] of Moab [[H4124]] rose up, [[H6965]] and they went [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] and said, [[H559]] Balaam [[H1109]] refuseth [[H3985]] to come [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] us. [[H5973]]

### 15
And Balak [[H1111]] sent [[H7971]] yet [[H5750]] again [[H3254]] princes, [[H8269]] more, [[H7227]] and more honourable [[H3513]] than they. [[H428]]

### 16
And they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and said [[H559]] to him, Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] Balak [[H1111]] the son [[H1121]] of Zippor, [[H6834]] Let nothing, [[H408]] I pray thee, [[H4994]] hinder [[H4513]] thee from coming [[H1980]] unto [[H413]] me: [[H413]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] I will promote great [[H3513]] thee unto very [[H3966]] honour, [[H3513]] and I will do [[H6213]] whatsoever [[H3605]] thou sayest [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me: come [[H1980]] therefore, I pray thee, [[H4994]] curse [[H6895]]  me [[H853]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]

### 18
And Balaam [[H1109]] answered [[H6030]] and said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the servants [[H5650]] of Balak, [[H1111]] If [[H518]] Balak [[H1111]] would give [[H5414]] me his house [[H1004]] full [[H4393]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] I cannot [[H3201]] go beyond [[H5674]] the word [[H6310]] of the Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] to do [[H6213]] less [[H6996]] or [[H176]] more. [[H1419]]

### 19
Now [[H6258]] therefore, I pray you, [[H4994]] tarry [[H3427]] ye [[H859]] also [[H1571]] here [[H2088]] this night, [[H3915]] that I may know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] the Lord [[H3068]] will say [[H1696]] unto [[H5973]] me more. [[H3254]]

### 20
And God [[H430]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] at night, [[H3915]] and said [[H559]] unto him, If [[H518]] the men [[H376]] come [[H935]] to call [[H7121]] thee, rise up, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] them; but yet [[H389]] the word [[H1697]] which [[H834]] I shall say [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee, that shalt thou do. [[H6213]]

### 21
And Balaam [[H1109]] rose up [[H6965]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and saddled [[H2280]] his ass, [[H860]] and went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] the princes [[H8269]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 22
And God's [[H430]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] went: [[H1980]] and the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] stood [[H3320]] in the way [[H1870]] for an adversary [[H7854]] against him. Now he [[H1931]] was riding [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] his ass, [[H860]] and his two [[H8147]] servants [[H5288]] with [[H5973]] him. [[H5973]]

### 23
And the ass [[H860]] saw [[H7200]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] standing [[H5324]] in the way, [[H1870]] and his sword [[H2719]] drawn [[H8025]] in his hand: [[H3027]] and the ass [[H860]] turned aside [[H5186]] out of [[H4480]] the way, [[H1870]] and went [[H1980]] into the field: [[H7704]] and Balaam [[H1109]] smote [[H5221]] the ass, [[H860]] to turn [[H5186]] her into the way. [[H1870]]

### 24
But the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] stood [[H5975]] in a path [[H4934]] of the vineyards, [[H3754]] a wall [[H1447]] on this side, [[H2088]] and a wall [[H1447]] on that side. [[H2088]]

### 25
And when the ass [[H860]] saw [[H7200]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] she thrust herself [[H3905]] unto [[H413]] the wall, [[H7023]] and crushed [[H3905]] Balaam's [[H1109]] foot [[H7272]] against [[H413]] the wall: [[H7023]] and he smote [[H5221]] her again. [[H3254]]

### 26
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] went [[H5674]] further, [[H3254]] and stood [[H5975]] in a narrow [[H6862]] place, [[H4725]] where [[H834]] no [[H369]] way [[H1870]] to turn [[H5186]] either to the right hand [[H3225]] or to the left. [[H8040]]

### 27
And when the ass [[H860]] saw [[H7200]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] she fell down [[H7257]] under [[H8478]] Balaam: [[H1109]] and Balaam's [[H1109]] anger [[H639]] was kindled, [[H2734]] and he smote [[H5221]] the ass [[H860]] with a staff. [[H4731]]

### 28
And the Lord [[H3068]] opened [[H6605]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the ass, [[H860]] and she said [[H559]] unto Balaam, [[H1109]] What [[H4100]] have I done [[H6213]] unto thee, that [[H3588]] thou hast smitten [[H5221]] me these [[H2088]] three [[H7969]] times? [[H7272]]

### 29
And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] unto the ass, [[H860]] Because [[H3588]] thou hast mocked [[H5953]] me: I would [[H3863]] there were [[H3426]] a sword [[H2719]] in mine hand, [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] would I kill [[H2026]] thee. [[H2026]]

### 30
And the ass [[H860]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] not [[H3808]] I [[H595]] thine ass, [[H860]] upon [[H5921]] which [[H834]] thou hast ridden [[H7392]] ever since [[H5750]] thine unto [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day? [[H3117]] was I ever [[H5532]] wont [[H5532]] to do so [[H6213]] unto thee? And he said, [[H559]] Nay. [[H3808]]

### 31
Then the Lord [[H3068]] opened [[H1540]] the eyes [[H5869]] of Balaam, [[H1109]] and he saw [[H7200]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] standing [[H5324]] in the way, [[H1870]] and his sword [[H2719]] drawn [[H8025]] in his hand: [[H3027]] and he bowed down [[H6915]] his head, and fell flat [[H7812]] on his face. [[H639]]

### 32
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, Wherefore [[H5921]] hast thou smitten [[H5221]] thine ass [[H860]] these [[H2088]] three [[H7969]] times? [[H7272]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] went out [[H3318]] to withstand [[H7854]] thee, because [[H3588]] way [[H1870]] is perverse [[H3399]] before [[H5048]] me: [[H5048]]

### 33
And the ass [[H860]] saw [[H7200]] me, and turned [[H5186]] from me [[H6440]] these [[H2088]] three [[H7969]] times: [[H7272]] unless [[H194]] she had turned [[H5186]] from me, [[H6440]] surely [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] also [[H1571]] I had slain [[H2026]] thee, and saved her alive. [[H2421]]

### 34
And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] I have sinned; [[H2398]] for [[H3588]] I knew [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] that [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] stoodest [[H5324]] in the way [[H1870]] against [[H7125]] me: now [[H6258]] therefore, if [[H518]] it displease [[H7451]] thee, [[H5869]] I will get me back again. [[H7725]]

### 35
And the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] Go [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] the men: [[H376]] but only [[H657]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I shall speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] thee, that thou shalt speak. [[H1696]] So Balaam [[H1109]] went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] the princes [[H8269]] of Balak. [[H1111]]

### 36
And when Balak [[H1111]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Balaam [[H1109]] was come, [[H935]] he went out [[H3318]] to meet [[H7125]] him unto [[H413]] a city [[H5892]] of Moab, [[H4124]] which [[H834]] in [[H5921]] the border [[H1366]] of Arnon, [[H769]] which [[H834]] in the utmost [[H7097]] coast. [[H1366]]

### 37
And Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] Did I not [[H3808]] earnestly [[H7971]] send [[H7971]] unto [[H413]] thee to call [[H7121]] thee? wherefore [[H4100]] camest [[H1980]] thou not [[H3808]] unto [[H413]] me? am I not able [[H3201]] indeed [[H552]] to promote thee to honour? [[H3513]]

### 38
And Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] Lo, [[H2009]] I am come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] thee: have I now [[H6258]] any power [[H3201]] at all [[H3605]] to say [[H1696]] any thing? [[H3972]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] putteth [[H7760]] in my mouth, [[H6310]] that shall I speak. [[H1696]]

### 39
And Balaam [[H1109]] went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] Balak, [[H1111]] and they came [[H935]] unto Kirjath-huzoth. [[H7155]]

### 40
And Balak [[H1111]] offered [[H2076]] oxen [[H1241]] and sheep, [[H6629]] and sent [[H7971]] to Balaam, [[H1109]] and to the princes [[H8269]] that [[H834]] with [[H854]] him. [[H854]]

### 41
And it came to pass [[H1961]] on the morrow, [[H1242]] that Balak [[H1111]] took [[H3947]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and brought him up [[H5927]] into the high places [[H1116]] of Baal, [[H1120]] that thence [[H8033]] he might see [[H7200]] the utmost [[H7097]] of the people. [[H5971]]
