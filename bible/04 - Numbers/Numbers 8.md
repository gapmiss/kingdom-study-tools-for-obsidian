And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

Speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] and say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] him, When thou lightest [[H5927]] the lamps, [[H5216]] the seven [[H7651]] lamps [[H5216]] shall give light [[H215]] over against [[H6440]] the candlestick. [[H4501]]

And Aaron [[H175]] did [[H6213]] so; [[H3651]] he lighted [[H5927]] the lamps [[H5216]] thereof over against [[H4136]] the candlestick, [[H4501]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

[[H4501]]

### 5
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 6
Take [[H3947]] the Levites [[H3881]] from among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and cleanse [[H2891]] them. [[H2891]]

### 7
And thus [[H3541]] shalt thou do [[H6213]] unto them, to cleanse [[H2891]] them: Sprinkle [[H5137]] water [[H4325]] of purifying [[H2403]] upon [[H5921]] them, and let them shave [[H8593]] all [[H3605]] their flesh, [[H1320]] and let them wash [[H3526]] their clothes, [[H899]] and make themselves clean. [[H2891]]

Then let them take [[H3947]] a young [[H1121]] bullock [[H6499]] with his meat offering, [[H4503]] fine flour [[H5560]] mingled [[H1101]] with oil, [[H8081]] and another [[H8145]] young [[H1121]] bullock [[H6499]] shalt thou take [[H3947]] for a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 9
And thou shalt bring [[H7126]] the Levites [[H3881]] before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation: [[H4150]] and thou shalt gather together: [[H6950]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]]

### 10
And thou shalt bring [[H7126]] the Levites [[H3881]] before [[H6440]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] shall put [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the Levites: [[H3881]]

### 11
And Aaron [[H175]] shall offer [[H5130]] the Levites [[H3881]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] an offering [[H8573]] of [[H853]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] that they may execute [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
And the Levites [[H3881]] shall lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of the bullocks: [[H6499]] and thou shalt offer [[H6213]] the one [[H259]] a sin offering, [[H2403]] and the other [[H259]] a burnt offering, [[H5930]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] to make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the Levites. [[H3881]]

### 13
And thou shalt set [[H5975]] the Levites [[H3881]] before [[H6440]] Aaron, [[H175]] and before [[H6440]] his sons, [[H1121]] and offer [[H5130]] them an offering [[H8573]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
Thus shalt thou separate [[H914]] the Levites [[H3881]] from among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] and the Levites [[H3881]] shall be [[H1961]] mine. [[H1961]]

### 15
And after [[H310]] that [[H3651]] shall the Levites [[H3881]] go in [[H935]] to do the service [[H5647]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation: [[H4150]] and thou shalt cleanse [[H2891]] them, and offer [[H5130]] them an offering. [[H8573]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] wholly given [[H5414]] unto me from among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel; [[H3478]] instead of [[H8478]] such as open [[H6363]] every [[H3605]] womb, [[H7358]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of all [[H3605]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] have I taken [[H3947]] them unto me. [[H3947]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] mine, man [[H120]] and beast: [[H929]] on the day [[H3117]] that I smote [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] I sanctified [[H6942]] them for myself. [[H6942]]

### 18
And I have taken [[H3947]] the Levites [[H3881]] for [[H8478]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 19
And I have given [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] a gift [[H5414]] to Aaron [[H175]] and to his sons [[H1121]] from among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to do [[H5647]] the service [[H5656]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] and to make an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]] that there be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] plague [[H5063]] among the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] when the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] come nigh [[H5066]] unto [[H413]] the sanctuary. [[H6944]]

### 20
And Moses, [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] to the Levites [[H3881]] according unto all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] concerning the Levites, [[H3881]] so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] unto them. [[H3478]]

### 21
And the Levites [[H3881]] were purified, [[H2398]] and they washed [[H3526]] their clothes; [[H899]] and Aaron [[H175]] offered [[H5130]] them an offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and Aaron [[H175]] made an atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] them to cleanse [[H2891]] them. [[H2891]]

### 22
And after [[H310]] that [[H3651]] went [[H935]] the Levites [[H3881]] in to do [[H5647]] their service [[H5656]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation [[H4150]] before [[H6440]] Aaron, [[H175]] and before [[H6440]] his sons: [[H1121]] as [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] concerning [[H5921]] the Levites, [[H3881]] so [[H3651]] did [[H6213]] they unto them. [[H6213]]

### 23
And the Lord [[H3068]] spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 24
This [[H2063]] that [[H834]] unto the Levites: [[H3881]] from twenty [[H6242]] and five [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] and upward [[H4605]] they shall go in [[H935]] to wait upon [[H6633]] the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation: [[H4150]]

### 25
And from the age [[H1121]] of fifty [[H2572]] years [[H8141]] they shall cease [[H7725]] waiting [[H6635]] upon the service [[H5656]] and shall serve [[H5647]] no [[H3808]] more: [[H5750]]

### 26
But shall minister [[H8334]] with [[H854]] their brethren [[H251]] in the tabernacle [[H168]] of the congregation, [[H4150]] to keep [[H8104]] the charge, [[H4931]] and shall do [[H5647]] no [[H3808]] service. [[H5656]] Thus [[H3602]] shalt thou do [[H6213]] unto the Levites [[H3881]] touching their charge. [[H4931]]
