Maschil [[H4905]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
O God, [[H430]] why [[H4100]] hast thou cast off [[H2186]] for ever? [[H5331]] doth thine anger [[H639]] smoke [[H6225]] against the sheep [[H6629]] of thy pasture? [[H4830]]

### 2
Remember [[H2142]] thy congregation, [[H5712]] thou hast purchased [[H7069]] of old; [[H6924]] the rod [[H7626]] of thine inheritance, [[H5159]] thou hast redeemed; [[H1350]] this [[H2088]] mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] wherein thou hast dwelt. [[H7931]]

### 3
Lift up [[H7311]] thy feet [[H6471]] unto the perpetual [[H5331]] desolations; [[H4876]] all [[H3605]] the enemy [[H341]] hath done wickedly [[H7489]] in the sanctuary. [[H6944]]

### 4
Thine enemies [[H6887]] roar [[H7580]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thy congregations; [[H4150]] they set up [[H7760]] their ensigns [[H226]] signs. [[H226]]

### 5
was famous [[H3045]] according as he had lifted up [[H935]] axes [[H7134]] upon the thick [[H5442]] trees. [[H6086]]

### 6
But now [[H6258]] they break down [[H1986]] the carved work [[H6603]] thereof at once [[H3162]] with axes [[H3781]] and hammers. [[H3597]]

### 7
They have cast [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] into thy sanctuary, [[H4720]] they have defiled [[H2490]] the dwelling place [[H4908]] of thy name [[H8034]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 8
They said [[H559]] in their hearts, [[H3820]] Let us destroy [[H3238]] them together: [[H3162]] they have burned up [[H8313]] all [[H3605]] the synagogues [[H4150]] of God [[H410]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 9
We see [[H7200]] not [[H3808]] our signs: [[H226]] no [[H369]] more [[H5750]] any prophet: [[H5030]] neither [[H3808]] among [[H854]] us any that knoweth [[H3045]] how long. [[H5704]]

### 10
O God, [[H430]] how long [[H5704]] shall the adversary [[H6862]] reproach? [[H2778]] shall the enemy [[H341]] blaspheme [[H5006]] thy name [[H8034]] for ever? [[H5331]]

### 11
Why [[H4100]] withdrawest [[H7725]] thou thy hand, [[H3027]] even thy right hand? [[H3225]] pluck [[H3615]] out of [[H7130]] thy bosom. [[H2436]]

### 12
For God [[H430]] my King [[H4428]] of old, [[H6924]] working [[H6466]] salvation [[H3444]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 13
Thou [[H859]] didst divide [[H6565]] the sea [[H3220]] by thy strength: [[H5797]] thou brakest [[H7665]] the heads [[H7218]] of the dragons [[H8577]] in [[H5921]] the waters. [[H4325]]

### 14
Thou [[H859]] brakest [[H7533]] the heads [[H7218]] of leviathan [[H3882]] in pieces, gavest [[H5414]] him meat [[H3978]] to the people [[H5971]] inhabiting the wilderness. [[H6728]]

### 15
Thou [[H859]] didst cleave [[H1234]] the fountain [[H4599]] and the flood: [[H5158]] thou [[H859]] driedst up [[H3001]] mighty [[H386]] rivers. [[H5104]]

### 16
The day [[H3117]] thine, the night [[H3915]] also [[H637]] thine: thou [[H859]] hast prepared [[H3559]] the light [[H3974]] and the sun. [[H8121]]

### 17
Thou [[H859]] hast set [[H5324]] all [[H3605]] the borders [[H1367]] of the earth: [[H776]] thou [[H859]] hast made [[H3335]] summer [[H7019]] and winter. [[H2779]]

### 18
Remember [[H2142]] this, [[H2063]] the enemy [[H341]] hath reproached, [[H2778]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and the foolish [[H5036]] people [[H5971]] have blasphemed [[H5006]] thy name. [[H8034]]

### 19
O deliver [[H5414]] not [[H408]] the soul [[H5315]] of thy turtledove [[H8449]] unto the multitude [[H2416]] forget [[H7911]] not [[H408]] the congregation [[H2416]] of thy poor [[H6041]] for ever. [[H5331]]

### 20
Have respect [[H5027]] unto the covenant: [[H1285]] for [[H3588]] the dark places [[H4285]] of the earth [[H776]] are full [[H4390]] of the habitations [[H4999]] of cruelty. [[H2555]]

### 21
O let not [[H408]] the oppressed [[H1790]] return [[H7725]] ashamed: [[H3637]] let the poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] praise [[H1984]] thy name. [[H8034]]

### 22
Arise, [[H6965]] O God, [[H430]] plead [[H7378]] thine own cause: [[H7379]] remember [[H2142]] how [[H4480]] the foolish man [[H5036]] reproacheth [[H2781]] thee daily. [[H3117]]

### 23
Forget [[H7911]] not [[H408]] the voice [[H6963]] of thine enemies: [[H6887]] the tumult [[H7588]] of those that rise up against [[H6965]] thee increaseth [[H5927]] continually. [[H8548]]
