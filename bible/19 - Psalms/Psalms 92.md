A Psalm [[H4210]] Song [[H7892]] for the sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]]

### 1
good [[H2896]] to give thanks [[H3034]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] and to sing praises [[H2167]] unto thy name, [[H8034]] O most High: [[H5945]]

### 2
To shew forth [[H5046]] thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and thy faithfulness [[H530]] every night, [[H3915]]

### 3
Upon [[H5921]] an instrument of ten strings, [[H6218]] and upon [[H5921]] the psaltery; [[H5035]] upon the harp [[H3658]] with [[H5921]] a solemn sound. [[H1902]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thou, Lord, [[H3068]] hast made me glad [[H8055]] through thy work: [[H6467]] I will triumph [[H7442]] in the works [[H4639]] of thy hands. [[H3027]]

### 5
O Lord, [[H3068]] how [[H4100]] great [[H1431]] are thy works! [[H4639]] thy thoughts [[H4284]] are very [[H3966]] deep. [[H6009]]

### 6
A brutish [[H1198]] man [[H376]] knoweth [[H3045]] not; [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] doth a fool [[H3684]] understand [[H995]] this. [[H853]]

### 7
When the wicked [[H7563]] spring [[H6524]] as [[H3644]] the grass, [[H6212]] and when all [[H3605]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] do flourish; [[H6692]] that they shall be destroyed [[H8045]] for ever: [[H5703]]

### 8
But thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H3068]] high [[H4791]] for evermore. [[H5769]]

### 9
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] thine enemies, [[H341]] O Lord, [[H3068]] for, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] thine enemies [[H341]] shall perish; [[H6]] all [[H3605]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] shall be scattered. [[H6504]]

### 10
But my horn [[H7161]] shalt thou exalt [[H7311]] like an unicorn: [[H7214]] I shall be anointed [[H1101]] with fresh [[H7488]] oil. [[H8081]]

### 11
Mine eye [[H5869]] also shall see [[H5027]] on mine enemies, [[H7790]] mine ears [[H241]] shall hear [[H8085]] of the wicked [[H7489]] that rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 12
The righteous [[H6662]] shall flourish [[H6524]] like the palm tree: [[H8558]] he shall grow [[H7685]] like a cedar [[H730]] in Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 13
Those that be planted [[H8362]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall flourish [[H6524]] in the courts [[H2691]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 14
They shall still [[H5750]] bring forth fruit [[H5107]] in old age; [[H7872]] they shall be [[H1961]] fat [[H1879]] and flourishing; [[H7488]]

### 15
To shew [[H5046]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] upright: [[H3477]] my rock, [[H6697]] and no [[H3808]] unrighteousness [[H5766]] in him. [[H5766]]
