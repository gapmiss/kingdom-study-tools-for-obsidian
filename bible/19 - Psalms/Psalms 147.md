### 1
Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord: [[H3050]] for [[H3588]] good [[H2896]] to sing praises [[H2167]] unto our God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] pleasant; [[H5273]] praise [[H8416]] is comely. [[H5000]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] doth build up [[H1129]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]] he gathereth together [[H3664]] the outcasts [[H1760]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
He healeth [[H7495]] the broken [[H7665]] in heart, [[H3820]] and bindeth up [[H2280]] their wounds. [[H6094]]

### 4
He telleth [[H4487]] the number [[H4557]] of the stars; [[H3556]] he calleth [[H7121]] them all [[H3605]] by names. [[H8034]]

### 5
Great [[H1419]] our Lord, [[H113]] and of great [[H7227]] power: [[H3581]] his understanding [[H8394]] infinite. [[H4557]]

### 6
The Lord [[H3068]] lifteth up [[H5749]] the meek: [[H6035]] he casteth [[H8213]] the wicked [[H7563]] down to [[H5704]] the ground. [[H776]]

### 7
Sing [[H6030]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] with thanksgiving; [[H8426]] sing praise [[H2167]] upon the harp [[H3658]] unto our God: [[H430]]

### 8
Who covereth [[H3680]] the heaven [[H8064]] with clouds, [[H5645]] who prepareth [[H3559]] rain [[H4306]] for the earth, [[H776]] who maketh grass [[H2682]] to grow [[H6779]] upon the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 9
He giveth [[H5414]] to the beast [[H929]] his food, [[H3899]] to the young [[H1121]] ravens [[H6158]] which [[H834]] cry. [[H7121]]

### 10
He delighteth [[H2654]] not [[H3808]] in the strength [[H1369]] of the horse: [[H5483]] he taketh not pleasure [[H7521]] in the legs [[H7785]] of a man. [[H376]]

### 11
The Lord [[H3068]] taketh pleasure in [[H7521]] them that fear [[H3373]]  him, in [[H853]] those that hope [[H3176]] in his mercy. [[H2617]]

### 12
Praise [[H7623]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O Jerusalem; [[H3389]] praise [[H1984]] thy God, [[H430]] O Zion. [[H6726]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] he hath strengthened [[H2388]] the bars [[H1280]] of thy gates; [[H8179]] he hath blessed [[H1288]] thy children [[H1121]] within [[H7130]] thee. [[H7130]]

### 14
He maketh [[H7760]] peace [[H7965]] thy borders, [[H1366]] filleth [[H7646]] thee with the finest [[H2459]] of the wheat. [[H2406]]

### 15
He sendeth forth [[H7971]] his commandment [[H565]] earth: [[H776]] his word [[H1697]] runneth [[H7323]] very [[H5704]] swiftly. [[H4120]]

### 16
He giveth [[H5414]] snow [[H7950]] like wool: [[H6785]] he scattereth [[H6340]] the hoarfrost [[H3713]] like ashes. [[H665]]

### 17
He casteth forth [[H7993]] his ice [[H7140]] like morsels: [[H6595]] who [[H4310]] can stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] his cold? [[H7135]]

### 18
He sendeth out [[H7971]] his word, [[H1697]] and melteth [[H4529]] them: he causeth his wind [[H7307]] to blow, [[H5380]] the waters [[H4325]] flow. [[H5140]]

### 19
He sheweth [[H5046]] his word [[H1697]] unto Jacob, [[H3290]] his statutes [[H2706]] and his judgments [[H4941]] unto Israel. [[H3478]]

### 20
He hath not [[H3808]] dealt [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] with any [[H3605]] nation: [[H1471]] and judgments, [[H4941]] they have not [[H1077]] known [[H3045]] them. Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord. [[H3050]]
