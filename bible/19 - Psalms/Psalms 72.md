Give [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] thy judgments, [[H4941]] O God, [[H430]] and thy righteousness [[H6666]] unto the king's [[H4428]] son. [[H1121]]

### 2
He shall judge [[H1777]] thy people [[H5971]] with righteousness, [[H6664]] and thy poor [[H6041]] with judgment. [[H4941]]

### 3
The mountains [[H2022]] shall bring [[H5375]] peace [[H7965]] to the people, [[H5971]] and the little hills, [[H1389]] by righteousness. [[H6666]]

He shall judge [[H8199]] the poor [[H6041]] of the people, [[H5971]] he shall save [[H3467]] the children [[H1121]] of the needy, [[H34]] and shall break in pieces [[H1792]] the oppressor. [[H6231]]

They shall fear [[H3372]] thee as long as [[H5973]] the sun [[H8121]] and moon [[H3394]] endure, [[H6440]] throughout all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 6
He shall come down [[H3381]] like rain [[H4306]] upon [[H5921]] the mown grass: [[H1488]] as showers [[H7241]] water [[H2222]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 7
In his days [[H3117]] shall the righteous [[H6662]] flourish; [[H6524]] and abundance [[H7230]] of peace [[H7965]] so long [[H5704]] as the moon [[H3394]] endureth. [[H3394]]

### 8
He shall have dominion [[H7287]] also from sea [[H3220]] to [[H5704]] sea, [[H3220]] and from the river [[H5104]] unto [[H5704]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 9
They that dwell in the wilderness [[H6728]] shall bow [[H3766]] before [[H6440]] him; and his enemies [[H341]] shall lick [[H3897]] the dust. [[H6083]]

### 10
The kings [[H4428]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] and of the isles [[H339]] shall bring [[H7725]] presents: [[H4503]] the kings [[H4428]] of Sheba [[H7614]] and Seba [[H5434]] shall offer [[H7126]] gifts. [[H814]]

### 11
Yea, all [[H3605]] kings [[H4428]] shall fall down [[H7812]] before him: all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] shall serve [[H5647]] him. [[H5647]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] he shall deliver [[H5337]] the needy [[H34]] when he crieth; [[H7768]] the poor [[H6041]] also, and that hath no [[H369]] helper. [[H5826]]

### 13
He shall spare [[H2347]] the poor [[H1800]] and needy, [[H34]] and shall save [[H3467]] the souls [[H5315]] of the needy. [[H34]]

### 14
He shall redeem [[H1350]] their soul [[H5315]] from deceit [[H8496]] and violence: [[H2555]] and precious [[H3365]] shall their blood [[H1818]] be in his sight. [[H5869]]

### 15
And he shall live, [[H2421]] and to him shall be given [[H5414]] of the gold [[H2091]] of Sheba: [[H7614]] prayer made [[H6419]] also shall be for [[H1157]] him continually; [[H8548]] daily [[H3117]] shall he be praised. [[H1288]]

### 16
There shall be [[H1961]] an handful [[H6451]] of corn [[H1250]] in the earth [[H776]] upon the top [[H7218]] of the mountains; [[H2022]] the fruit [[H6529]] thereof shall shake [[H7493]] like Lebanon: [[H3844]] and of the city [[H5892]] shall flourish [[H6692]] like grass [[H6212]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
His name [[H8034]] shall endure [[H1961]] for ever: [[H5769]] his name [[H8034]] shall be continued [[H5125]] as long as [[H6440]] the sun: [[H8121]] and shall be blessed [[H1288]] in him: all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] shall call him blessed. [[H833]]

### 18
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who only [[H905]] doeth [[H6213]] wondrous things. [[H6381]]
