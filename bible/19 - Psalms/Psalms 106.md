### 1
Praise ye the Lord. [[H1984]] O give thanks [[H3034]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] good: [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] his mercy [[H2617]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 2
Who [[H4310]] can utter [[H4448]] the mighty acts [[H1369]] of the Lord? [[H3068]] can shew forth [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] his praise? [[H8416]]

### 3
Blessed [[H835]] they that keep [[H8104]] judgment, [[H4941]] he that doeth [[H6213]] righteousness [[H6666]] at all [[H3605]] times. [[H6256]]

### 4
Remember [[H2142]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] with the favour [[H7522]] thy people: [[H5971]] O visit [[H6485]] me with thy salvation; [[H3444]]

### 5
That I may see [[H7200]] the good [[H2896]] of thy chosen, [[H972]] that I may rejoice [[H8055]] in the gladness [[H8057]] of thy nation, [[H1471]] that I may glory [[H1984]] with [[H5973]] thine inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 6
We have sinned [[H2398]] with [[H5973]] our fathers, [[H1]] we have committed iniquity, [[H5753]] we have done wickedly. [[H7561]]

### 7
Our fathers [[H1]] understood [[H7919]] not [[H3808]] thy wonders [[H6381]] in Egypt; [[H4714]] they remembered [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] the multitude [[H7230]] of thy mercies; [[H2617]] but provoked [[H4784]] at [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] at the Red [[H5488]] sea. [[H3220]]

### 8
Nevertheless he saved [[H3467]] them for his name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]]  that he might make [[H853]] his mighty power [[H1369]] to be known. [[H3045]]

### 9
He rebuked [[H1605]] the Red [[H5488]] sea [[H3220]] also, and it was dried up: [[H2717]] so he led [[H1980]] them through the depths, [[H8415]] as through the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 10
And he saved [[H3467]] them from the hand [[H3027]] of him that hated [[H8130]] and redeemed [[H1350]] them from the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy. [[H341]]

### 11
And the waters [[H4325]] covered [[H3680]] their enemies: [[H6862]] there was not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of them left. [[H3498]]

### 12
Then believed [[H539]] they his words; [[H1697]] they sang [[H7891]] his praise. [[H8416]]

### 13
They soon [[H4116]] forgat [[H7911]] his works; [[H4639]] they waited [[H2442]] not [[H3808]] for his counsel: [[H6098]]

### 14
But lusted [[H183]] exceedingly [[H8378]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and tempted [[H5254]] God [[H410]] in the desert. [[H3452]]

### 15
And he gave [[H5414]] them their request; [[H7596]] but sent [[H7971]] leanness [[H7332]] into their soul. [[H5315]]

### 16
They envied [[H7065]] Moses [[H4872]] also in the camp, [[H4264]] Aaron [[H175]] the saint [[H6918]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
The earth [[H776]] opened [[H6605]] and swallowed up [[H1104]] Dathan, [[H1885]] and covered [[H3680]] the company [[H5712]] of Abiram. [[H48]]

### 18
And a fire [[H784]] was kindled [[H1197]] in their company; [[H5712]] the flame [[H3852]] burned up [[H3857]] the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 19
They made [[H6213]] a calf [[H5695]] in Horeb, [[H2722]] and worshipped [[H7812]] the molten image. [[H4541]]

### 20
Thus they changed [[H4171]] their glory [[H3519]] into the similitude [[H8403]] of an ox [[H7794]] that eateth [[H398]] grass. [[H6212]]

### 21
They forgat [[H7911]] God [[H410]] their saviour, [[H3467]] which had done [[H6213]] great things [[H1419]] in Egypt; [[H4714]]

### 22
Wondrous works [[H6381]] in the land [[H776]] of Ham, [[H2526]] terrible things [[H3372]] by [[H5921]] the Red [[H5488]] sea. [[H3220]]

### 23
Therefore he said [[H559]] that he would destroy [[H8045]] them, had not [[H3884]] Moses [[H4872]] his chosen [[H972]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] him in the breach, [[H6556]] to turn away [[H7725]] his wrath, [[H2534]] lest he should destroy [[H7843]]

### 24
Yea, they despised [[H3988]] the pleasant [[H2532]] land, [[H776]] they believed [[H539]] not [[H3808]] his word: [[H1697]]

### 25
But murmured [[H7279]] in their tents, [[H168]] hearkened [[H8085]] not [[H3808]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 26
Therefore he lifted up [[H5375]] his hand [[H3027]] against them, to overthrow [[H5307]] them in the wilderness: [[H4057]]

### 27
To overthrow [[H5307]] their seed [[H2233]] also among the nations, [[H1471]] and to scatter [[H2219]] them in the lands. [[H776]]

### 28
They joined themselves [[H6775]] also unto Baal-peor, [[H1187]] and ate [[H398]] the sacrifices [[H2077]] of the dead. [[H4191]]

### 29
Thus they provoked to anger [[H3707]] with their inventions: [[H4611]] and the plague [[H4046]] brake in [[H6555]] upon them. [[H6555]]

### 30
Then stood up [[H5975]] Phinehas, [[H6372]] and executed judgment: [[H6419]] and the plague [[H4046]] was stayed. [[H6113]]

### 31
And that was counted [[H2803]] unto him for righteousness [[H6666]] unto all [[H1755]] generations [[H1755]] for [[H5704]] evermore. [[H5769]]

### 32
They angered [[H7107]] also at [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of strife, [[H4808]] so that it went ill [[H3415]] with Moses [[H4872]] for their sakes: [[H4872]]

### 33
Because [[H3588]] they provoked [[H4784]] his spirit, [[H7307]] so that he spake unadvisedly [[H981]] with his lips. [[H8193]]

### 34
They did not [[H3808]] destroy [[H8045]] the nations, [[H5971]] concerning whom [[H834]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H559]] them: [[H559]]

### 35
But were mingled [[H6148]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] and learned [[H3925]] their works. [[H4639]]

### 36
And they served [[H5647]] their idols: [[H6091]] which were [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] unto them. [[H4170]]

### 37
Yea, they sacrificed [[H2076]] their sons [[H1121]] and their daughters [[H1323]] unto devils, [[H7700]]

### 38
And shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]] the blood [[H1818]] of their sons [[H1121]] and of their daughters, [[H1323]] whom [[H834]] they sacrificed [[H2076]] unto the idols [[H6091]] of Canaan: [[H3667]] and the land [[H776]] was polluted [[H2610]] with blood. [[H1818]]

### 39
Thus were they defiled [[H2930]] with their own works, [[H4639]] and went a whoring [[H2181]] with their own inventions. [[H4611]]

### 40
Therefore was the wrath [[H639]] of the Lord [[H3068]] kindled [[H2734]] against his people, [[H5971]] insomuch that he abhorred [[H8581]] his own inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 41
And he gave [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of the heathen; [[H1471]] and they that hated [[H8130]] them ruled [[H4910]] over them. [[H4910]]

### 42
Their enemies [[H341]] also oppressed [[H3905]] them, and they were brought into subjection [[H3665]] under [[H8478]] their hand. [[H3027]]

### 43
Many [[H7227]] times [[H6471]] did he deliver [[H5337]] them; but they [[H1992]] provoked [[H4784]] with their counsel, [[H6098]] and were brought low [[H4355]] for their iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 44
Nevertheless he regarded [[H7200]] their affliction, [[H6862]] when he heard [[H8085]] their cry: [[H7440]]

### 45
And he remembered [[H2142]] for them his covenant, [[H1285]] and repented [[H5162]] according to the multitude [[H7230]] of his mercies. [[H2617]]

### 46
He made [[H5414]] them also to be pitied [[H7356]] of [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] those that carried them captives. [[H7617]]

### 47
Save [[H3467]] us, O Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and gather [[H6908]] us from among [[H4480]] the heathen, [[H1471]] to give thanks [[H3034]] unto thy holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] to triumph [[H7623]] in thy praise. [[H8416]]

### 48
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] from [[H4480]] everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting: [[H5769]] and let all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] Amen. [[H543]] Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord. [[H3050]]
