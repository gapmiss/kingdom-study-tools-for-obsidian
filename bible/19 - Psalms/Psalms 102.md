A Prayer [[H8605]] of the afflicted, [[H6041]] when [[H3588]] he is overwhelmed, [[H5848]] and poureth out [[H8210]] his complaint [[H7879]] before [[H6440]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] my prayer, [[H8605]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and my cry [[H7775]] let come [[H935]] unto thee. [[H413]]

### 2
Hide [[H5641]] not [[H408]] thy face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] me in the day [[H3117]] I am in trouble; [[H6862]] incline [[H5186]] thine ear [[H241]] unto [[H413]] me: in the day [[H3117]] I call [[H7121]] answer [[H6030]] me speedily. [[H4118]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] my days [[H3117]] are consumed [[H3615]] like smoke, [[H6227]] and my bones [[H6106]] are burned [[H2787]] as [[H4168]] an hearth. [[H4168]]

### 4
My heart [[H3820]] is smitten, [[H5221]] and withered [[H3001]] like grass; [[H6212]] so [[H3588]] that I forget [[H7911]] to eat [[H398]] my bread. [[H3899]]

### 5
By reason of the voice [[H6963]] of my groaning [[H585]] my bones [[H6106]] cleave [[H1692]] to my skin. [[H1320]]

### 6
I am like [[H1819]] a pelican [[H6893]] of the wilderness: [[H4057]] I am [[H1961]] like an owl [[H3563]] of the desert. [[H2723]]

### 7
I watch, [[H8245]] and am [[H1961]] as a sparrow [[H6833]] alone [[H909]] upon [[H5921]] the house top. [[H1406]]

### 8
Mine enemies [[H341]] reproach [[H2778]] me all [[H3605]] the day; [[H3117]] they that are mad [[H1984]] against me are sworn [[H7650]] against me. [[H7650]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] I have eaten [[H398]] ashes [[H665]] like bread, [[H3899]] and mingled [[H4537]] my drink [[H8249]] with weeping, [[H1065]]

### 10
Because [[H6440]] of thine indignation [[H2195]] and thy wrath: [[H7110]] for [[H3588]] thou hast lifted me up, [[H5375]] and cast me down. [[H7993]]

### 11
My days [[H3117]] like a shadow [[H6738]] that declineth; [[H5186]] and I [[H589]] am withered [[H3001]] like grass. [[H6212]]

### 12
But thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] shalt endure [[H3427]] for ever; [[H5769]] and thy remembrance [[H2143]] unto all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 13
Thou [[H859]] shalt arise, [[H6965]] have mercy upon [[H7355]] Zion: [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] the time [[H6256]] to favour [[H2603]] her, yea, [[H3588]] the set time, [[H4150]] is come. [[H935]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] thy servants [[H5650]] take pleasure in [[H7521]] her stones, [[H68]] and favour [[H2603]] the dust [[H6083]] thereof. [[H6083]]

### 15
So the heathen [[H1471]] shall fear [[H3372]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] thy glory. [[H3519]]

### 16
When [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall build up [[H1129]] Zion, [[H6726]] he shall appear [[H7200]] in his glory. [[H3519]]

### 17
He will regard [[H6437]] the prayer [[H8605]] of the destitute, [[H6199]] and not [[H3808]] despise [[H959]] their prayer. [[H8605]]

### 18
This [[H2063]] shall be written [[H3789]] for the generation [[H1755]] to come: [[H314]] and the people [[H5971]] which shall be created [[H1254]] shall praise [[H1984]] the Lord. [[H3050]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] he hath looked down [[H8259]] from the height [[H4791]] of his sanctuary; [[H6944]] from heaven [[H8064]] did the Lord [[H3068]] behold [[H5027]] the earth; [[H776]]

### 20
To hear [[H8085]] the groaning [[H603]] of the prisoner; [[H615]] to loose [[H6605]] those that are appointed [[H1121]] to death; [[H8546]]

### 21
To declare [[H5608]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in Zion, [[H6726]] and his praise [[H8416]] in Jerusalem; [[H3389]]

### 22
When the people [[H5971]] are gathered [[H6908]] together, [[H3162]] and the kingdoms, [[H4467]] to serve [[H5647]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 23
He weakened [[H6031]] my strength [[H3581]] in the way; [[H1870]] he shortened [[H7114]] my days. [[H3117]]

### 24
I said, [[H559]] O my God, [[H410]] take away [[H5927]] me not [[H408]] in the midst [[H2677]] of my days: [[H3117]] thy years [[H8141]] throughout all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 25
Of old [[H6440]] hast thou laid the foundation [[H3245]] of the earth: [[H776]] and the heavens [[H8064]] the work [[H4639]] of thy hands. [[H3027]]

### 26
They [[H1992]] shall perish, [[H6]] but thou [[H859]] shalt endure: [[H5975]] yea, all [[H3605]] of them shall wax old [[H1086]] like a garment; [[H899]] as a vesture [[H3830]] shalt thou change [[H2498]] them, and they shall be changed: [[H2498]]

### 27
But thou [[H859]] the same, [[H1931]] and thy years [[H8141]] shall have no [[H3808]] end. [[H8552]]

### 28
The children [[H1121]] of thy servants [[H5650]] shall continue, [[H7931]] and their seed [[H2233]] shall be established [[H3559]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]
