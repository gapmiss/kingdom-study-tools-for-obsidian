### 1
Bless [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O my soul. [[H5315]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] thou art very [[H3966]] great; [[H1431]] thou art clothed [[H3847]] with honour [[H1935]] and majesty. [[H1926]]

### 2
Who coverest [[H5844]] with light [[H216]] as a garment: [[H8008]] who stretchest out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] like a curtain: [[H3407]]

### 3
Who layeth the beams [[H7136]] of his chambers [[H5944]] in the waters: [[H4325]] who maketh [[H7760]] the clouds [[H5645]] his chariot: [[H7398]] who walketh [[H1980]] upon [[H5921]] the wings [[H3671]] of the wind: [[H7307]]

### 4
Who maketh [[H6213]] his angels [[H4397]] spirits; [[H7307]] his ministers [[H8334]] a flaming [[H3857]] fire: [[H784]]

### 5
laid [[H3245]] the foundations [[H4349]] of the earth, [[H776]] it should not [[H1077]] be removed [[H4131]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 6
Thou coveredst [[H3680]] it with the deep [[H8415]] as a garment: [[H3830]] the waters [[H4325]] stood [[H5975]] above [[H5921]] the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 7
At [[H4480]] thy rebuke [[H1606]] they fled; [[H5127]] at [[H4480]] the voice [[H6963]] of thy thunder [[H7482]] they hasted [[H2648]] away. [[H2648]]

### 8
They go up [[H5927]] by the mountains; [[H2022]] they go down [[H3381]] by the valleys [[H1237]] unto [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] which [[H2088]] thou hast founded [[H3245]] for them. [[H3245]]

### 9
Thou hast set [[H7760]] a bound [[H1366]] that they may not [[H1077]] pass over; [[H5674]] that they turn not again [[H7725]] to cover [[H3680]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
He sendeth [[H7971]] the springs [[H4599]] into the valleys, [[H5158]] run [[H1980]] among [[H996]] the hills. [[H2022]]

### 11
They give drink [[H8248]] to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field: [[H7704]] the wild asses [[H6501]] quench [[H7665]] their thirst. [[H6772]]

### 12
By [[H5921]] them shall the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven [[H8064]] have their habitation, [[H7931]] sing [[H5414]] among [[H996]] the branches. [[H6073]]

### 13
He watereth [[H8248]] the hills [[H2022]] from his chambers: [[H5944]] the earth [[H776]] is satisfied [[H7646]] with the fruit [[H6529]] of thy works. [[H4639]]

### 14
He causeth the grass [[H2682]] to grow [[H6779]] for the cattle, [[H929]] and herb [[H6212]] for the service [[H5656]] of man: [[H120]] that he may bring forth [[H3318]] food [[H3899]] out of [[H4480]] the earth; [[H776]]

### 15
And wine [[H3196]] maketh glad [[H8055]] the heart [[H3824]] of man, [[H582]] oil [[H8081]] to make face [[H6440]] to shine, [[H6670]] and bread [[H3899]] strengtheneth [[H5582]] man's [[H582]] heart. [[H3824]]

### 16
The trees [[H6086]] of the Lord [[H3068]] are full [[H7646]] the cedars [[H730]] of Lebanon, [[H3844]] which [[H834]] he hath planted; [[H5193]]

### 17
Where [[H834]] the birds [[H6833]] make their nests: [[H7077]] the stork, [[H2624]] the fir trees [[H1265]] her house. [[H1004]]

### 18
The high [[H1364]] hills [[H2022]] a refuge [[H4268]] for the wild goats; [[H3277]] the rocks [[H5553]] for the conies. [[H8227]]

### 19
He appointed [[H6213]] the moon [[H3394]] for seasons: [[H4150]] the sun [[H8121]] knoweth [[H3045]] his going down. [[H3996]]

### 20
Thou makest [[H7896]] darkness, [[H2822]] and it is [[H1961]] night: [[H3915]] wherein all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the forest [[H3293]] do creep [[H7430]]

### 21
The young lions [[H3715]] roar [[H7580]] after their prey, [[H2964]] and seek [[H1245]] their meat [[H400]] from God. [[H410]]

### 22
The sun [[H8121]] ariseth, [[H2224]] they gather themselves together, [[H622]] and lay them down [[H7257]] in [[H413]] their dens. [[H4585]]

### 23
Man [[H120]] goeth forth [[H3318]] unto his work [[H6467]] and to his labour [[H5656]] until [[H5704]] the evening. [[H6153]]

### 24
O Lord, [[H3068]] how [[H4100]] manifold [[H7231]] are thy works! [[H4639]] in wisdom [[H2451]] hast thou made [[H6213]] them all: [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] is full [[H4390]] of thy riches. [[H7075]]

### 25
this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] and wide [[H7342]] sea, [[H3220]] wherein [[H8033]] things creeping [[H7431]] innumerable, [[H4557]] both small [[H6996]] and [[H5973]] great [[H1419]] beasts. [[H2416]]

### 26
There [[H8033]] go [[H1980]] the ships: [[H591]] that leviathan, [[H3882]] thou [[H2088]] hast made [[H3335]] to play [[H7832]] therein. [[H7832]]

### 27
These wait [[H7663]] all [[H3605]] upon [[H413]] thee; that thou mayest give [[H5414]] their meat [[H400]] in due season. [[H6256]]

### 28
thou givest [[H5414]] them they gather: [[H3950]] thou openest [[H6605]] thine hand, [[H3027]] they are filled [[H7646]] with good. [[H2896]]

### 29
Thou hidest [[H5641]] thy face, [[H6440]] they are troubled: [[H926]] thou takest away [[H622]] their breath, [[H7307]] they die, [[H1478]] and return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] their dust. [[H6083]]

### 30
Thou sendest forth [[H7971]] thy spirit, [[H7307]] they are created: [[H1254]] and thou renewest [[H2318]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 31
The glory [[H3519]] of the Lord [[H3068]] shall endure [[H1961]] for ever: [[H5769]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall rejoice [[H8055]] in his works. [[H4639]]

### 32
He looketh [[H5027]] on the earth, [[H776]] and it trembleth: [[H7460]] he toucheth [[H5060]] the hills, [[H2022]] and they smoke. [[H6225]]

### 33
I will sing [[H7891]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] as long as I live: [[H2416]] I will sing praise [[H2167]] to my God [[H430]] while I have my being. [[H5750]]

### 34
My meditation [[H7879]] of [[H5921]] him shall be sweet: [[H6149]] I [[H595]] will be glad [[H8055]] in the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 35
Let the sinners [[H2400]] be consumed [[H8552]] out of [[H4480]] the earth, [[H776]] and let the wicked [[H7563]] be no [[H369]] more. [[H5750]] Bless [[H1288]]  thou [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O my soul. [[H5315]] Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord. [[H3050]]
