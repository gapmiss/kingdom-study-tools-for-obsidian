[[Psalms 41|←]] • [[Psalms 43|→]]

---

To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] Maschil, [[H4905]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]]

### 1
As the hart [[H354]] panteth [[H6165]] after [[H5921]] the water [[H4325]] brooks, [[H650]] so [[H3651]] panteth [[H6165]] my soul [[H5315]] after [[H413]] thee, O God. [[H430]]

### 2
My soul [[H5315]] thirsteth [[H6770]] for God, [[H430]] for the living [[H2416]] God: [[H410]] when [[H4970]] shall I come [[H935]] and appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] God? [[H430]]

### 3
My tears [[H1832]] have been [[H1961]] my meat [[H3899]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] while they continually [[H3117]] say [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Where [[H346]] thy God? [[H430]]

### 4
When I remember [[H2142]] these [[H428]] I pour out [[H8210]] my soul [[H5315]] in [[H5921]] me: for [[H3588]] I had gone [[H5674]] with the multitude, [[H5519]] I went [[H1718]] with them to [[H5704]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] with the voice [[H6963]] of joy [[H7440]] and praise, [[H8426]] with a multitude [[H1995]] that kept holyday. [[H2287]]

### 5
Why [[H4100]] art thou cast down, [[H7817]] O my soul? [[H5315]] and art thou disquieted [[H1993]] in [[H5921]] me? hope [[H3176]] thou in God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] I shall yet [[H5750]] praise [[H3034]] him the help [[H3444]] of his countenance. [[H6440]]

### 6
O my God, [[H430]] my soul [[H5315]] is cast down [[H7817]] within [[H5921]] me: therefore [[H5921]] will I remember [[H2142]] thee from the land [[H776]] of Jordan, [[H3383]] and of the Hermonites, [[H2769]] from the hill [[H2022]] Mizar. [[H4706]]

### 7
Deep [[H8415]] calleth [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] deep [[H8415]] at the noise [[H6963]] of thy waterspouts: [[H6794]] all [[H3605]] thy waves [[H4867]] and thy billows [[H1530]] are gone [[H5674]] over [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 8
the Lord [[H3068]] will command [[H6680]] his lovingkindness [[H2617]] in the daytime, [[H3119]] and in the night [[H3915]] his song [[H7892]] with [[H5973]] me, my prayer [[H8605]] unto the God [[H410]] of my life. [[H2416]]

### 9
I will say [[H559]] unto God [[H410]] my rock, [[H5553]] Why [[H4100]] hast thou forgotten [[H7911]] me? why [[H4100]] go [[H1980]] I mourning [[H6937]] because of the oppression [[H3906]] of the enemy? [[H341]]

### 10
with a sword [[H7524]] in my bones, [[H6106]] mine enemies [[H6887]] reproach [[H2778]] me; while they say [[H559]] daily [[H3117]] unto [[H413]] me, Where [[H346]] thy God? [[H430]]

### 11
Why [[H4100]] art thou cast down, [[H7817]] O my soul? [[H5315]] and why [[H4100]] art thou disquieted [[H1993]] within [[H5921]] me? hope [[H3176]] thou in God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] I shall yet [[H5750]] praise [[H3034]] him, the health [[H3444]] of my countenance, [[H6440]] and my God. [[H430]]
