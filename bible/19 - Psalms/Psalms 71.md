### 1
In thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] do I put my trust: [[H2620]] let me never [[H408]] be put to confusion. [[H954]]

### 2
Deliver [[H5337]] me in thy righteousness, [[H6666]] and cause me to escape: [[H6403]] incline [[H5186]] thine ear [[H241]] unto [[H413]] me, and save [[H3467]] me. [[H3467]]

### 3
Be [[H1961]] thou my strong [[H6697]] habitation, [[H4583]] whereunto I may continually [[H8548]] resort: [[H935]] thou hast given commandment [[H6680]] to save [[H3467]] me; for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my rock [[H5553]] and my fortress. [[H4686]]

### 4
Deliver [[H6403]] me, O my God, [[H430]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] out of the hand [[H3709]] of the unrighteous [[H5765]] and cruel man. [[H2556]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my hope, [[H8615]] O Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3068]] my trust [[H4009]] from my youth. [[H5271]]

### 6
By [[H5921]] thee have I been holden up [[H5564]] from the womb: [[H990]] thou [[H859]] art he that took [[H1491]] me out of my mother's [[H517]] bowels: [[H4578]] my praise [[H8416]] continually [[H8548]] of thee. [[H8548]]

### 7
I am [[H1961]] as a wonder [[H4159]] unto many; [[H7227]] but thou [[H859]] my strong [[H5797]] refuge. [[H4268]]

### 8
Let my mouth [[H6310]] be filled [[H4390]] thy praise [[H8416]] thy honour [[H8597]] all [[H3605]] the day. [[H3117]]

### 9
Cast me not off [[H7993]] in the time [[H6256]] of old age; [[H2209]] forsake [[H5800]] me not [[H408]] when my strength [[H3581]] faileth. [[H3615]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] mine enemies [[H341]] speak [[H559]] against me; and they that lay wait for [[H8104]] my soul [[H5315]] take counsel [[H3289]] together, [[H3162]]

### 11
Saying, [[H559]] God [[H430]] hath forsaken [[H5800]] him: persecute [[H7291]] and take [[H8610]] him; for [[H3588]] none [[H369]] to deliver [[H5337]]

### 12
O God, [[H430]] be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me: O my God, [[H430]] make haste [[H2363]] for my help. [[H5833]]

### 13
Let them be confounded [[H954]] consumed [[H3615]] that are adversaries [[H7853]] to my soul; [[H5315]] let them be covered [[H5844]] reproach [[H2781]] and dishonour [[H3639]] that seek [[H1245]] my hurt. [[H7451]]

### 14
But I [[H589]] will hope [[H3176]] continually, [[H8548]] and will yet praise [[H8416]] thee more and more. [[H3254]]

### 15
My mouth [[H6310]] shall shew forth [[H5608]] thy righteousness [[H6666]] thy salvation [[H8668]] all [[H3605]] the day; [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] the numbers [[H5615]]

### 16
I will go in [[H935]] the strength [[H1369]] of the Lord [[H136]] God: [[H3069]] I will make mention [[H2142]] of thy righteousness, [[H6666]] of thine only. [[H6666]]

### 17
O God, [[H430]] thou hast taught [[H3925]] me from my youth: [[H5271]] and hitherto [[H5704]] have I declared [[H5046]] thy wondrous works. [[H6381]]

### 18
Now also [[H1571]] when [[H5704]] I am old [[H2209]] and grayheaded, [[H7872]] O God, [[H430]] forsake [[H5800]] me not; [[H408]] until [[H5704]] I have shewed [[H5046]] thy strength [[H2220]] unto generation, [[H1755]] thy power [[H1369]] to every one [[H3605]] is to come. [[H935]]

### 19
Thy righteousness [[H6666]] also, O God, [[H430]] very [[H5704]] high, [[H4791]] who [[H834]] hast done [[H6213]] great things: [[H1419]] O God, [[H430]] who [[H4310]] like unto thee! [[H4310]]

### 20
which [[H834]] hast shewed [[H7200]] me great [[H7227]] and sore [[H7451]] troubles, [[H6869]] shalt quicken [[H2421]] me again, [[H7725]] and shalt bring me up [[H5927]] again [[H7725]] from the depths [[H8415]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 21
Thou shalt increase [[H7235]] my greatness, [[H1420]] and comfort [[H5162]] me on every side. [[H5437]]

### 22
I [[H589]] will also [[H1571]] praise [[H3034]] thee with the psaltery, [[H3627]] thy truth, [[H571]] O my God: [[H430]] unto thee will I sing [[H2167]] with the harp, [[H3658]] O thou Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 23
My lips [[H8193]] shall greatly rejoice [[H7442]] when [[H3588]] I sing [[H2167]] unto thee; and my soul, [[H5315]] which [[H834]] thou hast redeemed. [[H6299]]

### 24
My tongue [[H3956]] also [[H1571]] shall talk [[H1897]] of thy righteousness [[H6666]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long: for [[H3588]] they are confounded, [[H954]] for [[H3588]] they are brought unto shame, [[H2659]] that seek [[H1245]] my hurt. [[H7451]]
