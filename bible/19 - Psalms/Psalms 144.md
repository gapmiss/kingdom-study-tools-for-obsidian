of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] my strength, [[H6697]] which teacheth [[H3925]] my hands [[H3027]] to war, [[H7128]] my fingers [[H676]] to fight: [[H4421]]

### 2
My goodness, [[H2617]] and my fortress; [[H4686]] my high tower, [[H4869]] and my deliverer; [[H6403]] my shield, [[H4043]] and in whom I trust; [[H2620]] who subdueth [[H7286]] my people [[H5971]] under [[H8478]] me. [[H8478]]

### 3
Lord, [[H3068]] what [[H4100]] man, [[H120]] that thou takest knowledge [[H3045]] of him! the son [[H1121]] of man, [[H376]] that thou makest account [[H2803]] of him! [[H2803]]

### 4
Man [[H120]] is like [[H1819]] to vanity: [[H1892]] his days [[H3117]] as a shadow [[H6738]] that passeth away. [[H5674]]

### 5
Bow [[H5186]] thy heavens, [[H8064]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and come down: [[H3381]] touch [[H5060]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and they shall smoke. [[H6225]]

### 6
Cast forth [[H1299]] lightning, [[H1300]] and scatter [[H6327]] them: shoot out [[H7971]] thine arrows, [[H2671]] and destroy [[H2000]] them. [[H2000]]

### 7
Send [[H7971]] thine hand [[H3027]] from above; [[H4791]] rid [[H6475]] me, and deliver [[H5337]] me out of great [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] from the hand [[H3027]] of strange [[H5236]] children; [[H1121]]

### 8
Whose [[H834]] mouth [[H6310]] speaketh [[H1696]] vanity, [[H7723]] and their right hand [[H3225]] a right hand [[H3225]] of falsehood. [[H8267]]

### 9
I will sing [[H7891]] a new [[H2319]] song [[H7892]] unto thee, O God: [[H430]] upon a psaltery [[H5035]] an instrument of ten strings [[H6218]] will I sing praises [[H2167]] unto thee. [[H2167]]

### 10
that giveth [[H5414]] salvation [[H8668]] unto kings: [[H4428]] who delivereth [[H6475]] David [[H1732]] his servant [[H5650]] from the hurtful [[H7451]] sword. [[H2719]]

### 11
Rid [[H6475]] me, and deliver [[H5337]] me from the hand [[H3027]] of strange [[H5236]] children, [[H1121]] whose [[H834]] mouth [[H6310]] speaketh [[H1696]] vanity, [[H7723]] and their right hand [[H3225]] a right hand [[H3225]] of falsehood: [[H8267]]

### 12
That [[H834]] our sons [[H1121]] as plants [[H5195]] grown up [[H1431]] in their youth; [[H5271]] our daughters [[H1323]] as corner stones, [[H2106]] polished [[H2404]] the similitude [[H8403]] of a palace: [[H1964]]

### 13
our garners [[H4200]] full, [[H4392]] affording [[H6329]] all manner of store: [[H2177]] our sheep [[H6629]] may bring forth thousands [[H503]] and ten thousands [[H7231]] in our streets: [[H2351]]

### 14
our oxen [[H441]] strong to labour; [[H5445]] no [[H369]] breaking in, [[H6556]] nor [[H369]] going out; [[H3318]] that no [[H369]] complaining [[H6682]] in our streets. [[H7339]]

### 15
Happy [[H835]] people, [[H5971]] that is in such a case: [[H3602]] happy [[H835]] people, [[H5971]] whose God [[H430]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
