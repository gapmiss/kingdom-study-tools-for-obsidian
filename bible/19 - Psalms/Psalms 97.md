### 1
The Lord [[H3068]] reigneth; [[H4427]] let the earth [[H776]] rejoice; [[H1523]] let the multitude [[H7227]] of isles [[H339]] be glad [[H8055]]

### 2
Clouds [[H6051]] and darkness [[H6205]] round about [[H5439]] him: righteousness [[H6664]] and judgment [[H4941]] the habitation [[H4349]] of his throne. [[H3678]]

### 3
A fire [[H784]] goeth [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] him, and burneth up [[H3857]] his enemies [[H6862]] round about. [[H5439]]

### 4
His lightnings [[H1300]] enlightened [[H215]] the world: [[H8398]] the earth [[H776]] saw, [[H7200]] and trembled. [[H2342]]

### 5
The hills [[H2022]] melted [[H4549]] like wax [[H1749]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord [[H113]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]]

### 6
The heavens [[H8064]] declare [[H5046]] his righteousness, [[H6664]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] see [[H7200]] his glory. [[H3519]]

### 7
Confounded [[H954]] be all [[H3605]] they that serve [[H5647]] graven images, [[H6459]] that boast themselves [[H1984]] of idols: [[H457]] worship [[H7812]] him, all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]]

### 8
Zion [[H6726]] heard, [[H8085]] and was glad; [[H8055]] and the daughters [[H1323]] of Judah [[H3063]] rejoiced [[H1523]] because of [[H4616]] thy judgments, [[H4941]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H3068]] high above [[H5945]] all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] thou art exalted [[H5927]] far above [[H3966]] all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]]

### 10
Ye that love [[H157]] the Lord, [[H3068]] hate [[H8130]] evil: [[H7451]] he preserveth [[H8104]] the souls [[H5315]] of his saints; [[H2623]] he delivereth [[H5337]] them out of the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 11
Light [[H216]] is sown [[H2232]] for the righteous, [[H6662]] and gladness [[H8057]] for the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]

### 12
Rejoice [[H8055]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] ye righteous; [[H6662]] and give thanks [[H3034]] at the remembrance [[H2143]] of his holiness. [[H6944]]
