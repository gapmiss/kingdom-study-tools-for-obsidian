A Psalm [[H4210]] of David, [[H1732]] when he fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] Absalom [[H53]] his son. [[H1121]]

### 1
Lord, [[H3068]] how [[H4100]] are they increased [[H7231]] that trouble [[H6862]] me! many [[H7227]] they that rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 2
Many [[H7227]] which say [[H559]] of my soul, [[H5315]] no [[H369]] help [[H3444]] for him in God. [[H430]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 3
But thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] a shield [[H4043]] for [[H1157]] me; my glory, [[H3519]] and the lifter up [[H7311]] of mine head. [[H7218]]

### 4
I cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] with my voice, [[H6963]] and he heard [[H6030]] me out of his holy [[H6944]] hill. [[H2022]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
I [[H589]] laid me down [[H7901]] and slept; [[H3462]] I awaked; [[H6974]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] sustained [[H5564]] me. [[H5564]]

### 6
I will not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] of ten thousands [[H7233]] of people, [[H5971]] that [[H834]] have set [[H7896]] against [[H5921]] me round about. [[H5439]]

### 7
Arise, [[H6965]] O Lord; [[H3068]] save [[H3467]] me, O my God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] thou hast smitten [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] mine enemies [[H341]] the cheek bone; [[H3895]] thou hast broken [[H7665]] the teeth [[H8127]] of the ungodly. [[H7563]]

### 8
Salvation [[H3444]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] thy blessing [[H1293]] upon [[H5921]] thy people. [[H5971]] Selah. [[H5542]]
