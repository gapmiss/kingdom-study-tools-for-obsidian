### 1
Rejoice [[H7442]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] O ye righteous: [[H6662]] praise [[H8416]] is comely [[H5000]] for the upright. [[H3477]]

### 2
Praise [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] with harp: [[H3658]] sing [[H2167]] unto him with the psaltery [[H5035]] an instrument of ten strings. [[H6218]]

### 3
Sing [[H7891]] unto him a new [[H2319]] song; [[H7892]] play [[H5059]] skilfully [[H3190]] with a loud noise. [[H8643]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] right; [[H3477]] and all [[H3605]] his works [[H4639]] in truth. [[H530]]

### 5
He loveth [[H157]] righteousness [[H6666]] and judgment: [[H4941]] the earth [[H776]] is full [[H4390]] of the goodness [[H2617]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
By the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H3068]] were the heavens [[H8064]] made; [[H6213]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of them by the breath [[H7307]] of his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 7
He gathereth [[H3664]] the waters [[H4325]] of the sea [[H3220]] together as an heap: [[H5067]] he layeth up [[H5414]] the depth [[H8415]] in storehouses. [[H214]]

### 8
Let all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] fear [[H3372]] the Lord: [[H3068]] let all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world [[H8398]] stand in awe [[H1481]] of [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] spake, [[H559]] and it was [[H1961]] he [[H1931]] commanded, [[H6680]] and it stood fast. [[H5975]]

### 10
The Lord [[H3068]] bringeth [[H6331]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the heathen [[H1471]] to nought: he maketh [[H5106]] the devices [[H4284]] of the people [[H5971]] of none effect. [[H5971]]

### 11
The counsel [[H6098]] of the Lord [[H3068]] standeth [[H5975]] for ever, [[H5769]] the thoughts [[H4284]] of his heart [[H3820]] to all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 12
Blessed [[H835]] the nation [[H1471]] whose [[H834]] God [[H430]] the Lord; [[H3068]] the people [[H5971]] he hath chosen [[H977]] for his own inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 13
The Lord [[H3068]] looketh [[H5027]] from heaven; [[H8064]] he beholdeth [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 14
From the place [[H4349]] of his habitation [[H3427]] he looketh [[H7688]] upon [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 15
He fashioneth [[H3335]] their hearts [[H3820]] alike; [[H3162]] he considereth [[H995]] all [[H3605]] their works. [[H4639]]

### 16
There is no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] saved [[H3467]] by the multitude [[H7230]] of an host: [[H2428]] a mighty man [[H1368]] is not [[H3808]] delivered [[H5337]] by much [[H7230]] strength. [[H3581]]

### 17
An horse [[H5483]] a vain thing [[H8267]] for safety: [[H8668]] neither [[H3808]] shall he deliver [[H4422]] by his great [[H7230]] strength. [[H2428]]

### 18
Behold, [[H2009]] the eye [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H413]] them that fear [[H3373]] him, upon them that hope [[H3176]] in his mercy; [[H2617]]

### 19
To deliver [[H5337]] their soul [[H5315]] from death, [[H4194]] and to keep them alive [[H2421]] in famine. [[H7458]]

### 20
Our soul [[H5315]] waiteth [[H2442]] for the Lord: [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] our help [[H5828]] and our shield. [[H4043]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] our heart [[H3820]] shall rejoice [[H8055]] in him, because [[H3588]] we have trusted [[H982]] in his holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]]

### 22
Let thy mercy, [[H2617]] O Lord, [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] us, according as [[H834]] we hope [[H3176]] in thee. [[H3176]]
