### 1
O give thanks [[H3034]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] call [[H7121]] upon his name: [[H8034]] make known [[H3045]] his deeds [[H5949]] among the people. [[H5971]]

### 2
Sing [[H7891]] unto him, sing psalms [[H2167]] unto him: talk [[H7878]] ye of all [[H3605]] his wondrous works. [[H6381]]

### 3
Glory [[H1984]] ye in his holy [[H6944]] name: [[H8034]] let the heart [[H3820]] of them rejoice [[H8055]] that seek [[H1245]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
Seek [[H1875]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and his strength: [[H5797]] seek [[H1245]] his face [[H6440]] evermore. [[H8548]]

### 5
Remember [[H2142]] his marvellous works [[H6381]] that [[H834]] he hath done; [[H6213]] his wonders, [[H4159]] and the judgments [[H4941]] of his mouth; [[H6310]]

### 6
O ye seed [[H2233]] of Abraham [[H85]] his servant, [[H5650]] ye children [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] his chosen. [[H972]]

### 7
He [[H1931]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God: [[H430]] his judgments [[H4941]] in all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
He hath remembered [[H2142]] his covenant [[H1285]] for ever, [[H5769]] the word [[H1697]] he commanded [[H6680]] to a thousand [[H505]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 9
Which [[H834]] he made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] Abraham, [[H85]] and his oath [[H7621]] unto Isaac; [[H3446]]

### 10
And confirmed [[H5975]] the same unto Jacob [[H3290]] for a law, [[H2706]] to Israel [[H3478]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant: [[H1285]]

### 11
Saying, [[H559]] Unto thee will I give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] the lot [[H2256]] of your inheritance: [[H5159]]

### 12
When they were [[H1961]] a few men [[H4962]] in number; [[H4557]] yea, very few, [[H4592]] and strangers [[H1481]] in it. [[H1481]]

### 13
When they went [[H1980]] from one nation [[H1471]] to [[H413]] another, [[H1471]] from kingdom [[H4467]] to [[H413]] another [[H312]] people; [[H5971]]

### 14
He suffered [[H3240]] no [[H3808]] man [[H120]] to do them wrong: [[H6231]] yea, he reproved [[H3198]] kings [[H4428]] for their sakes; [[H4428]]

### 15
Touch [[H5060]] not [[H408]] mine anointed, [[H4899]] and do my prophets [[H5030]] no [[H408]] harm. [[H7489]]

### 16
Moreover he called for [[H7121]] a famine [[H7458]] upon [[H5921]] the land: [[H776]] he brake [[H7665]] the whole [[H3605]] staff [[H4294]] of bread. [[H3899]]

### 17
He sent [[H7971]] a man [[H376]] before [[H6440]] them, Joseph, [[H3130]] was sold [[H4376]] for a servant: [[H5650]]

### 18
Whose feet [[H7272]] they hurt [[H6031]] with fetters: [[H3525]] he [[H5315]] was laid [[H935]] in iron: [[H1270]]

### 19
Until [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] that his word [[H1697]] came: [[H935]] the word [[H565]] of the Lord [[H3068]] tried [[H6884]] him. [[H6884]]

### 20
The king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] and loosed [[H5425]] him; the ruler [[H4910]] of the people, [[H5971]] and let him go free. [[H6605]]

### 21
He made [[H7760]] him lord [[H113]] of his house, [[H1004]] and ruler [[H4910]] of all [[H3605]] his substance: [[H7075]]

### 22
To bind [[H631]] his princes [[H8269]] at his pleasure; [[H5315]] and teach his senators [[H2205]] wisdom. [[H2449]]

### 23
Israel [[H3478]] also came into [[H935]] Egypt; [[H4714]] and Jacob [[H3290]] sojourned [[H1481]] in the land [[H776]] of Ham. [[H2526]]

### 24
And he increased [[H6509]] his people [[H5971]] greatly; [[H3966]] and made them stronger [[H6105]] than their enemies. [[H6862]]

### 25
He turned [[H2015]] their heart [[H3820]] to hate [[H8130]] his people, [[H5971]] to deal subtilly [[H5230]] with his servants. [[H5650]]

### 26
He sent [[H7971]] Moses [[H4872]] his servant; [[H5650]] Aaron [[H175]] whom [[H834]] he had chosen. [[H977]]

### 27
They shewed [[H7760]] his signs [[H226]] among them, and wonders [[H4159]] in the land [[H776]] of Ham. [[H2526]]

### 28
He sent [[H7971]] darkness, [[H2822]] and made it dark; [[H2821]] and they rebelled [[H4784]] not [[H3808]] against his word. [[H1697]]

### 29
He turned [[H2015]] their waters [[H4325]] into blood, [[H1818]] and slew [[H4191]] their fish. [[H1710]]

### 30
Their land [[H776]] brought forth [[H8317]] frogs [[H6854]] in abundance, in the chambers [[H2315]] of their kings. [[H4428]]

### 31
He spake, [[H559]] and there came [[H935]] divers sorts of flies, [[H6157]] lice [[H3654]] in all [[H3605]] their coasts. [[H1366]]

### 32
He gave [[H5414]] them hail [[H1259]] for rain, [[H1653]] flaming [[H3852]] fire [[H784]] in their land. [[H776]]

### 33
He smote [[H5221]] their vines [[H1612]] also and their fig trees; [[H8384]] and brake [[H7665]] the trees [[H6086]] of their coasts. [[H1366]]

### 34
He spake, [[H559]] and the locusts [[H697]] came, [[H935]] and caterpillers, [[H3218]] and that without [[H369]] number, [[H4557]]

### 35
And did eat up [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the herbs [[H6212]] in their land, [[H776]] and devoured [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of their ground. [[H127]]

### 36
He smote [[H5221]] also all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in their land, [[H776]] the chief [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] their strength. [[H202]]

### 37
He brought them forth [[H3318]] also with silver [[H3701]] and gold: [[H2091]] and not [[H369]] one feeble [[H3782]] among their tribes. [[H7626]]

### 38
Egypt [[H4714]] was glad [[H8055]] when they departed: [[H3318]] for [[H3588]] the fear [[H6343]] of them fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H5921]]

### 39
He spread [[H6566]] a cloud [[H6051]] for a covering; [[H4539]] and fire [[H784]] to give light [[H215]] in the night. [[H3915]]

### 40
asked, [[H7592]] and he brought [[H935]] quails, [[H7958]] and satisfied [[H7646]] them with the bread [[H3899]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 41
He opened [[H6605]] the rock, [[H6697]] and the waters [[H4325]] gushed out; [[H2100]] they ran [[H1980]] in the dry places [[H6723]] a river. [[H5104]]

### 42
For [[H3588]] he remembered [[H2142]] his holy [[H6944]] promise, [[H1697]] Abraham [[H85]] his servant. [[H5650]]

### 43
And he brought forth [[H3318]] his people [[H5971]] with joy, [[H8342]] his chosen [[H972]] with gladness: [[H7440]]

### 44
And gave [[H5414]] them the lands [[H776]] of the heathen: [[H1471]] and they inherited [[H3423]] the labour [[H5999]] of the people; [[H3816]]

### 45
That [[H5668]] they might observe [[H8104]] his statutes, [[H2706]] and keep [[H5341]] his laws. [[H8451]] Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord. [[H3050]]
