of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Unto [[H413]] thee will I cry, [[H7121]] O Lord [[H3068]] my rock; [[H6697]] be not [[H408]] silent [[H2790]] to [[H4480]] me: lest, [[H6435]] thou be silent [[H2790]] to [[H4480]] me, I become like [[H4911]] them that go down [[H3381]] into the pit. [[H953]]

### 2
Hear [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of my supplications, [[H8469]] when I cry [[H7768]] unto [[H413]] thee, when I lift up [[H5375]] my hands [[H3027]] toward [[H413]] thy holy [[H6944]] oracle. [[H1687]]

### 3
Draw away [[H4900]] me not [[H408]] with [[H5973]] the wicked, [[H7563]] and with [[H5973]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity, [[H205]] which speak [[H1696]] peace [[H7965]] to [[H5973]] their neighbours, [[H7453]] but mischief [[H7451]] in their hearts. [[H3824]]

### 4
Give [[H5414]] them according to their deeds, [[H6467]] and according to the wickedness [[H7455]] of their endeavours: [[H4611]] give [[H5414]] them after the work [[H4639]] of their hands; [[H3027]] render [[H7725]] to them their desert. [[H1576]]

### 5
Because [[H3588]] they regard [[H995]] not [[H3808]] the works [[H6468]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] nor the operation [[H4639]] of his hands, [[H3027]] he shall destroy [[H2040]] them, and not [[H3808]] build them up. [[H1129]]

### 6
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] he hath heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of my supplications. [[H8469]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] my strength [[H5797]] and my shield; [[H4043]] my heart [[H3820]] trusted [[H982]] in him, and I am helped: [[H5826]] therefore my heart [[H3820]] greatly rejoiceth; [[H5937]] and with my song [[H7892]] will I praise [[H3034]] him. [[H3034]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] their strength, [[H5797]] and he [[H1931]] the saving [[H3444]] strength [[H4581]] of his anointed. [[H4899]]

### 9
Save [[H3467]] thy people, [[H5971]] and bless [[H1288]] thine inheritance: [[H5159]] feed [[H7462]] them also, and lift them up [[H5375]] for ever. [[H5769]]
