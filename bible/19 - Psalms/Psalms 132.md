A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
Lord, [[H3068]] remember [[H2142]] David, [[H1732]] all [[H3605]] his afflictions: [[H6031]]

### 2
How [[H834]] he sware [[H7650]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] vowed [[H5087]] unto the mighty [[H46]] of Jacob; [[H3290]]

### 3
Surely [[H518]] I will not come [[H935]] into the tabernacle [[H168]] of my house, [[H1004]] nor [[H518]] go up [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] my bed; [[H6210]]

### 4
I will not [[H518]] give [[H5414]] sleep [[H8153]] to mine eyes, [[H5869]] slumber [[H8572]] to mine eyelids, [[H6079]]

### 5
Until [[H5704]] I find out [[H4672]] a place [[H4725]] for the Lord, [[H3068]] an habitation [[H4908]] for the mighty [[H46]] of Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 6
Lo, [[H2009]] we heard [[H8085]] of it at Ephratah: [[H672]] we found [[H4672]] it in the fields [[H7704]] of the wood. [[H3293]]

### 7
We will go [[H935]] into his tabernacles: [[H4908]] we will worship [[H7812]] at his footstool. [[H1916]]

### 8
Arise, [[H6965]] O Lord, [[H3068]] into thy rest; [[H4496]] thou, [[H859]] and the ark [[H727]] of thy strength. [[H5797]]

### 9
Let thy priests [[H3548]] be clothed [[H3847]] with righteousness; [[H6664]] and let thy saints [[H2623]] shout for joy. [[H7442]]

### 10
For thy servant [[H5650]] David's [[H1732]] sake [[H5668]] turn not away [[H7725]] the face [[H6440]] of thine anointed. [[H4899]]

### 11
The Lord [[H3068]] hath sworn [[H7650]] truth [[H571]] unto David; [[H1732]] he will not [[H3808]] turn [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] it; Of the fruit [[H6529]] of thy body [[H990]] will I set [[H7896]] upon thy throne. [[H3678]]

### 12
If [[H518]] thy children [[H1121]] will keep [[H8104]] my covenant [[H1285]] and my testimony [[H5713]] that [[H2090]] I shall teach [[H3925]] them, their children [[H1121]] shall also [[H1571]] sit [[H3427]] upon thy throne [[H3678]] for evermore. [[H5703]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath chosen [[H977]] Zion; [[H6726]] he hath desired [[H183]] for his habitation. [[H4186]]

### 14
This [[H2063]] my rest [[H4496]] for ever: [[H5703]] here [[H6311]] will I dwell; [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] I have desired [[H183]] it. [[H183]]

### 15
I will abundantly [[H1288]] bless [[H1288]] her provision: [[H6718]] I will satisfy [[H7646]] her poor [[H34]] with bread. [[H3899]]

### 16
I will also clothe [[H3847]] her priests [[H3548]] with salvation: [[H3468]] and her saints [[H2623]] shall shout aloud [[H7442]] for joy. [[H7442]]

### 17
There [[H8033]] will I make the horn [[H7161]] of David [[H1732]] to bud: [[H6779]] I have ordained [[H6186]] a lamp [[H5216]] for mine anointed. [[H4899]]

### 18
His enemies [[H341]] will I clothe [[H3847]] with shame: [[H1322]] but upon [[H5921]] himself shall his crown [[H5145]] flourish. [[H6692]]
