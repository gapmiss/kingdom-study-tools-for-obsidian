A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
God [[H430]] standeth [[H5324]] in the congregation [[H5712]] of the mighty; [[H410]] he judgeth [[H8199]] among [[H7130]] the gods. [[H430]]

### 2
How long [[H5704]] will ye judge [[H8199]] unjustly, [[H5766]] and accept [[H5375]] the persons [[H6440]] of the wicked? [[H7563]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 3
Defend [[H8199]] the poor [[H1800]] and fatherless: [[H3490]] do justice [[H6663]] to the afflicted [[H6041]] and needy. [[H7326]]

### 4
Deliver [[H6403]] the poor [[H1800]] and needy: [[H34]] rid [[H5337]] out of the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 5
They know [[H3045]] not, [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] will they understand; [[H995]] they walk on [[H1980]] in darkness: [[H2825]] all [[H3605]] the foundations [[H4144]] of the earth [[H776]] are out of course. [[H4131]]

### 6
I [[H589]] have said, [[H559]] Ye gods; [[H430]] and all [[H3605]] of you [[H859]] children [[H1121]] of the most High. [[H5945]]

### 7
But [[H403]] ye shall die [[H4191]] like men, [[H120]] and fall [[H5307]] like one [[H259]] of the princes. [[H8269]]

### 8
Arise, [[H6965]] O God, [[H430]] judge [[H8199]] the earth: [[H776]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] shalt inherit [[H5157]] all [[H3605]] nations. [[H1471]]
