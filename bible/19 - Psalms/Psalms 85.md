To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]]

### 1
Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast been favourable [[H7521]] unto thy land: [[H776]] thou hast brought back [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 2
Thou hast forgiven [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of thy people, [[H5971]] thou hast covered [[H3680]] all [[H3605]] their sin. [[H2403]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 3
Thou hast taken away [[H622]] all [[H3605]] thy wrath: [[H5678]] thou hast turned [[H7725]] from the fierceness [[H2740]] of thine anger. [[H639]]

### 4
Turn [[H7725]] us, O God [[H430]] of our salvation, [[H3468]] and cause thine anger [[H3708]] toward [[H5973]] us to cease. [[H6565]]

### 5
Wilt thou be angry [[H599]] with us for ever? [[H5769]] wilt thou draw out [[H4900]] thine anger [[H639]] to all [[H1755]] generations? [[H1755]]

### 6
Wilt thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] revive [[H2421]] us again: [[H7725]] that thy people [[H5971]] may rejoice [[H8055]] in thee? [[H8055]]

### 7
Shew [[H7200]] us thy mercy, [[H2617]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and grant [[H5414]] us thy salvation. [[H3468]]

### 8
I will hear [[H8085]] what [[H4100]] God [[H410]] the Lord [[H3068]] will speak: [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] he will speak [[H1696]] peace [[H7965]] unto [[H413]] his people, [[H5971]] and to [[H413]] his saints: [[H2623]] but let them not [[H408]] turn again [[H7725]] to folly. [[H3690]]

### 9
Surely [[H389]] his salvation [[H3468]] nigh [[H7138]] them that fear [[H3373]] him; that glory [[H3519]] may dwell [[H7931]] in our land. [[H776]]

### 10
Mercy [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] are met together; [[H6298]] righteousness [[H6664]] and peace [[H7965]] have kissed [[H5401]]

### 11
Truth [[H571]] shall spring out [[H6779]] of the earth; [[H776]] and righteousness [[H6664]] shall look down [[H8259]] from heaven. [[H8064]]

### 12
Yea, [[H1571]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall give [[H5414]] good; [[H2896]] and our land [[H776]] shall yield [[H5414]] her increase. [[H2981]]

### 13
Righteousness [[H6664]] shall go [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] him; and shall set [[H7760]] in the way [[H1870]] of his steps. [[H6471]]
