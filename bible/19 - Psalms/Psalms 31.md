To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
In thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] do I put my trust; [[H2620]] let me never [[H408]] be ashamed: [[H954]] deliver [[H6403]] me in thy righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 2
Bow down [[H5186]] thine ear [[H241]] to [[H413]] me; deliver [[H5337]] me speedily: [[H4120]] be [[H1961]] thou my strong [[H4581]] rock, [[H6697]] for an house [[H1004]] of defence [[H4686]] to save [[H3467]] me. [[H3467]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my rock [[H5553]] and my fortress; [[H4686]] therefore for thy name's [[H8034]] sake [[H4616]] lead [[H5148]] me, and guide [[H5095]] me. [[H5095]]

### 4
Pull me out [[H3318]] of the net [[H7568]] that [[H2098]] they have laid privily [[H2934]] for me: for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my strength. [[H4581]]

### 5
Into thine hand [[H3027]] I commit [[H6485]] my spirit: [[H7307]] thou hast redeemed [[H6299]] me, O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H410]] of truth. [[H571]]

### 6
I have hated [[H8130]] them that regard [[H8104]] lying [[H7723]] vanities: [[H1892]] but I [[H589]] trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
I will be glad [[H1523]] and rejoice [[H8055]] in thy mercy: [[H2617]] for [[H834]] thou hast considered [[H7200]] my trouble; [[H6040]] thou hast known [[H3045]] my soul [[H5315]] in adversities; [[H6869]]

### 8
And hast not [[H3808]] shut me up [[H5462]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy: [[H341]] thou hast set [[H5975]] my feet [[H7272]] in a large room. [[H4800]]

### 9
Have mercy [[H2603]] upon me, O Lord, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I am in trouble: [[H6887]] mine eye [[H5869]] is consumed [[H6244]] with grief, [[H3708]] my soul [[H5315]] and my belly. [[H990]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] my life [[H2416]] is spent [[H3615]] with grief, [[H3015]] and my years [[H8141]] with sighing: [[H585]] my strength [[H3581]] faileth [[H3782]] because of mine iniquity, [[H5771]] and my bones [[H6106]] are consumed. [[H6244]]

### 11
I was [[H1961]] a reproach [[H2781]] among all [[H3605]] mine enemies, [[H6887]] but especially [[H3966]] among my neighbours, [[H7934]] and a fear [[H6343]] to mine acquaintance: [[H3045]] they that did see [[H7200]] me without [[H2351]] fled [[H5074]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 12
I am forgotten [[H7911]] as a dead man [[H4191]] out of mind: [[H3820]] I am [[H1961]] like a broken [[H6]] vessel. [[H3627]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] I have heard [[H8085]] the slander [[H1681]] of many: [[H7227]] fear [[H4032]] on every side: [[H5439]] while they took counsel [[H3245]] together [[H3162]] against [[H5921]] me, they devised [[H2161]] to take away [[H3947]] my life. [[H5315]]

### 14
But I [[H589]] trusted [[H982]] in [[H5921]] thee, O Lord: [[H3068]] I said, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] my God. [[H430]]

### 15
My times [[H6256]] in thy hand: [[H3027]] deliver [[H5337]] me from the hand [[H3027]] of mine enemies, [[H341]] and from them that persecute [[H7291]] me. [[H7291]]

### 16
Make thy face [[H6440]] to shine [[H215]] upon [[H5921]] thy servant: [[H5650]] save [[H3467]] me for thy mercies' [[H2617]] sake. [[H2617]]

### 17
Let me not [[H408]] be ashamed, [[H954]] O Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I have called upon [[H7121]] thee: let the wicked [[H7563]] be ashamed, [[H954]] let them be silent [[H1826]] in the grave. [[H7585]]

### 18
Let the lying [[H8267]] lips [[H8193]] be put to silence; [[H481]] which speak [[H1696]] grievous things [[H6277]] proudly [[H1346]] and contemptuously [[H937]] against [[H5921]] the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 19
how [[H4100]] great [[H7227]] thy goodness, [[H2898]] which [[H834]] thou hast laid up [[H6845]] for them that fear [[H3373]] thee; thou hast wrought [[H6466]] for them that trust [[H2620]] in thee before [[H5048]] the sons [[H1121]] of men! [[H120]]

### 20
Thou shalt hide [[H5641]] them in the secret [[H5643]] of thy presence [[H6440]] from the pride [[H7407]] of man: [[H376]] thou shalt keep them secretly [[H6845]] in a pavilion [[H5521]] from the strife [[H7379]] of tongues. [[H3956]]

### 21
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he hath shewed me his marvellous [[H6381]] kindness [[H2617]] in a strong [[H4692]] city. [[H5892]]

### 22
For I [[H589]] said [[H559]] in my haste, [[H2648]] I am cut off [[H1629]] from before [[H5048]] thine eyes: [[H5869]] nevertheless [[H403]] thou heardest [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of my supplications [[H8469]] when I cried [[H7768]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 23
O love [[H157]] the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] ye his saints: [[H2623]] the Lord [[H3068]] preserveth [[H5341]] the faithful, [[H539]] and plentifully [[H3499]] rewardeth [[H7999]] the proud [[H1346]] doer. [[H6213]]

### 24
Be of good courage, [[H2388]] and he shall strengthen [[H553]] your heart, [[H3824]] all [[H3605]] ye that hope [[H3176]] in the Lord. [[H3068]]
