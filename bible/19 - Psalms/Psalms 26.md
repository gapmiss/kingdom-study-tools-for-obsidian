of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Judge [[H8199]] me, O Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have walked [[H1980]] in mine integrity: [[H8537]] I have trusted [[H982]] also in the Lord; [[H3068]] I shall not [[H3808]] slide. [[H4571]]

### 2
Examine [[H974]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] and prove [[H5254]] me; try [[H6884]] my reins [[H3629]] and my heart. [[H3820]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] before [[H5048]] mine eyes: [[H5869]] and I have walked [[H1980]] in thy truth. [[H571]]

### 4
I have not [[H3808]] sat [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] vain [[H7723]] persons, [[H4962]] neither [[H3808]] will I go in [[H935]] with [[H5973]] dissemblers. [[H5956]]

### 5
I have hated [[H8130]] the congregation [[H6951]] of evil doers; [[H7489]] and will not [[H3808]] sit [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 6
I will wash [[H7364]] mine hands [[H3709]] in innocency: [[H5356]] so will I compass [[H5437]]  thine [[H853]] altar, [[H4196]] O Lord: [[H3068]]

### 7
That I may publish [[H8085]] with the voice [[H6963]] of thanksgiving, [[H8426]] and tell [[H5608]] of all [[H3605]] thy wondrous works. [[H6381]]

### 8
Lord, [[H3068]] I have loved [[H157]] the habitation [[H4583]] of thy house, [[H1004]] and the place [[H4725]] where thine honour [[H3519]] dwelleth. [[H4908]]

### 9
Gather [[H622]] not [[H408]] my soul [[H5315]] with [[H5973]] sinners, [[H2400]] nor my life [[H2416]] with [[H5973]] bloody [[H1818]] men: [[H376]]

### 10
In whose [[H834]] hands [[H3027]] mischief, [[H2154]] and their right hand [[H3225]] is full [[H4390]] of bribes. [[H7810]]

### 11
But as for me, [[H589]] I will walk [[H1980]] in mine integrity: [[H8537]] redeem [[H6299]] me, and be merciful [[H2603]] unto me. [[H2603]]

### 12
My foot [[H7272]] standeth [[H5975]] in an even place: [[H4334]] in the congregations [[H4721]] will I bless [[H1288]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
