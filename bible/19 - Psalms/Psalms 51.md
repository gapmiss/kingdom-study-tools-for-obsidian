To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David, [[H1732]] when [[H935]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] came [[H935]] unto [[H413]] him, [[H413]] after [[H834]] he had gone in [[H935]] to [[H413]] Bathsheba. [[H1339]]

### 1
Have mercy [[H2603]] upon me, O God, [[H430]] according to thy lovingkindness: [[H2617]] according unto the multitude [[H7230]] of thy tender mercies [[H7356]] blot out [[H4229]] my transgressions. [[H6588]]

### 2
Wash [[H3526]] me throughly [[H7235]] from mine iniquity, [[H5771]] and cleanse [[H2891]] me from my sin. [[H2403]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] acknowledge [[H3045]] my transgressions: [[H6588]] and my sin [[H2403]] ever [[H8548]] before [[H5048]] me. [[H5048]]

### 4
Against thee, thee only, [[H905]] have I sinned, [[H2398]] and done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in thy sight: [[H5869]] that [[H4616]] thou mightest be justified [[H6663]] when thou speakest, [[H1696]] be clear [[H2135]] when thou judgest. [[H8199]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2005]] I was shapen [[H2342]] in iniquity; [[H5771]] and in sin [[H2399]] did my mother [[H517]] conceive [[H3179]] me. [[H3179]]

### 6
Behold, [[H2005]] thou desirest [[H2654]] truth [[H571]] in the inward parts: [[H2910]] and in the hidden [[H5640]] thou shalt make me to know [[H3045]] wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 7
Purge [[H2398]] me with hyssop, [[H231]] and I shall be clean: [[H2891]] wash [[H3526]] me, and I shall be whiter [[H3835]] than snow. [[H7950]]

### 8
Make me to hear [[H8085]] joy [[H8342]] and gladness; [[H8057]] the bones [[H6106]] thou hast broken [[H1794]] may rejoice. [[H1523]]

### 9
Hide [[H5641]] thy face [[H6440]] from my sins, [[H2399]] and blot out [[H4229]] all [[H3605]] mine iniquities. [[H5771]]

### 10
Create [[H1254]] in me a clean [[H2889]] heart, [[H3820]] O God; [[H430]] and renew [[H2318]] a right [[H3559]] spirit [[H7307]] within [[H7130]] me. [[H7130]]

### 11
Cast away [[H7993]] me not [[H408]] from thy presence; [[H6440]] and take [[H3947]] not [[H408]] thy holy [[H6944]] spirit [[H7307]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 12
Restore [[H7725]] unto me the joy [[H8342]] of thy salvation; [[H3468]] and uphold [[H5564]] me free [[H5081]] spirit. [[H7307]]

### 13
will I teach [[H3925]] transgressors [[H6586]] thy ways; [[H1870]] and sinners [[H2400]] shall be converted [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 14
Deliver [[H5337]] me from bloodguiltiness, [[H1818]] O God, [[H430]] thou God [[H430]] of my salvation: [[H8668]] my tongue [[H3956]] shall sing aloud [[H7442]] of thy righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 15
O Lord, [[H136]] open [[H6605]] thou my lips; [[H8193]] and my mouth [[H6310]] shall shew forth [[H5046]] thy praise. [[H8416]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] thou desirest [[H2654]] not [[H3808]] sacrifice; [[H2077]] else would I give [[H5414]] thou delightest [[H7521]] not [[H3808]] in burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 17
The sacrifices [[H2077]] of God [[H430]] a broken [[H7665]] spirit: [[H7307]] a broken [[H7665]] and a contrite [[H1794]] heart, [[H3820]] O God, [[H430]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] despise. [[H959]]

### 18
Do good [[H3190]] in thy good pleasure [[H7522]]  unto [[H853]] Zion: [[H6726]] build [[H1129]] thou the walls [[H2346]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 19
Then [[H227]] shalt thou be pleased [[H2654]] with the sacrifices [[H2077]] of righteousness, [[H6664]] with burnt offering [[H5930]] and whole [[H3632]] burnt offering: then [[H227]] shall they offer [[H5927]] bullocks [[H6499]] upon [[H5921]] thine altar. [[H4196]]
