To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Shoshannim, [[H7799]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah, [[H7141]] Maschil, [[H4905]] A Song [[H7892]] of loves. [[H3039]]

### 1
My heart [[H3820]] is inditing [[H7370]] a good [[H2896]] matter: [[H1697]] I [[H589]] speak [[H559]] of the things which I have made [[H4639]] touching the king: [[H4428]] my tongue [[H3956]] the pen [[H5842]] of a ready [[H4106]] writer. [[H5608]]

### 2
Thou art fairer [[H3302]] than the children [[H1121]] of men: [[H120]] grace [[H2580]] is poured [[H3332]] into thy lips: [[H8193]] therefore [[H5921]] God [[H430]] hath blessed [[H1288]] thee for ever. [[H5769]]

### 3
Gird [[H2296]] thy sword [[H2719]] upon [[H5921]] thigh, [[H3409]] O mighty, [[H1368]] with thy glory [[H1935]] and thy majesty. [[H1926]]

### 4
And in thy majesty [[H1926]] ride [[H7392]] prosperously [[H6743]] because [[H1697]] of truth [[H571]] and meekness [[H6037]] righteousness; [[H6664]] and thy right hand [[H3225]] shall teach [[H3384]] thee terrible things. [[H3372]]

### 5
Thine arrows [[H2671]] sharp [[H8150]] in the heart [[H3820]] of the king's [[H4428]] enemies; [[H341]] the people [[H5971]] fall [[H5307]] under [[H8478]] thee. [[H8478]]

### 6
Thy throne, [[H3678]] O God, [[H430]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever: [[H5703]] the sceptre [[H7626]] of thy kingdom [[H4438]] a right [[H4334]] sceptre. [[H7626]]

### 7
Thou lovest [[H157]] righteousness, [[H6664]] and hatest [[H8130]] wickedness: [[H7562]] therefore [[H5921]] God, [[H430]] thy God, [[H430]] hath anointed [[H4886]] thee with the oil [[H8081]] of gladness [[H8342]] above thy fellows. [[H2270]]

### 8
All [[H3605]] thy garments [[H899]] of myrrh, [[H4753]] and aloes, [[H174]] cassia, [[H7102]] out of [[H4480]] the ivory [[H8127]] palaces, [[H1964]] whereby [[H4482]] they have made thee glad. [[H8055]]

### 9
Kings' [[H4428]] daughters [[H1323]] among thy honourable women: [[H3368]] upon thy right hand [[H3225]] did stand [[H5324]] the queen [[H7694]] in gold [[H3800]] of Ophir. [[H211]]

### 10
Hearken, [[H8085]] O daughter, [[H1323]] and consider, [[H7200]] and incline [[H5186]] thine ear; [[H241]] forget [[H7911]] also thine own people, [[H5971]] and thy father's [[H1]] house; [[H1004]]

### 11
So shall the king [[H4428]] greatly desire [[H183]] thy beauty: [[H3308]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] thy Lord; [[H113]] and worship [[H7812]] thou him. [[H7812]]

### 12
And the daughter [[H1323]] of Tyre [[H6865]] with a gift; [[H4503]] the rich [[H6223]] among the people [[H5971]] shall intreat [[H2470]] thy favour. [[H6440]]

### 13
The king's [[H4428]] daughter [[H1323]] all [[H3605]] glorious [[H3520]] within: [[H6441]] her clothing [[H3830]] of wrought [[H4865]] gold. [[H2091]]

### 14
She shall be brought [[H2986]] unto the king [[H4428]] in raiment of needlework: [[H7553]] the virgins [[H1330]] her companions [[H7464]] that follow [[H310]] her shall be brought [[H935]] unto thee. [[H935]]

### 15
With gladness [[H8057]] and rejoicing [[H1524]] shall they be brought: [[H2986]] they shall enter [[H935]] into the king's [[H4428]] palace. [[H1964]]

### 16
Instead [[H8478]] of thy fathers [[H1]] shall be [[H1961]] thy children, [[H1121]] whom thou mayest make [[H7896]] princes [[H8269]] in all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
I will make thy name [[H8034]] to be remembered [[H2142]] in all [[H1755]] generations: [[H1755]] therefore [[H5921]] shall the people [[H5971]] praise [[H3034]] thee for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]
