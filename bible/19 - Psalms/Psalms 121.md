A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
I will lift up [[H5375]] mine eyes [[H5869]] unto [[H413]] the hills, [[H2022]] from whence [[H370]] cometh [[H935]] my help. [[H5828]]

### 2
My help [[H5828]] from [[H5973]] the Lord, [[H3068]] which made [[H6213]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]]

### 3
He will not [[H408]] suffer [[H5414]] thy foot [[H7272]] to be moved: [[H4132]] he that keepeth [[H8104]] thee will not [[H408]] slumber. [[H5123]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2009]] he that keepeth [[H8104]] Israel [[H3478]] shall neither [[H3808]] slumber [[H5123]] nor [[H3808]] sleep. [[H3462]]

### 5
The Lord [[H3068]] thy keeper: [[H8104]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy shade [[H6738]] upon [[H5921]] thy right [[H3225]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 6
The sun [[H8121]] shall not [[H3808]] smite [[H5221]] thee by day, [[H3119]] nor the moon [[H3394]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] shall preserve [[H8104]] thee from all [[H3605]] evil: [[H7451]] he shall preserve [[H8104]] thy soul. [[H5315]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] shall preserve [[H8104]] thy going out [[H3318]] and thy coming in [[H935]] from this time forth, [[H6258]] and even for [[H5704]] evermore. [[H5769]]
