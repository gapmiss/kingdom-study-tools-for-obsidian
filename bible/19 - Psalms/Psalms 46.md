To the chief Musician [[H5329]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah, [[H7141]] A Song [[H7892]] upon [[H5921]] Alamoth. [[H5961]]

### 1
God [[H430]] our refuge [[H4268]] and strength, [[H5797]] a very [[H3966]] present [[H4672]] help [[H5833]] in trouble. [[H6869]]

### 2
Therefore [[H5921]] will not [[H3808]] we fear, [[H3372]] though the earth [[H776]] be removed, [[H4171]] and though the mountains [[H2022]] be carried [[H4131]] into the midst [[H3820]] of the sea; [[H3220]]

### 3
the waters [[H4325]] thereof roar [[H1993]] be troubled, [[H2560]] the mountains [[H2022]] shake [[H7493]] with the swelling [[H1346]] thereof. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 4
a river, [[H5104]] the streams [[H6388]] whereof shall make glad [[H8055]] the city [[H5892]] of God, [[H430]] the holy [[H6918]] of the tabernacles [[H4908]] of the most High. [[H5945]]

### 5
God [[H430]] in the midst [[H7130]] of her; she shall not [[H1077]] be moved: [[H4131]] God [[H430]] shall help [[H5826]] her, right [[H6437]] early. [[H1242]]

### 6
The heathen [[H1471]] raged, [[H1993]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] were moved: [[H4131]] he uttered [[H5414]] his voice, [[H6963]] the earth [[H776]] melted. [[H4127]]

### 7
The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] with [[H5973]] us; the God [[H430]] of Jacob [[H3290]] our refuge. [[H4869]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 8
Come, [[H1980]] behold [[H2372]] the works [[H4659]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] what [[H834]] desolations [[H8047]] he hath made [[H7760]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 9
He maketh wars [[H4421]] to cease [[H7673]] unto [[H5704]] the end [[H7097]] of the earth; [[H776]] he breaketh [[H7665]] the bow, [[H7198]] and cutteth sunder; [[H7112]] the spear [[H2595]] in he burneth [[H8313]] the chariot [[H5699]] in the fire. [[H784]]

### 10
Be still, [[H7503]] and know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H595]] God: [[H430]] I will be exalted [[H7311]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] I will be exalted [[H7311]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 11
The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts [[H6635]] with [[H5973]] us; the God [[H430]] of Jacob [[H3290]] our refuge. [[H4869]] Selah. [[H5542]]
