To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
The heavens [[H8064]] declare [[H5608]] the glory [[H3519]] of God; [[H410]] and the firmament [[H7549]] sheweth [[H5046]] his handywork. [[H4639]]

### 2
Day [[H3117]] unto day [[H3117]] uttereth [[H5042]] speech, [[H562]] and night [[H3915]] unto night [[H3915]] sheweth [[H2331]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 3
no [[H369]] speech [[H562]] nor [[H369]] language, [[H1697]] their voice [[H6963]] is not [[H1097]] heard. [[H8085]]

### 4
Their line [[H6957]] is gone out [[H3318]] through all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] and their words [[H4405]] to the end [[H7097]] of the world. [[H8398]] In them hath he set [[H7760]] a tabernacle [[H168]] for the sun, [[H8121]]

### 5
Which [[H1931]] as a bridegroom [[H2860]] coming out [[H3318]] of his chamber, [[H2646]] rejoiceth [[H7797]] as a strong man [[H1368]] to run [[H7323]] a race. [[H734]]

### 6
His going forth [[H4161]] from the end [[H7097]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] and his circuit [[H8622]] unto [[H5921]] the ends [[H7098]] of it: and there is nothing [[H369]] hid [[H5641]] from the heat [[H2535]] thereof. [[H2535]]

### 7
The law [[H8451]] of the Lord [[H3068]] perfect, [[H8549]] converting [[H7725]] the soul: [[H5315]] the testimony [[H5715]] of the Lord [[H3068]] sure, [[H539]] making wise [[H2449]] the simple. [[H6612]]

### 8
The statutes [[H6490]] of the Lord [[H3068]] right, [[H3477]] rejoicing [[H8055]] the heart: [[H3820]] the commandment [[H4687]] of the Lord [[H3068]] pure, [[H1249]] enlightening [[H215]] the eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
The fear [[H3374]] of the Lord [[H3068]] clean, [[H2889]] enduring [[H5975]] for ever: [[H5703]] the judgments [[H4941]] of the Lord [[H3068]] true [[H571]] righteous [[H6663]] altogether. [[H3162]]

### 10
More to be desired [[H2530]] than gold, [[H2091]] yea, than much [[H7227]] fine gold: [[H6337]] sweeter [[H4966]] also than honey [[H1706]] and the honeycomb. [[H5317]]

### 11
Moreover [[H1571]] by them is thy servant [[H5650]] warned: [[H2094]] in keeping [[H8104]] of them great [[H7227]] reward. [[H6118]]

### 12
Who [[H4310]] can understand [[H995]] errors? [[H7691]] cleanse [[H5352]] thou me from secret [[H5641]]

### 13
Keep back [[H2820]] thy servant [[H5650]] also [[H1571]] from presumptuous [[H2086]] let them not [[H408]] have dominion [[H4910]] over me: then [[H227]] shall I be upright, [[H8552]] and I shall be innocent [[H5352]] from the great [[H7227]] transgression. [[H6588]]

### 14
Let the words [[H561]] of my mouth, [[H6310]] and the meditation [[H1902]] of my heart, [[H3820]] be [[H1961]] acceptable [[H7522]] in thy sight, [[H6440]] O Lord, [[H3068]] my strength, [[H6697]] and my redeemer. [[H1350]]
