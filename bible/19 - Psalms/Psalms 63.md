A Psalm [[H4210]] of David, [[H1732]] when he was [[H1961]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 1
O God, [[H430]] thou [[H859]] my God; [[H410]] early will I seek [[H7836]] thee: my soul [[H5315]] thirsteth [[H6770]] for thee, my flesh [[H1320]] longeth [[H3642]] for thee in a dry [[H6723]] and thirsty [[H5889]] land, [[H776]] where no [[H1097]] water [[H4325]] is; [[H4325]]

### 2
To see [[H7200]] thy power [[H5797]] and thy glory, [[H3519]] so [[H3651]] I have seen [[H2372]] thee in the sanctuary. [[H6944]]

### 3
Because [[H3588]] thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] better [[H2896]] than life, [[H2416]] my lips [[H8193]] shall praise [[H7623]] thee. [[H7623]]

### 4
Thus [[H3651]] will I bless [[H1288]] thee while I live: [[H2416]] I will lift up [[H5375]] my hands [[H3709]] in thy name. [[H8034]]

### 5
My soul [[H5315]] shall be satisfied [[H7646]] as [[H3644]] marrow [[H2459]] and fatness; [[H1880]] and my mouth [[H6310]] shall praise [[H1984]] with joyful [[H7445]] lips: [[H8193]]

### 6
When [[H518]] I remember [[H2142]] thee upon [[H5921]] my bed, [[H3326]] meditate [[H1897]] on thee in the watches. [[H821]]

### 7
Because [[H3588]] thou hast been [[H1961]] my help, [[H5833]] therefore in the shadow [[H6738]] of thy wings [[H3671]] will I rejoice. [[H7442]]

### 8
My soul [[H5315]] followeth hard [[H1692]] after [[H310]] thee: thy right hand [[H3225]] upholdeth [[H8551]] me. [[H8551]]

### 9
But those [[H1992]] seek [[H1245]] my soul, [[H5315]] to destroy [[H7722]] shall go [[H935]] into the lower parts [[H8482]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
They shall fall [[H5064]] by [[H5921]] the sword: [[H3027]] they shall be [[H1961]] a portion [[H4521]] for foxes. [[H7776]]

### 11
But the king [[H4428]] shall rejoice [[H8055]] in God; [[H430]] every one [[H3605]] that sweareth [[H7650]] by him shall glory: [[H1984]] but [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of them that speak [[H1696]] lies [[H8267]] shall be stopped. [[H5534]]
