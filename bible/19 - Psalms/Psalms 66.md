To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Song [[H7892]] Psalm. [[H4210]]

### 1
Make a joyful noise [[H7321]] unto God, [[H430]] all [[H3605]] ye lands: [[H776]]

### 2
Sing forth [[H2167]] the honour [[H3519]] of his name: [[H8034]] make [[H7760]] his praise [[H8416]] glorious. [[H3519]]

### 3
Say [[H559]] unto God, [[H430]] How [[H4100]] terrible [[H3372]] thy works! [[H4639]] through the greatness [[H7230]] of thy power [[H5797]] shall thine enemies [[H341]] submit [[H3584]] themselves unto thee. [[H3584]]

### 4
All [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] shall worship [[H7812]] thee, and shall sing [[H2167]] unto thee; they shall sing [[H2167]] thy name. [[H8034]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
Come [[H1980]] and see [[H7200]] the works [[H4659]] of God: [[H430]] terrible [[H3372]] doing [[H5949]] toward [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 6
He turned [[H2015]] the sea [[H3220]] into dry [[H3004]] they went [[H5674]] through the flood [[H5104]] on foot: [[H7272]] there [[H8033]] did we rejoice [[H8055]] in him. [[H8055]]

### 7
He ruleth [[H4910]] by his power [[H1369]] for ever; [[H5769]] his eyes [[H5869]] behold [[H6822]] the nations: [[H1471]] let not [[H408]] the rebellious [[H5637]] exalt [[H7311]] themselves. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 8
O bless [[H1288]] our God, [[H430]] ye people, [[H5971]] and make the voice [[H6963]] of his praise [[H8416]] to be heard: [[H8085]]

### 9
Which holdeth [[H7760]] our soul [[H5315]] in life, [[H2416]] and suffereth [[H5414]] not [[H3808]] our feet [[H7272]] to be moved. [[H4132]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] thou, O God, [[H430]] hast proved [[H974]] us: thou hast tried [[H6884]] us, as silver [[H3701]] is tried. [[H6884]]

### 11
Thou broughtest [[H935]] us into the net; [[H4686]] thou laidst [[H7760]] affliction [[H4157]] upon our loins. [[H4975]]

### 12
Thou hast caused men [[H582]] to ride [[H7392]] over our heads; [[H7218]] we went [[H935]] through fire [[H784]] and through water: [[H4325]] but thou broughtest us out [[H3318]] into a wealthy [[H7310]]

### 13
I will go [[H935]] into thy house [[H1004]] with burnt offerings: [[H5930]] I will pay [[H7999]] thee my vows, [[H5088]]

### 14
Which [[H834]] my lips [[H8193]] have uttered, [[H6475]] and my mouth [[H6310]] hath spoken, [[H1696]] when I was in trouble. [[H6862]]

### 15
I will offer [[H5927]] unto thee burnt sacrifices [[H5930]] of fatlings, [[H4220]] with [[H5973]] the incense [[H7004]] of rams; [[H352]] I will offer [[H6213]] bullocks [[H1241]] with [[H5973]] goats. [[H6260]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 16
Come [[H1980]] hear, [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] ye that fear [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] and I will declare [[H5608]] what [[H834]] he hath done [[H6213]] for my soul. [[H5315]]

### 17
I cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] him with my mouth, [[H6310]] and he was extolled [[H7318]] with [[H8478]] my tongue. [[H3956]]

### 18
If [[H518]] I regard [[H7200]] iniquity [[H205]] in my heart, [[H3820]] the Lord [[H136]] will not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]]

### 19
verily [[H403]] God [[H430]] hath heard [[H8085]] he hath attended [[H7181]] to the voice [[H6963]] of my prayer. [[H8605]]

### 20
Blessed [[H1288]] God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] turned away [[H5493]] my prayer, [[H8605]] nor his mercy [[H2617]] from [[H854]] me. [[H854]]
