To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Hold [[H2790]] not [[H408]] thy peace, O God [[H430]] of my praise; [[H8416]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] and the mouth [[H6310]] of the deceitful [[H4820]] are opened [[H6605]] against [[H5921]] me: they have spoken [[H1696]] against [[H854]] me with a lying [[H8267]] tongue. [[H3956]]

### 3
They compassed [[H5437]] me about also with words [[H1697]] of hatred; [[H8135]] and fought against [[H3898]] me without a cause. [[H2600]]

### 4
For [[H8478]] my love [[H160]] they are my adversaries: [[H7853]] but I [[H589]] prayer. [[H8605]]

### 5
And they have rewarded [[H7760]] me evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good, [[H2896]] and hatred [[H8135]] for [[H8478]] my love. [[H160]]

### 6
Set [[H6485]] thou a wicked man [[H7563]] over [[H5921]] him: and let Satan [[H7854]] stand [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] his right hand. [[H3225]]

### 7
When he shall be judged, [[H8199]] let him condemned: [[H7563]]  be [[H3318]] and let his prayer [[H8605]] become [[H1961]] sin. [[H2401]]

### 8
Let his days [[H3117]] be [[H1961]] few; [[H4592]] let another [[H312]] take [[H3947]] his office. [[H6486]]

### 9
Let his children [[H1121]] be [[H1961]] fatherless, [[H3490]] and his wife [[H802]] a widow. [[H490]]

### 10
Let his children [[H1121]] be continually [[H5128]] vagabonds, [[H5128]] and beg: [[H7592]] let them seek [[H1875]] also out of their desolate places. [[H2723]]

### 11
Let the extortioner [[H5383]] catch [[H5367]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he hath; and let the strangers [[H2114]] spoil [[H962]] his labour. [[H3018]]

### 12
Let there be [[H1961]] none [[H408]] to extend [[H4900]] mercy [[H2617]] unto him: neither [[H408]] let there be [[H1961]] any to favour [[H2603]] his fatherless children. [[H3490]]

### 13
Let his posterity [[H319]] be [[H1961]] cut off; [[H3772]] in the generation [[H1755]] following [[H312]] let their name [[H8034]] be blotted out. [[H4229]]

### 14
Let the iniquity [[H5771]] of his fathers [[H1]] be remembered [[H2142]] with [[H413]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and let not [[H408]] the sin [[H2403]] of his mother [[H517]] be blotted out. [[H4229]]

### 15
Let them be [[H1961]] before [[H5048]] the Lord [[H3068]] continually, [[H8548]] that he may cut off [[H3772]] the memory [[H2143]] of them from the earth. [[H776]]

### 16
Because [[H3282]] that [[H834]] he remembered [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] to shew [[H6213]] mercy, [[H2617]] but persecuted [[H7291]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] man, [[H376]] that he might even slay [[H4191]] the broken [[H3512]] in heart. [[H3824]]

### 17
As he loved [[H157]] cursing, [[H7045]] so let it come [[H935]] unto him: as he delighted [[H2654]] not [[H3808]] in blessing, [[H1293]] so let it be far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 18
As he clothed [[H3847]] himself with cursing [[H7045]] like as with his garment, [[H4055]] so let it come [[H935]] into his bowels [[H7130]] like water, [[H4325]] and like oil [[H8081]] into his bones. [[H6106]]

### 19
Let it be [[H1961]] unto him as the garment [[H899]] covereth [[H5844]] him, and for a girdle [[H4206]] wherewith he is girded [[H2296]] continually. [[H8548]]

### 20
this [[H2063]] the reward [[H6468]] of mine adversaries [[H7853]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and of them that speak [[H1696]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] my soul. [[H5315]]

### 21
But do [[H6213]] thou [[H859]] for [[H854]] me, O God [[H3069]] the Lord, [[H136]] for thy name's [[H8034]] sake: [[H4616]] because [[H3588]] thy mercy [[H2617]] good, [[H2896]] deliver [[H5337]] thou me. [[H5337]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] and my heart [[H3820]] is wounded [[H2490]] within [[H7130]] me. [[H7130]]

### 23
I am gone [[H1980]] like the shadow [[H6738]] when it declineth: [[H5186]] I am tossed up and down [[H5287]] as the locust. [[H697]]

### 24
My knees [[H1290]] are weak [[H3782]] through fasting; [[H6685]] and my flesh [[H1320]] faileth [[H3584]] of fatness. [[H8081]]

### 25
I [[H589]] became [[H1961]] also a reproach [[H2781]] unto them: they looked upon [[H7200]] me they shaked [[H5128]] their heads. [[H7218]]

### 26
Help [[H5826]] me, O Lord [[H3068]] my God: [[H430]] O save [[H3467]] me according to thy mercy: [[H2617]]

### 27
That [[H3588]] they may know [[H3045]] that this [[H2063]] thy hand; [[H3027]] thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H3068]] hast done [[H6213]] it. [[H6213]]

### 28
Let them [[H1992]] curse, [[H7043]] but bless [[H1288]] thou: [[H859]] when they arise, [[H6965]] let them be ashamed; [[H954]] but let thy servant [[H5650]] rejoice. [[H8055]]

### 29
Let mine adversaries [[H7853]] be clothed [[H3847]] with shame, [[H3639]] and let them cover [[H5844]] themselves with their own confusion, [[H1322]] as with a mantle. [[H4598]]

### 30
I will greatly [[H3966]] praise [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] with my mouth; [[H6310]] yea, I will praise [[H1984]] him among [[H8432]] the multitude. [[H7227]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] he shall stand [[H5975]] at the right hand [[H3225]] of the poor, [[H34]] to save [[H3467]] from those that condemn [[H8199]] his soul. [[H5315]]
