To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Gittith, [[H1665]] A Psalm [[H4210]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]]

### 1
How [[H4100]] amiable [[H3039]] thy tabernacles, [[H4908]] O Lord [[H3068]] of hosts! [[H6635]]

### 2
My soul [[H5315]] longeth, [[H3700]] yea, even [[H1571]] fainteth [[H3615]] for the courts [[H2691]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] my heart [[H3820]] and my flesh [[H1320]] crieth out [[H7442]] for [[H413]] the living [[H2416]] God. [[H410]]

### 3
Yea, [[H1571]] the sparrow [[H6833]] hath found [[H4672]] an house, [[H1004]] and the swallow [[H1866]] a nest [[H7064]] for herself, where [[H834]] she may lay [[H7896]] her young, [[H667]] thine altars, [[H4196]] O Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] my King, [[H4428]] and my God. [[H430]]

### 4
Blessed [[H835]] they that dwell [[H3427]] in thy house: [[H1004]] they will be still [[H5750]] praising [[H1984]] thee. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
Blessed [[H835]] the man [[H120]] whose strength [[H5797]] in thee; in whose heart [[H3824]] the ways [[H4546]]

### 6
passing [[H5674]] through the valley [[H6010]] of Baca [[H1056]] make [[H7896]] it a well; [[H4599]] the rain [[H4175]] also [[H1571]] filleth [[H5844]] the pools. [[H1293]]

### 7
They go [[H1980]] from strength [[H2428]] to [[H413]] strength, [[H2428]] in Zion [[H6726]] appeareth [[H7200]] before [[H413]] God. [[H430]]

### 8
O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] hear [[H8085]] my prayer: [[H8605]] give ear, [[H238]] O God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 9
Behold, [[H7200]] O God [[H430]] our shield, [[H4043]] and look upon [[H5027]] the face [[H6440]] of thine anointed. [[H4899]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] a day [[H3117]] in thy courts [[H2691]] better [[H2896]] than a thousand. [[H505]] I had rather [[H977]] be a doorkeeper [[H5605]] in the house [[H1004]] of my God, [[H430]] than to dwell [[H1752]] in the tents [[H168]] of wickedness. [[H7562]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] a sun [[H8121]] and shield: [[H4043]] the Lord [[H3068]] will give [[H5414]] grace [[H2580]] and glory: [[H3519]] no [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] will he withhold [[H4513]] from them that walk [[H1980]] uprightly. [[H8549]]

### 12
O Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] blessed [[H835]] the man [[H120]] that trusteth [[H982]] in thee. [[H982]]
