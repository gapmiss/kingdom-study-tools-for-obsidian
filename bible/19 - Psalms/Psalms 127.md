A Song [[H7892]] of degrees [[H4609]] for Solomon. [[H8010]]

### 1
Except [[H518]] the Lord [[H3068]] build [[H1129]] the house, [[H1004]] they labour [[H5998]] in vain [[H7723]] that build [[H1129]] it: except [[H518]] the Lord [[H3068]] keep [[H8104]] the city, [[H5892]] the watchman [[H8104]] waketh [[H8245]] in vain. [[H7723]]

### 2
vain [[H7723]] for you to rise up [[H6965]] early, [[H7925]] to sit up [[H3427]] late, [[H309]] to eat [[H398]] the bread [[H3899]] of sorrows: [[H6089]] so [[H3651]] he giveth [[H5414]] his beloved [[H3039]] sleep. [[H8142]]

### 3
Lo, [[H2009]] children [[H1121]] an heritage [[H5159]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] the fruit [[H6529]] of the womb [[H990]] reward. [[H7939]]

### 4
As arrows [[H2671]] in the hand [[H3027]] of a mighty man; [[H1368]] so [[H3651]] children [[H1121]] of the youth. [[H5271]]

### 5
Happy [[H835]] the man [[H1397]] that [[H834]]  hath [[H853]] his quiver [[H827]] full [[H4390]] of them: they shall not [[H3808]] be ashamed, [[H954]] but [[H3588]] they shall speak [[H1696]] with [[H854]] the enemies [[H341]] in the gate. [[H8179]]
