The Lord [[H3068]] said [[H5002]] unto my Lord, [[H113]] Sit [[H3427]] thou at my right hand, [[H3225]] until [[H5704]] I make [[H7896]] thine enemies [[H341]] thy footstool. [[H1916]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] shall send [[H7971]] the rod [[H4294]] of thy strength [[H5797]] out of Zion: [[H6726]] rule [[H7287]] thou in the midst [[H7130]] of thine enemies. [[H341]]

### 3
Thy people [[H5971]] willing [[H5071]] in the day [[H3117]] of thy power, [[H2428]] in the beauties [[H1926]] of holiness [[H6944]] from the womb [[H7358]] of the morning: [[H4891]] thou hast the dew [[H2919]] of thy youth. [[H3208]]

### 4
The Lord [[H3068]] hath sworn, [[H7650]] and will not [[H3808]] repent, [[H5162]] Thou [[H859]] a priest [[H3548]] for ever [[H5769]] after [[H5921]] the order [[H1700]] of Melchizedek. [[H4442]]

### 5
The Lord [[H136]] at [[H5921]] thy right hand [[H3225]] shall strike through [[H4272]] kings [[H4428]] in the day [[H3117]] of his wrath. [[H639]]

### 6
He shall judge [[H1777]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] he shall fill [[H4390]] with the dead bodies; [[H1472]] he shall wound [[H4272]] the heads [[H7218]] over [[H5921]] many [[H7227]] countries. [[H776]]

### 7
He shall drink [[H8354]] of the brook [[H5158]] in the way: [[H1870]] therefore [[H5921]] shall he lift up [[H7311]] the head. [[H7218]]
