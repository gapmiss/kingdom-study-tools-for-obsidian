### 1
O sing [[H7891]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] a new [[H2319]] song; [[H7892]] for [[H3588]] he hath done [[H6213]] marvellous things: [[H6381]] his right hand, [[H3225]] and his holy [[H6944]] arm, [[H2220]] hath gotten him the victory. [[H3467]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] hath made known [[H3045]] his salvation: [[H3444]] his righteousness [[H6666]] hath he openly shewed [[H1540]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the heathen. [[H1471]]

He hath remembered [[H2142]] his mercy [[H2617]] and his truth [[H530]] toward the house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] have seen [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3444]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 4
Make a joyful noise [[H7321]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the earth: [[H776]] make a loud noise, [[H6476]] and rejoice, [[H7442]] and sing [[H2167]] praise. [[H2167]]

### 5
Sing [[H2167]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] with the harp; [[H3658]] with the harp, [[H3658]] and the voice [[H6963]] of a psalm. [[H2172]]

### 6
With trumpets [[H2689]] and sound [[H6963]] of cornet [[H7782]] make a joyful noise [[H7321]] before [[H6440]] the Lord, [[H3068]] the King. [[H4428]]

### 7
Let the sea [[H3220]] roar, [[H7481]] and the fulness [[H4393]] thereof; the world, [[H8398]] and they that dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 8
Let the floods [[H5104]] clap [[H4222]] hands: [[H3709]] let the hills [[H2022]] be joyful [[H7442]] together [[H3162]]

### 9
Before [[H6440]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he cometh [[H935]] to judge [[H8199]] the earth: [[H776]] with righteousness [[H6664]] shall he judge [[H8199]] the world, [[H8398]] and the people [[H5971]] with equity. [[H4339]]
