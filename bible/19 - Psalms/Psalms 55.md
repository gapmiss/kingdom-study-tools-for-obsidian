To the chief Musician [[H5329]] on Neginoth, [[H5058]] Maschil, [[H4905]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Give ear [[H238]] to my prayer, [[H8605]] O God; [[H430]] and hide [[H5956]] not thyself [[H408]] from my supplication. [[H8467]]

### 2
Attend [[H7181]] unto me, and hear [[H6030]] me: I mourn [[H7300]] in my complaint, [[H7879]] and make a noise; [[H1949]]

### 3
Because of the voice [[H6963]] of the enemy, [[H341]] because [[H6440]] of the oppression [[H6125]] of the wicked: [[H7563]] for [[H3588]] they cast [[H4131]] iniquity [[H205]] upon [[H5921]] me, and in wrath [[H639]] they hate [[H7852]] me. [[H7852]]

### 4
My heart [[H3820]] is sore pained [[H2342]] within [[H7130]] me: and the terrors [[H367]] of death [[H4194]] are fallen [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 5
Fearfulness [[H3374]] and trembling [[H7461]] are come [[H935]] upon me, and horror [[H6427]] hath overwhelmed [[H3680]] me. [[H3680]]

### 6
And I said, [[H559]] Oh that [[H5414]] I had wings [[H83]] like a dove! [[H3123]] would I fly away, [[H5774]] and be at rest. [[H7931]]

### 7
Lo, [[H2009]] would I wander [[H5074]] far off, [[H7368]] remain [[H3885]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 8
I would hasten [[H2363]] my escape [[H4655]] from the windy [[H7307]] storm [[H5584]] tempest. [[H5591]]

### 9
Destroy, [[H1104]] O Lord, [[H136]] divide [[H6385]] their tongues: [[H3956]] for [[H3588]] I have seen [[H7200]] violence [[H2555]] and strife [[H7379]] in the city. [[H5892]]

### 10
Day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] they go about [[H5437]] it upon [[H5921]] the walls [[H2346]] thereof: mischief [[H205]] also and sorrow [[H5999]] in the midst [[H7130]] of it. [[H7130]]

### 11
Wickedness [[H1942]] in the midst [[H7130]] thereof: deceit [[H8496]] and guile [[H4820]] depart [[H4185]] not [[H3808]] from her streets. [[H7339]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] an enemy [[H341]] reproached [[H2778]] me; then I could have borne [[H5375]] neither [[H3808]] he that hated [[H8130]] me did magnify [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] me; then I would have hid myself [[H5641]] from [[H4480]] him: [[H4480]]

### 13
But thou, [[H859]] a man [[H582]] mine equal, [[H6187]] my guide, [[H441]] and mine acquaintance. [[H3045]]

### 14
We took sweet [[H4985]] counsel [[H5475]] together, [[H3162]] walked [[H1980]] unto the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] in company. [[H7285]]

### 15
Let death seize [[H5377]] upon [[H5921]] them, let them go down [[H3381]] quick [[H2416]] into hell: [[H7585]] for [[H3588]] wickedness [[H7451]] in their dwellings, [[H4033]] among them. [[H7130]]

### 16
As for me, I [[H589]] will call [[H7121]] upon [[H413]] God; [[H430]] and the Lord [[H3068]] shall save [[H3467]] me. [[H3467]]

### 17
Evening, [[H6153]] and morning, [[H1242]] and at noon, [[H6672]] will I pray, [[H7878]] and cry aloud: [[H1993]] and he shall hear [[H8085]] my voice. [[H6963]]

### 18
He hath delivered [[H6299]] my soul [[H5315]] in peace [[H7965]] from the battle [[H7128]] against me: for [[H3588]] there were [[H1961]] many [[H7227]] with [[H5978]] me. [[H5978]]

### 19
God [[H410]] shall hear, [[H8085]] and afflict [[H6031]] them, even he that abideth [[H3427]] of old. [[H6924]] Selah. [[H5542]] Because [[H834]] they have no [[H369]] changes, [[H2487]] therefore they fear [[H3372]] not [[H3808]] God. [[H430]]

### 20
He hath put forth [[H7971]] his hands [[H3027]] against such as be at peace [[H7965]] with him: he hath broken [[H2490]] his covenant. [[H1285]]

### 21
of his mouth [[H6310]] were smoother [[H2505]] than butter, [[H4260]] but war [[H7128]] in his heart: [[H3820]] his words [[H1697]] were softer [[H7401]] than oil, [[H8081]] yet they [[H1992]] drawn swords. [[H6609]]

### 22
Cast [[H7993]] thy burden [[H3053]] upon [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he [[H1931]] shall sustain [[H3557]] thee: he shall never [[H5769]] suffer [[H5414]] the righteous [[H6662]] to be moved. [[H4131]]

### 23
But thou, [[H859]] O God, [[H430]] shalt bring them down [[H3381]] into the pit [[H875]] of destruction: [[H7845]] bloody [[H1818]] and deceitful [[H4820]] men [[H582]] shall not [[H3808]] live out half [[H2673]] their days; [[H3117]] but I [[H589]] will trust [[H982]] in thee. [[H982]]
