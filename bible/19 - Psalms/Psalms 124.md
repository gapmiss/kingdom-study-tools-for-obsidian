A Song [[H7892]] of degrees [[H4609]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
If [[H3884]] the Lord [[H3068]] who was [[H1961]] on our side, now [[H4994]] may Israel [[H3478]] say; [[H559]]

### 2
If [[H3884]] the Lord [[H3068]] who was [[H1961]] on our side, when men [[H120]] rose up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] us: [[H5921]]

### 3
Then [[H233]] they had swallowed us up [[H1104]] quick, [[H2416]] when their wrath [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] against us: [[H2734]]

### 4
Then [[H233]] the waters [[H4325]] had overwhelmed [[H7857]] us, the stream [[H5158]] had gone over [[H5674]] our soul: [[H5315]]

### 5
Then [[H233]] the proud [[H2121]] waters [[H4325]] had gone over [[H5674]] our soul. [[H5315]]

### 6
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] who hath not [[H3808]] given [[H5414]] us a prey [[H2964]] to their teeth. [[H8127]]

### 7
Our soul [[H5315]] is escaped [[H4422]] as a bird [[H6833]] out of the snare [[H6341]] of the fowlers: [[H3369]] the snare [[H6341]] is broken, [[H7665]] and we [[H587]] are escaped. [[H4422]]

### 8
Our help [[H5828]] in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] who made [[H6213]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]]
