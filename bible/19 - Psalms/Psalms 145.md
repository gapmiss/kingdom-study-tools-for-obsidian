The Lord [[H3068]] gracious, [[H2587]] and full of compassion; [[H7349]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] and of great [[H1419]] mercy. [[H2617]]

The eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] wait [[H7663]] upon [[H413]] thee; and thou [[H859]] givest [[H5414]]  them [[H853]] their meat [[H400]] in due season. [[H6256]]

### 16
