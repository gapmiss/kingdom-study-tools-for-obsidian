Shiggaion [[H7692]] of David, [[H1732]] which [[H834]] he sang [[H7891]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] concerning [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of Cush [[H3568]] the Benjamite. [[H1121]]

### 1
O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] in thee do I put my trust: [[H2620]] save me [[H3467]] from all [[H3605]] them that persecute me, [[H7291]] and deliver me: [[H5337]]

### 2
Lest [[H6435]] he tear [[H2963]] my soul [[H5315]] like a lion, [[H738]] rending in pieces, [[H6561]] while none [[H369]] to deliver. [[H5337]]

### 3
O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] if [[H518]] I have done [[H6213]] this; [[H2063]] if [[H518]] there be [[H3426]] iniquity [[H5766]] in my hands; [[H3709]]

### 4
If [[H518]] I have rewarded [[H1580]] evil [[H7451]] unto him that was at peace [[H7999]] with me; (yea, I have delivered [[H2502]] him that without cause [[H7387]] is mine enemy:) [[H6887]]

### 5
Let the enemy [[H341]] persecute [[H7291]] my soul, [[H5315]] and take [[H5381]] yea, let him tread down [[H7429]] my life [[H2416]] upon the earth, [[H776]] and lay [[H7931]] mine honour [[H3519]] in the dust. [[H6083]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 6
Arise, [[H6965]] O Lord, [[H3068]] in thine anger, [[H639]] lift up thyself [[H5375]] because of the rage [[H5678]] of mine enemies: [[H6887]] and awake [[H5782]] for [[H413]] me the judgment [[H4941]] thou hast commanded. [[H6680]]

### 7
So shall the congregation [[H5712]] of the people [[H3816]] compass thee about: [[H5437]] for their sakes [[H5921]] therefore return [[H7725]] thou on high. [[H4791]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] shall judge [[H1777]] the people: [[H5971]] judge [[H8199]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] according to my righteousness, [[H6664]] and according to mine integrity [[H8537]] in [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 9
Oh [[H4994]] let the wickedness [[H7451]] of the wicked [[H7563]] come to an end; [[H1584]] but establish [[H3559]] the just: [[H6662]] for the righteous [[H6662]] God [[H430]] trieth [[H974]] the hearts [[H3826]] and reins. [[H3629]]

### 10
My defence [[H4043]] of [[H5921]] God, [[H430]] which saveth [[H3467]] the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]

### 11
God [[H430]] judgeth [[H8199]] the righteous, [[H6662]] and God [[H410]] is angry [[H2194]] every [[H3605]] day. [[H3117]]

### 12
If [[H518]] he turn [[H7725]] not, [[H3808]] he will whet [[H3913]] his sword; [[H2719]] he hath bent [[H1869]] his bow, [[H7198]] and made it ready. [[H3559]]

### 13
He hath also prepared [[H3559]] for him the instruments [[H3627]] of death; [[H4194]] he ordaineth [[H6466]] his arrows [[H2671]] against the persecutors. [[H1814]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2009]] he travaileth [[H2254]] with iniquity, [[H205]] and hath conceived [[H2029]] mischief, [[H5999]] and brought forth [[H3205]] falsehood. [[H8267]]

### 15
He made [[H3738]] a pit, [[H953]] and digged [[H2658]] it, and is fallen [[H5307]] into the ditch [[H7845]] he made. [[H6466]]

### 16
His mischief [[H5999]] shall return [[H7725]] upon his own head, [[H7218]] and his violent dealing [[H2555]] shall come down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] his own pate. [[H6936]]

### 17
I will praise [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] according to his righteousness: [[H6664]] and will sing praise [[H2167]] to the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] most high. [[H5945]]
