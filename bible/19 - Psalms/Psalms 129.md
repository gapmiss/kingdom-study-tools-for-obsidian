A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
Many a time [[H7227]] have they afflicted [[H6887]] me from my youth, [[H5271]] may Israel [[H3478]] now [[H4994]] say: [[H559]]

### 2
Many a time [[H7227]] have they afflicted [[H6887]] me from my youth: [[H5271]] yet [[H1571]] they have not [[H3808]] prevailed [[H3201]] against me. [[H3201]]

### 3
The plowers [[H2790]] plowed [[H2790]] upon [[H5921]] my back: [[H1354]] they made long [[H748]] their furrows. [[H4618]]

### 4
The Lord [[H3068]] righteous: [[H6662]] he hath cut asunder [[H7112]] the cords [[H5688]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 5
Let them all [[H3605]] be confounded [[H954]] and turned [[H5472]] back [[H268]] that hate [[H8130]] Zion. [[H6726]]

### 6
Let them be [[H1961]] as the grass [[H2682]] the housetops, [[H1406]] which withereth [[H3001]] afore [[H6927]] it groweth up: [[H8025]]

### 7
Wherewith the mower [[H7114]] filleth [[H4390]] not [[H3808]] his hand; [[H3709]] nor he that bindeth sheaves [[H6014]] his bosom. [[H2683]]

### 8
Neither [[H3808]] do they which go by [[H5674]] say, [[H559]] The blessing [[H1293]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H413]] you: we bless [[H1288]] you in the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
