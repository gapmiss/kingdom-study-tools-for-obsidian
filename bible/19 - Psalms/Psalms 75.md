To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] Al-taschith, [[H516]] A Psalm [[H4210]] Song [[H7892]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
Unto thee, O God, [[H430]] do we give thanks, [[H3034]] do we give thanks: [[H3034]] for thy name [[H8034]] is near [[H7138]] thy wondrous works [[H6381]] declare. [[H5608]]

### 2
When [[H3588]] I shall receive [[H3947]] the congregation [[H4150]] I [[H589]] will judge [[H8199]] uprightly. [[H4339]]

### 3
The earth [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] thereof are dissolved: [[H4127]] I [[H595]] bear up [[H8505]] the pillars [[H5982]] of it. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 4
I said [[H559]] unto the fools, [[H1984]] Deal not foolishly: [[H1984]] and to the wicked, [[H7563]] Lift not up [[H7311]] the horn: [[H7161]]

### 5
Lift not up [[H7311]] your horn [[H7161]] on high: [[H4791]] speak [[H1696]] a stiff [[H6277]] neck. [[H6677]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] promotion [[H7311]] neither [[H3808]] from the east, [[H4161]] nor from the west, [[H4628]] nor [[H3808]] from the south. [[H4057]]

### 7
But [[H3588]] God [[H430]] the judge: [[H8199]] he putteth down [[H8213]] one, [[H2088]] and setteth up [[H7311]] another. [[H7311]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H3068]] a cup, [[H3563]] and the wine [[H3196]] is red; [[H2560]] it is full [[H4392]] of mixture; [[H4538]] and he poureth out [[H5064]] of the same: [[H2088]] but [[H389]] the dregs [[H8105]] thereof, all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7563]] of the earth [[H776]] shall wring out, [[H4680]] drink [[H8354]]

### 9
But I [[H589]] will declare [[H5046]] for ever; [[H5769]] I will sing praises [[H2167]] to the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] the horns [[H7161]] of the wicked [[H7563]] also will I cut off; [[H1438]] the horns [[H7161]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shall be exalted. [[H7311]]
