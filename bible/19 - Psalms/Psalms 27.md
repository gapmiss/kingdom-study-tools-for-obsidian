of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
The Lord [[H3068]] my light [[H216]] and my salvation; [[H3468]] whom [[H4310]] shall I fear? [[H3372]] the Lord [[H3068]] the strength [[H4581]] of my life; [[H2416]] of whom [[H4310]] shall I be afraid? [[H6342]]

### 2
When the wicked, [[H7489]] mine enemies [[H6862]] and my foes, [[H341]] came [[H7126]] upon [[H5921]] me to eat up [[H398]] my flesh, [[H1320]] they [[H1992]] stumbled [[H3782]] and fell. [[H5307]]

### 3
Though [[H518]] an host [[H4264]] should encamp [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] me, my heart [[H3820]] shall not [[H3808]] fear: [[H3372]] though [[H518]] war [[H4421]] should rise [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] me, in this [[H2063]] I [[H589]] confident. [[H982]]

### 4
One [[H259]] have I desired [[H7592]] of [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] that will I seek after; [[H1245]] that I may dwell [[H3427]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of my life, [[H2416]] to behold [[H2372]] the beauty [[H5278]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and to inquire [[H1239]] in his temple. [[H1964]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] in the time [[H3117]] of trouble [[H7451]] he shall hide [[H6845]] me in his pavilion: [[H5520]] in the secret [[H5643]] of his tabernacle [[H168]] shall he hide [[H5641]] me; he shall set me up [[H7311]] upon a rock. [[H6697]]

### 6
And now [[H6258]] shall mine head [[H7218]] be lifted up [[H7311]] above [[H5921]] mine enemies [[H341]] round about [[H5439]] me: therefore will I offer [[H2076]] in his tabernacle [[H168]] sacrifices [[H2077]] of joy; [[H8643]] I will sing, [[H7891]] yea, I will sing praises [[H2167]] unto the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
Hear, [[H8085]] O Lord, [[H3068]] I cry [[H7121]] with my voice: [[H6963]] have mercy [[H2603]] also upon me, and answer [[H6030]] me. [[H6030]]

### 8
Seek [[H1245]] ye my face; [[H6440]] my heart [[H3820]] said [[H559]]  unto thee, [[H853]] Thy face, [[H6440]] Lord, [[H3068]] will I seek. [[H1245]]

### 9
Hide [[H5641]] not [[H408]] thy face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] me; put [[H5186]] not thy servant [[H5650]]  away [[H408]] in anger: [[H639]] thou hast been [[H1961]] my help; [[H5833]] leave [[H5203]] me not, [[H408]] neither [[H408]] forsake [[H5800]] me, O God [[H430]] of my salvation. [[H3468]]

### 10
When [[H3588]] my father [[H1]] and my mother [[H517]] forsake [[H5800]] me, then the Lord [[H3068]] will take me up. [[H622]]

### 11
Teach [[H3384]] me thy way, [[H1870]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and lead [[H5148]] me in a plain [[H4334]] path, [[H734]] because of [[H4616]] mine enemies. [[H8324]]

### 12
Deliver [[H5414]] me not [[H408]] over unto the will [[H5315]] of mine enemies: [[H6862]] for [[H3588]] false [[H8267]] witnesses [[H5707]] are risen up [[H6965]] against me, and such as breathe out [[H3307]] cruelty. [[H2555]]

### 13
unless [[H3884]] I had believed [[H539]] to see [[H7200]] the goodness [[H2898]] of the Lord [[H3068]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 14
Wait [[H6960]] on [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] be of good courage, [[H2388]] and he shall strengthen [[H553]] thine heart: [[H3820]] wait, [[H6960]] I say, on [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]
