A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
Truly [[H389]] God [[H430]] good [[H2896]] to Israel, [[H3478]] to such as are of a clean [[H1249]] heart. [[H3824]]

### 2
But as for me, [[H589]] my feet [[H7272]] were almost [[H4592]] gone; [[H5186]] my steps [[H838]] had well nigh [[H369]] slipped. [[H8210]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] I was envious [[H7065]] at the foolish, [[H1984]] I saw [[H7200]] the prosperity [[H7965]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] no [[H369]] bands [[H2784]] in their death: [[H4194]] but their strength [[H193]] firm. [[H1277]]

### 5
They not [[H369]] in trouble [[H5999]] men; [[H582]] neither [[H3808]] are they plagued [[H5060]] like [[H5973]] men. [[H120]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] pride [[H1346]] compasseth them about as a chain; [[H6059]] violence [[H2555]] covereth [[H5848]] them a garment. [[H7897]]

### 7
Their eyes [[H5869]] stand out [[H3318]] with fatness: [[H2459]] they have more [[H5674]] than heart [[H3824]] could wish. [[H4906]]

### 8
They are corrupt, [[H4167]] and speak [[H1696]] wickedly [[H7451]] oppression: [[H6233]] they speak [[H1696]] loftily. [[H4791]]

### 9
They set [[H8371]] their mouth [[H6310]] against the heavens, [[H8064]] and their tongue [[H3956]] walketh [[H1980]] through the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
Therefore [[H3651]] his people [[H5971]] return [[H7725]] hither: [[H1988]] and waters [[H4325]] of a full [[H4392]] are wrung out [[H4680]] to them. [[H4680]]

### 11
And they say, [[H559]] How [[H349]] doth God [[H410]] know? [[H3045]] and is there [[H3426]] knowledge [[H1844]] in the most High? [[H5945]]

### 12
Behold, [[H2009]] these [[H428]] the ungodly, [[H7563]] who prosper [[H7961]] in the world; [[H5769]] they increase [[H7685]] riches. [[H2428]]

### 13
Verily [[H389]] I have cleansed [[H2135]] my heart [[H3824]] vain, [[H7385]] and washed [[H7364]] my hands [[H3709]] in innocency. [[H5356]]

### 14
For all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long have I been [[H1961]] plagued, [[H5060]] and chastened [[H8433]] every morning. [[H1242]]

### 15
If [[H518]] I say, [[H559]] I will speak [[H5608]] thus; [[H3644]] behold, [[H2009]] I should offend [[H898]] the generation [[H1755]] of thy children. [[H1121]]

### 16
When I thought [[H2803]] to know [[H3045]] this, [[H2063]] it [[H1931]] too painful [[H5999]] for me; [[H5869]]

### 17
Until [[H5704]] I went [[H935]] into [[H413]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] of God; [[H410]] understood [[H995]] I their end. [[H319]]

### 18
Surely [[H389]] thou didst set [[H7896]] them in slippery places: [[H2513]] thou castedst them down [[H5307]] into destruction. [[H4876]]

### 19
How [[H349]] are [[H1961]] they into desolation, [[H8047]] as in a moment! [[H7281]] they are utterly [[H5486]] consumed [[H8552]] with [[H4480]] terrors. [[H1091]]

### 20
As a dream [[H2472]] when awaketh; [[H6974]] O Lord, [[H136]] when thou awakest, [[H5782]] thou shalt despise [[H959]] their image. [[H6754]]

### 21
Thus [[H3588]] my heart [[H3824]] was grieved, [[H2556]] and I was pricked [[H8150]] in my reins. [[H3629]]

### 22
So foolish [[H1198]] I, [[H589]] and ignorant: [[H3045]] I was [[H1961]] a beast [[H929]] before [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 23
Nevertheless I [[H589]] continually [[H8548]] with [[H5973]] thee: thou hast holden [[H270]] by my right [[H3225]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 24
Thou shalt guide [[H5148]] me with thy counsel, [[H6098]] and afterward [[H310]] receive [[H3947]] me glory. [[H3519]]

### 25
Whom [[H4310]] have I in heaven [[H8064]] and none [[H3808]] upon earth [[H776]] I desire [[H2654]] beside [[H5973]] thee. [[H5973]]

### 26
My flesh [[H7607]] and my heart [[H3824]] faileth: [[H3615]] God [[H430]] the strength [[H6697]] of my heart, [[H3824]] and my portion [[H2506]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 27
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] they that are far [[H7369]] from thee shall perish: [[H6]] thou hast destroyed [[H6789]] all [[H3605]] them that go a whoring [[H2181]] from [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 28
But [[H589]] good [[H2896]] for me to draw near [[H7132]] to God: [[H430]] I have put [[H7896]] my trust [[H4268]] in the Lord [[H136]] God, [[H3069]] that I may declare [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] thy works. [[H4399]]
