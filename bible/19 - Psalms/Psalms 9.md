To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Muth-labben, [[H4192]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
I will praise [[H3034]] O Lord, [[H3068]] with my whole [[H3605]] heart; [[H3820]] I will shew forth [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] thy marvellous works. [[H6381]]

### 2
I will be glad [[H8055]] and rejoice [[H5970]] in thee: I will sing praise [[H2167]] to thy name, [[H8034]] O thou most High. [[H5945]]

### 3
When mine enemies [[H341]] are turned [[H7725]] back, [[H268]] they shall fall [[H3782]] and perish [[H6]] at thy presence. [[H6440]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thou hast maintained [[H6213]] my right [[H4941]] and my cause; [[H1779]] thou satest [[H3427]] in the throne [[H3678]] judging [[H8199]] right. [[H6664]]

### 5
Thou hast rebuked [[H1605]] the heathen, [[H1471]] thou hast destroyed [[H6]] the wicked, [[H7563]] thou hast put out [[H4229]] their name [[H8034]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

### 6
O thou enemy, [[H341]] destructions [[H2723]] are come to a perpetual [[H5331]] end: [[H8552]] and thou hast destroyed [[H5428]] cities; [[H5892]] their memorial [[H2143]] is perished [[H6]] with them. [[H1992]]

### 7
But the Lord [[H3068]] shall endure [[H3427]] for ever: [[H5769]] he hath prepared [[H3559]] his throne [[H3678]] for judgment. [[H4941]]

### 8
And he [[H1931]] shall judge [[H8199]] the world [[H8398]] in righteousness, [[H6664]] he shall minister judgment [[H1777]] to the people [[H3816]] in uprightness. [[H4339]]

### 9
The Lord [[H3068]] also will be [[H1961]] a refuge [[H4869]] for the oppressed, [[H1790]] a refuge [[H4869]] in times [[H6256]] of trouble. [[H6869]]

### 10
And they that know [[H3045]] thy name [[H8034]] will put their trust [[H982]] in thee: for [[H3588]] thou, Lord, [[H3068]] hast not [[H3808]] forsaken [[H5800]] them that seek [[H1875]] thee. [[H1875]]

### 11
Sing praises [[H2167]] to the Lord, [[H3068]] which dwelleth [[H3427]] in Zion: [[H6726]] declare [[H5046]] among the people [[H5971]] his doings. [[H5949]]

### 12
When [[H3588]] he maketh inquisition [[H1875]] for blood, [[H1818]] he remembereth [[H2142]] them: he forgetteth [[H7911]] not [[H3808]] the cry [[H6818]] of the humble. [[H6035]]

### 13
Have mercy [[H2603]] upon me, O Lord; [[H3068]] consider [[H7200]] my trouble [[H6040]] of them that hate [[H8130]] me, thou that liftest me up [[H7311]] from the gates [[H8179]] of death: [[H4194]]

### 14
That [[H4616]] I may shew forth [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] thy praise [[H8416]] in the gates [[H8179]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion: [[H6726]] I will rejoice [[H1523]] in thy salvation. [[H3444]]

### 15
The heathen [[H1471]] are sunk down [[H2883]] in the pit [[H7845]] they made: [[H6213]] in the net [[H7568]] which [[H2098]] they hid [[H2934]] is their own foot [[H7272]] taken. [[H3920]]

### 16
The Lord [[H3068]] is known [[H3045]] the judgment [[H4941]] he executeth: [[H6213]] the wicked [[H7563]] is snared [[H5367]] in the work [[H6467]] of his own hands. [[H3709]] Higgaion. [[H1902]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 17
The wicked [[H7563]] shall be turned [[H7725]] into hell, [[H7585]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that forget [[H7913]] God. [[H430]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] the needy [[H34]] shall not [[H3808]] alway [[H5331]] be forgotten: [[H7911]] the expectation [[H8615]] of the poor [[H6035]] shall perish [[H6]] for ever. [[H5703]]

### 19
Arise, [[H6965]] O Lord; [[H3068]] let not [[H408]] man [[H376]] prevail: [[H5810]] let the heathen [[H1471]] be judged [[H8199]] in [[H5921]] thy sight. [[H6440]]

### 20
Put [[H7896]] them in fear, [[H4172]] O Lord: [[H3068]] the nations [[H1471]] may know [[H3045]] themselves [[H1992]] men. [[H582]] Selah. [[H5542]]
