To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] to [[H5921]] Jeduthun, [[H3038]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Truly [[H389]] my soul [[H5315]] waiteth [[H1747]] upon [[H413]] God: [[H430]] from [[H4480]] him my salvation. [[H3444]]

### 2
He [[H1931]] only [[H389]] my rock [[H6697]] and my salvation; [[H3444]] my defence; [[H4869]] I shall not [[H3808]] be greatly [[H7227]] moved. [[H4131]]

### 3
How long [[H5704]] will ye imagine mischief [[H2050]] against [[H5921]] a man? [[H376]] ye shall be slain [[H7523]] all [[H3605]] of you: as a bowing [[H5186]] wall [[H7023]] a tottering [[H1760]] fence. [[H1447]]

### 4
They only [[H389]] consult [[H3289]] to cast down [[H5080]] from his excellency: [[H7613]] they delight [[H7521]] in lies: [[H3577]] they bless [[H1288]] with their mouth, [[H6310]] but they curse [[H7043]] inwardly. [[H7130]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
My soul, [[H5315]] wait [[H1826]] thou only [[H389]] upon God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] my expectation [[H8615]] from [[H4480]] him. [[H4480]]

### 6
He [[H1931]] only [[H389]] my rock [[H6697]] and my salvation: [[H3444]] my defence; [[H4869]] I shall not [[H3808]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 7
In [[H5921]] God [[H430]] my salvation [[H3468]] and my glory: [[H3519]] the rock [[H6697]] of my strength, [[H5797]] my refuge, [[H4268]] in God. [[H430]]

### 8
Trust [[H982]] in him at all [[H3605]] times; [[H6256]] ye people, [[H5971]] pour out [[H8210]] your heart [[H3824]] before [[H6440]] him: God [[H430]] a refuge [[H4268]] for us. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 9
Surely [[H389]] men [[H120]] of low degree [[H1121]] vanity, [[H1892]] men [[H376]] of high degree [[H1121]] a lie: [[H3577]] to be laid [[H5927]] in the balance, [[H3976]] they [[H1992]] altogether [[H3162]] than vanity. [[H1892]]

### 10
Trust [[H982]] not [[H408]] in oppression, [[H6233]] and become not vain [[H1891]] in robbery: [[H1498]] if [[H3588]] riches [[H2428]] increase, [[H5107]] set [[H7896]] not [[H408]] your heart [[H3820]]

### 11
God [[H430]] hath spoken [[H1696]] once; [[H259]] twice [[H8147]] have I heard [[H8085]] this; [[H2098]] that [[H3588]] power [[H5797]] unto God. [[H430]]

### 12
Also unto thee, O Lord, [[H136]] mercy: [[H2617]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] renderest [[H7999]] to every man [[H376]] according to his work. [[H4639]]
