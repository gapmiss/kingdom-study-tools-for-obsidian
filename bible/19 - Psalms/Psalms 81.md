To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Gittith, [[H1665]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
Sing aloud [[H7442]] unto God [[H430]] our strength: [[H5797]] make a joyful noise [[H7321]] unto the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 2
Take [[H5375]] a psalm, [[H2172]] and bring [[H5414]] hither the timbrel, [[H8596]] the pleasant [[H5273]] harp [[H3658]] with [[H5973]] the psaltery. [[H5035]]

### 3
Blow up [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] in the new moon, [[H2320]] in the time appointed, [[H3677]] on our solemn feast [[H2282]] day. [[H3117]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] a statute [[H2706]] for Israel, [[H3478]] a law [[H4941]] of the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 5
This he ordained [[H7760]] in Joseph [[H3084]] a testimony, [[H5715]] when he went out [[H3318]] through [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] I heard [[H8085]] a language [[H8193]] I understood [[H3045]] not. [[H3045]]

### 6
I removed [[H5493]] his shoulder [[H7926]] from the burden: [[H5447]] his hands [[H3709]] were delivered [[H5674]] from the pots. [[H1731]]

### 7
Thou calledst [[H7121]] in trouble, [[H6869]] and I delivered [[H2502]] thee; I answered [[H6030]] thee in the secret place [[H5643]] of thunder: [[H7482]] I proved [[H974]] thee at [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Meribah. [[H4809]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 8
Hear, [[H8085]] O my people, [[H5971]] and I will testify [[H5749]] unto thee: O Israel, [[H3478]] if [[H518]] thou wilt hearken [[H8085]] unto me; [[H8085]]

### 9
There shall no [[H3808]] strange [[H2114]] god [[H410]] be [[H1961]] in thee; neither [[H3808]] shalt thou worship [[H7812]] any strange [[H5236]] god. [[H410]]

### 10
I [[H595]] the Lord [[H3068]] thy God, [[H430]] which brought [[H5927]] thee out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt: [[H4714]] open thy mouth [[H6310]] wide, [[H7337]] and I will fill [[H4390]] it. [[H4390]]

### 11
But my people [[H5971]] would not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] to my voice; [[H6963]] and Israel [[H3478]] would [[H14]] none [[H3808]] of me. [[H3808]]

### 12
So I gave them up [[H7971]] unto their own hearts' [[H3820]] lust: [[H8307]] they walked [[H1980]] in their own counsels. [[H4156]]

### 13
Oh that [[H3863]] my people [[H5971]] had hearkened [[H8085]] unto me, Israel [[H3478]] had walked [[H1980]] in my ways! [[H1870]]

### 14
I should soon [[H4592]] have subdued [[H3665]] their enemies, [[H341]] and turned [[H7725]] my hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] their adversaries. [[H6862]]

### 15
The haters [[H8130]] of the Lord [[H3068]] should have submitted [[H3584]] themselves unto him: but their time [[H6256]] should have endured [[H1961]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 16
He should have fed [[H398]] them also with the finest [[H2459]] of the wheat: [[H2406]] and with honey [[H1706]] out of the rock [[H6697]] should I have satisfied [[H7646]] thee. [[H7646]]
