A Song [[H7892]] of degrees [[H4609]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
I was glad [[H8055]] when they said [[H559]] unto me, Let us go [[H1980]] into the house [[H1004]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
Our feet [[H7272]] shall [[H1961]] stand [[H5975]] within thy gates, [[H8179]] O Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
Jerusalem [[H3389]] is builded [[H1129]] as a city [[H5892]] that is compact [[H2266]] together: [[H3162]]

### 4
Whither [[H8033]] the tribes [[H7626]] go up, [[H5927]] the tribes [[H7626]] of the Lord, [[H3050]] unto the testimony [[H5715]] of Israel, [[H3478]] to give thanks [[H3034]] unto the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] are set [[H3427]] thrones [[H3678]] of judgment, [[H4941]] the thrones [[H3678]] of the house [[H1004]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 6
Pray [[H7592]] for the peace [[H7965]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] they shall prosper [[H7951]] that love [[H157]] thee. [[H157]]

### 7
Peace [[H7965]] be [[H1961]] within thy walls, [[H2426]] prosperity [[H7962]] within thy palaces. [[H759]]

### 8
For [[H4616]] my brethren [[H251]] and companions' [[H7453]] sakes, I will now [[H4994]] say, [[H1696]] Peace [[H7965]] within thee. [[H7965]]

### 9
Because of [[H4616]] the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] I will seek [[H1245]] thy good. [[H2896]]
