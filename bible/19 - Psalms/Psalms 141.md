A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Lord, [[H3068]] I cry [[H7121]] unto thee: make haste [[H2363]] unto me; give ear [[H238]] unto my voice, [[H6963]] when I cry [[H7121]] unto thee. [[H7121]]

### 2
Let my prayer [[H8605]] be set forth [[H3559]] before [[H6440]] thee incense; [[H7004]] the lifting up [[H4864]] of my hands [[H3709]] the evening [[H6153]] sacrifice. [[H4503]]

### 3
Set [[H7896]] a watch, [[H8108]] O Lord, [[H3068]] before my mouth; [[H6310]] keep [[H5341]] the door [[H1817]] of my lips. [[H8193]]

### 4
Incline [[H5186]] not [[H408]] my heart [[H3820]] to evil [[H7451]] thing, [[H1697]] to practise [[H5953]] wicked [[H7562]] works [[H5949]] with [[H854]] men [[H582]] that work [[H6466]] iniquity: [[H205]] and let me not [[H1077]] eat [[H3898]] of their dainties. [[H4516]]

### 5
Let the righteous [[H6662]] smite [[H1986]] me; a kindness: [[H2617]] and let him reprove [[H3198]] me; an excellent [[H7218]] oil, [[H8081]] shall not [[H408]] break [[H5106]] my head: [[H7218]] for [[H3588]] yet [[H5750]] my prayer [[H8605]] also in their calamities. [[H7451]]

### 6
When their judges [[H8199]] are overthrown [[H8058]] in stony [[H5553]] places, [[H3027]] they shall hear [[H8085]] my words; [[H561]] for [[H3588]] they are sweet. [[H5276]]

### 7
Our bones [[H6106]] are scattered [[H6340]] at the grave's [[H7585]] mouth, [[H6310]] as when [[H3644]] one cutteth [[H6398]] and cleaveth [[H1234]] upon the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
But [[H3588]] mine eyes [[H5869]] unto [[H413]] thee, O God [[H3068]] the Lord: [[H136]] in thee is my trust; [[H2620]] leave [[H6168]] not my soul [[H5315]] destitute. [[H5315]]

### 9
Keep [[H8104]] me from the snares [[H6341]] they have laid [[H3369]] for me, and the gins [[H4170]] of the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity. [[H205]]

### 10
Let the wicked [[H7563]] fall [[H5307]] into their own nets, [[H4364]] whilst [[H5704]] that I [[H595]] withal [[H3162]] escape. [[H5674]]
