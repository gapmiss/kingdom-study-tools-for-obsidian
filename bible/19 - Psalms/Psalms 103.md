of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Bless [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O my soul: [[H5315]] and all [[H3605]] that is within [[H7130]]  me, [[H853]] his holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]]

### 2
Bless [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O my soul, [[H5315]] and forget [[H7911]] not [[H408]] all [[H3605]] his benefits: [[H1576]]

### 3
Who forgiveth [[H5545]] all [[H3605]] thine iniquities; [[H5771]] who healeth [[H7495]] all [[H3605]] thy diseases; [[H8463]]

### 4
Who redeemeth [[H1350]] thy life [[H2416]] from destruction; [[H7845]] who crowneth [[H5849]] thee with lovingkindness [[H2617]] and tender mercies; [[H7356]]

### 5
Who satisfieth [[H7646]] thy mouth [[H5716]] with good [[H2896]] thy youth [[H5271]] is renewed [[H2318]] like the eagle's. [[H5404]]

### 6
The Lord [[H3068]] executeth [[H6213]] righteousness [[H6666]] and judgment [[H4941]] for all [[H3605]] that are oppressed. [[H6231]]

### 7
He made known [[H3045]] his ways [[H1870]] unto Moses, [[H4872]] his acts [[H5949]] unto the children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] merciful [[H7349]] and gracious, [[H2587]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] and plenteous [[H7227]] in mercy. [[H2617]]

### 9
He will not [[H3808]] always [[H5331]] chide: [[H7378]] neither [[H3808]] will he keep [[H5201]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 10
He hath not [[H3808]] dealt [[H6213]] with us after our sins; [[H2399]] nor [[H3808]] rewarded [[H1580]] us according to our iniquities. [[H5771]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] as the heaven [[H8064]] is high above [[H1361]] the earth, [[H776]] great [[H1396]] is his mercy [[H2617]] toward [[H5921]] them that fear [[H3373]] him. [[H3373]]

### 12
As far as [[H7368]] the east [[H4217]] is from the west, [[H4628]] far hath he removed [[H7368]] our transgressions [[H6588]] from us. [[H4480]]

### 13
Like as a father [[H1]] pitieth [[H7355]] children, [[H1121]] the Lord [[H3068]] pitieth [[H7355]] them that fear [[H3373]] him. [[H3373]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] knoweth [[H3045]] our frame; [[H3336]] he remembereth [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] we [[H587]] dust. [[H6083]]

### 15
man, [[H376]] his days [[H3117]] as grass: [[H2682]] as a flower [[H6731]] of the field, [[H7704]] so [[H3651]] he flourisheth. [[H6692]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] the wind [[H7307]] passeth over [[H5674]] it, and it is gone; [[H369]] and the place [[H4725]] thereof shall know [[H5234]] it no [[H3808]] more. [[H3808]]

### 17
But the mercy [[H2617]] of the Lord [[H3068]] from everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting [[H5769]] upon [[H5921]] them that fear [[H3373]] him, and his righteousness [[H6666]] unto children's [[H1121]] children; [[H1121]]

### 18
To such as keep [[H8104]] his covenant, [[H1285]] and to those that remember [[H2142]] his commandments [[H6490]] to do [[H6213]] them. [[H6213]]

### 19
The Lord [[H3068]] hath prepared [[H3559]] his throne [[H3678]] in the heavens; [[H8064]] and his kingdom [[H4438]] ruleth [[H4910]] over all. [[H4910]]

### 20
Bless [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] ye his angels, [[H4397]] that excel [[H1368]] in strength, [[H3581]] that do [[H6213]] his commandments, [[H1697]] hearkening [[H8085]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of his word. [[H1697]]

### 21
Bless [[H1288]] ye the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] his hosts; [[H6635]] ministers [[H8334]] of his, that do [[H6213]] his pleasure. [[H7522]]

### 22
Bless [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] his works [[H4639]] in all [[H3605]] places [[H4725]] of his dominion: [[H4475]] bless [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O my soul. [[H5315]]
