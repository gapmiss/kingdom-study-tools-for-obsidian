A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
The Lord [[H3068]] my shepherd; [[H7462]] I shall not [[H3808]] want. [[H2637]]

### 2
He maketh me to lie down [[H7257]] in green [[H1877]] pastures: [[H4999]] he leadeth [[H5095]] me beside [[H5921]] the still [[H4496]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 3
He restoreth [[H7725]] my soul: [[H5315]] he leadeth [[H5148]] me in the paths [[H4570]] of righteousness [[H6664]] for his name's [[H8034]] sake. [[H4616]]

### 4
Yea, [[H1571]] though [[H3588]] I walk [[H1980]] through the valley [[H1516]] of the shadow of death, [[H6757]] I will fear [[H3372]] no [[H3808]] evil: [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] with [[H5978]] me; thy rod [[H7626]] and thy staff [[H4938]] they [[H1992]] comfort [[H5162]] me. [[H5162]]

### 5
Thou preparest [[H6186]] a table [[H7979]] before [[H6440]] me in the presence [[H5048]] of mine enemies: [[H6887]] thou anointest [[H1878]] my head [[H7218]] with oil; [[H8081]] my cup [[H3563]] runneth over. [[H7310]]

### 6
Surely [[H389]] goodness [[H2896]] and mercy [[H2617]] shall follow [[H7291]] me all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of my life: [[H2416]] and I will dwell [[H3427]] in the house [[H1004]] of the Lord [[H3068]] for ever. [[H753]]
