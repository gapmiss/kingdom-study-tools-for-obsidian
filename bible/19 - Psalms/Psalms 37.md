of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Fret [[H2734]] not thyself [[H408]] because of evildoers, [[H7489]] neither [[H408]] be thou envious [[H7065]] against the workers [[H6213]] of iniquity. [[H5766]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] they shall soon [[H4120]] be cut down [[H5243]] like the grass, [[H2682]] and wither [[H5034]] as the green [[H3418]] herb. [[H1877]]

### 3
Trust [[H982]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] and do [[H6213]] good; [[H2896]] shalt thou dwell [[H7931]] in the land, [[H776]] and verily [[H530]] thou shalt be fed. [[H7462]]

### 4
Delight thyself [[H6026]] also in [[H5921]] the Lord; [[H3068]] and he shall give [[H5414]] thee the desires [[H4862]] of thine heart. [[H3820]]

### 5
Commit [[H1556]] thy way [[H1870]] unto [[H5921]] the Lord; [[H3068]] trust [[H982]] also in [[H5921]] him; and he [[H1931]] shall bring to pass. [[H6213]]

### 6
And he shall bring forth [[H3318]] thy righteousness [[H6664]] as the light, [[H216]] and thy judgment [[H4941]] as the noonday. [[H6672]]

### 7
Rest [[H1826]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] and wait patiently [[H2342]] for him: fret [[H2734]] not thyself [[H408]] because of him who prospereth [[H6743]] in his way, [[H1870]] because of the man [[H376]] who bringeth [[H6213]] wicked devices [[H4209]] to pass. [[H4209]]

### 8
Cease [[H7503]] from anger, [[H639]] and forsake [[H5800]] wrath: [[H2534]] fret [[H2734]] not thyself [[H408]] in any wise [[H389]] to do evil. [[H7489]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] evildoers [[H7489]] shall be cut off: [[H3772]] but those that wait upon [[H6960]] the Lord, [[H3068]] they [[H1992]] shall inherit [[H3423]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
For yet [[H5750]] a little while, [[H4592]] and the wicked [[H7563]] not [[H369]] yea, thou shalt diligently consider [[H995]] his place, [[H4725]] and it not [[H369]]

### 11
But the meek [[H6035]] shall inherit [[H3423]] the earth; [[H776]] and shall delight themselves [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] the abundance [[H7230]] of peace. [[H7965]]

### 12
The wicked [[H7563]] plotteth [[H2161]] against the just, [[H6662]] and gnasheth [[H2786]] upon [[H5921]] him with his teeth. [[H8127]]

### 13
The Lord [[H136]] shall laugh [[H7832]] at him: for [[H3588]] he seeth [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his day [[H3117]] is coming. [[H935]]

### 14
The wicked [[H7563]] have drawn out [[H6605]] the sword, [[H2719]] and have bent [[H1869]] their bow, [[H7198]] to cast down [[H5307]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] to slay [[H2873]] such as be of upright [[H3477]] conversation. [[H1870]]

### 15
Their sword [[H2719]] shall enter [[H935]] into their own heart, [[H3820]] and their bows [[H7198]] shall be broken. [[H7665]]

### 16
A little [[H4592]] that a righteous man [[H6662]] hath better [[H2896]] than the riches [[H1995]] of many [[H7227]] wicked. [[H7563]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] the arms [[H2220]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be broken: [[H7665]] but the Lord [[H3068]] upholdeth [[H5564]] the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 18
The Lord [[H3068]] knoweth [[H3045]] the days [[H3117]] of the upright: [[H8549]] and their inheritance [[H5159]] shall be [[H1961]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 19
They shall not [[H3808]] be ashamed [[H954]] in the evil [[H7451]] time: [[H6256]] and in the days [[H3117]] of famine [[H7459]] they shall be satisfied. [[H7646]]

### 20
But [[H3588]] the wicked [[H7563]] shall perish, [[H6]] and the enemies [[H341]] of the Lord [[H3068]] as the fat [[H3368]] of lambs: [[H3733]] they shall consume; [[H3615]] into smoke [[H6227]] shall they consume away. [[H3615]]

### 21
The wicked [[H7563]] borroweth, [[H3867]] and payeth [[H7999]] not [[H3808]] again: but the righteous [[H6662]] sheweth mercy, [[H2603]] and giveth. [[H5414]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] blessed [[H1288]] of him shall inherit [[H3423]] the earth; [[H776]] and cursed [[H7043]] of him shall be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 23
The steps [[H4703]] of a man [[H1397]] are ordered [[H3559]] by the Lord: [[H3068]] and he delighteth [[H2654]] in his way. [[H1870]]

### 24
Though [[H3588]] he fall, [[H5307]] he shall not [[H3808]] be utterly cast down: [[H2904]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] upholdeth [[H5564]] his hand. [[H3027]]

### 25
I have been [[H1961]] young, [[H5288]] and [[H1571]] am old; [[H2204]] yet have I not [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] the righteous [[H6662]] forsaken, [[H5800]] nor his seed [[H2233]] begging [[H1245]] bread. [[H3899]]

### 26
ever [[H3117]] merciful, [[H2603]] and lendeth; [[H3867]] and his seed [[H2233]] blessed. [[H1293]]

### 27
Depart [[H5493]] from evil, [[H7451]] and do [[H6213]] good; [[H2896]] and dwell [[H7931]] for evermore. [[H5769]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] loveth [[H157]] judgment, [[H4941]] and forsaketh [[H5800]] not [[H3808]] his saints; [[H2623]] they are preserved [[H8104]] for ever: [[H5769]] but the seed [[H2233]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 29
The righteous [[H6662]] shall inherit [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] and dwell [[H7931]] therein [[H5921]] for ever. [[H5703]]

### 30
The mouth [[H6310]] of the righteous [[H6662]] speaketh [[H1897]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and his tongue [[H3956]] talketh [[H1696]] of judgment. [[H4941]]

### 31
The law [[H8451]] of his God [[H430]] in his heart; [[H3820]] none [[H3808]] of his steps [[H838]] shall slide. [[H4571]]

### 32
The wicked [[H7563]] watcheth [[H6822]] the righteous, [[H6662]] and seeketh [[H1245]] to slay [[H4191]] him. [[H4191]]

### 33
The Lord [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] leave [[H5800]] him in his hand, [[H3027]] nor [[H3808]] condemn [[H7561]] him when he is judged. [[H8199]]

### 34
Wait [[H6960]] on [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and keep [[H8104]] his way, [[H1870]] and he shall exalt [[H7311]] thee to inherit [[H3423]] the land: [[H776]] when the wicked [[H7563]] are cut off, [[H3772]] thou shalt see [[H7200]]

### 35
I have seen [[H7200]] the wicked [[H7563]] in great power, [[H6184]] and spreading himself [[H6168]] like a green [[H7488]] bay tree. [[H249]]

### 36
Yet he passed away, [[H5674]] and, lo, [[H2009]] he not: [[H369]] yea, I sought [[H1245]] him, but he could not [[H3808]] be found. [[H4672]]

### 37
Mark [[H8104]] the perfect [[H8535]] and behold [[H7200]] the upright: [[H3477]] for [[H3588]] the end [[H319]] of man [[H376]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 38
But the transgressors [[H6586]] shall be destroyed [[H8045]] together: [[H3162]] the end [[H319]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall be cut off. [[H3772]]

### 39
But the salvation [[H8668]] of the righteous [[H6662]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] their strength [[H4581]] in the time [[H6256]] of trouble. [[H6869]]

### 40
And the Lord [[H3068]] shall help [[H5826]] them, and deliver [[H6403]] them: he shall deliver [[H6403]] them from the wicked, [[H7563]] and save [[H3467]] them, because [[H3588]] they trust [[H2620]] in him. [[H2620]]
