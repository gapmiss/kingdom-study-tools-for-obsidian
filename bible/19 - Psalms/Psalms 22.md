To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Aijeleth [[H365]] Shahar, [[H7837]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
My God, [[H410]] my God, [[H410]] why [[H4100]] hast thou forsaken [[H5800]] me? far [[H7350]] from helping [[H3444]] me, the words [[H1697]] of my roaring? [[H7581]]

### 2
O my God, [[H430]] I cry [[H7121]] in the daytime, [[H3119]] but thou hearest [[H6030]] not; [[H3808]] and in the night season, [[H3915]] and am not [[H3808]] silent. [[H1747]]

### 3
But thou [[H859]] holy, [[H6918]] that inhabitest [[H3427]] the praises [[H8416]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
Our fathers [[H1]] trusted [[H982]] in thee: they trusted, [[H982]] and thou didst deliver [[H6403]] them. [[H6403]]

### 5
They cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] thee, and were delivered: [[H4422]] they trusted [[H982]] in thee, and were not [[H3808]] confounded. [[H954]]

### 6
But I [[H595]] a worm, [[H8438]] and no [[H3808]] man; [[H376]] a reproach [[H2781]] of men, [[H120]] and despised [[H959]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] they that see [[H7200]] me laugh scorn: [[H3932]] me to they shoot out [[H6362]] the lip, [[H8193]] they shake [[H5128]] the head, [[H7218]]

### 8
He trusted [[H1556]] on [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] he would deliver [[H6403]] him: let him deliver [[H5337]] him, seeing [[H3588]] he delighted [[H2654]] in him. [[H2654]]

### 9
But [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] he that took [[H1518]] me out of the womb: [[H990]] thou didst make me hope [[H982]] upon [[H5921]] my mother's [[H517]] breasts. [[H7699]]

### 10
I was cast [[H7993]] upon [[H5921]] thee from the womb: [[H7358]] thou [[H859]] my God [[H410]] from my mother's [[H517]] belly. [[H990]]

### 11
Be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me; for [[H3588]] trouble [[H6869]] near; [[H7138]] for [[H3588]] none [[H369]] to help. [[H5826]]

### 12
Many [[H7227]] bulls [[H6499]] have compassed [[H5437]] me: strong [[H47]] of Bashan [[H1316]] have beset me round. [[H3803]]

### 13
They gaped [[H6475]] upon [[H5921]] me their mouths, [[H6310]] a ravening [[H2963]] and a roaring [[H7580]] lion. [[H738]]

### 14
I am poured out [[H8210]] like water, [[H4325]] and all [[H3605]] my bones [[H6106]] are out of joint: [[H6504]] my heart [[H3820]] is [[H1961]] like wax; [[H1749]] it is melted [[H4549]] in the midst [[H8432]] of my bowels. [[H4578]]

### 15
My strength [[H3581]] is dried up [[H3001]] like a potsherd; [[H2789]] and my tongue [[H3956]] cleaveth [[H1692]] to my jaws; [[H4455]] and thou hast brought [[H8239]] me into the dust [[H6083]] of death. [[H4194]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] dogs [[H3611]] have compassed [[H5437]] me: the assembly [[H5712]] of the wicked [[H7489]] have inclosed [[H5362]] me: they pierced [[H3738]] my hands [[H3027]] and my feet. [[H7272]]

### 17
I may tell [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] my bones: [[H6106]] they [[H1992]] look [[H5027]] stare [[H7200]] upon me. [[H7200]]

### 18
They part [[H2505]] my garments [[H899]] among them, and cast [[H5307]] lots [[H1486]] upon [[H5921]] my vesture. [[H3830]]

### 19
But be not [[H408]] thou [[H859]] far [[H7368]] from me, O Lord: [[H3068]] O my strength, [[H360]] haste [[H2363]] thee to help [[H5833]] me. [[H5833]]

### 20
Deliver [[H5337]] my soul [[H5315]] from the sword; [[H2719]] my darling [[H3173]] from the power [[H3027]] of the dog. [[H3611]]

### 21
Save [[H3467]] me from the lion's [[H738]] mouth: [[H6310]] for thou hast heard [[H6030]] me from the horns [[H7161]] of the unicorns. [[H7214]]

### 22
I will declare [[H5608]] thy name [[H8034]] unto my brethren: [[H251]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the congregation [[H6951]] will I praise [[H1984]] thee. [[H1984]]

### 23
Ye that fear [[H3373]] the Lord, [[H3068]] praise [[H1984]] him; all [[H3605]] ye the seed [[H2233]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] glorify [[H3513]] him; and fear [[H1481]] him, all [[H3605]] ye the seed [[H2233]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] he hath not [[H3808]] despised [[H959]] nor [[H3808]] abhorred [[H8262]] the affliction [[H6039]] of the afflicted; [[H6041]] neither [[H3808]] hath he hid [[H5641]] his face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] him; but when he cried [[H7768]] unto [[H413]] him, he heard. [[H8085]]

### 25
My praise [[H8416]] of [[H853]] thee in the great [[H7227]] congregation: [[H6951]] I will pay [[H7999]] my vows [[H5088]] before [[H5048]] them that fear [[H3373]] him. [[H3373]]

### 26
The meek [[H6035]] shall eat [[H398]] and be satisfied: [[H7646]] they shall praise [[H1984]] the Lord [[H3068]] that seek [[H1875]] him: your heart [[H3824]] shall live [[H2421]] for ever. [[H5703]]

### 27
All [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the world [[H776]] shall remember [[H2142]] and turn [[H7725]] unto [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the kindreds [[H4940]] of the nations [[H1471]] shall worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] thee. [[H6440]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] the kingdom [[H4410]] the Lord's: [[H3068]] and he the governor [[H4910]] among the nations. [[H1471]]

### 29
All [[H3605]] fat [[H1879]] upon earth [[H776]] shall eat [[H398]] and worship: [[H7812]] all [[H3605]] they that go down [[H3381]] to the dust [[H6083]] shall bow [[H3766]] before [[H6440]] him: and none [[H3808]] can keep alive [[H2421]] his own soul. [[H5315]]

### 30
A seed [[H2233]] shall serve [[H5647]] him; it shall be accounted [[H5608]] to the Lord [[H136]] for a generation. [[H1755]]

### 31
They shall come, [[H935]] and shall declare [[H5046]] his righteousness [[H6666]] unto a people [[H5971]] that shall be born, [[H3205]] that [[H3588]] he hath done [[H6213]]
