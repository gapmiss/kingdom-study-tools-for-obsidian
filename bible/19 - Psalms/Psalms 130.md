A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
Out of the depths [[H4615]] have I cried [[H7121]] unto thee, O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
Lord, [[H136]] hear [[H8085]] my voice: [[H6963]] let thine ears [[H241]] be [[H1961]] attentive [[H7183]] to the voice [[H6963]] of my supplications. [[H8469]]

### 3
If [[H518]] thou, Lord, [[H3050]] shouldest mark [[H8104]] iniquities, [[H5771]] O Lord, [[H136]] who [[H4310]] shall stand? [[H5975]]

### 4
But [[H3588]] forgiveness [[H5547]] with [[H5973]] thee, that [[H4616]] thou mayest be feared. [[H3372]]

### 5
I wait for [[H6960]] the Lord, [[H3068]] my soul [[H5315]] doth wait, [[H6960]] and in his word [[H1697]] do I hope. [[H3176]]

### 6
My soul [[H5315]] for the Lord [[H136]] more than they that watch [[H8104]] for the morning: [[H1242]] they that watch [[H8104]] for the morning. [[H1242]]

### 7
Let Israel [[H3478]] hope [[H3176]] in [[H413]] the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] with [[H5973]] the Lord [[H3068]] mercy, [[H2617]] and with [[H5973]] him plenteous [[H7235]] redemption. [[H6304]]

### 8
And he [[H1931]] shall redeem [[H6299]] Israel [[H3478]] from all [[H3605]] his iniquities. [[H5771]]
