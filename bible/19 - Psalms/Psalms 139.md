To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
O Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast searched [[H2713]] me, and known [[H3045]]

### 2
Thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] my downsitting [[H3427]] and mine uprising, [[H6965]] thou understandest [[H995]] my thought [[H7454]] afar off. [[H7350]]

### 3
Thou compassest [[H2219]] my path [[H734]] and my lying down, [[H7252]] and art acquainted [[H5532]] all [[H3605]] my ways. [[H1870]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] not [[H369]] a word [[H4405]] in my tongue, [[H3956]] lo, [[H2005]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou knowest [[H3045]] it altogether. [[H3045]]

### 5
Thou hast beset [[H6696]] me behind [[H268]] and before, [[H6924]] and laid [[H7896]] thine hand [[H3709]] upon [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 6
knowledge [[H1847]] too wonderful [[H6383]] for [[H4480]] me; it is high, [[H7682]] I cannot [[H3201]] unto it. [[H3808]]

### 7
Whither [[H575]] shall I go [[H1980]] from thy spirit? [[H7307]] or whither [[H575]] shall I flee [[H1272]] from thy presence? [[H6440]]

### 8
If [[H518]] I ascend up [[H5266]] into heaven, [[H8064]] thou [[H859]] there: [[H8033]] if I make my bed [[H3331]] in hell, [[H7585]] behold, [[H2005]] thou [[H2005]]

### 9
I take [[H5375]] the wings [[H3671]] of the morning, [[H7837]] dwell [[H7931]] in the uttermost parts [[H319]] of the sea; [[H3220]]

### 10
Even [[H1571]] there [[H8033]] shall thy hand [[H3027]] lead [[H5148]] me, and thy right hand [[H3225]] shall hold [[H270]] me. [[H270]]

### 11
If I say, [[H559]] Surely [[H389]] the darkness [[H2822]] shall cover [[H7779]] me; even the night [[H3915]] shall be light [[H216]] about me. [[H1157]]

### 12
Yea, [[H1571]] the darkness [[H2822]] hideth [[H2821]] not [[H3808]] from [[H4480]] thee; but the night [[H3915]] shineth [[H215]] as the day: [[H3117]] the darkness [[H2825]] and the light [[H219]] both alike [[H219]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast possessed [[H7069]] my reins: [[H3629]] thou hast covered [[H5526]] me in my mother's [[H517]] womb. [[H990]]

### 14
I will praise [[H3034]] thee; for [[H5921]] I am fearfully [[H3372]] wonderfully made: [[H6395]] marvellous [[H6381]] thy works; [[H4639]] and my soul [[H5315]] knoweth [[H3045]] right well. [[H3966]]

### 15
My substance [[H6108]] was not [[H3808]] hid [[H3582]] from [[H4480]] thee, when [[H834]] I was made [[H6213]] in secret, [[H5643]] curiously wrought [[H7551]] in the lowest parts [[H8482]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 16
Thine eyes [[H5869]] did see [[H7200]] my substance, yet being unperfect; [[H1564]] and in [[H5921]] thy book [[H5612]] all [[H3605]] were written, [[H3789]] in continuance [[H3117]] were fashioned, [[H3335]] when none [[H259]] of them. [[H3808]]

### 17
How [[H4100]] precious [[H3365]] also are thy thoughts [[H7454]] unto me, O God! [[H410]] how [[H4100]] great [[H6105]] is the sum [[H7218]] of them! [[H7218]]

### 18
I should count [[H5608]] them, they are more in number [[H7235]] than the sand: [[H2344]] when I awake, [[H6974]] I am still [[H5750]] with thee. [[H5750]]

### 19
Surely [[H518]] thou wilt slay [[H6991]] the wicked, [[H7563]] O God: [[H433]] depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] me therefore, ye bloody [[H1818]] men. [[H582]]

### 20
For [[H834]] they speak [[H559]] against thee wickedly, [[H4209]] thine enemies [[H6145]] take [[H5375]] in vain. [[H7723]]

### 21
Do not [[H3808]] I hate [[H8130]] them, O Lord, [[H3068]] that hate [[H8130]] thee? and am not I grieved [[H6962]] with those that rise up against thee? [[H8618]]

### 22
I hate [[H8130]] them with perfect [[H8503]] hatred: [[H8135]] I count [[H1961]] them mine enemies. [[H341]]

### 23
Search [[H2713]] me, O God, [[H410]] and know [[H3045]] my heart: [[H3824]] try [[H974]] me, and know [[H3045]] my thoughts: [[H8312]]

### 24
And see [[H7200]] if [[H518]] wicked [[H6090]] way [[H1870]] in me, and lead [[H5148]] me in the way [[H1870]] everlasting. [[H5769]]
