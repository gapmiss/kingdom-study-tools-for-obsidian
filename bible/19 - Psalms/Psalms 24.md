### 1
The earth [[H776]] the Lord's, [[H3068]] and the fulness [[H4393]] thereof; the world, [[H8398]] and they that dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] hath founded [[H3245]] it upon [[H5921]] the seas, [[H3220]] and established [[H3559]] it upon [[H5921]] the floods. [[H5104]]

Who [[H4310]] shall ascend [[H5927]] into the hill [[H2022]] of the Lord? [[H3068]] or who [[H4310]] shall stand [[H6965]] in his holy [[H6944]] place? [[H4725]]

### 4
He that hath clean [[H5355]] hands, [[H3709]] and a pure [[H1249]] heart; [[H3824]] who [[H834]] hath not [[H3808]] lifted up [[H5375]] his soul [[H5315]] unto vanity, [[H7723]] nor [[H3808]] sworn [[H7650]] deceitfully. [[H4820]]

### 5
He shall receive [[H5375]] the blessing [[H1293]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and righteousness [[H6666]] from the God [[H430]] of his salvation. [[H3468]]

### 6
This [[H2088]] the generation [[H1755]] of them that seek [[H1875]] him, that seek [[H1245]] thy face, [[H6440]] O Jacob. [[H3290]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 7
Lift up [[H5375]] your heads, [[H7218]] O ye gates; [[H8179]] and be ye lift up, [[H5375]] ye everlasting [[H5769]] doors; [[H6607]] and the King [[H4428]] of glory [[H3519]] shall come in. [[H935]]

### 8
Who [[H4310]] this [[H2088]] King [[H4428]] of glory? [[H3519]] The Lord [[H3068]] strong [[H5808]] and mighty, [[H1368]] the Lord [[H3068]] mighty [[H1368]] in battle. [[H4421]]

### 9
Lift up [[H5375]] your heads, [[H7218]] O ye gates; [[H8179]] even lift up, [[H5375]] ye everlasting [[H5769]] doors; [[H6607]] and the King [[H4428]] of glory [[H3519]] shall come in. [[H935]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] is [[H1931]] this [[H2088]] King [[H4428]] of glory? [[H3519]] The Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] he [[H1931]] the King [[H4428]] of glory. [[H3519]] Selah. [[H5542]]
