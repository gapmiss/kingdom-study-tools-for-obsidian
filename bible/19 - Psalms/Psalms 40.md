To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
I waited [[H6960]] patiently [[H6960]] for the Lord; [[H3068]] and he inclined [[H5186]] unto [[H413]] me, and heard [[H8085]] my cry. [[H7775]]

### 2
He brought me up [[H5927]] also out of an horrible [[H7588]] pit, [[H953]] out of the miry [[H3121]] clay, [[H2916]] and set [[H6965]] my feet [[H7272]] upon [[H5921]] a rock, [[H5553]] established [[H3559]] my goings. [[H838]]

### 3
And he hath put [[H5414]] a new [[H2319]] song [[H7892]] in my mouth, [[H6310]] praise [[H8416]] unto our God: [[H430]] many [[H7227]] shall see [[H7200]] and fear, [[H3372]] and shall trust [[H982]] in the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
Blessed [[H835]] that man [[H1397]] that [[H834]] maketh [[H7760]] the Lord [[H3068]] his trust, [[H4009]] and respecteth [[H6437]] not [[H3808]] the proud, [[H7295]] nor such as turn aside [[H7750]] to lies. [[H3577]]

### 5
Many, [[H7227]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] thy wonderful works [[H6381]] thou [[H859]] hast done, [[H6213]] and thy thoughts [[H4284]] to [[H413]] us-ward: they cannot [[H369]] be reckoned up in order [[H6186]] unto thee: [[H413]] I would declare [[H5046]] and speak [[H1696]] they are more [[H6105]] than can be numbered. [[H5608]]

### 6
Sacrifice [[H2077]] and offering [[H4503]] thou didst not [[H3808]] desire; [[H2654]] mine ears [[H241]] hast thou opened: [[H3738]] burnt offering [[H5930]] and sin offering [[H2401]] hast thou not [[H3808]] required. [[H7592]]

### 7
Then [[H227]] said [[H559]] I, Lo, [[H2009]] I come: [[H935]] in the volume [[H4039]] of the book [[H5612]] written [[H3789]] of [[H5921]] me, [[H5921]]

### 8
I delight [[H2654]] to do [[H6213]] thy will, [[H7522]] O my God: [[H430]] yea, thy law [[H8451]] within [[H8432]] my heart. [[H4578]]

### 9
I have preached [[H1319]] righteousness [[H6664]] in the great [[H7227]] congregation: [[H6951]] lo, [[H2009]] I have not [[H3808]] refrained [[H3607]] my lips, [[H8193]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou [[H859]] knowest. [[H3045]]

### 10
I have not [[H3808]] hid [[H3680]] thy righteousness [[H6666]] within [[H8432]] my heart; [[H3820]] I have declared [[H559]] thy faithfulness [[H530]] and thy salvation: [[H8668]] I have not [[H3808]] concealed [[H3582]] thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] and thy truth [[H571]] from the great [[H7227]] congregation. [[H6951]]

### 11
Withhold [[H3607]] not [[H3808]] thou [[H859]] thy tender mercies [[H7356]] from [[H4480]] me, O Lord: [[H3068]] let thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] and thy truth [[H571]] continually [[H8548]] preserve [[H5341]] me. [[H5341]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] innumerable [[H4557]] evils [[H7451]] have compassed [[H661]]  me about: [[H5921]] mine iniquities [[H5771]] have taken hold [[H5381]] upon me, so that I am not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to look up; [[H7200]] they are more [[H6105]] than the hairs [[H8185]] of mine head: [[H7218]] therefore my heart [[H3820]] faileth [[H5800]] me. [[H5800]]

### 13
Be pleased, [[H7521]] O Lord, [[H3068]] to deliver [[H5337]] me: O Lord, [[H3068]] make haste [[H2363]] to help [[H5833]] me. [[H5833]]

### 14
Let them be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded [[H2659]] together [[H3162]] that seek after [[H1245]] my soul [[H5315]] to destroy [[H5595]] it; let them be driven [[H5472]] backward [[H268]] and put to shame [[H3637]] that wish [[H2655]] me evil. [[H7451]]

### 15
Let them be desolate [[H8074]] for [[H5921]] a reward [[H6118]] of their shame [[H1322]] that say [[H559]] unto me, Aha, [[H1889]] aha. [[H1889]]

### 16
Let all [[H3605]] those that seek [[H1245]] thee rejoice [[H7797]] and be glad [[H8055]] in thee: let such as love [[H157]] thy salvation [[H8668]] say [[H559]] continually, [[H8548]] The Lord [[H3068]] be magnified. [[H1431]]

### 17
But I [[H589]] poor [[H6041]] and needy; [[H34]] the Lord [[H136]] thinketh [[H2803]] upon me: thou [[H859]] my help [[H5833]] and my deliverer; [[H6403]] make no [[H408]] tarrying, [[H309]] O my God. [[H430]]
