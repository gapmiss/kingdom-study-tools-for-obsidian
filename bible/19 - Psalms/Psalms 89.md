Maschil [[H4905]] of Ethan [[H387]] the Ezrahite. [[H250]]

### 1
I will sing [[H7891]] of the mercies [[H2617]] of the Lord [[H3068]] for ever: [[H5769]] with my mouth [[H6310]] will I make known [[H3045]] thy faithfulness [[H530]] to all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] I have said, [[H559]] Mercy [[H2617]] shall be built up [[H1129]] for ever: [[H5769]] thy faithfulness [[H530]] shalt thou establish [[H3559]] in the very heavens. [[H8064]]

### 3
I have made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with my chosen, [[H972]] I have sworn [[H7650]] unto David [[H1732]] my servant, [[H5650]]

### 4
Thy seed [[H2233]] will I establish [[H3559]] for [[H5704]] ever, [[H5769]] and build up [[H1129]] thy throne [[H3678]] to all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
And the heavens [[H8064]] shall praise [[H3034]] thy wonders, [[H6382]] O Lord: [[H3068]] thy faithfulness [[H530]] also [[H637]] in the congregation [[H6951]] of the saints. [[H6918]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] in the heaven [[H7834]] can be compared [[H6186]] unto the Lord? [[H3068]] among the sons [[H1121]] of the mighty [[H410]] can be likened [[H1819]] unto the Lord? [[H3068]]

### 7
God [[H410]] is greatly [[H7227]] to be feared [[H6206]] in the assembly [[H5475]] of the saints, [[H6918]] and to be had in reverence [[H3372]] of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] about [[H5439]] him. [[H5439]]

### 8
O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] who [[H4310]] a strong [[H2626]] Lord [[H3050]] like unto thee? [[H3644]] or to thy faithfulness [[H530]] round about [[H5439]] thee? [[H5439]]

### 9
Thou [[H859]] rulest [[H4910]] the raging [[H1348]] of the sea: [[H3220]] when the waves [[H1530]] thereof arise, [[H7721]] thou [[H859]] stillest [[H7623]] them. [[H7623]]

### 10
Thou [[H859]] hast broken pieces, [[H1792]] Rahab [[H7294]] in as one that is slain; [[H2491]] thou hast scattered [[H6340]] thine enemies [[H341]] with thy strong [[H5797]] arm. [[H2220]]

### 11
The heavens [[H8064]] thine, the earth [[H776]] also [[H637]] thine: the world [[H8398]] and the fulness [[H4393]] thereof, thou [[H859]] hast founded [[H3245]] them. [[H3245]]

### 12
The north [[H6828]] and the south [[H3225]] thou [[H859]] hast created [[H1254]] them: Tabor [[H8396]] and Hermon [[H2768]] shall rejoice [[H7442]] in thy name. [[H8034]]

### 13
Thou hast a mighty [[H1369]] arm: [[H2220]] strong [[H5810]] is thy hand, [[H3027]] high [[H7311]] is thy right hand. [[H3225]]

### 14
Justice [[H6664]] and judgment [[H4941]] the habitation [[H4349]] of thy throne: [[H3678]] mercy [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] shall go [[H6923]] before thy face. [[H6440]]

### 15
Blessed [[H835]] the people [[H5971]] that know [[H3045]] the joyful sound: [[H8643]] they shall walk, [[H1980]] O Lord, [[H3068]] in the light [[H216]] of thy countenance. [[H6440]]

### 16
In thy name [[H8034]] shall they rejoice [[H1523]] all [[H3605]] the day: [[H3117]] and in thy righteousness [[H6666]] shall they be exalted. [[H7311]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] the glory [[H8597]] of their strength: [[H5797]] and in thy favour [[H7522]] our horn [[H7161]] shall be exalted. [[H7311]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] our defence; [[H4043]] and the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel [[H3478]] our king. [[H4428]]

### 19
Then [[H227]] thou spakest [[H1696]] in vision [[H2377]] to thy holy one, [[H2623]] and saidst, [[H559]] I have laid [[H7737]] help [[H5828]] upon [[H5921]] mighty; [[H1368]] I have exalted [[H7311]] chosen [[H970]] out of the people. [[H5971]]

### 20
I have found [[H4672]] David [[H1732]] my servant; [[H5650]] with my holy [[H6944]] oil [[H8081]] have I anointed [[H4886]] him: [[H4886]]

### 21
With [[H5973]] whom [[H834]] my hand [[H3027]] shall be established: [[H3559]] mine arm [[H2220]] also [[H637]] shall strengthen [[H553]] him. [[H553]]

### 22
The enemy [[H341]] shall not [[H3808]] exact [[H5378]] upon him; nor [[H3808]] the son [[H1121]] of wickedness [[H5766]] afflict [[H6031]] him. [[H6031]]

### 23
And I will beat down [[H3807]] his foes [[H6862]] before his face, [[H6440]] and plague [[H5062]] them that hate [[H8130]] him. [[H8130]]

### 24
But my faithfulness [[H530]] and my mercy [[H2617]] with [[H5973]] him: and in my name [[H8034]] shall his horn [[H7161]] be exalted. [[H7311]]

### 25
I will set [[H7760]] his hand [[H3027]] also in the sea, [[H3220]] and his right hand [[H3225]] in the rivers. [[H5104]]

### 26
He [[H1931]] shall cry [[H7121]] unto me, Thou [[H859]] my father, [[H1]] my God, [[H410]] and the rock [[H6697]] of my salvation. [[H3444]]

### 27
Also [[H637]] I [[H589]] will make [[H5414]] him firstborn, [[H1060]] higher [[H5945]] than the kings [[H4428]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 28
My mercy [[H2617]] will I keep [[H8104]] for him for evermore, [[H5769]] and my covenant [[H1285]] shall stand fast [[H539]] with him. [[H539]]

### 29
His seed [[H2233]] also will I make [[H7760]] for ever, [[H5703]] and his throne [[H3678]] as the days [[H3117]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 30
If [[H518]] his children [[H1121]] forsake [[H5800]] my law, [[H8451]] and walk [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] in my judgments; [[H4941]]

### 31
If [[H518]] they break [[H2490]] my statutes, [[H2708]] and keep [[H8104]] not [[H3808]] my commandments; [[H4687]]

### 32
Then will I visit [[H6485]] their transgression [[H6588]] with the rod, [[H7626]] and their iniquity [[H5771]] with stripes. [[H5061]]

### 33
Nevertheless my lovingkindness [[H2617]] will I not [[H3808]] utterly take [[H6331]] from [[H5973]] him, nor [[H3808]] suffer my faithfulness [[H530]] to fail. [[H8266]]

### 34
My covenant [[H1285]] will I not [[H3808]] break, [[H2490]] nor [[H3808]] alter [[H8138]] the thing that is gone out [[H4161]] of my lips. [[H8193]]

### 35
Once [[H259]] have I sworn [[H7650]] by my holiness [[H6944]] that I will not [[H518]] lie [[H3576]] unto David. [[H1732]]

### 36
His seed [[H2233]] shall endure [[H1961]] for ever, [[H5769]] and his throne [[H3678]] as the sun [[H8121]] before [[H5048]] me. [[H5048]]

### 37
It shall be established [[H3559]] for ever [[H5769]] as the moon, [[H3394]] and a faithful [[H539]] witness [[H5707]] in heaven. [[H7834]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 38
But thou [[H859]] hast cast off [[H2186]] and abhorred, [[H3988]] thou hast been wroth [[H5674]] with [[H5973]] thine anointed. [[H4899]]

### 39
Thou hast made void [[H5010]] the covenant [[H1285]] of thy servant: [[H5650]] thou hast profaned [[H2490]] his crown [[H5145]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 40
Thou hast broken down [[H6555]] all [[H3605]] his hedges; [[H1448]] thou hast brought [[H7760]] his strong holds [[H4013]] to ruin. [[H4288]]

### 41
All [[H3605]] that pass by [[H5674]] the way [[H1870]] spoil [[H8155]] him: he is [[H1961]] a reproach [[H2781]] to his neighbours. [[H7934]]

### 42
Thou hast set up [[H7311]] the right hand [[H3225]] of his adversaries; [[H6862]] thou hast made all [[H3605]] his enemies [[H341]] to rejoice. [[H8055]]

### 43
Thou hast also [[H637]] turned [[H7725]] the edge [[H6697]] of his sword, [[H2719]] and hast not [[H3808]] made him to stand [[H6965]] in the battle. [[H4421]]

### 44
Thou hast made his glory [[H2892]] to cease, [[H7673]] and cast down [[H4048]] his throne [[H3678]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 45
The days [[H3117]] of his youth [[H5934]] hast thou shortened: [[H7114]] thou hast covered [[H5844]] him with shame. [[H955]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 46
How long, [[H5704]] Lord? [[H3068]] wilt thou hide thyself [[H5641]] for ever? [[H5331]] shall thy wrath [[H2534]] burn [[H1197]] like [[H3644]] fire? [[H784]]

### 47
Remember [[H2142]] how [[H4100]] short [[H2465]] my [[H589]] time is: wherefore [[H5921]] hast thou made [[H1254]] all [[H3605]] men [[H1121]] in vain? [[H7723]]

### 48
What [[H4310]] man [[H1397]] liveth, [[H2421]] and shall not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] death? [[H4194]] shall he deliver [[H4422]] his soul [[H5315]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the grave? [[H7585]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 49
Lord, [[H136]] where [[H346]] thy former [[H7223]] lovingkindnesses, [[H2617]] thou swarest [[H7650]] unto David [[H1732]] in thy truth? [[H530]]

### 50
Remember, [[H2142]] Lord, [[H136]] the reproach [[H2781]] of thy servants; [[H5650]] I do bear [[H5375]] in my bosom [[H2436]] all [[H3605]] the mighty [[H7227]] people; [[H5971]]

### 51
Wherewith [[H834]] thine enemies [[H341]] have reproached, [[H2778]] O Lord; [[H3068]] wherewith [[H834]] they have reproached [[H2778]] the footsteps [[H6119]] of thine anointed. [[H4899]]

### 52
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] for evermore. [[H5769]] Amen, [[H543]] and Amen. [[H543]]
