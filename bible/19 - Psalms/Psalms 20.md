To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
The Lord [[H3068]] hear [[H6030]] thee in the day [[H3117]] of trouble; [[H6869]] the name [[H8034]] of the God [[H430]] of Jacob [[H3290]] defend [[H7682]] thee; [[H7682]]

### 2
Send [[H7971]] thee help [[H5828]] from the sanctuary, [[H6944]] and strengthen [[H5582]] thee out of Zion; [[H6726]]

### 3
Remember [[H2142]] all [[H3605]] thy offerings, [[H4503]] and accept [[H1878]] thy burnt sacrifice; [[H5930]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 4
Grant [[H5414]] thee according to thine own heart, [[H3824]] and fulfil [[H4390]] all [[H3605]] thy counsel. [[H6098]]

### 5
We will rejoice [[H7442]] in thy salvation, [[H3444]] and in the name [[H8034]] of our God [[H430]] we will set up banners: [[H1713]] the Lord [[H3068]] fulfil [[H4390]] all [[H3605]] thy petitions. [[H4862]]

### 6
Now [[H6258]] know [[H3045]] I that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] saveth [[H3467]] his anointed; [[H4899]] he will hear [[H6030]] him from his holy [[H6944]] heaven [[H8064]] with the saving [[H3468]] strength [[H1369]] of his right hand. [[H3225]]

### 7
Some [[H428]] in chariots, [[H7393]] and some [[H428]] in horses: [[H5483]] but we [[H587]] will remember [[H2142]] the name [[H8034]] of the Lord [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 8
They [[H1992]] are brought down [[H3766]] and fallen: [[H5307]] but we [[H587]] are risen, [[H6965]] and stand upright. [[H5749]]

### 9
Save, [[H3467]] Lord: [[H3068]] let the king [[H4428]] hear [[H6030]] us when [[H3117]] we call. [[H7121]]
