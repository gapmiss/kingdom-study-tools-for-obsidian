In Judah [[H3063]] God [[H430]] known: [[H3045]] his name [[H8034]] great [[H1419]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
In Salem [[H8004]] also is [[H1961]] his tabernacle, [[H5520]] and his dwelling place [[H4585]] in Zion. [[H6726]]

There [[H8033]] brake [[H7665]] he the arrows [[H7565]] of the bow, [[H7198]] the shield, [[H4043]] and the sword, [[H2719]] and the battle. [[H4421]] Selah. [[H5542]]

Thou [[H859]] more glorious [[H215]] excellent [[H117]] than the mountains [[H2042]] of prey. [[H2964]]

The stouthearted [[H47]] are spoiled, [[H7997]] they have slept [[H5123]] their sleep: [[H8142]] and none [[H3808]] of the men [[H582]] of might [[H2428]] have found [[H4672]] their hands. [[H3027]]

At thy rebuke, [[H1606]] O God [[H430]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] both the chariot [[H7393]] and horse [[H5483]] are cast into a dead sleep. [[H7290]]

Thou, [[H859]] thou, [[H859]] to be feared: [[H3372]] and who [[H4310]] may stand [[H5975]] in thy sight [[H6440]] when [[H227]] once thou art angry? [[H639]]

Thou didst cause judgment [[H1779]] to be heard [[H8085]] from heaven; [[H8064]] the earth [[H776]] feared, [[H3372]] and was still, [[H8252]]

### 9
When God [[H430]] arose [[H6965]] to judgment, [[H4941]] to save [[H3467]] all [[H3605]] the meek [[H6035]] of the earth. [[H776]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 10
Surely [[H3588]] the wrath [[H2534]] of man [[H120]] shall praise [[H3034]] thee: the remainder [[H7611]] of wrath [[H2534]] shalt thou restrain. [[H2296]]

### 11
Vow, [[H5087]] and pay [[H7999]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]] let all [[H3605]] that be round about [[H5439]] him bring [[H2986]] presents [[H7862]] unto him that ought to be feared. [[H4172]]

### 12
He shall cut off [[H1219]] the spirit [[H7307]] of princes: [[H5057]] terrible [[H3372]] to the kings [[H4428]] of the earth. [[H776]]
