To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
How long [[H5704]] wilt thou forget [[H7911]] me, O Lord? [[H3068]] for ever? [[H5331]] how long [[H5704]] wilt thou hide [[H5641]] thy face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] me? [[H4480]]

### 2
How long [[H5704]] shall I take [[H7896]] counsel [[H6098]] in my soul, [[H5315]] sorrow [[H3015]] in my heart [[H3824]] daily? [[H3119]] how long [[H5704]] shall mine enemy [[H341]] be exalted [[H7311]] over [[H5921]] me? [[H5921]]

### 3
Consider [[H5027]] hear [[H6030]] me, O Lord [[H3068]] my God: [[H430]] lighten [[H215]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] lest [[H6435]] I sleep [[H3462]] the death; [[H4194]]

### 4
Lest [[H6435]] mine enemy [[H341]] say, [[H559]] I have prevailed against [[H3201]] him; those that trouble [[H6862]] me rejoice [[H1523]] when [[H3588]] I am moved. [[H4131]]

### 5
But I [[H589]] have trusted [[H982]] in thy mercy; [[H2617]] my heart [[H3820]] shall rejoice [[H1523]] in thy salvation. [[H3444]]

### 6
I will sing [[H7891]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] he hath dealt bountifully [[H1580]] with [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]
