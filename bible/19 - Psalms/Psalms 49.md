To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]]

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] all [[H3605]] people; [[H5971]] give ear, [[H238]] all [[H3605]] inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world: [[H2465]]

### 2
Both [[H1571]] low [[H1121]] and [[H1571]] high, [[H1121]] rich [[H6223]] and poor, [[H34]] together. [[H3162]]

### 3
My mouth [[H6310]] shall speak [[H1696]] of wisdom; [[H2454]] and the meditation [[H1900]] of my heart [[H3820]] of understanding. [[H8394]]

### 4
I will incline [[H5186]] mine ear [[H241]] to a parable: [[H4912]] I will open [[H6605]] my dark saying [[H2420]] upon the harp. [[H3658]]

### 5
Wherefore [[H4100]] should I fear [[H3372]] in the days [[H3117]] of evil, [[H7451]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of my heels [[H6120]] shall compass [[H5437]] me about? [[H5437]]

### 6
They that trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] their wealth, [[H2428]] and boast themselves [[H1984]] in the multitude [[H7230]] of their riches; [[H6239]]

### 7
None [[H3808]] can [[H376]] by any means [[H6299]] redeem [[H6299]] his brother, [[H251]] nor [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] to God [[H430]] a ransom [[H3724]] for him: [[H3724]]

### 8
(For the redemption [[H6306]] of their soul [[H5315]] precious, [[H3365]] and it ceaseth [[H2308]] for ever:) [[H5769]]

### 9
That he should still [[H5750]] live [[H2421]] for ever, [[H5331]] not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] corruption. [[H7845]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] he seeth [[H7200]] wise men [[H2450]] die, [[H4191]] likewise [[H3162]] the fool [[H3684]] and the brutish person [[H1198]] perish, [[H6]] and leave [[H5800]] their wealth [[H2428]] to others. [[H312]]

### 11
Their inward thought [[H7130]] their houses [[H1004]] for ever, [[H5769]] their dwelling places [[H4908]] to all [[H1755]] generations; [[H1755]] they call [[H7121]] lands [[H127]] after their own names. [[H8034]]

### 12
Nevertheless man [[H120]] in honour [[H3366]] abideth [[H3885]] not: [[H1077]] he is like [[H4911]] the beasts [[H929]] perish. [[H1820]]

### 13
This [[H2088]] their way [[H1870]] their folly: [[H3689]] yet their posterity [[H310]] approve [[H7521]] their sayings. [[H6310]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 14
Like sheep [[H6629]] they are laid [[H8371]] in the grave; [[H7585]] death [[H4194]] shall feed [[H7462]] on them; and the upright [[H3477]] shall have dominion [[H7287]] over them in the morning; [[H1242]] and their beauty [[H6736]] shall consume [[H1086]] in the grave [[H7585]] from their dwelling. [[H2073]]

### 15
But [[H389]] God [[H430]] will redeem [[H6299]] my soul [[H5315]] from the power [[H3027]] of the grave: [[H7585]] for [[H3588]] he shall receive [[H3947]] me. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 16
Be not [[H408]] thou afraid [[H3372]] when [[H3588]] one [[H376]] is made rich, [[H6238]] when [[H3588]] the glory [[H3519]] of his house [[H1004]] is increased; [[H7235]]

### 17
For when [[H3588]] he dieth [[H4194]] he shall carry away: [[H3947]] nothing [[H3808]] his glory [[H3519]] shall not [[H3808]] descend [[H3381]] after [[H310]] him. [[H310]]

### 18
Though [[H3588]] while he lived [[H2416]] he blessed [[H1288]] his soul: [[H5315]] and will praise [[H3034]] thee, when [[H3588]] thou doest well [[H3190]] to thyself. [[H3190]]

### 19
He shall go [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the generation [[H1755]] of his fathers; [[H1]] they shall never [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] light. [[H216]]

### 20
Man [[H120]] in honour, [[H3366]] and understandeth [[H995]] not, [[H3808]] is like [[H4911]] the beasts [[H929]] perish. [[H1820]]
