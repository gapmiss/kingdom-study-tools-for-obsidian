A Song [[H7892]] Psalm [[H4210]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]]

### 1
Great [[H1419]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and greatly [[H3966]] to be praised [[H1984]] in the city [[H5892]] of our God, [[H430]] the mountain [[H2022]] of his holiness. [[H6944]]

### 2
Beautiful [[H3303]] for situation, [[H5131]] the joy [[H4885]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] the sides [[H3411]] of the north, [[H6828]] the city [[H7151]] of the great [[H7227]] King. [[H4428]]

### 3
God [[H430]] is known [[H3045]] in her palaces [[H759]] for a refuge. [[H4869]]

### 4
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] the kings [[H4428]] were assembled, [[H3259]] they passed by [[H5674]] together. [[H3162]]

### 5
They [[H1992]] saw [[H7200]] so [[H3651]] they marvelled; [[H8539]] they were troubled, [[H926]] hasted away. [[H2648]]

### 6
Fear [[H7461]] took hold upon [[H270]] them there, [[H8033]] pain, [[H2427]] as of a woman in travail. [[H3205]]

### 7
Thou breakest [[H7665]] the ships [[H591]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] with an east [[H6921]] wind. [[H7307]]

### 8
As [[H834]] we have heard, [[H8085]] so [[H3651]] have we seen [[H7200]] in the city [[H5892]] of the Lord [[H3068]] of hosts, [[H6635]] in the city [[H5892]] of our God: [[H430]] God [[H430]] will establish [[H3559]] it for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 9
We have thought [[H1819]] of thy lovingkindness, [[H2617]] O God, [[H430]] in the midst [[H7130]] of thy temple. [[H1964]]

### 10
According to thy name, [[H8034]] O God, [[H430]] so [[H3651]] thy praise [[H8416]] unto [[H5921]] the ends [[H7099]] of the earth: [[H776]] thy right hand [[H3225]] is full [[H4390]] of righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 11
Let mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] rejoice, [[H8055]] let the daughters [[H1323]] of Judah [[H3063]] be glad, [[H1523]] because of [[H4616]] thy judgments. [[H4941]]

### 12
Walk about [[H5437]] Zion, [[H6726]] and go round about [[H5362]] her: tell [[H5608]] the towers [[H4026]] thereof. [[H4026]]

### 13
Mark [[H7896]] ye well [[H3820]] her bulwarks, [[H2430]] consider [[H6448]] her palaces; [[H759]] that [[H4616]] ye may tell [[H5608]] to the generation [[H1755]] following. [[H314]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] God [[H430]] our God [[H430]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever: [[H5703]] he [[H1931]] will be our guide [[H5090]] unto [[H5921]] death. [[H4192]]
