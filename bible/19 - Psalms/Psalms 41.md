To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Blessed [[H835]] he that considereth [[H7919]] the poor: [[H1800]] the Lord [[H3068]] will deliver [[H4422]] him in time [[H3117]] of trouble. [[H7451]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] will preserve [[H8104]] him, and keep him alive; [[H2421]] he shall be blessed [[H833]] upon the earth: [[H776]] and thou wilt not [[H408]] deliver [[H5414]] him unto the will [[H5315]] of his enemies. [[H341]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] will strengthen [[H5582]] him upon [[H5921]] the bed [[H6210]] of languishing: [[H1741]] thou wilt make [[H2015]] all [[H3605]] his bed [[H4904]] in his sickness. [[H2483]]

### 4
I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] Lord, [[H3068]] be merciful [[H2603]] unto me: heal [[H7495]] my soul; [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I have sinned [[H2398]] against thee. [[H2398]]

### 5
Mine enemies [[H341]] speak [[H559]] evil [[H7451]] of me, When [[H4970]] shall he die, [[H4191]] and his name [[H8034]] perish? [[H6]]

### 6
And if [[H518]] he come [[H935]] to see [[H7200]] he speaketh [[H1696]] vanity: [[H7723]] his heart [[H3820]] gathereth [[H6908]] iniquity [[H205]] to itself; he goeth [[H3318]] abroad, [[H2351]] he telleth [[H1696]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] that hate [[H8130]] me whisper [[H3907]] together [[H3162]] against [[H5921]] me: against [[H5921]] me do they devise [[H2803]] my hurt. [[H7451]]

### 8
An evil [[H1100]] disease, [[H1697]] cleaveth fast [[H3332]] unto him: and that [[H834]] he lieth [[H7901]] he shall rise up [[H6965]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H3254]]

### 9
Yea, [[H1571]] mine own familiar [[H7965]] friend, [[H376]] in whom [[H834]] I trusted, [[H982]] which did eat [[H398]] of my bread, [[H3899]] hath lifted up [[H1431]] heel [[H6119]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 10
But thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] be merciful [[H2603]] unto me, and raise me up, [[H6965]] that I may requite [[H7999]] them. [[H7999]]

### 11
By this [[H2063]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou favourest [[H2654]] me, because [[H3588]] mine enemy [[H341]] doth not [[H3808]] triumph [[H7321]] over [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 12
And as for me, [[H589]] thou upholdest [[H8551]] me in mine integrity, [[H8537]] and settest [[H5324]] me before thy face [[H6440]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 13
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] from everlasting, [[H5769]] and to [[H5704]] everlasting. [[H5769]] Amen, [[H543]] and Amen. [[H543]]
