A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
The mighty [[H410]] God, [[H430]] the Lord, [[H3068]] hath spoken, [[H1696]] and called [[H7121]] the earth [[H776]] from the rising [[H4217]] of the sun [[H8121]] unto [[H5704]] the going down [[H3996]] thereof. [[H3996]]

### 2
Out of Zion, [[H6726]] the perfection [[H4359]] of beauty, [[H3308]] God [[H430]] hath shined. [[H3313]]

### 3
Our God [[H430]] shall come, [[H935]] and shall not [[H408]] keep silence: [[H2790]] a fire [[H784]] shall devour [[H398]] before [[H6440]] him, and it shall be very [[H3966]] tempestuous [[H8175]] round about [[H5439]] him. [[H5439]]

### 4
He shall call [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the heavens [[H8064]] from above, [[H5920]] and to [[H413]] the earth, [[H776]] that he may judge [[H1777]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 5
Gather [[H622]] my saints [[H2623]] together unto me; those that have made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with me by [[H5921]] sacrifice. [[H2077]]

### 6
And the heavens [[H8064]] shall declare [[H5046]] his righteousness: [[H6664]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] judge [[H8199]] himself. [[H1931]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 7
Hear, [[H8085]] O my people, [[H5971]] and I will speak; [[H1696]] O Israel, [[H3478]] and I will testify [[H5749]] against thee: I [[H595]] God, [[H430]] thy God. [[H430]]

### 8
I will not [[H3808]] reprove [[H3198]] thee for [[H5921]] thy sacrifices [[H2077]] or thy burnt offerings, [[H5930]] continually [[H8548]] before [[H5048]] me. [[H5048]]

### 9
I will take [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] bullock [[H6499]] out of thy house, [[H1004]] he goats [[H6260]] out of thy folds. [[H4356]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the forest [[H3293]] mine, the cattle [[H929]] upon a thousand [[H505]] hills. [[H2042]]

### 11
I know [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] the fowls [[H5775]] of the mountains: [[H2022]] and the wild beasts [[H2123]] of the field [[H7704]] mine. [[H5978]]

### 12
If [[H518]] I were hungry, [[H7456]] I would not [[H3808]] tell [[H559]] thee: for [[H3588]] the world [[H8398]] mine, and the fulness [[H4393]] thereof. [[H4393]]

### 13
Will I eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of bulls, [[H47]] or drink [[H8354]] the blood [[H1818]] of goats? [[H6260]]

### 14
Offer [[H2076]] unto God [[H430]] thanksgiving; [[H8426]] and pay [[H7999]] thy vows [[H5088]] unto the most High: [[H5945]]

### 15
And call upon [[H7121]] me in the day [[H3117]] of trouble: [[H6869]] I will deliver [[H2502]] thee, and thou shalt glorify [[H3513]] me. [[H3513]]

### 16
But unto the wicked [[H7563]] God [[H430]] saith, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] hast thou to do to declare [[H5608]] my statutes, [[H2706]] or thou shouldest take [[H5375]] my covenant [[H1285]] in [[H5921]] thy mouth? [[H6310]]

### 17
Seeing thou [[H859]] hatest [[H8130]] instruction, [[H4148]] and castest [[H7993]] my words [[H1697]] behind [[H310]] thee. [[H310]]

### 18
When [[H518]] thou sawest [[H7200]] a thief, [[H1590]] then thou consentedst [[H7521]] with [[H5973]] him, and hast been partaker [[H2506]] with [[H5973]] adulterers. [[H5003]]

### 19
Thou givest [[H7971]] thy mouth [[H6310]] to evil, [[H7451]] and thy tongue [[H3956]] frameth [[H6775]] deceit. [[H4820]]

### 20
Thou sittest [[H3427]] speakest [[H1696]] against thy brother; [[H251]] thou [[H5414]] slanderest [[H1848]] thine own mother's [[H517]] son. [[H1121]]

### 21
These [[H428]] hast thou done, [[H6213]] and I kept silence; [[H2790]] thou thoughtest [[H1819]] that I was [[H1961]] altogether [[H1961]] as thyself: [[H3644]] I will reprove [[H3198]] thee, and set in order [[H6186]] before thine eyes. [[H5869]]

### 22
Now [[H4994]] consider [[H995]] this, [[H2063]] ye that forget [[H7911]] God, [[H433]] lest [[H6435]] I tear in pieces, [[H2963]] and none [[H369]] to deliver. [[H5337]]

### 23
Whoso offereth [[H2076]] praise [[H8426]] glorifieth [[H3513]] me: [[H3513]] and to him that ordereth [[H7760]] conversation [[H1870]] will I shew [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3468]] of [[H3468]] God. [[H430]]
