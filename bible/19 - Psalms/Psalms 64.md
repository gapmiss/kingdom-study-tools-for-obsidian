To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] my voice, [[H6963]] O God, [[H430]] in my prayer: [[H7879]] preserve [[H5341]] my life [[H2416]] from fear [[H6343]] of the enemy. [[H341]]

### 2
Hide [[H5641]] me from the secret counsel [[H5475]] of the wicked; [[H7489]] from the insurrection [[H7285]] of the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity: [[H205]]

### 3
Who [[H834]] whet [[H8150]] their tongue [[H3956]] like a sword, [[H2719]] bend [[H1869]] their arrows, [[H2671]] bitter [[H4751]] words: [[H1697]]

### 4
That they may shoot [[H3384]] in secret [[H4565]] at the perfect: [[H8535]] suddenly [[H6597]] do they shoot [[H3384]] at him, and fear [[H3372]] not. [[H3372]]

### 5
They encourage [[H2388]] themselves an evil [[H7451]] matter: [[H1697]] they commune [[H5608]] of laying [[H2934]] snares [[H4170]] privily; they say, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] shall see [[H7200]] them? [[H7200]]

### 6
They search out [[H2664]] iniquities; [[H5766]] they accomplish [[H8552]] a diligent [[H2664]] search: [[H2665]] both the inward [[H7130]] of every one [[H376]] and the heart, [[H3820]] deep. [[H6013]]

### 7
But God [[H430]] shall shoot [[H3384]] at them an arrow; [[H2671]] suddenly [[H6597]] shall they be [[H1961]] wounded. [[H4347]]

### 8
So they shall make their own tongue [[H3956]] to fall [[H3782]] upon [[H5921]] themselves: all [[H3605]] that see [[H7200]] them shall flee away. [[H5074]]

### 9
And all [[H3605]] men [[H120]] shall fear, [[H3372]] and shall declare [[H5046]] the work [[H6467]] of God; [[H430]] for they shall wisely consider [[H7919]] of his doing. [[H4639]]

### 10
The righteous [[H6662]] shall be glad [[H8055]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] and shall trust [[H2620]] in him; and all [[H3605]] the upright [[H3477]] in heart [[H3820]] shall glory. [[H1984]]
