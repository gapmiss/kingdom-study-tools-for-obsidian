To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Jonath-elem-rechokim, [[H3123]] Michtam [[H4387]] of David, [[H1732]] when the Philistines [[H6430]] took [[H270]] him in Gath. [[H1661]]

### 1
Be merciful [[H2603]] unto me, O God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] man [[H582]] would swallow me up; [[H7602]] he fighting [[H3898]] daily [[H3117]] oppresseth [[H3905]] me. [[H3905]]

### 2
Mine enemies [[H8324]] would daily [[H3117]] swallow [[H7602]] up: for [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] that fight [[H3898]] against me, O thou most High. [[H4791]]

### 3
What time [[H3117]] I am afraid, [[H3372]] I [[H589]] will trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 4
In God [[H430]] I will praise [[H1984]] his word, [[H1697]] in God [[H430]] I have put my trust; [[H982]] I will not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] what [[H4100]] flesh [[H1320]] can do [[H6213]] unto me. [[H6213]]

### 5
Every [[H3605]] day [[H3117]] they wrest [[H6087]] my words: [[H1697]] all [[H3605]] their thoughts [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] me for evil. [[H7451]]

### 6
They gather themselves together, [[H1481]] they hide [[H6845]] themselves, they [[H1992]] mark [[H8104]] my steps, [[H6119]] when [[H834]] they wait for [[H6960]] my soul. [[H5315]]

### 7
Shall they [[H3926]] escape [[H6405]] by [[H5921]] iniquity? [[H205]] in anger [[H639]] cast down [[H3381]] the people, [[H5971]] O God. [[H430]]

### 8
Thou tellest [[H5608]] my wanderings: [[H5112]] put [[H7760]] thou [[H859]] my tears [[H1832]] into thy bottle: [[H4997]] not [[H3808]] in thy book? [[H5612]]

### 9
When [[H3117]] I cry [[H7121]] then [[H227]] shall mine enemies [[H341]] turn [[H7725]] back: [[H268]] this [[H2088]] I know; [[H3045]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] for me. [[H430]]

### 10
In God [[H430]] will I praise [[H1984]] word: [[H1697]] in the Lord [[H3068]] will I praise [[H1984]] word. [[H1697]]

### 11
In God [[H430]] have I put my trust: [[H982]] I will not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] what [[H4100]] man [[H120]] can do [[H6213]] unto me. [[H6213]]

### 12
Thy vows [[H5088]] upon [[H5921]] me, O God: [[H430]] I will render [[H7999]] praises [[H8426]] unto thee. [[H8426]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] thou hast delivered [[H5337]] my soul [[H5315]] from death: [[H4194]] not [[H3808]] my feet [[H7272]] from falling, [[H1762]] that I may walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] God [[H430]] in the light [[H216]] of the living? [[H2416]]
