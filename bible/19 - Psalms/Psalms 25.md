of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Unto [[H413]] thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] do I lift up [[H5375]] my soul. [[H5315]]

### 2
O my God, [[H430]] I trust [[H982]] in thee: let me not [[H408]] be ashamed, [[H954]] let not [[H408]] mine enemies [[H341]] triumph [[H5970]] over me. [[H5970]]

### 3
Yea, [[H1571]] let none [[H3605]] that wait [[H6960]] on thee be ashamed: [[H954]] let them be ashamed [[H954]] which transgress [[H898]] without cause. [[H7387]]

### 4
Shew [[H3045]] me thy ways, [[H1870]] O Lord; [[H3068]] teach [[H3925]] me thy paths. [[H734]]

### 5
Lead [[H1869]] me in thy truth, [[H571]] and teach [[H3925]] me: for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] the God [[H430]] of my salvation; [[H3468]] on thee do I wait [[H6960]] all [[H3605]] the day. [[H3117]]

### 6
Remember, [[H2142]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thy tender mercies [[H7356]] and thy lovingkindnesses; [[H2617]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] ever of old. [[H5769]]

### 7
Remember [[H2142]] not [[H408]] the sins [[H2403]] of my youth, [[H5271]] nor my transgressions: [[H6588]] according to thy mercy [[H2617]] remember [[H2142]] thou [[H859]] me for thy goodness' [[H2898]] sake, [[H4616]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
Good [[H2896]] and upright [[H3477]] the Lord: [[H3068]] therefore [[H5921]] will he teach [[H3384]] sinners [[H2400]] in the way. [[H1870]]

### 9
The meek [[H6035]] will he guide [[H1869]] in judgment: [[H4941]] and the meek [[H6035]] will he teach [[H3925]] his way. [[H1870]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] the paths [[H734]] of the Lord [[H3068]] mercy [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] unto such as keep [[H5341]] his covenant [[H1285]] and his testimonies. [[H5713]]

### 11
For thy name's [[H8034]] sake, [[H4616]] O Lord, [[H3068]] pardon [[H5545]] mine iniquity; [[H5771]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] great. [[H7227]]

### 12
What [[H4310]] man [[H376]] he that [[H2088]] feareth [[H3373]] the Lord? [[H3068]] him shall he teach [[H3384]] in the way [[H1870]] he shall choose. [[H977]]

### 13
His soul [[H5315]] shall dwell [[H3885]] at ease; [[H2896]] and his seed [[H2233]] shall inherit [[H3423]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 14
The secret [[H5475]] of the Lord [[H3068]] with them that fear [[H3373]] him; and he will shew [[H3045]] them his covenant. [[H1285]]

### 15
Mine eyes [[H5869]] ever [[H8548]] toward [[H413]] the Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] shall pluck [[H3318]] my feet [[H7272]] out of the net. [[H7568]]

### 16
Turn [[H6437]] thee unto [[H413]] me, and have mercy [[H2603]] upon me; for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] desolate [[H3173]] and afflicted. [[H6041]]

### 17
The troubles [[H6869]] of my heart [[H3824]] are enlarged: [[H7337]] bring thou me out [[H3318]] of my distresses. [[H4691]]

### 18
Look upon [[H7200]] mine affliction [[H6040]] and my pain; [[H5999]] and forgive [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] my sins. [[H2403]]

### 19
Consider [[H7200]] mine enemies; [[H341]] for [[H3588]] they are many; [[H7231]] and they hate [[H8130]] me with cruel [[H2555]] hatred. [[H8135]]

### 20
O keep [[H8104]] my soul, [[H5315]] and deliver [[H5337]] me: let me not [[H408]] be ashamed; [[H954]] for [[H3588]] I put my trust [[H2620]] in thee. [[H2620]]

### 21
Let integrity [[H8537]] and uprightness [[H3476]] preserve [[H5341]] me; for [[H3588]] I wait on [[H6960]] thee. [[H6960]]

### 22
Redeem [[H6299]] Israel, [[H3478]] O God, [[H430]] out of all [[H3605]] his troubles. [[H6869]]
