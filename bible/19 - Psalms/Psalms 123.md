A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
Unto [[H413]] thee lift I up [[H5375]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] O thou that dwellest [[H3427]] in the heavens. [[H8064]]

### 2
Behold, [[H2009]] as the eyes [[H5869]] of servants [[H5650]] unto [[H413]] the hand [[H3027]] of their masters, [[H113]] as the eyes [[H5869]] of a maiden [[H8198]] unto [[H413]] the hand [[H3027]] of her mistress; [[H1404]] so [[H3651]] our eyes [[H5869]] upon [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] until [[H5704]] that he have mercy upon us. [[H2603]]

### 3
Have mercy upon [[H2603]] us, O Lord, [[H3068]] have mercy upon [[H2603]] us: for [[H3588]] we are exceedingly [[H7227]] filled [[H7646]] with contempt. [[H937]]

### 4
Our soul [[H5315]] is exceedingly [[H7227]] filled [[H7646]] with the scorning [[H3933]] of those that are at ease, [[H7600]] with the contempt [[H937]] of the proud. [[H1349]]
