[[Psalms 57|←]] • [[Psalms 59|→]]

---

To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] Al-taschith, [[H516]] Michtam [[H4387]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Do ye indeed [[H552]] speak [[H1696]] righteousness, [[H6664]] O congregation? [[H482]] do ye judge [[H8199]] uprightly, [[H4339]] O ye sons [[H1121]] of men? [[H120]]

### 2
Yea, [[H637]] in heart [[H3820]] ye work [[H6466]] wickedness; [[H5766]] ye weigh [[H6424]] the violence [[H2555]] of your hands [[H3027]] in the earth. [[H776]]

### 3
The wicked [[H7563]] are estranged [[H2114]] from the womb: [[H7358]] they go astray [[H8582]] as soon as they be born, [[H990]] speaking [[H1696]] lies. [[H3577]]

### 4
Their poison [[H2534]] like [[H1823]] the poison [[H2534]] of a serpent: [[H5175]] like [[H3644]] the deaf [[H2795]] adder [[H6620]] stoppeth [[H331]] her ear; [[H241]]

### 5
Which [[H834]] will not [[H3808]] hearken [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of charmers, [[H3907]] charming [[H2266]] never so wisely. [[H2449]]

### 6
Break [[H2040]] their teeth, [[H8127]] O God, [[H430]] in their mouth: [[H6310]] break out [[H5422]] the great teeth [[H4459]] of the young lions, [[H3715]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
Let them melt away [[H3988]] as [[H3644]] waters [[H4325]] run continually: [[H1980]] he bendeth [[H1869]] his arrows, [[H2671]] let them be as [[H3644]] cut in pieces. [[H4135]]

### 8
As [[H3644]] a snail [[H7642]] melteth, [[H8557]] let pass away: [[H1980]] the untimely birth [[H5309]] of a woman, [[H802]] they may not [[H1077]] see [[H2372]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 9
Before [[H2962]] your pots [[H5518]] can feel [[H995]] the thorns, [[H329]] he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, [[H8175]] both [[H3644]] living, [[H2416]] and in [[H3644]] wrath. [[H2740]]

### 10
The righteous [[H6662]] shall rejoice [[H8055]] when [[H3588]] he seeth [[H2372]] the vengeance: [[H5359]] he shall wash [[H7364]] his feet [[H6471]] in the blood [[H1818]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 11
So that a man [[H120]] shall say, [[H559]] Verily [[H389]] a reward [[H6529]] for the righteous: [[H6662]] verily [[H389]] he is [[H3426]] a God [[H430]] that judgeth [[H8199]] in the earth. [[H776]]
