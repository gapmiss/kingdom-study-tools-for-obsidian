A Song [[H7892]] Psalm [[H4210]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah, [[H7141]] to the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Mahalath [[H4257]] Leannoth, [[H6031]] Maschil [[H4905]] of Heman [[H1968]] the Ezrahite. [[H250]]

### 1
O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of my salvation, [[H3444]] I have cried [[H6817]] day [[H3117]] night [[H3915]] before [[H5048]] thee: [[H5048]]

### 2
Let my prayer [[H8605]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] thee: incline [[H5186]] thine ear [[H241]] unto my cry; [[H7440]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] my soul [[H5315]] is full [[H7646]] of troubles: [[H7451]] and my life [[H2416]] draweth nigh [[H5060]] unto the grave. [[H7585]]

### 4
I am counted [[H2803]] with [[H5973]] them that go down [[H3381]] into the pit: [[H953]] I am [[H1961]] as a man [[H1397]] no [[H369]] strength: [[H353]]

### 5
Free [[H2670]] among the dead, [[H4191]] like [[H3644]] the slain [[H2491]] that lie [[H7901]] in the grave, [[H6913]] whom [[H834]] thou rememberest [[H2142]] no [[H3808]] more: [[H5750]] and they [[H1992]] are cut off [[H1504]] from thy hand. [[H3027]]

### 6
Thou hast laid [[H7896]] me in the lowest [[H8482]] pit, [[H953]] in darkness, [[H4285]] in the deeps. [[H4688]]

### 7
Thy wrath [[H2534]] lieth hard [[H5564]] upon [[H5921]] me, and thou hast afflicted [[H6031]] with all [[H3605]] thy waves. [[H4867]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 8
Thou hast put away [[H7368]] mine acquaintance [[H3045]] far from [[H4480]] me; thou hast made [[H7896]] me an abomination [[H8441]] unto them: shut up, [[H3607]] and I cannot [[H3808]] come forth. [[H3318]]

### 9
Mine eye [[H5869]] mourneth [[H1669]] by reason of [[H4480]] affliction: [[H6040]] Lord, [[H3068]] I have called [[H7121]] daily [[H3117]] upon thee, I have stretched out [[H7849]] my hands [[H3709]] unto thee. [[H3709]]

### 10
Wilt thou shew [[H6213]] wonders [[H6382]] to the dead? [[H4191]] shall the dead [[H7496]] arise [[H6965]] praise [[H3034]] thee? Selah. [[H5542]]

### 11
Shall thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] be declared [[H5608]] in the grave? [[H6913]] thy faithfulness [[H530]] in destruction? [[H11]]

### 12
Shall thy wonders [[H6382]] be known [[H3045]] in the dark? [[H2822]] and thy righteousness [[H6666]] in the land [[H776]] of forgetfulness? [[H5388]]

### 13
But unto [[H413]] thee have I [[H589]] cried, [[H7768]] O Lord; [[H3068]] and in the morning [[H1242]] shall my prayer [[H8605]] prevent [[H6923]] thee. [[H6923]]

### 14
Lord, [[H3068]] why [[H4100]] castest thou off [[H2186]] my soul? [[H5315]] hidest [[H5641]] thou thy face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] me? [[H4480]]

### 15
I [[H589]] afflicted [[H6041]] and ready to die [[H1478]] from youth [[H5290]] up: I suffer [[H5375]] thy terrors [[H367]] I am distracted. [[H6323]]

### 16
Thy fierce wrath [[H2740]] goeth over [[H5674]] me; thy terrors [[H1161]] have cut me off. [[H6789]]

### 17
They came round about [[H5437]] me daily [[H3117]] like water; [[H4325]] they compassed [[H5362]]  me about [[H5921]] together. [[H3162]]

### 18
Lover [[H157]] and friend [[H7453]] hast thou put far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me, mine acquaintance [[H3045]] into darkness. [[H4285]]
