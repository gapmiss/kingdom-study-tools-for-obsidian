For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H5971]] idols: [[H457]] but the Lord [[H3068]] made [[H6213]] the heavens. [[H8064]]

Say [[H559]] among the heathen [[H1471]] the Lord [[H3068]] reigneth: [[H4427]] the world [[H8398]] also [[H637]] shall be established [[H3559]] that it shall not [[H1077]] be moved: [[H4131]] he shall judge [[H1777]] the people [[H5971]] righteously. [[H4339]]

Let the heavens [[H8064]] rejoice, [[H8055]] and let the earth [[H776]] be glad; [[H1523]] let the sea [[H3220]] roar, [[H7481]] and the fulness [[H4393]] thereof. [[H4393]]
