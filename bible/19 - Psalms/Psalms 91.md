### 1
He that dwelleth [[H3427]] in the secret place [[H5643]] of the most High [[H5945]] shall abide [[H3885]] under the shadow [[H6738]] of the Almighty. [[H7706]]

### 2
I will say [[H559]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] my refuge [[H4268]] and my fortress: [[H4686]] my God; [[H430]] in him will I trust. [[H982]]

### 3
Surely [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] shall deliver [[H5337]] thee from the snare [[H6341]] of the fowler, [[H3353]] from the noisome [[H1942]] pestilence. [[H1698]]

### 4
He shall cover [[H5526]] thee with his feathers, [[H84]] and under [[H8478]] his wings [[H3671]] shalt thou trust: [[H2620]] his truth [[H571]] shield [[H6793]] and buckler. [[H5507]]

### 5
Thou shalt not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] for the terror [[H6343]] by night; [[H3915]] for the arrow [[H2671]] flieth [[H5774]] by day; [[H3119]]

### 6
for the pestilence [[H1698]] walketh [[H1980]] in darkness; [[H652]] for the destruction [[H6986]] wasteth [[H7736]] at noonday. [[H6672]]

### 7
A thousand [[H505]] shall fall [[H5307]] at thy side, [[H6654]] and ten thousand [[H7233]] at thy right hand; [[H3225]] it shall not [[H3808]] come nigh [[H5066]] thee. [[H413]]

### 8
Only [[H7535]] with thine eyes [[H5869]] shalt thou behold [[H5027]] and see [[H7200]] the reward [[H8011]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 9
Because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast made [[H7760]] the Lord, [[H3068]] my refuge, [[H4268]] the most High, [[H5945]] thy habitation; [[H4583]]

### 10
There shall no [[H3808]] evil [[H7451]] befall [[H579]] thee, neither [[H3808]] shall any plague [[H5061]] come nigh [[H7126]] thy dwelling. [[H168]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] he shall give his angels [[H4397]] charge [[H6680]] over thee, to keep [[H8104]] thee in all [[H3605]] thy ways. [[H1870]]

### 12
They shall bear thee up [[H5375]] in [[H5921]] hands, [[H3709]] lest [[H6435]] thou dash [[H5062]] thy foot [[H7272]] against a stone. [[H68]]

### 13
Thou shalt tread [[H1869]] upon [[H5921]] the lion [[H7826]] and adder: [[H6620]] the young lion [[H3715]] and the dragon [[H8577]] shalt thou trample under feet. [[H7429]]

### 14
Because [[H3588]] he hath set his love [[H2836]] upon me, therefore will I deliver [[H6403]] him: I will set him on high, [[H7682]] because [[H3588]] he hath known [[H3045]] my name. [[H8034]]

### 15
He shall call upon [[H7121]] me, and I will answer [[H6030]] him: I [[H595]] with [[H5973]] him in trouble; [[H6869]] I will deliver [[H2502]] him, and honour [[H3513]] him. [[H3513]]

### 16
With long [[H753]] life [[H3117]] will I satisfy [[H7646]] him, and shew [[H7200]] him my salvation. [[H3444]]
