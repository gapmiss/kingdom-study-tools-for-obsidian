### 1
The Lord [[H3068]] reigneth; [[H4427]] let the people [[H5971]] tremble: [[H7264]] he sitteth [[H3427]] the cherubims; [[H3742]] let the earth [[H776]] be moved. [[H5120]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] great [[H1419]] in Zion; [[H6726]] and he [[H1931]] high [[H7311]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 3
Let them praise [[H3034]] thy great [[H1419]] and terrible [[H3372]] name; [[H8034]] it [[H1931]] holy. [[H6918]]

### 4
The king's [[H4428]] strength [[H5797]] also loveth [[H157]] judgment; [[H4941]] thou [[H859]] dost establish [[H3559]] equity, [[H4339]] thou [[H859]] executest [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] in Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 5
Exalt [[H7311]] ye the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and worship [[H7812]] at his footstool; [[H7272]] he [[H1931]] holy. [[H6918]]

### 6
Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] among his priests, [[H3548]] and Samuel [[H8050]] among them that call upon [[H7121]] his name; [[H8034]] they called [[H7121]] upon [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he [[H1931]] answered [[H6030]] them. [[H6030]]

### 7
He spake [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them in the cloudy [[H6051]] pillar: [[H5982]] they kept [[H8104]] his testimonies, [[H5713]] and the ordinance [[H2706]] he gave [[H5414]] them. [[H5414]]

### 8
Thou answeredst [[H6030]] them, O Lord [[H3068]] our God: [[H430]] thou [[H859]] wast [[H1961]] a God [[H410]] that forgavest [[H5375]] them, though thou tookest vengeance [[H5358]] of [[H5921]] their inventions. [[H5949]]

### 9
Exalt [[H7311]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and worship [[H7812]] at his holy [[H6944]] hill; [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] holy. [[H6918]]
