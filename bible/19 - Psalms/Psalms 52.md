To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] Maschil, [[H4905]] of David, [[H1732]] when Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite [[H130]] came [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] Saul, [[H7586]] and said [[H559]] unto him, David [[H1732]] is come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahimelech. [[H288]]

### 1
Why [[H4100]] boastest [[H1984]] thou thyself in mischief, [[H7451]] O mighty man? [[H1368]] the goodness [[H2617]] of God [[H410]] continually. [[H3117]]

### 2
Thy tongue [[H3956]] deviseth [[H2803]] mischiefs; [[H1942]] like a sharp [[H3913]] razor, [[H8593]] working [[H6213]] deceitfully. [[H7423]]

### 3
Thou lovest [[H157]] evil [[H7451]] more than good; [[H2896]] lying [[H8267]] rather than to speak [[H1696]] righteousness. [[H6664]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 4
Thou lovest [[H157]] all [[H3605]] devouring [[H1105]] words, [[H1697]] O deceitful [[H4820]] tongue. [[H3956]]

### 5
God [[H410]] shall likewise [[H1571]] destroy [[H5422]] thee for ever, [[H5331]] he shall take thee away, [[H2846]] and pluck thee out [[H5255]] of dwelling place, [[H168]] and root out [[H8327]] thee of the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 6
The righteous [[H6662]] also shall see, [[H7200]] and fear, [[H3372]] and shall laugh [[H7832]] at [[H5921]] him: [[H5921]]

### 7
Lo, [[H2009]] the man [[H1397]] made [[H7760]] not [[H3808]] God [[H430]] his strength; [[H4581]] but trusted [[H982]] in the abundance [[H7230]] of his riches, [[H6239]] strengthened [[H5810]] himself in his wickedness. [[H1942]]

### 8
But I [[H589]] like a green [[H7488]] olive tree [[H2132]] in the house [[H1004]] of God: [[H430]] I trust [[H982]] in the mercy [[H2617]] of God [[H430]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

### 9
I will praise [[H3034]] thee for ever, [[H5769]] because [[H3588]] thou hast done [[H6213]] and I will wait on [[H6960]] thy name; [[H8034]] for [[H3588]] good [[H2896]] before [[H5048]] thy saints. [[H2623]]
