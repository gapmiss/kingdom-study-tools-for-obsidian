### 1
O come, [[H1980]] let us sing [[H7442]] unto the Lord: [[H3068]] let us make a joyful noise [[H7321]] to the rock [[H6697]] of our salvation. [[H3468]]

### 2
Let us come before [[H6923]] his presence [[H6440]] with thanksgiving, [[H8426]] and make a joyful noise [[H7321]] unto him with psalms. [[H2158]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] a great [[H1419]] God, [[H410]] and a great [[H1419]] King [[H4428]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]]

### 4
In his hand [[H3027]] the deep places [[H4278]] of the earth: [[H776]] the strength [[H8443]] of the hills [[H2022]] his also. [[H2022]]

### 5
The sea [[H3220]] his, and he [[H1931]] made [[H6213]] it: and his hands [[H3027]] formed [[H3335]] the dry [[H3006]]

### 6
O come, [[H935]] let us worship [[H7812]] and bow down: [[H3766]] let us kneel [[H1288]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] our maker. [[H6213]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] our God; [[H430]] and we [[H587]] the people [[H5971]] of his pasture, [[H4830]] and the sheep [[H6629]] of his hand. [[H3027]] To day [[H3117]] if [[H518]] ye will hear [[H8085]] his voice, [[H6963]]

### 8
Harden [[H7185]] not [[H408]] your heart, [[H3824]] as in the provocation, [[H4808]] as the day [[H3117]] of temptation [[H4531]] in the wilderness: [[H4057]]

### 9
When [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] tempted [[H5254]] me, proved [[H974]] me, and [[H1571]] saw [[H7200]] my work. [[H6467]]

### 10
Forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] long was I grieved [[H6962]] with generation, [[H1755]] and said, [[H559]] It [[H1992]] a people [[H5971]] that do err [[H8582]] in their heart, [[H3824]] and they [[H1992]] have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] my ways: [[H1870]]

### 11
Unto whom [[H834]] I sware [[H7650]] in my wrath [[H639]] that [[H518]] they should not enter [[H935]] into [[H413]] my rest. [[H4496]]
