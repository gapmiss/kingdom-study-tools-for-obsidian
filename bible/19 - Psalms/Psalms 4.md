To the chief Musician [[H5329]] on Neginoth, [[H5058]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Hear [[H6030]] me when I call, [[H7121]] O God [[H430]] of my righteousness: [[H6664]] thou hast enlarged [[H7337]] me in distress; [[H6862]] have mercy [[H2603]] upon me, and hear [[H8085]] my prayer. [[H8605]]

### 2
O ye sons [[H1121]] of men, [[H376]] how long [[H5704]] my glory [[H3519]] into shame? [[H3639]] will ye love [[H157]] vanity, [[H7385]] seek after [[H1245]] leasing? [[H3577]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 3
But know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath set apart [[H6395]] him that is godly [[H2623]] for himself: the Lord [[H3068]] will hear [[H8085]] when I call [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 4
Stand in awe, [[H7264]] and sin [[H2398]] not: [[H408]] commune [[H559]] with your own heart [[H3824]] upon [[H5921]] your bed, [[H4904]] and be still. [[H1826]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
Offer [[H2076]] the sacrifices [[H2077]] of righteousness, [[H6664]] and put your trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
many [[H7227]] that say, [[H559]] Who [[H4310]] will shew [[H7200]] us good? [[H2896]] Lord, [[H3068]] lift thou up [[H5375]] the light [[H216]] of thy countenance [[H6440]] upon [[H5921]] us. [[H5921]]

### 7
Thou hast put [[H5414]] gladness [[H8057]] in my heart, [[H3820]] more than in the time [[H6256]] their corn [[H1715]] and their wine [[H8492]] increased. [[H7231]]

### 8
I will both [[H3162]] lay me down [[H7901]] in peace, [[H7965]] and sleep: [[H3462]] for [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H3068]] only [[H910]] makest me dwell [[H3427]] in safety. [[H983]]
