terrible things [[H3372]] in righteousness [[H6664]] wilt thou answer [[H6030]] us, O God [[H430]] of our salvation; [[H3468]] the confidence [[H4009]] of all [[H3605]] the ends [[H7099]] of the earth, [[H776]] and of them that are afar off [[H7350]] the sea: [[H3220]]

### 9
Thou visitest [[H6485]] the earth, [[H776]] and waterest [[H7783]] it: thou greatly [[H7227]] enrichest [[H6238]] it with the river [[H6388]] of God, [[H430]] is full [[H4390]] of water: [[H4325]] thou preparest [[H3559]] them corn, [[H1715]] when [[H3588]] thou hast so [[H3651]] provided [[H3559]] for it.
