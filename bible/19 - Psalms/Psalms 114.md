### 1
When Israel [[H3478]] went out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] from a people [[H5971]] of strange language; [[H3937]]

### 2
Judah [[H3063]] was [[H1961]] his sanctuary, [[H6944]] Israel [[H3478]] his dominion. [[H4475]]

### 3
The sea [[H3220]] saw [[H7200]] and fled: [[H5127]] Jordan [[H3383]] was driven [[H5437]] back. [[H268]]

### 4
The mountains [[H2022]] skipped [[H7540]] like rams, [[H352]] the little hills [[H1389]] like lambs. [[H1121]]

### 5
What [[H4100]] thee, O thou sea, [[H3220]] that [[H3588]] thou fleddest? [[H5127]] thou Jordan, [[H3383]] thou wast driven [[H5437]] back? [[H268]]

### 6
Ye mountains, [[H2022]] ye skipped [[H7540]] like rams; [[H352]] ye little hills, [[H1389]] like lambs? [[H1121]]

### 7
Tremble, [[H2342]] thou earth, [[H776]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H113]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the God [[H433]] of Jacob; [[H3290]]

### 8
Which turned [[H2015]] the rock [[H6697]] a standing [[H98]] water, [[H4325]] the flint [[H2496]] into a fountain [[H4599]] of waters. [[H4325]]
