### 1
By [[H5921]] the rivers [[H5104]] of Babylon, [[H894]] there [[H8033]] we sat down, [[H3427]] yea, [[H1571]] we wept, [[H1058]] when we remembered [[H2142]] Zion. [[H6726]]

### 2
We hanged [[H8518]] our harps [[H3658]] upon [[H5921]] the willows [[H6155]] in the midst [[H8432]] thereof. [[H8432]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] they that carried us away captive [[H7617]] required [[H7592]] of us a song; [[H1697]] and they that wasted [[H8437]] us mirth, [[H8057]] Sing [[H7891]] us of the songs [[H7892]] of Zion. [[H6726]]

### 4
How [[H349]] shall we sing [[H7891]] the Lord's [[H3068]] song [[H7892]] in [[H5921]] a strange [[H5236]] land? [[H127]]

### 5
If [[H518]] I forget [[H7911]] thee, O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] let my right hand [[H3225]] forget [[H7911]]

### 6
If [[H518]] I do not [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] thee, let my tongue [[H3956]] cleave [[H1692]] to the roof of my mouth; [[H2441]] if [[H518]] I prefer [[H5927]] not [[H3808]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] above [[H5921]] my chief [[H7218]] joy. [[H8057]]

### 7
Remember, [[H2142]] O Lord, [[H3068]] the children [[H1121]] of Edom [[H123]] in the day [[H3117]] of Jerusalem; [[H3389]] who said, [[H559]] Rase [[H6168]] rase [[H6168]] to [[H5704]] the foundation [[H3247]] thereof. [[H3247]]

### 8
O daughter [[H1323]] of Babylon, [[H894]] who art to be destroyed; [[H7703]] happy [[H835]] that rewardeth [[H7999]] thee as [[H853]] thou hast served [[H1580]] us. [[H1580]]

### 9
Happy [[H835]] that taketh [[H270]] and dasheth [[H5310]] thy little ones [[H5768]] against [[H413]] the stones. [[H5553]]
