A Prayer [[H8605]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] the right, [[H6664]] O Lord, [[H3068]] attend [[H7181]] unto my cry, [[H7440]] give ear [[H238]] unto my prayer, [[H8605]] not [[H3808]] out of feigned [[H4820]] lips. [[H8193]]

### 2
Let my sentence [[H4941]] come forth [[H3318]] from thy presence; [[H6440]] let thine eyes [[H5869]] behold [[H2372]] the things that are equal. [[H4339]]

### 3
Thou hast proved [[H974]] mine heart; [[H3820]] thou hast visited [[H6485]] in the night; [[H3915]] thou hast tried [[H6884]] me, shalt find [[H4672]] nothing; [[H1077]] I am purposed [[H2161]] my mouth [[H6310]] shall not [[H1077]] transgress. [[H5674]]

### 4
Concerning the works [[H6468]] of men, [[H120]] by the word [[H1697]] of thy lips [[H8193]] I [[H589]] have kept [[H8104]] the paths [[H734]] of the destroyer. [[H6530]]

### 5
Hold up [[H8551]] my goings [[H838]] in thy paths, [[H4570]] my footsteps [[H6471]] slip [[H4131]] not. [[H1077]]

### 6
I [[H589]] have called upon [[H7121]] thee, for [[H3588]] thou wilt hear [[H6030]] me, O God: [[H410]] incline [[H5186]] thine ear [[H241]] unto me, [[H9001]] hear [[H8085]] my speech. [[H565]]

### 7
Shew thy marvellous [[H6395]] lovingkindness, [[H2617]] O thou that savest [[H3467]] by thy right hand [[H3225]] them which put their trust [[H2620]] from those that rise up [[H6965]]

### 8
Keep [[H8104]] me as the apple [[H380]] of the eye, [[H1323]] hide [[H5641]] me under the shadow [[H6738]] of thy wings, [[H3671]]

### 9
From [[H6440]] the wicked [[H7563]] that [[H2098]] oppress [[H7703]] me, my deadly [[H5315]] enemies, [[H341]] compass me about. [[H5362]]

### 10
They are inclosed in [[H5462]] their own fat: [[H2459]] with their mouth [[H6310]] they speak [[H1696]] proudly. [[H1348]]

### 11
They have now [[H6258]] compassed [[H5437]] us in our steps: [[H838]] they have set [[H7896]] their eyes [[H5869]] bowing down [[H5186]] to the earth; [[H776]]

### 12
Like [[H1825]] as a lion [[H738]] is greedy [[H3700]] of his prey, [[H2963]] and as it were a young lion [[H3715]] lurking [[H3427]] in secret places. [[H4565]]

### 13
Arise, [[H6965]] O Lord, [[H3068]] disappoint [[H6923]] him, [[H6440]] cast him down: [[H3766]] deliver [[H6403]] my soul [[H5315]] from the wicked, [[H7563]] thy sword: [[H2719]]

### 14
From men [[H4962]] thy hand, [[H3027]] O Lord, [[H3068]] from men [[H4962]] of the world, [[H2465]] their portion [[H2506]] in life, [[H2416]] and whose belly [[H990]] thou fillest [[H4390]] with thy hid [[H6840]] they are full [[H7646]] of children, [[H1121]] and leave [[H3240]] the rest [[H3499]] of their to their babes. [[H5768]]

### 15
As for me, [[H589]] I will behold [[H2372]] thy face [[H6440]] in righteousness: [[H6664]] I shall be satisfied, [[H7646]] when I awake, [[H6974]] with thy likeness. [[H8544]]
