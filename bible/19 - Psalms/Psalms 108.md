A Song [[H7892]] Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
O God, [[H430]] my heart [[H3820]] is fixed; [[H3559]] I will sing [[H7891]] and give praise, [[H2167]] even [[H637]] with my glory. [[H3519]]

### 2
Awake, [[H5782]] psaltery [[H5035]] and harp: [[H3658]] I will awake [[H5782]] early. [[H7837]]

### 3
I will praise [[H3034]] thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] among the people: [[H5971]] and I will sing praises [[H2167]] unto thee among the nations. [[H3816]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thy mercy [[H2617]] great [[H1419]] above [[H5921]] the heavens: [[H8064]] and thy truth [[H571]] unto [[H5704]] the clouds. [[H7834]]

### 5
Be thou exalted, [[H7311]] O God, [[H430]] above [[H5921]] the heavens: [[H8064]] and thy glory [[H3519]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth; [[H776]]

### 6
That [[H4616]] thy beloved [[H3039]] may be delivered: [[H2502]] save [[H3467]] thy right hand, [[H3225]] and answer [[H6030]] me. [[H6030]]

### 7
God [[H430]] hath spoken [[H1696]] in his holiness; [[H6944]] I will rejoice, [[H5937]] I will divide [[H2505]] Shechem, [[H7927]] and mete out [[H4058]] the valley [[H6010]] of Succoth. [[H5523]]

### 8
Gilead [[H1568]] mine; Manasseh [[H4519]] mine; Ephraim [[H669]] also the strength [[H4581]] of mine head; [[H7218]] Judah [[H3063]] my lawgiver; [[H2710]]

### 9
Moab [[H4124]] my washpot; [[H7366]] over [[H5921]] Edom [[H123]] will I cast out [[H7993]] my shoe; [[H5275]] over [[H5921]] Philistia [[H6429]] will I triumph. [[H7321]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] will bring [[H2986]] me into the strong [[H4013]] city? [[H5892]] who [[H4310]] will lead [[H5148]] me into [[H5704]] Edom? [[H123]]

### 11
not [[H3808]] O God, [[H430]] hast cast us off? [[H2186]] and wilt not [[H3808]] thou, O God, [[H430]] go forth [[H3318]] with our hosts? [[H6635]]

### 12
Give [[H3051]] us help [[H5833]] from trouble: [[H6862]] for vain [[H7723]] the help [[H8668]] of man. [[H120]]

### 13
Through God [[H430]] we shall do [[H6213]] valiantly: [[H2428]] for he [[H1931]] shall tread down [[H947]] our enemies. [[H6862]]
