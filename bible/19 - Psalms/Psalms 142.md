Maschil [[H4905]] of David; [[H1732]] A Prayer [[H8605]] when he was [[H1961]] in the cave. [[H4631]]

### 1
I cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] with my voice; [[H6963]] with my voice [[H6963]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] did I make my supplication. [[H2603]]

### 2
I poured out [[H8210]] my complaint [[H7879]] before [[H6440]] him; I shewed [[H5046]] before [[H6440]] him my trouble. [[H6869]]

### 3
When my spirit [[H7307]] was overwhelmed [[H5848]] within [[H5921]] me, then thou [[H859]] knewest [[H3045]] my path. [[H5410]] In the way [[H734]] wherein [[H2098]] I walked [[H1980]] have they privily laid [[H2934]] a snare [[H6341]] for me. [[H6341]]

### 4
I looked [[H5027]] on right hand, [[H3225]] and beheld, [[H7200]] but no man [[H369]] that would know [[H5234]] me: refuge [[H4498]] failed [[H6]] me; no man [[H369]] cared [[H1875]] for my soul. [[H5315]]

### 5
I cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] thee, O Lord: [[H3068]] I said, [[H559]] Thou [[H859]] my refuge [[H4268]] my portion [[H2506]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 6
Attend [[H7181]] unto [[H413]] my cry; [[H7440]] for [[H3588]] I am brought [[H1809]] very [[H3966]] low: deliver [[H5337]] me from my persecutors; [[H7291]] for [[H3588]] they are stronger [[H553]] than [[H4480]] I. [[H4480]]

### 7
Bring [[H3318]] my soul [[H5315]] out of prison, [[H4525]] that I may praise [[H3034]] thy name: [[H8034]] the righteous [[H6662]] shall compass me about; [[H3803]] for [[H3588]] thou shalt deal bountifully [[H1580]] with [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]
