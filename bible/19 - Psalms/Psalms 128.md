A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
Blessed [[H835]] every one [[H3605]] that feareth [[H3373]] the Lord; [[H3068]] that walketh [[H1980]] in his ways. [[H1870]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] thou shalt eat [[H398]] the labour [[H3018]] of thine hands: [[H3709]] happy [[H835]] thou and well [[H2896]] with thee. [[H2896]]

### 3
Thy wife [[H802]] as a fruitful [[H6509]] vine [[H1612]] by the sides [[H3411]] of thine house: [[H1004]] thy children [[H1121]] like olive [[H2132]] plants [[H8363]] round about [[H5439]] thy table. [[H7979]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2009]] that [[H3588]] thus [[H3651]] shall the man [[H1397]] be blessed [[H1288]] that feareth [[H3373]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
The Lord [[H3068]] shall bless [[H1288]] thee out of Zion: [[H6726]] and thou shalt see [[H7200]] the good [[H2898]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of thy life. [[H2416]]

### 6
Yea, thou shalt see [[H7200]] thy children's [[H1121]] children, [[H1121]] peace [[H7965]] upon [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]
