To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H413]] Nehiloth, [[H5155]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Give ear [[H238]] to my words, [[H561]] O Lord, [[H3068]] consider [[H995]] my meditation. [[H1901]]

### 2
Hearken [[H7181]] unto the voice [[H6963]] of my cry, [[H7773]] my King, [[H4428]] and my God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] unto [[H413]] thee will I pray. [[H6419]]

### 3
My voice [[H6963]] shalt thou hear [[H8085]] in the morning, [[H1242]] O Lord; [[H3068]] in the morning [[H1242]] will I direct [[H6186]] unto thee, and will look up. [[H6822]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] not [[H3808]] a God [[H410]] that hath pleasure [[H2655]] in wickedness: [[H7562]] neither [[H3808]] shall evil [[H7451]] dwell [[H1481]] with thee. [[H1481]]

### 5
The foolish [[H1984]] shall not [[H3808]] stand [[H3320]] in [[H2962]] thy sight: [[H5869]] thou hatest [[H8130]] all [[H3605]] workers [[H6466]] of iniquity. [[H205]]

### 6
Thou shalt destroy [[H6]] them that speak [[H1696]] leasing: [[H3577]] the Lord [[H3068]] will abhor [[H8581]] the bloody [[H1818]] and deceitful [[H4820]] man. [[H376]]

### 7
But as for me, [[H589]] I will come [[H935]] thy house [[H1004]] in the multitude [[H7230]] of thy mercy: [[H2617]] in thy fear [[H3374]] will I worship [[H7812]] toward [[H413]] thy holy [[H6944]] temple. [[H1964]]

### 8
Lead [[H5148]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] in thy righteousness [[H6666]] because of [[H4616]] mine enemies; [[H8324]] make thy way [[H1870]] straight [[H3474]] before my face. [[H6440]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] no [[H369]] faithfulness [[H3559]] in their mouth; [[H6310]] their inward part [[H7130]] very wickedness; [[H1942]] their throat [[H1627]] an open [[H6605]] sepulchre; [[H6913]] they flatter [[H2505]] with their tongue. [[H3956]]

### 10
Destroy [[H816]] thou them, O God; [[H430]] let them fall [[H5307]] by their own counsels; [[H4156]] cast them out [[H5080]] in the multitude [[H7230]] of their transgressions; [[H6588]] for [[H3588]] they have rebelled [[H4784]] against thee. [[H4784]]

### 11
But let all [[H3605]] those that put their trust [[H2620]] in thee rejoice: [[H8055]] let them ever [[H5769]] shout for joy, [[H7442]] because thou defendest [[H5526]] them: [[H5921]] let them also that love [[H157]] thy name [[H8034]] be joyful [[H5970]] in thee. [[H5970]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H3068]] wilt bless [[H1288]] the righteous; [[H6662]] with favour [[H7522]] wilt thou compass [[H5849]] him as a shield. [[H6793]]
