A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H4310]] shall abide [[H1481]] in thy tabernacle? [[H168]] who [[H4310]] shall dwell [[H7931]] in thy holy [[H6944]] hill? [[H2022]]

### 2
He that walketh [[H1980]] uprightly, [[H8549]] and worketh [[H6466]] righteousness, [[H6664]] and speaketh [[H1696]] the truth [[H571]] in his heart. [[H3824]]

### 3
backbiteth [[H7270]] not [[H3808]] with [[H5921]] his tongue, [[H3956]] nor [[H3808]] doeth [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] to his neighbour, [[H7453]] nor [[H3808]] taketh up [[H5375]] a reproach [[H2781]] against [[H5921]] his neighbour. [[H7138]]

### 4
In whose eyes [[H5869]] a vile person [[H3988]] is contemned; [[H959]] but he honoureth [[H3513]] them that fear [[H3373]] the Lord. [[H3068]] sweareth [[H7650]] to hurt, [[H7489]] and changeth [[H4171]] not. [[H3808]]

### 5
putteth not out [[H5414]] his money [[H3701]] to usury, [[H5392]] nor [[H3808]] taketh [[H3947]] reward [[H7810]] against [[H5921]] the innocent. [[H5355]] He that doeth [[H6213]] these [[H428]] shall never [[H5769]] be moved. [[H4131]]
