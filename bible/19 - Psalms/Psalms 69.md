To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Shoshannim, [[H7799]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Save [[H3467]] me, O God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] the waters [[H4325]] are come in [[H935]] unto [[H5704]] soul. [[H5315]]

### 2
I sink [[H2883]] in deep [[H4688]] mire, [[H3121]] where no [[H369]] standing: [[H4613]] I am come [[H935]] into deep [[H4615]] waters, [[H4325]] where the floods [[H7641]] overflow [[H7857]] me. [[H7857]]

### 3
I am weary [[H3021]] of my crying: [[H7121]] my throat [[H1627]] is dried: [[H2787]] mine eyes [[H5869]] fail [[H3615]] while I wait [[H3176]] for my God. [[H430]]

### 4
They that hate [[H8130]] me without a cause [[H2600]] are more [[H7231]] than the hairs [[H8185]] of mine head: [[H7218]] they that would destroy [[H6789]] me, mine enemies [[H341]] wrongfully, [[H8267]] are mighty: [[H6105]] then [[H227]] I restored [[H7725]] which [[H834]] I took not away. [[H1497]]

### 5
O God, [[H430]] thou [[H859]] knowest [[H3045]] my foolishness; [[H200]] and my sins [[H819]] are not [[H3808]] hid [[H3582]] from [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 6
Let not [[H408]] them that wait on [[H6960]] thee, O Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] of hosts, [[H6635]] be ashamed [[H954]] for my sake: let not [[H408]] those that seek [[H1245]] thee be confounded [[H3637]] for my sake, O God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
Because [[H3588]] for thy sake [[H5921]] I have borne [[H5375]] reproach; [[H2781]] shame [[H3639]] hath covered [[H3680]] my face. [[H6440]]

### 8
I am become [[H1961]] a stranger [[H2114]] unto my brethren, [[H251]] and an alien [[H5237]] unto my mother's [[H517]] children. [[H1121]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] the zeal [[H7068]] of thine house [[H1004]] hath eaten me up; [[H398]] and the reproaches [[H2781]] of them that reproached [[H2778]] thee are fallen [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 10
When I wept, [[H1058]] my soul [[H5315]] with fasting, [[H6685]] that was [[H1961]] to my reproach. [[H2781]]

### 11
I made [[H5414]] sackcloth [[H8242]] also my garment; [[H3830]] and I became [[H1961]] a proverb [[H4912]] to them. [[H4912]]

### 12
They that sit in [[H3427]] the gate [[H8179]] speak [[H7878]] against me; and I the song [[H5058]] of the drunkards. [[H8354]]

### 13
But as for me, [[H589]] my prayer [[H8605]] unto thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] an acceptable [[H7522]] time: [[H6256]] O God, [[H430]] in the multitude [[H7230]] of thy mercy [[H2617]] hear [[H6030]] me, in the truth [[H571]] of thy salvation. [[H3468]]

### 14
Deliver [[H5337]] me out of the mire, [[H2916]] and let me not [[H408]] sink: [[H2883]] let me be delivered [[H5337]] from them that hate [[H8130]] me, and out of the deep [[H4615]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 15
Let not [[H408]] the waterflood [[H4325]] overflow [[H7857]] me, neither [[H408]] let the deep [[H4688]] swallow me up, [[H1104]] and let not [[H408]] the pit [[H875]] shut [[H332]] her mouth [[H6310]] upon [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 16
Hear [[H6030]] me, O Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] good: [[H2896]] turn [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] me according to the multitude [[H7230]] of thy tender mercies. [[H7356]]

### 17
And hide [[H5641]] not [[H408]] thy face [[H6440]] from thy servant; [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I am in trouble: [[H6887]] hear [[H6030]] me speedily. [[H4118]]

### 18
Draw nigh [[H7126]] unto [[H413]] my soul, [[H5315]] redeem [[H1350]] it: deliver [[H6299]] me because of [[H4616]] mine enemies. [[H341]]

### 19
Thou [[H859]] hast known [[H3045]] my reproach, [[H2781]] and my shame, [[H1322]] and my dishonour: [[H3639]] mine adversaries [[H6887]] all [[H3605]] before [[H5048]] thee. [[H5048]]

### 20
Reproach [[H2781]] hath broken [[H7665]] my heart; [[H3820]] and I am full of heaviness: [[H5136]] and I looked [[H6960]] to take pity, [[H5110]] but none; [[H369]] and for comforters, [[H5162]] but I found [[H4672]] none. [[H4672]]

### 21
They gave [[H5414]] me also gall [[H7219]] for my meat; [[H1267]] and in my thirst [[H6772]] they gave me vinegar [[H2558]] to drink. [[H8248]]

### 22
Let their table [[H7979]] become [[H1961]] a snare [[H6341]] before [[H6440]] them: and for welfare, [[H7965]] a trap. [[H4170]]

### 23
Let their eyes [[H5869]] be darkened, [[H2821]] that they see [[H7200]] not; and make their loins [[H4975]] continually [[H8548]] to shake. [[H4571]]

### 24
Pour out [[H8210]] thine indignation [[H2195]] upon [[H5921]] them, and let thy wrathful [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] take hold [[H5381]] of them. [[H5381]]

### 25
Let their habitation [[H2918]] be [[H1961]] desolate; [[H8074]] let [[H1961]] none [[H408]] dwell [[H3427]] in their tents. [[H168]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] they persecute [[H7291]] whom [[H834]] thou [[H859]] hast smitten; [[H5221]] and they talk [[H5608]] to [[H413]] the grief [[H4341]] of those whom thou hast wounded. [[H2491]]

### 27
Add [[H5414]] iniquity [[H5771]] unto [[H5921]] their iniquity: [[H5771]] and let them not [[H408]] come [[H935]] into thy righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 28
Let them be blotted [[H4229]] out of the book [[H5612]] of the living, [[H2416]] and not [[H408]] be written [[H3789]] with [[H5973]] the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 29
But I [[H589]] poor [[H6041]] and sorrowful: [[H3510]] let thy salvation, [[H3444]] O God, [[H430]] set me up on high. [[H7682]]

### 30
I will praise [[H1984]] the name [[H8034]] of God [[H430]] with a song, [[H7892]] and will magnify [[H1431]] him with thanksgiving. [[H8426]]

### 31
also shall please [[H3190]] the Lord [[H3068]] better than an ox [[H7794]] bullock [[H6499]] that hath horns [[H7160]] and hoofs. [[H6536]]

### 32
The humble [[H6035]] shall see [[H7200]] be glad: [[H8055]] and your heart [[H3824]] shall live [[H2421]] that seek [[H1875]] God. [[H430]]

### 33
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] heareth [[H8085]] the poor, [[H34]] and despiseth [[H959]] not [[H3808]] his prisoners. [[H615]]

### 34
Let the heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] praise [[H1984]] him, the seas, [[H3220]] and every thing [[H3605]] that moveth [[H7430]] therein. [[H7430]]

### 35
For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] will save [[H3467]] Zion, [[H6726]] and will build [[H1129]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah: [[H3063]] that they may dwell [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] and have it in possession. [[H3423]]

### 36
The seed [[H2233]] also of his servants [[H5650]] shall inherit [[H5157]] it: and they that love [[H157]] his name [[H8034]] shall dwell [[H7931]] therein. [[H7931]]
