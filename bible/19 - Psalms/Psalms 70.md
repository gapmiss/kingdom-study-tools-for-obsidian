---

To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] of David, [[H1732]] to bring to remembrance. [[H2142]]

### 1
O God, [[H430]] to deliver [[H5337]] me; make haste [[H2363]] to help [[H5833]] me, O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
Let them be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded [[H2659]] that seek after [[H1245]] my soul: [[H5315]] let them be turned [[H5472]] backward, [[H268]] and put to confusion, [[H3637]] that desire [[H2655]] my hurt. [[H7451]]

### 3
Let them be turned back [[H7725]] for [[H5921]] a reward [[H6118]] of their shame [[H1322]] that say, [[H559]] Aha, [[H1889]] aha. [[H1889]]

### 4
Let all [[H3605]] those that seek [[H1245]] thee rejoice [[H7797]] and be glad [[H8055]] in thee: and let such as love [[H157]] thy salvation [[H3444]] say [[H559]] continually, [[H8548]] Let God [[H430]] be magnified. [[H1431]]

### 5
But I [[H589]] poor [[H6041]] and needy: [[H34]] make haste [[H2363]] unto me, O God: [[H430]] thou [[H859]] my help [[H5828]] and my deliverer; [[H6403]] O Lord, [[H3068]] make no [[H408]] tarrying. [[H309]]
