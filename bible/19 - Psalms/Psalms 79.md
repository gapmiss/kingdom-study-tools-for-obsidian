A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
O God, [[H430]] the heathen [[H1471]] are come [[H935]] into thine inheritance; [[H5159]] thy holy [[H6944]] temple [[H1964]] have they defiled; [[H2930]] they have laid [[H7760]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] on heaps. [[H5856]]

### 2
The dead bodies [[H5038]] of thy servants [[H5650]] have they given [[H5414]] meat [[H3978]] unto the fowls [[H5775]] of the heaven, [[H8064]] the flesh [[H1320]] of thy saints [[H2623]] unto the beasts [[H2416]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 3
Their blood [[H1818]] have they shed [[H8210]] like water [[H4325]] round about [[H5439]] Jerusalem; [[H3389]] and none [[H369]] to bury [[H6912]]

### 4
We are become [[H1961]] a reproach [[H2781]] to our neighbours, [[H7934]] a scorn [[H3933]] and derision [[H7047]] to them that are round about [[H5439]] us. [[H5439]]

### 5
How long, [[H5704]] Lord? [[H3068]] wilt thou be angry [[H599]] for ever? [[H5331]] shall thy jealousy [[H7068]] burn [[H1197]] like [[H3644]] fire? [[H784]]

### 6
Pour out [[H8210]] thy wrath [[H2534]] upon [[H413]] the heathen [[H1471]] that [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] thee, and upon [[H5921]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] that [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] called [[H7121]] upon thy name. [[H8034]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] they have devoured [[H398]] Jacob, [[H3290]] and laid waste [[H8074]] his dwelling place. [[H5116]]

### 8
O remember [[H2142]] not [[H408]] against us former [[H7223]] iniquities: [[H5771]] let thy tender mercies [[H7356]] speedily [[H4118]] prevent [[H6923]] us: for [[H3588]] we are brought [[H1809]] very [[H3966]] low. [[H3966]]

### 9
Help [[H5826]] us, O God [[H430]] of our salvation, [[H3468]] for [[H1697]] the glory [[H3519]] of thy name: [[H8034]] and deliver [[H5337]] us, and purge away [[H3722]] our sins, [[H2403]] for thy name's [[H8034]] sake. [[H4616]]

### 10
Wherefore [[H4100]] should the heathen [[H1471]] say, [[H559]] Where [[H346]] their God? [[H430]] let him be known [[H3045]] among the heathen [[H1471]] in our sight [[H5869]] the revenging [[H5360]] of the blood [[H1818]] of thy servants [[H5650]] shed. [[H8210]]

### 11
Let the sighing [[H603]] of the prisoner [[H615]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] thee; according to the greatness [[H1433]] of thy power [[H2220]] preserve [[H3498]] thou those that are appointed [[H1121]] to die; [[H8546]]

### 12
And render [[H7725]] unto our neighbours [[H7934]] sevenfold [[H7659]] into [[H413]] their bosom [[H2436]] their reproach, [[H2781]] wherewith [[H834]] they have reproached [[H2778]] thee, O Lord. [[H136]]

### 13
So we [[H587]] thy people [[H5971]] and sheep [[H6629]] of thy pasture [[H4830]] will give thee thanks [[H3034]] for ever: [[H5769]] we will shew forth [[H5608]] thy praise [[H8416]] to all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]
