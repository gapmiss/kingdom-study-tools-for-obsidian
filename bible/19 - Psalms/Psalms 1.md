### 1
Blessed [[H835]] the man [[H376]] that [[H834]] walketh [[H1980]] not [[H3808]] in the counsel [[H6098]] of the ungodly, [[H7563]] nor [[H3808]] standeth [[H5975]] in the way [[H1870]] of sinners, [[H2400]] nor [[H3808]] sitteth [[H3427]] in the seat [[H4186]] of the scornful. [[H3887]]

### 2
But [[H3588]] his delight [[H2656]] in the law [[H8451]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] and in his law [[H8451]] doth he meditate [[H1897]] day [[H3119]] and night. [[H3915]]

### 3
And he shall be [[H1961]] like a tree [[H6086]] planted [[H8362]] by [[H5921]] the rivers [[H6388]] of water, [[H4325]] that [[H834]] bringeth forth [[H5414]] his fruit [[H6529]] in his season; [[H6256]] his leaf [[H5929]] also shall not [[H3808]] wither; [[H5034]] and whatsoever [[H3605]] he doeth [[H6213]] shall prosper. [[H6743]]

### 4
The ungodly [[H7563]] not [[H3808]] so: [[H3651]] but [[H3588]] like the chaff [[H4671]] which [[H834]] the wind [[H7307]] driveth away. [[H5086]]

### 5
Therefore [[H5921]] the ungodly [[H7563]] shall not [[H3808]] stand [[H6965]] in the judgment, [[H4941]] nor sinners [[H2400]] in the congregation [[H5712]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] knoweth [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] of the righteous: [[H6662]] but the way [[H1870]] of the ungodly [[H7563]] shall perish. [[H6]]
