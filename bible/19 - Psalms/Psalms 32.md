of David, [[H1732]] Maschil. [[H4905]]

### 1
Blessed [[H835]] transgression [[H6588]] forgiven, [[H5375]] sin [[H2401]] covered. [[H3680]]

### 2
Blessed [[H835]] the man [[H120]] unto whom the Lord [[H3068]] imputeth [[H2803]] not [[H3808]] iniquity, [[H5771]] and in whose spirit [[H7307]] no [[H369]] guile. [[H7423]]

### 3
When [[H3588]] I kept silence, [[H2790]] my bones [[H6106]] waxed old [[H1086]] through my roaring [[H7581]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long. [[H3117]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] thy hand [[H3027]] was heavy [[H3513]] upon [[H5921]] me: my moisture [[H3955]] is turned [[H2015]] into the drought [[H2725]] of summer. [[H7019]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
I acknowledged [[H3045]] my sin [[H2403]] unto thee, and mine iniquity [[H5771]] have I not [[H3808]] hid. [[H3680]] I said, [[H559]] I will confess [[H3034]] my transgressions [[H6588]] unto the Lord; [[H3068]] and thou [[H859]] forgavest [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of my sin. [[H2403]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 6
For [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] shall every [[H3605]] one that is godly [[H2623]] pray [[H6419]] unto [[H413]] thee in a time [[H6256]] when thou mayest be found: [[H4672]] surely [[H7535]] in the floods [[H7858]] of great [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] they shall not [[H3808]] come nigh [[H5060]] unto [[H413]] him. [[H413]]

### 7
Thou [[H859]] my hiding place; [[H5643]] thou shalt preserve [[H5341]] me from trouble; [[H6862]] thou shalt compass [[H5437]] me about with songs [[H7438]] of deliverance. [[H6405]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 8
I will instruct [[H7919]] thee and teach [[H3384]] thee in the way [[H1870]] which [[H2098]] thou shalt go: [[H1980]] I will guide [[H3289]] thee with mine eye. [[H5869]]

### 9
Be [[H1961]] ye not [[H408]] as the horse, [[H5483]] as the mule, [[H6505]] have no [[H369]] understanding: [[H995]] whose mouth [[H5716]] must be held in [[H1102]] with bit [[H4964]] and bridle, [[H7448]] lest [[H1077]] they come near [[H7126]] unto thee. [[H413]]

### 10
Many [[H7227]] sorrows [[H4341]] to the wicked: [[H7563]] but he that trusteth [[H982]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] mercy [[H2617]] shall compass [[H5437]] him about. [[H5437]]

### 11
Be glad [[H8055]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] and rejoice, [[H1523]] ye righteous: [[H6662]] and shout for joy, [[H7442]] all [[H3605]] upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]
