To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] of David [[H1732]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 1
The transgression [[H6588]] of the wicked [[H7563]] saith [[H5002]] within [[H7130]] my heart, [[H3820]] no [[H369]] fear [[H6343]] of God [[H430]] before [[H5048]] his eyes. [[H5869]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] he flattereth [[H2505]] himself in his own eyes, [[H5869]] until his iniquity [[H5771]] be found [[H4672]] to be hateful. [[H8130]]

### 3
The words [[H1697]] of his mouth [[H6310]] iniquity [[H205]] and deceit: [[H4820]] he hath left off [[H2308]] to be wise, [[H7919]] to do good. [[H3190]]

### 4
He deviseth [[H2803]] mischief [[H205]] upon [[H5921]] his bed; [[H4904]] he setteth himself [[H3320]] in [[H5921]] a way [[H1870]] not [[H3808]] good; [[H2896]] he abhorreth [[H3988]] not [[H3808]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 5
Thy mercy, [[H2617]] O Lord, [[H3068]] in the heavens; [[H8064]] thy faithfulness [[H530]] unto [[H5704]] the clouds. [[H7834]]

### 6
Thy righteousness [[H6666]] like the great [[H410]] mountains; [[H2042]] thy judgments [[H4941]] a great [[H7227]] deep: [[H8415]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thou preservest [[H3467]] man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]]

### 7
How [[H4100]] excellent [[H3368]] thy lovingkindness, [[H2617]] O God! [[H430]] therefore the children [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] put their trust [[H2620]] under the shadow [[H6738]] of thy wings. [[H3671]]

### 8
They shall be abundantly satisfied [[H7301]] with the fatness [[H1880]] of thy house; [[H1004]] and thou shalt make them drink [[H8248]] of the river [[H5158]] of thy pleasures. [[H5730]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] with [[H5973]] thee the fountain [[H4726]] of life: [[H2416]] in thy light [[H216]] shall we see [[H7200]] light. [[H216]]

### 10
O continue [[H4900]] thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] unto them that know [[H3045]] thee; and thy righteousness [[H6666]] to the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]

### 11
Let not [[H408]] the foot [[H7272]] of pride [[H1346]] come against [[H935]] me, and let not [[H408]] the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked [[H7563]] remove [[H5110]] me. [[H5110]]

### 12
There [[H8033]] are the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] fallen: [[H5307]] they are cast down, [[H1760]] and shall not [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to rise. [[H6965]]
