A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
I will sing [[H7891]] of mercy [[H2617]] and judgment: [[H4941]] unto thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] will I sing. [[H2167]]

### 2
I will behave myself wisely [[H7919]] in a perfect [[H8549]] way. [[H1870]] O when [[H4970]] wilt thou come [[H935]] unto [[H413]] me? I will walk [[H1980]] within [[H7130]] my house [[H1004]] with a perfect [[H8537]] heart. [[H3824]]

### 3
I will set [[H7896]] no [[H3808]] wicked [[H1100]] thing [[H1697]] before [[H5048]] mine eyes: [[H5869]] I hate [[H8130]] the work [[H6213]] of them that turn aside; [[H7750]] shall not [[H3808]] cleave [[H1692]] to me. [[H1692]]

### 4
A froward [[H6141]] heart [[H3824]] shall depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] me: I will not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] a wicked [[H7451]]

### 5
Whoso privily [[H5643]] slandereth [[H3960]] his neighbour, [[H7453]] him will I cut off: [[H6789]] him that hath an high [[H1362]] look [[H5869]] and a proud [[H7342]] heart [[H3824]] will not [[H3808]] I suffer. [[H3201]]

### 6
Mine eyes [[H5869]] upon the faithful [[H539]] of the land, [[H776]] that they may dwell [[H3427]] with [[H5978]] me: he that walketh [[H1980]] in a perfect [[H8549]] way, [[H1870]] he [[H1931]] shall serve [[H8334]] me. [[H8334]]

### 7
He that worketh [[H6213]] deceit [[H7423]] shall not [[H3808]] dwell [[H3427]] within [[H7130]] my house: [[H1004]] he that telleth [[H1696]] lies [[H8267]] shall not [[H3808]] tarry [[H3559]] in [[H5048]] my sight. [[H5869]]

### 8
I will early [[H1242]] destroy [[H6789]] all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7563]] of the land; [[H776]] that I may cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] wicked [[H205]] doers [[H6466]] from the city [[H5892]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
