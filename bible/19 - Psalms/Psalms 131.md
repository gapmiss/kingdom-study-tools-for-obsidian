A Song [[H7892]] of degrees [[H4609]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Lord, [[H3068]] my heart [[H3820]] is not [[H3808]] haughty, [[H1361]] nor [[H3808]] mine eyes [[H5869]] lofty: [[H7311]] neither [[H3808]] do I exercise [[H1980]] myself in great matters, [[H1419]] or in things too high [[H6381]] for [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 2
Surely [[H518]] I have behaved [[H7737]] and quieted [[H1826]] myself, [[H5315]] as a child that is weaned [[H1580]] of [[H5921]] his mother: [[H517]] my soul [[H5315]] even as a weaned child. [[H1580]]

### 3
Let Israel [[H3478]] hope [[H3176]] in [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] from henceforth [[H6258]] and for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]
