To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Mahalath, [[H4257]] Maschil, [[H4905]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
The fool [[H5036]] hath said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] no [[H369]] God. [[H430]] Corrupt [[H7843]] are they, and have done abominable [[H8581]] iniquity: [[H5766]] none [[H369]] that doeth [[H6213]] good. [[H2896]]

### 2
God [[H430]] looked down [[H8259]] from heaven [[H8064]] upon [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] to see [[H7200]] if there were [[H3426]] that did understand, [[H7919]] that did seek [[H1875]] God. [[H430]]

### 3
Every one [[H3605]] of them is gone back: [[H5472]] they are altogether [[H3162]] become filthy; [[H444]] none [[H369]] that doeth [[H6213]] good, [[H2896]] no, [[H369]] not [[H1571]] one. [[H259]]

### 4
Have the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] no [[H3808]] knowledge? [[H3045]] who eat up [[H398]] my people [[H5971]] they eat [[H398]] bread: [[H3899]] they have not [[H3808]] called upon [[H7121]] God. [[H430]]

### 5
There [[H8033]] were they in great [[H6343]] fear, [[H6342]] no [[H3808]] fear [[H6343]] was: [[H1961]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] hath scattered [[H6340]] the bones [[H6106]] of him that encampeth [[H2583]] thee: thou hast put to shame, [[H954]] because [[H3588]] God [[H430]] hath despised [[H3988]] them. [[H3988]]

### 6
Oh that [[H5414]] the salvation [[H3444]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of Zion! [[H6726]] When God [[H430]] bringeth back [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of his people, [[H5971]] Jacob [[H3290]] shall rejoice, [[H1523]] Israel [[H3478]] shall be glad. [[H8055]]
