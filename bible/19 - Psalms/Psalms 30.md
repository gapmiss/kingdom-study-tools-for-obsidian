A Psalm [[H4210]] Song [[H7892]] the dedication [[H2598]] of the house [[H1004]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
I will extol [[H7311]] thee, O Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] thou hast lifted me up, [[H1802]] and hast not [[H3808]] made my foes [[H341]] to rejoice [[H8055]] over me. [[H8055]]

### 2
O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] I cried [[H7768]] unto [[H413]] thee, and thou hast healed [[H7495]] me. [[H7495]]

### 3
O Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast brought up [[H5927]] my soul [[H5315]] from [[H4480]] the grave: [[H7585]] thou hast kept me alive, [[H2421]] that I should not go down [[H3381]] to the pit. [[H953]]

### 4
Sing [[H2167]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] O ye saints [[H2623]] of his, and give thanks [[H3034]] at the remembrance [[H2143]] of his holiness. [[H6944]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] his anger [[H639]] a moment; [[H7281]] in his favour [[H7522]] life: [[H2416]] weeping [[H1065]] may endure [[H3885]] for a night, [[H6153]] but joy [[H7440]] in the morning. [[H1242]]

### 6
And in my prosperity [[H7959]] I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] I shall never [[H5769]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 7
Lord, [[H3068]] by thy favour [[H7522]] thou hast made my mountain [[H2042]] to stand [[H5975]] strong: [[H5797]] thou didst hide [[H5641]] thy face, [[H6440]] I was [[H1961]] troubled. [[H926]]

### 8
I cried [[H7121]] to [[H413]] thee, O Lord; [[H3068]] and unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] I made supplication. [[H2603]]

### 9
What [[H4100]] profit [[H1215]] in my blood, [[H1818]] when I go down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the pit? [[H7845]] Shall the dust [[H6083]] praise [[H3034]] thee? shall it declare [[H5046]] thy truth? [[H571]]

### 10
Hear, [[H8085]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and have mercy [[H2603]] upon me: Lord, [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] thou my helper. [[H5826]]

### 11
Thou hast turned [[H2015]] for me my mourning [[H4553]] into dancing: [[H4234]] thou hast put off [[H6605]] my sackcloth, [[H8242]] and girded [[H247]] me with gladness; [[H8057]]

### 12
To the end that [[H4616]] glory [[H3519]] may sing praise [[H2167]] to thee, and not [[H3808]] be silent. [[H1826]] O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] I will give thanks [[H3034]] unto thee for ever. [[H5769]]
