### 1
Preserve [[H8104]] me, O God: [[H410]] for [[H3588]] in thee do I put my trust. [[H2620]]

### 2
thou hast said [[H559]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] Thou [[H859]] my Lord: [[H136]] my goodness [[H2896]] not [[H1077]] to [[H5921]] thee; [[H5921]]

### 3
to the saints [[H6918]] that [[H1992]] in the earth, [[H776]] and the excellent, [[H117]] in whom all [[H3605]] my delight. [[H2656]]

### 4
Their sorrows [[H6094]] shall be multiplied [[H7235]] hasten [[H4116]] another [[H312]] their drink offerings [[H5262]] of blood [[H1818]] will I not [[H1077]] offer, [[H5258]] nor [[H1077]] take up [[H5375]] their names [[H8034]] into [[H5921]] my lips. [[H8193]]

### 5
The Lord [[H3068]] the portion [[H4490]] of mine inheritance [[H2506]] and of my cup: [[H3563]] thou [[H859]] maintainest [[H8551]] my lot. [[H1486]]

### 6
The lines [[H2256]] are fallen [[H5307]] unto me in pleasant [[H5273]] yea, [[H637]] I have [[H5921]] a goodly [[H8231]] heritage. [[H5159]]

### 7
I will bless [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] hath given me counsel: [[H3289]] my reins [[H3629]] also [[H637]] instruct [[H3256]] me in the night seasons. [[H3915]]

### 8
I have set [[H7737]] the Lord [[H3068]] always [[H8548]] before [[H5048]] me: because [[H3588]] at my right hand, [[H3225]] I shall not [[H1077]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] my heart [[H3820]] is glad, [[H8055]] and my glory [[H3519]] rejoiceth: [[H1523]] my flesh [[H1320]] also [[H637]] shall rest [[H7931]] in hope. [[H983]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] thou wilt not [[H3808]] leave [[H5800]] my soul [[H5315]] in hell; [[H7585]] neither [[H3808]] wilt thou suffer [[H5414]] thine Holy One [[H2623]] to see [[H7200]] corruption. [[H7845]]

### 11
Thou wilt shew [[H3045]] me the path [[H734]] of life: [[H2416]] in [[H853]] thy presence [[H6440]] fulness [[H7648]] of joy; [[H8057]] at thy right hand [[H3225]] pleasures [[H5273]] for evermore. [[H5331]]
