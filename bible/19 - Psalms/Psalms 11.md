To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
In the Lord [[H3068]] put I my trust: [[H2620]] how [[H349]] say [[H559]] ye to my soul, [[H5315]] Flee [[H5110]] a bird [[H6833]] to your mountain? [[H2022]]

### 2
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] the wicked [[H7563]] bend [[H1869]] bow, [[H7198]] they make ready [[H3559]] their arrow [[H2671]] upon [[H5921]] the string, [[H3499]] that they may privily [[H652]] shoot [[H3384]] at the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]

### 3
If [[H3588]] the foundations [[H8356]] be destroyed, [[H2040]] what [[H4100]] can the righteous [[H6662]] do? [[H6466]]

### 4
The Lord [[H3068]] in his holy [[H6944]] temple, [[H1964]] the Lord's [[H3068]] throne [[H3678]] in heaven: [[H8064]] his eyes [[H5869]] behold, [[H2372]] his eyelids [[H6079]] try, [[H974]] the children [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 5
The Lord [[H3068]] trieth [[H974]] the righteous: [[H6662]] but the wicked [[H7563]] and him that loveth [[H157]] violence [[H2555]] his soul [[H5315]] hateth. [[H8130]]

### 6
Upon [[H5921]] the wicked [[H7563]] he shall rain [[H4305]] snares, [[H6341]] fire [[H784]] and brimstone, [[H1614]] and an horrible [[H2152]] tempest: [[H7307]] the portion [[H4521]] of their cup. [[H3563]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the righteous [[H6662]] Lord [[H3068]] loveth [[H157]] righteousness; [[H6666]] his countenance [[H6440]] doth behold [[H2372]] the upright. [[H3477]]
