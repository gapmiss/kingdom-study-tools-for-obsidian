To the chief Musician [[H5329]] on Neginoth, [[H5058]] Maschil, [[H4905]] of David, [[H1732]] when the Ziphims [[H2130]] came [[H935]] and said [[H559]] to Saul, [[H7586]] Doth not [[H3808]] David [[H1732]] hide himself [[H5641]] with [[H5973]] us? [[H5973]]

### 1
Save [[H3467]] me, O God, [[H430]] by thy name, [[H8034]] and judge [[H1777]] me by thy strength. [[H1369]]

### 2
Hear [[H8085]] my prayer, [[H8605]] O God; [[H430]] give ear [[H238]] to the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] strangers [[H2114]] are risen up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] me, and oppressors [[H6184]] seek after [[H1245]] my soul: [[H5315]] they have not [[H3808]] set [[H7760]] God [[H430]] before [[H5048]] them. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 4
Behold, [[H2009]] God [[H430]] mine helper: [[H5826]] the Lord [[H136]] with them that uphold [[H5564]] my soul. [[H5315]]

### 5
He shall reward [[H7725]] evil [[H7451]] unto mine enemies: [[H8324]] cut them off [[H6789]] in thy truth. [[H571]]

### 6
I will freely [[H5071]] sacrifice [[H2076]] unto thee: I will praise [[H3034]] thy name, [[H8034]] O Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] good. [[H2896]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] he hath delivered [[H5337]] me out of all [[H3605]] trouble: [[H6869]] and mine eye [[H5869]] hath seen [[H7200]] upon mine enemies. [[H341]]
