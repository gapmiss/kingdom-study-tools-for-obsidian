To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Sheminith, [[H8067]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Help, [[H3467]] Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] the godly man [[H2623]] ceaseth; [[H1584]] for [[H3588]] the faithful [[H539]] fail [[H6461]] from among the children [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 2
They speak [[H1696]] vanity [[H7723]] every one [[H376]] with [[H854]] his neighbour: [[H7453]] flattering [[H2513]] lips [[H8193]] with a double [[H3820]] heart [[H3820]] do they speak. [[H1696]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] shall cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] flattering [[H2513]] lips, [[H8193]] the tongue [[H3956]] that speaketh [[H1696]] proud things: [[H1419]]

### 4
Who [[H834]] have said, [[H559]] With our tongue [[H3956]] will we prevail; [[H1396]] our lips [[H8193]] our own: who [[H4310]] lord [[H113]] over us? [[H113]]

### 5
For the oppression [[H7701]] of the poor, [[H6041]] for the sighing [[H603]] of the needy, [[H34]] now [[H6258]] will I arise, [[H6965]] saith [[H559]] the Lord; [[H3068]] I will set [[H7896]] in safety [[H3468]] puffeth [[H6315]] at him. [[H6315]]

### 6
The words [[H565]] of the Lord [[H3068]] pure [[H2889]] words: [[H565]] silver [[H3701]] tried [[H6884]] in a furnace [[H5948]] of earth, [[H776]] purified [[H2212]] seven times. [[H7659]]

### 7
Thou [[H859]] shalt keep [[H8104]] them, O Lord, [[H3068]] thou shalt preserve [[H5341]] them from [[H4480]] this [[H2098]] generation [[H1755]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 8
The wicked [[H7563]] walk [[H1980]] on every side, [[H5439]] when the vilest [[H2149]] men [[H1121]] are exalted. [[H7311]]
