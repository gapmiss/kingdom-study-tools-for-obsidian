of David, [[H1732]] when he changed [[H8138]] his behaviour [[H2940]] before [[H6440]] Abimelech; [[H40]] who drove him away, [[H1644]] and he departed. [[H1980]]

### 1
I will bless [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3068]] at all [[H3605]] times: [[H6256]] his praise [[H8416]] continually [[H8548]] in my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 2
My soul [[H5315]] shall make her boast [[H1984]] in the Lord: [[H3068]] the humble [[H6035]] shall hear [[H8085]] and be glad. [[H8055]]

### 3
O magnify [[H1431]] the Lord [[H3068]] with [[H854]] me, and let us exalt [[H7311]] his name [[H8034]] together. [[H3162]]

### 4
I sought [[H1875]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he heard [[H6030]] me, and delivered [[H5337]] me from all [[H3605]] my fears. [[H4035]]

### 5
They looked [[H5027]] unto [[H413]] him, and were lightened: [[H5102]] and their faces [[H6440]] were not [[H408]] ashamed. [[H2659]]

### 6
This [[H2088]] poor man [[H6041]] cried, [[H7121]] and the Lord [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] and saved [[H3467]] him out of all [[H3605]] his troubles. [[H6869]]

### 7
The angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] encampeth [[H2583]] round about [[H5439]] them that fear [[H3373]] him, and delivereth [[H2502]] them. [[H2502]]

### 8
O taste [[H2938]] and see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] good: [[H2896]] blessed [[H835]] the man [[H1397]] trusteth [[H2620]] in him. [[H2620]]

### 9
O fear [[H3372]] the Lord, [[H3068]] ye his saints: [[H6918]] for [[H3588]] no [[H369]] want [[H4270]] to them that fear [[H3373]] him. [[H3373]]

### 10
The young lions [[H3715]] do lack, [[H7326]] and suffer hunger: [[H7456]] but they that seek [[H1875]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall not [[H3808]] want [[H2637]] any [[H3605]] good [[H2896]]

### 11
Come, [[H1980]] ye children, [[H1121]] hearken [[H8085]] unto me: I will teach [[H3925]] you the fear [[H3374]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 12
What [[H4310]] man [[H376]] desireth [[H2655]] life, [[H2416]] loveth [[H157]] days, [[H3117]] that he may see [[H7200]] good? [[H2896]]

### 13
Keep [[H5341]] thy tongue [[H3956]] from evil, [[H7451]] and thy lips [[H8193]] from speaking [[H1696]] guile. [[H4820]]

### 14
Depart [[H5493]] from evil, [[H7451]] and do [[H6213]] good; [[H2896]] seek [[H1245]] peace, [[H7965]] and pursue [[H7291]] it. [[H7291]]

### 15
The eyes [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] upon [[H413]] the righteous, [[H6662]] and his ears [[H241]] unto [[H413]] their cry. [[H7775]]

### 16
The face [[H6440]] of the Lord [[H3068]] against them that do [[H6213]] evil, [[H7451]] to cut off [[H3772]] the remembrance [[H2143]] of them from the earth. [[H776]]

### 17
cry, [[H6817]] and the Lord [[H3068]] heareth, [[H8085]] and delivereth [[H5337]] them out of all [[H3605]] their troubles. [[H6869]]

### 18
The Lord [[H3068]] nigh [[H7138]] unto them that are of a broken [[H7665]] heart; [[H3820]] and saveth [[H3467]] such as be of a contrite [[H1793]] spirit. [[H7307]]

### 19
Many [[H7227]] the afflictions [[H7451]] of the righteous: [[H6662]] but the Lord [[H3068]] delivereth [[H5337]] him out of them all. [[H3605]]

### 20
He keepeth [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] his bones: [[H6106]] not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of them [[H2007]] is broken. [[H7665]]

### 21
Evil [[H7451]] shall slay [[H4191]] the wicked: [[H7563]] and they that hate [[H8130]] the righteous [[H6662]] shall be desolate. [[H816]]

### 22
The Lord [[H3068]] redeemeth [[H6299]] the soul [[H5315]] of his servants: [[H5650]] and none [[H3808]] of them that trust [[H2620]] in him shall be desolate. [[H816]]
