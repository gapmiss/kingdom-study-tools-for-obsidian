A Prayer [[H8605]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Bow down [[H5186]] thine ear, [[H241]] O Lord, [[H3068]] hear [[H6030]] me: for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] poor [[H6041]] and needy. [[H34]]

### 2
Preserve [[H8104]] my soul; [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] holy: [[H2623]] O thou [[H859]] my God, [[H430]] save [[H3467]] thy servant [[H5650]] that trusteth [[H982]] in thee. [[H982]]

### 3
Be merciful [[H2603]] unto me, O Lord: [[H136]] for [[H3588]] I cry [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] thee daily. [[H3117]]

### 4
Rejoice [[H8055]] the soul [[H5315]] of thy servant: [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] unto [[H413]] thee, O Lord, [[H136]] do I lift up [[H5375]] my soul. [[H5315]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H136]] good, [[H2896]] and ready to forgive; [[H5546]] and plenteous [[H7227]] in mercy [[H2617]] unto all [[H3605]] them that call upon [[H7121]] thee. [[H7121]]

### 6
Give ear, [[H238]] O Lord, [[H3068]] unto my prayer; [[H8605]] and attend [[H7181]] to the voice [[H6963]] of my supplications. [[H8469]]

### 7
In the day [[H3117]] of my trouble [[H6869]] I will call upon [[H7121]] thee: for [[H3588]] thou wilt answer [[H6030]] me. [[H6030]]

### 8
Among the gods [[H430]] none [[H369]] like unto thee, [[H3644]] O Lord; [[H136]] neither [[H369]] like unto thy works. [[H4639]]

### 9
All [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] thou hast made [[H6213]] shall come [[H935]] and worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] thee, O Lord; [[H136]] and shall glorify [[H3513]] thy name. [[H8034]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] great, [[H1419]] and doest [[H6213]] wondrous things: [[H6381]] thou [[H859]] God [[H430]] alone. [[H430]]

### 11
Teach [[H3384]] me thy way, [[H1870]] O Lord; [[H3068]] I will walk [[H1980]] in thy truth: [[H571]] unite [[H3161]] my heart [[H3824]] to fear [[H3372]] thy name. [[H8034]]

### 12
I will praise [[H3034]] thee, O Lord [[H136]] my God, [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] my heart: [[H3824]] and I will glorify [[H3513]] thy name [[H8034]] for evermore. [[H5769]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] thy mercy [[H2617]] toward [[H5921]] me: and thou hast delivered [[H5337]] my soul [[H5315]] from the lowest [[H8482]] hell. [[H7585]]

### 14
O God, [[H430]] the proud [[H2086]] are risen [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] me, and the assemblies [[H5712]] of violent [[H6184]] have sought after [[H1245]] my soul; [[H5315]] and have not [[H3808]] set [[H7760]] thee before [[H5048]] them. [[H5048]]

### 15
But thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H136]] a God [[H410]] full of compassion, [[H7349]] and gracious, [[H2587]] longsuffering, [[H750]] and plenteous [[H7227]] in mercy [[H2617]] and truth. [[H571]]

### 16
O turn [[H6437]] unto [[H413]] me, and have mercy [[H2603]] upon me; give [[H5414]] thy strength [[H5797]] unto thy servant, [[H5650]] and save [[H3467]] the son [[H1121]] of thine handmaid. [[H519]]

### 17
Shew [[H6213]] me a token [[H226]] for good; [[H2896]] that they which hate [[H8130]] me may see [[H7200]] and be ashamed: [[H954]] because [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] Lord, [[H3068]] hast holpen [[H5826]] me, and comforted [[H5162]] me. [[H5162]]
