A Song [[H7892]] Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
Keep not thou silence, [[H1824]] O God: [[H430]] hold not thy peace, [[H2790]] and be not [[H408]] still, [[H8252]] O God. [[H410]]

### 2
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] thine enemies [[H341]] make a tumult: [[H1993]] and they that hate [[H8130]] thee have lifted up [[H5375]] the head. [[H7218]]

### 3
They have taken crafty [[H6191]] counsel [[H5475]] against [[H5921]] thy people, [[H5971]] and consulted [[H3289]] against [[H5921]] thy hidden ones. [[H6845]]

### 4
They have said, [[H559]] Come, [[H1980]] and let us cut them off [[H3582]] from a nation; [[H1471]] that the name [[H8034]] of Israel [[H3478]] may be no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] in remembrance. [[H2142]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] they have consulted [[H3289]] together [[H3162]] with one consent: [[H3820]] they are [[H3772]] confederate [[H1285]] against [[H5921]] thee: [[H5921]]

### 6
The tabernacles [[H168]] of Edom, [[H123]] and the Ishmaelites; [[H3459]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and the Hagarenes; [[H1905]]

### 7
Gebal, [[H1381]] and Ammon, [[H5983]] and Amalek; [[H6002]] the Philistines [[H6429]] with [[H5973]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Tyre; [[H6865]]

### 8
Assur [[H804]] also [[H1571]] is joined [[H3867]] with [[H5973]] them: they have [[H1961]] holpen [[H2220]] the children [[H1121]] of Lot. [[H3876]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 9
Do [[H6213]] unto them as the Midianites; [[H4080]] as Sisera, [[H5516]] as Jabin, [[H2985]] at the brook [[H5158]] of Kison: [[H7028]]

### 10
perished [[H8045]] at Endor: [[H5874]] they became [[H1961]] dung [[H1828]] for the earth. [[H127]]

### 11
Make [[H7896]] their nobles [[H5081]] like Oreb, [[H6159]] and like Zeeb: [[H2062]] yea, all [[H3605]] their princes [[H5257]] as Zebah, [[H2078]] and as Zalmunna: [[H6759]]

### 12
Who [[H834]] said, [[H559]] Let us take [[H3423]]  to ourselves [[H853]] the houses [[H4999]] of God [[H430]] in possession. [[H430]]

### 13
O my God, [[H430]] make [[H7896]] them like a wheel; [[H1534]] as the stubble [[H7179]] before [[H6440]] the wind. [[H7307]]

### 14
As the fire [[H784]] burneth [[H1197]] a wood, [[H3293]] and as the flame [[H3852]] setteth [[H3857]] the mountains [[H2022]] on fire; [[H2022]]

### 15
So [[H3651]] persecute [[H7291]] them with thy tempest, [[H5591]] and make them afraid [[H926]] with thy storm. [[H5492]]

### 16
Fill [[H4390]] their faces [[H6440]] with shame; [[H7036]] that they may seek [[H1245]] thy name, [[H8034]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 17
Let them be confounded [[H954]] and troubled [[H926]] for ever; [[H5703]] yea, let them be put to shame, [[H2659]] and perish: [[H6]]

### 18
That may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] whose name [[H8034]] alone [[H905]] Jehovah, [[H3068]] the most high [[H5945]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]
