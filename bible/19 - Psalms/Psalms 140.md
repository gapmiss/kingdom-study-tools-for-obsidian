To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Deliver [[H2502]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] from the evil [[H7451]] man: [[H120]] preserve [[H5341]] me from the violent [[H2555]] man; [[H376]]

### 2
Which [[H834]] imagine [[H2803]] mischiefs [[H7451]] in heart; [[H3820]] continually [[H3117]] are they gathered together [[H1481]] war. [[H4421]]

### 3
They have sharpened [[H8150]] their tongues [[H3956]] like [[H3644]] a serpent; [[H5175]] adders' [[H5919]] poison [[H2534]] under [[H8478]] their lips. [[H8193]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 4
Keep [[H8104]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] from the hands [[H3027]] of the wicked; [[H7563]] preserve [[H5341]] me from the violent [[H2555]] man; [[H376]] who [[H834]] have purposed [[H2803]] to overthrow [[H1760]] my goings. [[H6471]]

### 5
The proud [[H1343]] have hid [[H2934]] a snare [[H6341]] for me, and cords; [[H2256]] they have spread [[H6566]] a net [[H7568]] by the wayside; [[H3027]] they have set [[H7896]] gins [[H4170]] for me. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 6
I said [[H559]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] Thou [[H859]] my God: [[H410]] hear [[H238]] the voice [[H6963]] of my supplications, [[H8469]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 7
O God [[H3069]] the Lord, [[H136]] the strength [[H5797]] of my salvation, [[H3444]] thou hast covered [[H5526]] my head [[H7218]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle. [[H5402]]

### 8
Grant [[H5414]] not, [[H408]] O Lord, [[H3068]] the desires [[H3970]] of the wicked: [[H7563]] further [[H6329]] not [[H408]] his wicked device; [[H2162]] they exalt [[H7311]] themselves. Selah. [[H5542]]

### 9
the head [[H7218]] of those that compass me about, [[H4524]] let the mischief [[H5999]] of their own lips [[H8193]] cover [[H3680]] them. [[H3680]]

### 10
Let burning coals [[H1513]] fall [[H4131]] upon [[H5921]] them: let them be cast [[H5307]] into the fire; [[H784]] into deep pits, [[H4113]] that they rise again. [[H6965]] not [[H1077]] up [[H1077]]

### 11
Let not [[H1077]] an evil speaker [[H376]] be established [[H3559]] in the earth: [[H776]] evil [[H7451]] shall hunt [[H6679]] the violent [[H2555]] man [[H376]] to overthrow [[H4073]]

### 12
I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will maintain [[H6213]] the cause [[H1779]] of the afflicted, [[H6041]] the right [[H4941]] of the poor. [[H34]]

### 13
Surely [[H389]] the righteous [[H6662]] shall give thanks [[H3034]] unto thy name: [[H8034]] the upright [[H3477]] shall dwell [[H3427]] in thy presence. [[H6440]]
