To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] Al-taschith, [[H516]] Michtam [[H4387]] of David, [[H1732]] when he fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] Saul [[H7586]] in the cave. [[H4631]]

### 1
Be merciful [[H2603]] unto me, O God, [[H430]] be merciful [[H2603]] unto me: for [[H3588]] my soul [[H5315]] trusteth [[H2620]] in thee: yea, in the shadow [[H6738]] of thy wings [[H3671]] will I make my refuge, [[H2620]] until [[H5704]] calamities [[H1942]] be overpast. [[H5674]]

### 2
I will cry [[H7121]] unto God [[H430]] most high; [[H5945]] unto God [[H410]] that performeth [[H1584]] for [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 3
He shall send [[H7971]] from heaven, [[H8064]] and save [[H3467]] me the reproach [[H2778]] of him that would swallow me up. [[H7602]] Selah. [[H5542]] God [[H430]] shall send forth [[H7971]] his mercy [[H2617]] and his truth. [[H571]]

### 4
My soul [[H5315]] among [[H8432]] lions: [[H3833]] I lie [[H7901]] them that are set on fire, [[H3857]] the sons [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] whose teeth [[H8127]] spears [[H2595]] and arrows, [[H2671]] and their tongue [[H3956]] a sharp [[H2299]] sword. [[H2719]]

### 5
Be thou exalted, [[H7311]] O God, [[H430]] above [[H5921]] the heavens; [[H8064]] thy glory [[H3519]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 6
They have prepared [[H3559]] a net [[H7568]] for my steps; [[H6471]] my soul [[H5315]] is bowed down: [[H3721]] they have digged [[H3738]] a pit [[H7882]] before [[H6440]] me, into the midst [[H8432]] whereof they are fallen [[H5307]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 7
My heart [[H3820]] is fixed, [[H3559]] O God, [[H430]] my heart [[H3820]] is fixed: [[H3559]] I will sing [[H7891]] and give praise. [[H2167]]

### 8
Awake up, [[H5782]] my glory; [[H3519]] awake, [[H5782]] psaltery [[H5035]] and harp: [[H3658]] I will awake [[H5782]] early. [[H7837]]

### 9
I will praise [[H3034]] thee, O Lord, [[H136]] among the people: [[H5971]] I will sing [[H2167]] unto thee among the nations. [[H3816]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] thy mercy [[H2617]] great [[H1419]] unto [[H5704]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and thy truth [[H571]] unto [[H5704]] the clouds. [[H7834]]

### 11
Be thou exalted, [[H7311]] O God, [[H430]] above [[H5921]] the heavens: [[H8064]] thy glory [[H3519]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]
