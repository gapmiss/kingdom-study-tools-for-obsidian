of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
I will praise [[H3034]] thee with my whole [[H3605]] heart: [[H3820]] before [[H5048]] the gods [[H430]] will I sing praise [[H2167]] unto thee. [[H2167]]

### 2
I will worship [[H7812]] toward [[H413]] thy holy [[H6944]] temple, [[H1964]] and praise [[H3034]] thy name [[H8034]] for [[H5921]] thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] and for [[H5921]] thy truth: [[H571]] for [[H3588]] thou hast magnified [[H1431]] thy word [[H565]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] thy name. [[H8034]]

### 3
In the day [[H3117]] when I cried [[H7121]] thou answeredst [[H6030]] me, strengthenedst [[H7292]] me strength [[H5797]] in my soul. [[H5315]]

### 4
All [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] shall praise [[H3034]] thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] when [[H3588]] they hear [[H8085]] the words [[H561]] of thy mouth. [[H6310]]

### 5
Yea, they shall sing [[H7891]] in the ways [[H1870]] of the Lord: [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] the glory [[H3519]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 6
Though [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] high, [[H7311]] yet hath he respect [[H7200]] unto the lowly: [[H8217]] but the proud [[H1364]] he knoweth [[H3045]] afar off. [[H4801]]

### 7
Though [[H518]] I walk [[H1980]] in the midst [[H7130]] of trouble, [[H6869]] thou wilt revive [[H2421]] me: thou shalt stretch forth [[H7971]] thine hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the wrath [[H639]] of mine enemies, [[H341]] and thy right hand [[H3225]] shall save [[H3467]] me. [[H3467]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] will perfect [[H1584]] concerneth [[H1157]] me: thy mercy, [[H2617]] O Lord, [[H3068]] for ever: [[H5769]] forsake [[H7503]] not [[H408]] the works [[H4639]] of thine own hands. [[H3027]]
