A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] my prayer, [[H8605]] O Lord, [[H3068]] give ear [[H238]] to [[H413]] my supplications: [[H8469]] in thy faithfulness [[H530]] answer [[H6030]] me, in thy righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 2
And enter [[H935]] not [[H408]] into judgment [[H4941]] with [[H854]] thy servant: [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] in thy sight [[H6440]] shall no [[H3808]] man [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] be justified. [[H6663]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the enemy [[H341]] hath persecuted [[H7291]] my soul; [[H5315]] he hath smitten down [[H1792]] my life [[H2416]] to the ground; [[H776]] he hath made me to dwell [[H3427]] in darkness, [[H4285]] as those that have been long [[H5769]] dead. [[H4191]]

### 4
Therefore is my spirit [[H7307]] overwhelmed [[H5848]] within [[H5921]] me; my heart [[H3820]] within [[H8432]] me is desolate. [[H8074]]

### 5
I remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of old; [[H6924]] I meditate [[H1897]] on all [[H3605]] thy works; [[H6467]] I muse [[H7878]] on the work [[H4639]] of thy hands. [[H3027]]

### 6
I stretch forth [[H6566]] my hands [[H3027]] unto thee: [[H413]] my soul [[H5315]] after thee, as a thirsty [[H5889]] land. [[H776]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 7
Hear [[H6030]] me speedily, [[H4118]] O Lord: [[H3068]] my spirit [[H7307]] faileth: [[H3615]] hide [[H5641]] not [[H408]] thy face [[H6440]] from [[H4480]] me, lest I be like [[H4911]] unto [[H5973]] them that go down [[H3381]] into the pit. [[H953]]

### 8
Cause me to hear [[H8085]] thy lovingkindness [[H2617]] in the morning; [[H1242]] for [[H3588]] in thee do I trust: [[H982]] cause me to know [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] wherein [[H2098]] I should walk; [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] I lift up [[H5375]] my soul [[H5315]] unto [[H413]] thee. [[H413]]

### 9
Deliver me, [[H5337]] O Lord, [[H3068]] from mine enemies: [[H341]] unto thee [[H413]] I flee to hide me. [[H3680]]

### 10
Teach [[H3925]] me to do [[H6213]] thy will; [[H7522]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] my God: [[H430]] thy spirit [[H7307]] good; [[H2896]] lead [[H5148]] me into the land [[H776]] of uprightness. [[H4334]]

### 11
Quicken [[H2421]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] for thy name's [[H8034]] sake: [[H4616]] for thy righteousness' [[H6666]] sake bring [[H3318]] my soul [[H5315]] out of trouble. [[H6869]]

### 12
And of thy mercy [[H2617]] cut off [[H6789]] mine enemies, [[H341]] and destroy [[H6]] all [[H3605]] them that afflict [[H6887]] my soul: [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] thy servant. [[H5650]]
