### 1
Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord. [[H3050]] Praise [[H1984]] the Lord, [[H3068]] O my soul. [[H5315]]

### 2
While I live [[H2416]] will I praise [[H1984]] the Lord: [[H3068]] I will sing praises [[H2167]] unto my God [[H430]] while I have any being. [[H430]]

### 3
Put not [[H408]] your trust [[H982]] in princes, [[H5081]] in the son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] in whom no [[H369]] help. [[H8668]]

### 4
His breath [[H7307]] goeth forth, [[H3318]] he returneth [[H7725]] to his earth; [[H127]] in that very [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] his thoughts [[H6250]] perish. [[H6]]

### 5
Happy [[H835]] that the God [[H410]] of Jacob [[H3290]] for his help, [[H5828]] whose hope [[H7664]] in [[H5921]] the Lord [[H3068]] his God: [[H430]]

### 6
Which made [[H6213]] heaven, [[H8064]] and earth, [[H776]] the sea, [[H3220]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] therein which keepeth [[H8104]] truth [[H571]] for ever: [[H5769]]

### 7
Which executeth [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] for the oppressed: [[H6231]] which giveth [[H5414]] food [[H3899]] to the hungry. [[H7457]] The Lord [[H3068]] looseth [[H5425]] the prisoners: [[H631]]

### 8
The Lord [[H3068]] openeth [[H6491]] the blind: [[H5787]] the Lord [[H3068]] raiseth [[H2210]] them that are bowed down: [[H3721]] the Lord [[H3068]] loveth [[H157]] the righteous: [[H6662]]

### 9
The Lord [[H3068]] preserveth [[H8104]] the strangers; [[H1616]] he relieveth [[H5749]] the fatherless [[H3490]] and widow: [[H490]] but the way [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] he turneth upside down. [[H5791]]

### 10
The Lord [[H3068]] shall reign [[H4427]] for ever, [[H5769]] thy God, [[H430]] O Zion, [[H6726]] unto all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]] Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord. [[H3050]]
