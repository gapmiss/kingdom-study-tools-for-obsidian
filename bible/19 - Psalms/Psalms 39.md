To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] to Jeduthun, [[H3038]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
I said, [[H559]] I will take heed [[H8104]] to my ways, [[H1870]] that I sin [[H2398]] not with my tongue: [[H3956]] I will keep [[H8104]] my mouth [[H6310]] with a bridle, [[H4269]] while [[H5750]] the wicked [[H7563]] is before me. [[H5048]]

### 2
I was dumb [[H481]] with silence, [[H1747]] I held my peace, [[H2814]] from good; [[H2896]] and my sorrow [[H3511]] was stirred. [[H5916]]

### 3
My heart [[H3820]] was hot [[H2552]] within [[H7130]] me, while I was musing [[H1901]] the fire [[H784]] burned: [[H1197]] spake I [[H1696]] with my tongue, [[H3956]]

### 4
Lord, [[H3068]] make me to know [[H3045]] mine end, [[H7093]] and the measure [[H4060]] of my days, [[H3117]] what [[H4100]] it [[H1931]] I may know [[H3045]] how [[H4100]] frail [[H2310]] I [[H589]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2009]] thou hast made [[H5414]] my days [[H3117]] an handbreadth; [[H2947]] and mine age [[H2465]] as nothing [[H369]] before [[H5048]] thee: verily [[H389]] every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] at his best state [[H5324]] altogether [[H3605]] vanity. [[H1892]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 6
Surely [[H389]] every man [[H376]] walketh [[H1980]] in a vain shew: [[H6754]] surely [[H389]] they are disquieted [[H1993]] in vain: [[H1892]] he heapeth up [[H6651]] and knoweth [[H3045]] not [[H3808]] who [[H4310]] shall gather [[H622]] them. [[H622]]

### 7
And now, [[H6258]] Lord, [[H136]] what [[H4100]] wait [[H6960]] I for? my hope [[H8431]] in thee. [[H8431]]

### 8
Deliver [[H5337]] me from all [[H3605]] my transgressions: [[H6588]] make [[H7760]] me not [[H408]] the reproach [[H2781]] of the foolish. [[H5036]]

### 9
I was dumb, [[H481]] I opened [[H6605]] not [[H3808]] my mouth; [[H6310]] because [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] didst [[H6213]]

### 10
Remove [[H5493]] thy stroke [[H5061]] away from [[H5921]] me: I [[H589]] am consumed [[H3615]] by the blow [[H8409]] of thine hand. [[H3027]]

### 11
When thou with rebukes [[H8433]] dost correct [[H3256]] man [[H376]] for [[H5921]] iniquity, [[H5771]] thou makest his beauty [[H2530]] to consume away [[H4529]] like a moth: [[H6211]] surely [[H389]] every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] vanity. [[H1892]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 12
Hear [[H8085]] my prayer, [[H8605]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and give ear [[H238]] unto my cry; [[H7775]] hold not thy peace [[H2790]] at [[H413]] my tears: [[H1832]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] a stranger [[H1616]] with [[H5973]] thee, a sojourner, [[H8453]] as all [[H3605]] my fathers [[H1]]

### 13
O spare [[H8159]] me, that I may recover strength, [[H1082]] before [[H2962]] I go hence, [[H3212]] and be no more. [[H369]]
