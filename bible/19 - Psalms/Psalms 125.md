A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
They that trust [[H982]] in the Lord [[H3068]] as mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] cannot [[H3808]] be removed, [[H4131]] abideth [[H3427]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 2
the mountains [[H2022]] round about [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so the Lord [[H3068]] round about [[H5439]] his people [[H5971]] from henceforth [[H6258]] even for [[H5704]] ever. [[H5769]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the rod [[H7626]] of the wicked [[H7562]] shall not [[H3808]] rest [[H5117]] upon [[H5921]] the lot [[H1486]] of the righteous; [[H6662]] lest [[H4616]] the righteous [[H6662]] put forth [[H7971]] their hands [[H3027]] unto iniquity. [[H5766]]

### 4
Do good, [[H2895]] O Lord, [[H3068]] unto good, [[H2896]] and to upright [[H3477]] in their hearts. [[H3826]]

### 5
As for such as turn aside [[H5186]] unto their crooked ways, [[H6128]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall lead them forth [[H1980]] with [[H854]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity: [[H205]] peace [[H7965]] upon [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]
