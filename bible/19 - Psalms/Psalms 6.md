To the chief Musician [[H5329]] on Neginoth [[H5058]] upon [[H5921]] Sheminith, [[H8067]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
O Lord, [[H3068]] rebuke [[H3198]] me not [[H408]] in thine anger, [[H639]] neither [[H408]] chasten [[H3256]] me in thy hot displeasure. [[H2534]]

### 2
Have mercy [[H2603]] upon me, O Lord; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] weak: [[H536]] O Lord, [[H3068]] heal [[H7495]] me; for [[H3588]] my bones [[H6106]] are vexed. [[H926]]

### 3
My soul [[H5315]] is also sore [[H3966]] vexed: [[H926]] but thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] how long? [[H5704]]

### 4
Return, [[H7725]] O Lord, [[H3068]] deliver [[H2502]] my soul: [[H5315]] oh save [[H3467]] me for thy mercies' [[H2617]] sake. [[H4616]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] in death [[H4194]] no [[H369]] remembrance [[H2143]] of thee: in the grave [[H7585]] who [[H4310]] shall give thee thanks? [[H3034]]

### 6
I am weary [[H3021]] with my groaning; [[H585]] all [[H3605]] the night [[H3915]] make I my bed [[H4296]] to swim; [[H7811]] I water [[H4529]] my couch [[H6210]] with my tears. [[H1832]]

### 7
Mine eye [[H5869]] is consumed [[H6244]] because of grief; [[H3708]] it waxeth old [[H6275]] because of all [[H3605]] mine enemies. [[H6887]]

### 8
Depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] me, all [[H3605]] ye workers [[H6466]] of iniquity; [[H205]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of my weeping. [[H1065]]

### 9
The Lord [[H3068]] hath heard [[H8085]] my supplication; [[H8467]] the Lord [[H3068]] will receive [[H3947]] my prayer. [[H8605]]

### 10
Let all [[H3605]] mine enemies [[H341]] be ashamed [[H954]] and sore [[H3966]] vexed: [[H926]] let them return [[H7725]] be ashamed [[H954]] suddenly. [[H7281]]
