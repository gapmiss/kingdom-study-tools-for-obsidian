### 1
I love [[H157]] the Lord, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] he hath heard [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] my supplications. [[H8469]]

### 2
Because [[H3588]] he hath inclined [[H5186]] his ear [[H241]] unto me, therefore will I call upon [[H7121]] as long as I live. [[H3117]]

### 3
The sorrows [[H2256]] of death [[H4194]] compassed [[H661]] me, and the pains [[H4712]] of hell [[H7585]] gat hold upon [[H4672]] me: I found [[H4672]] trouble [[H6869]] and sorrow. [[H3015]]

### 4
Then called [[H7121]] I upon the name [[H8034]] of the Lord; [[H3068]] O Lord, [[H3068]] I beseech [[H577]] thee, deliver [[H4422]] my soul. [[H5315]]

### 5
Gracious [[H2587]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and righteous; [[H6662]] yea, our God [[H430]] merciful. [[H7355]]

### 6
The Lord [[H3068]] preserveth [[H8104]] the simple: [[H6612]] I was brought low, [[H1809]] and he helped [[H3467]] me. [[H3467]]

### 7
Return [[H7725]] unto thy rest, [[H4494]] O my soul; [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath dealt bountifully [[H1580]] with [[H5921]] thee. [[H5921]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] thou hast delivered [[H2502]] my soul [[H5315]] from death, [[H4194]] mine eyes [[H5869]] from [[H4480]] tears, [[H1832]] my feet [[H7272]] from falling. [[H1762]]

### 9
I will walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 10
I believed, [[H539]] therefore [[H3588]] have I [[H589]] spoken: [[H1696]] I was greatly [[H3966]] afflicted: [[H6031]]

### 11
I [[H589]] said [[H559]] in my haste, [[H2648]] All [[H3605]] men [[H120]] liars. [[H3576]]

### 12
What [[H4100]] shall I render [[H7725]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] his benefits [[H8408]] toward [[H5921]] me? [[H5921]]

### 13
I will take [[H5375]] the cup [[H3563]] of salvation, [[H3444]] and call [[H7121]] upon the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 14
I will pay [[H7999]] my vows [[H5088]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] now [[H4994]] in the presence [[H5048]] of all [[H3605]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 15
Precious [[H3368]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Lord [[H3068]] the death [[H4194]] of his saints. [[H2623]]

### 16
O Lord, [[H3068]] truly [[H577]] I [[H589]] thy servant; [[H5650]] I [[H589]] thy servant, [[H5650]] the son [[H1121]] of thine handmaid: [[H519]] thou hast loosed [[H6605]] my bonds. [[H4147]]

### 17
I will offer [[H2076]] to thee the sacrifice [[H2077]] of thanksgiving, [[H8426]] and will call [[H7121]] upon the name [[H8034]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 18
I will pay [[H7999]] my vows [[H5088]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] now [[H4994]] in the presence [[H5048]] of all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]]

### 19
In the courts [[H2691]] of the Lord's [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] in the midst [[H8432]] of thee, O Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord. [[H3050]]
