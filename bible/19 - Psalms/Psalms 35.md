of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Plead [[H7378]] O Lord, [[H3068]] with [[H853]] them that strive [[H3401]] with me: fight against [[H3898]] them that fight against [[H3898]] me. [[H3898]]

### 2
Take hold [[H2388]] of shield [[H4043]] and buckler, [[H6793]] and stand up [[H6965]] for mine help. [[H5833]]

### 3
Draw out [[H7324]] also the spear, [[H2595]] and stop [[H5462]] against [[H7125]] them that persecute [[H7291]] me: say [[H559]] unto my soul, [[H5315]] I [[H589]] thy salvation. [[H3444]]

### 4
Let them be confounded [[H954]] and put to shame [[H3637]] that seek after [[H1245]] my soul: [[H5315]] let them be turned [[H5472]] back [[H268]] and brought to confusion [[H2659]] that devise [[H2803]] my hurt. [[H7451]]

### 5
Let them be [[H1961]] as chaff [[H4671]] before [[H6440]] the wind: [[H7307]] and let the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] chase [[H1760]]

### 6
Let their way [[H1870]] be [[H1961]] dark [[H2822]] and slippery: [[H2519]] and let the angel [[H4397]] of the Lord [[H3068]] persecute [[H7291]] them. [[H7291]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] without cause [[H2600]] have they hid [[H2934]] for me their net [[H7568]] a pit, [[H7845]] without cause [[H2600]] they have digged [[H2658]] for my soul. [[H5315]]

### 8
Let destruction [[H7722]] come upon [[H935]] him at unawares; [[H3045]] and let his net [[H7568]] that [[H834]] he hath hid [[H2934]] catch [[H3920]] himself: into that very destruction [[H7722]] let him fall. [[H5307]]

### 9
And my soul [[H5315]] shall be joyful [[H1523]] in the Lord: [[H3068]] it shall rejoice [[H7797]] in his salvation. [[H3444]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] my bones [[H6106]] shall say, [[H559]] Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H4310]] like unto thee, [[H3644]] which deliverest [[H5337]] the poor [[H6041]] from him that is too strong [[H2389]] for [[H4480]] him, yea, the poor [[H6041]] and the needy [[H34]] from him that spoileth [[H1497]] him? [[H1497]]

### 11
False [[H2555]] witnesses [[H5707]] did rise up; [[H6965]] they laid to my charge [[H7592]] that [[H834]] I knew [[H3045]] not. [[H3808]]

### 12
They rewarded [[H7999]] me evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good [[H2896]] the spoiling [[H7908]] of my soul. [[H5315]]

### 13
But as for me, [[H589]] when they were sick, [[H2470]] my clothing [[H3830]] sackcloth: [[H8242]] I humbled [[H6031]] my soul [[H5315]] with fasting; [[H6685]] and my prayer [[H8605]] returned [[H7725]] into [[H5921]] mine own bosom. [[H2436]]

### 14
I behaved myself [[H1980]] as though my friend [[H7453]] brother: [[H251]] I bowed down [[H7817]] heavily, [[H6937]] as one that mourneth [[H57]] mother. [[H517]]

### 15
But in mine adversity [[H6761]] they rejoiced, [[H8055]] and gathered themselves together: [[H622]] the abjects [[H5222]] gathered themselves together [[H622]] against [[H5921]] me, and I knew [[H3045]] not; [[H3808]] they did tear [[H7167]] and ceased [[H1826]] not: [[H3808]]

### 16
With hypocritical [[H2611]] mockers [[H3934]] in feasts, [[H4580]] they gnashed [[H2786]] upon [[H5921]] me with their teeth. [[H8127]]

### 17
Lord, [[H136]] how long [[H4100]] wilt thou look on? [[H7200]] rescue [[H7725]] my soul [[H5315]] from their destructions, [[H7722]] my darling [[H3173]] from the lions. [[H3715]]

### 18
I will give thee thanks [[H3034]] in the great [[H7227]] congregation: [[H6951]] I will praise [[H1984]] thee among much [[H6099]] people. [[H5971]]

### 19
Let not [[H408]] them that are mine enemies [[H341]] wrongfully [[H8267]] rejoice [[H8055]] over me: let them wink [[H7169]] with the eye [[H5869]] that hate [[H8130]] me without a cause. [[H2600]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] they speak [[H1696]] not [[H3808]] peace: [[H7965]] but they devise [[H2803]] deceitful [[H4820]] matters [[H1697]] against [[H5921]] quiet [[H7282]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 21
Yea, they opened their mouth [[H6310]] wide [[H7337]] against [[H5921]] me, said, [[H559]] Aha, [[H1889]] aha, [[H1889]] our eye [[H5869]] hath seen [[H7200]]

### 22
thou hast seen, [[H7200]] O Lord: [[H3068]] keep not [[H408]] silence: [[H2790]] O Lord, [[H136]] be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 23
Stir up thyself, [[H5782]] and awake [[H6974]] to my judgment, [[H4941]] unto my cause, [[H7379]] my God [[H430]] and my Lord. [[H136]]

### 24
Judge [[H8199]] me, O Lord [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] according to thy righteousness; [[H6664]] and let them not [[H408]] rejoice [[H8055]] over me. [[H8055]]

### 25
Let them not [[H408]] say [[H559]] in their hearts, [[H3820]] Ah, [[H1889]] so would we have it: [[H5315]] let them not [[H408]] say, [[H559]] We have swallowed him up. [[H1104]]

### 26
Let them be ashamed [[H954]] and brought to confusion [[H2659]] together [[H3162]] that rejoice [[H8056]] at mine hurt: [[H7451]] let them be clothed [[H3847]] with shame [[H1322]] and dishonour [[H3639]] that magnify [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 27
Let them shout for joy, [[H7442]] and be glad, [[H8055]] that favour [[H2655]] my righteous cause: [[H6664]] yea, let them say [[H559]] continually, [[H8548]] Let the Lord [[H3068]] be magnified, [[H1431]] which hath pleasure [[H2655]] in the prosperity [[H7965]] of his servant. [[H5650]]

### 28
And my tongue [[H3956]] shall speak [[H1897]] of thy righteousness [[H6664]] of thy praise [[H8416]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long. [[H3117]]
