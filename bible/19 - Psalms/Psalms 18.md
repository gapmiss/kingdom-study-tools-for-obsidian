To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] of David, [[H1732]] the servant [[H5650]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] spake [[H1696]] unto the Lord [[H3068]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] song [[H7892]] in the day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H3068]] delivered [[H5337]] him from the hand [[H3709]] of all [[H3605]] his enemies, [[H341]] and from the hand [[H3027]] of Saul: [[H7586]] And he said, [[H559]]

### 1
I will love thee, [[H7355]] O Lord, [[H3068]] my strength. [[H2391]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] my rock, [[H5553]] and my fortress, [[H4686]] and my deliverer; [[H6403]] my God, [[H410]] my strength, [[H6697]] in whom I will trust; [[H2620]] my buckler, [[H4043]] and the horn [[H7161]] of my salvation, [[H3468]] my high tower. [[H4869]]

### 3
I will call [[H7121]] upon the Lord, [[H3068]] to be praised: [[H1984]] so shall I be saved [[H3467]] from [[H4480]] mine enemies. [[H341]]

### 4
The sorrows [[H2256]] of death [[H4194]] compassed [[H661]] me, and the floods [[H5158]] of ungodly men [[H1100]] made me afraid. [[H1204]]

### 5
The sorrows [[H2256]] of hell [[H7585]] compassed me about: [[H5437]] the snares [[H4170]] of death [[H4194]] prevented [[H6923]] me. [[H6923]]

### 6
In my distress [[H6862]] I called upon [[H7121]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and cried [[H7768]] unto [[H413]] my God: [[H430]] he heard [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] out of his temple, [[H1964]] and my cry [[H7775]] came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] him, into his ears. [[H241]]

### 7
Then the earth [[H776]] shook [[H1607]] and trembled; [[H7493]] the foundations [[H4146]] also of the hills [[H2022]] moved [[H7264]] and were shaken, [[H1607]] because [[H3588]] he was wroth. [[H2734]]

### 8
There went up [[H5927]] a smoke [[H6227]] out of his nostrils, [[H639]] and fire [[H784]] out of his mouth [[H6310]] devoured: [[H398]] coals [[H1513]] were kindled [[H1197]] by [[H4480]] it. [[H4480]]

### 9
He bowed [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] also, and came down: [[H3381]] and darkness [[H6205]] under [[H8478]] his feet. [[H7272]]

### 10
And he rode [[H7392]] upon [[H5921]] a cherub, [[H3742]] and did fly: [[H5774]] yea, he did fly [[H1675]] upon [[H5921]] the wings [[H3671]] of the wind. [[H7307]]

### 11
He made [[H7896]] darkness [[H2822]] his secret place; [[H5643]] his pavilion [[H5521]] round about [[H5439]] him dark [[H2824]] waters [[H4325]] thick clouds [[H5645]] of the skies. [[H7834]]

### 12
At the brightness [[H5051]] before [[H5048]] him his thick clouds [[H5645]] passed, [[H5674]] hail [[H1259]] and coals [[H1513]] of fire. [[H784]]

### 13
The Lord [[H3068]] also thundered [[H7481]] in the heavens, [[H8064]] and the Highest [[H5945]] gave [[H5414]] his voice; [[H6963]] hail [[H1259]] and coals [[H1513]] of fire. [[H784]]

### 14
Yea, he sent out [[H7971]] his arrows, [[H2671]] and scattered [[H6327]] them; and he shot out [[H7232]] lightnings, [[H1300]] and discomfited [[H2000]] them. [[H2000]]

### 15
Then the channels [[H650]] of waters [[H4325]] were seen, [[H7200]] and the foundations [[H4146]] of the world [[H8398]] were discovered [[H1540]] at thy rebuke, [[H1606]] O Lord, [[H3068]] at the blast [[H5397]] of the breath [[H7307]] of thy nostrils. [[H639]]

### 16
He sent [[H7971]] from above, [[H4791]] he took [[H3947]] me, he drew [[H4871]] me out of many [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 17
He delivered [[H5337]] me from my strong [[H5794]] enemy, [[H341]] and from them which hated [[H8130]] me: for [[H3588]] they were too strong [[H553]] for [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 18
They prevented [[H6923]] me in the day [[H3117]] of my calamity: [[H343]] but the Lord [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] my stay. [[H4937]]

### 19
He brought me forth [[H3318]] also into a large place; [[H4800]] he delivered [[H2502]] me, because [[H3588]] he delighted [[H2654]] in me. [[H2654]]

### 20
The Lord [[H3068]] rewarded [[H1580]] me according to my righteousness; [[H6664]] according to the cleanness [[H1252]] of my hands [[H3027]] hath he recompensed [[H7725]] me. [[H7725]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] I have kept [[H8104]] the ways [[H1870]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and have not [[H3808]] wickedly departed [[H7561]] from my God. [[H430]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] his judgments [[H4941]] before [[H5048]] me, and I did not [[H3808]] put away [[H5493]] his statutes [[H2708]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 23
I was [[H1961]] also upright [[H8549]] before [[H5973]] him, and I kept myself [[H8104]] from mine iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 24
Therefore hath the Lord [[H3068]] recompensed [[H7725]] me according to my righteousness, [[H6664]] according to the cleanness [[H1252]] of my hands [[H3027]] in [[H5048]] his eyesight. [[H5869]]

### 25
With [[H5973]] the merciful [[H2623]] thou wilt shew thyself merciful; [[H2616]] with [[H5973]] an upright [[H8549]] man [[H1399]] thou wilt shew thyself upright; [[H8552]]

### 26
With [[H5973]] the pure [[H1305]] thou wilt shew thyself pure; [[H1305]] and with [[H5973]] the froward [[H6141]] thou wilt shew thyself froward. [[H6617]]

### 27
For [[H3588]] thou wilt [[H859]] save [[H3467]] the afflicted [[H6041]] people; [[H5971]] but wilt bring down [[H8213]] high [[H7311]] looks. [[H5869]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] wilt light [[H215]] my candle: [[H5216]] the Lord [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] will enlighten [[H5050]] my darkness. [[H2822]]

### 29
For [[H3588]] by thee I have run through [[H7323]] a troop; [[H1416]] and by my God [[H430]] have I leaped over [[H1801]] a wall. [[H7791]]

### 30
God, [[H410]] his way [[H1870]] perfect: [[H8549]] the word [[H565]] of the Lord [[H3068]] is tried: [[H6884]] he [[H1931]] a buckler [[H4043]] to all [[H3605]] those that trust [[H2620]] in him. [[H2620]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] God [[H433]] save [[H1107]] the Lord? [[H3068]] or who [[H4310]] a rock [[H6697]] save [[H2108]] our God? [[H430]]

### 32
God [[H410]] that girdeth [[H247]] me with strength, [[H2428]] and maketh [[H5414]] my way [[H1870]] perfect. [[H8549]]

### 33
He maketh [[H7737]] my feet [[H7272]] like hinds' [[H355]] and setteth [[H5975]] me upon [[H5921]] my high places. [[H1116]]

### 34
He teacheth [[H3925]] my hands [[H3027]] to war, [[H4421]] so that a bow [[H7198]] of steel [[H5154]] is broken [[H5181]] by mine arms. [[H2220]]

### 35
Thou hast also given [[H5414]] me the shield [[H4043]] of thy salvation: [[H3468]] and thy right hand [[H3225]] hath holden me up, [[H5582]] and thy gentleness [[H6037]] hath made me great. [[H7235]]

### 36
Thou hast enlarged [[H7337]] my steps [[H6806]] under [[H8478]] me, that my feet [[H7166]] did not [[H3808]] slip. [[H4571]]

### 37
I have pursued [[H7291]] mine enemies, [[H341]] and overtaken [[H5381]] them: neither [[H3808]] did I turn again [[H7725]] till [[H5704]] they were consumed. [[H3615]]

### 38
I have wounded [[H4272]] them that they were not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to rise: [[H6965]] they are fallen [[H5307]] under [[H8478]] my feet. [[H7272]]

### 39
For thou hast girded [[H247]] me with strength [[H2428]] unto the battle: [[H4421]] thou hast subdued [[H3766]] under [[H8478]] me those that rose up [[H6965]] against me. [[H6965]]

### 40
Thou hast also given [[H5414]] me the necks [[H6203]] of mine enemies; [[H341]] that I might destroy [[H6789]] them that hate [[H8130]] me. [[H8130]]

### 41
They cried, [[H7768]] but none [[H369]] to save [[H3467]] unto [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] but he answered [[H6030]] them not. [[H3808]]

### 42
Then did I beat [[H7833]] them small as the dust [[H6083]] before [[H6440]] the wind: [[H7307]] I did cast them out [[H7324]] as the dirt [[H2916]] in the streets. [[H2351]]

### 43
Thou hast delivered [[H6403]] me from the strivings [[H7379]] of the people; [[H5971]] thou hast made [[H7760]] me the head [[H7218]] of the heathen: [[H1471]] a people [[H5971]] I have not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] shall serve [[H5647]] me. [[H5647]]

### 44
As soon as they hear [[H8088]] of me, they shall obey [[H8085]] me: the strangers [[H1121]] shall submit [[H3584]] themselves unto me. [[H3584]]

### 45
The strangers [[H1121]] shall fade away, [[H5034]] and be afraid [[H2727]] out of their close places. [[H4526]]

### 46
The Lord [[H3068]] liveth; [[H2416]] and blessed [[H1288]] my rock; [[H6697]] and let the God [[H430]] of my salvation [[H3468]] be exalted. [[H7311]]

### 47
God [[H410]] that avengeth [[H5414]] me, and subdueth [[H1696]] the people [[H5971]] under [[H8478]] me. [[H8478]]

### 48
He delivereth [[H6403]] me from mine enemies: [[H341]] yea, [[H637]] thou liftest me up [[H7311]] above [[H4480]] those that rise up [[H6965]] against me: thou hast delivered [[H5337]] me from the violent [[H2555]] man. [[H376]]

### 49
Therefore [[H5921]] will I give thanks [[H3034]] unto thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] and sing praises [[H2167]] unto thy name. [[H8034]]

### 50
Great [[H1431]] deliverance [[H3444]] giveth he to his king; [[H4428]] and sheweth [[H6213]] mercy [[H2617]] to his anointed, [[H4899]] to David, [[H1732]] and to his seed [[H2233]] for [[H5704]] evermore. [[H5769]]
