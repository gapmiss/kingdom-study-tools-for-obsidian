### 1
O Lord [[H3068]] God, [[H410]] to whom vengeance [[H5360]] belongeth; O God, [[H410]] to whom vengeance [[H5360]] belongeth, shew [[H3313]] thyself. [[H3313]]

### 2
Lift up thyself, [[H5375]] thou judge [[H8199]] of the earth: [[H776]] render [[H7725]] a reward [[H1576]] to [[H5921]] the proud. [[H1343]]

### 3
Lord, [[H3068]] how long [[H5704]] shall the wicked, [[H7563]] how long [[H5704]] shall the wicked [[H7563]] triumph? [[H5937]]

### 4
shall they utter [[H5042]] speak [[H1696]] hard things? [[H6277]] all [[H3605]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] boast [[H559]] themselves? [[H559]]

### 5
They break in pieces [[H1792]] thy people, [[H5971]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and afflict [[H6031]] thine heritage. [[H5159]]

### 6
They slay [[H2026]] the widow [[H490]] and the stranger, [[H1616]] and murder [[H7523]] the fatherless. [[H3490]]

### 7
Yet they say, [[H559]] The Lord [[H3050]] shall not [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] neither [[H3808]] shall the God [[H430]] of Jacob [[H3290]] regard [[H995]]

### 8
Understand, [[H995]] ye brutish [[H1197]] among the people: [[H5971]] and fools, [[H3684]] when [[H4970]] will ye be wise? [[H7919]]

### 9
He that planted [[H5193]] the ear, [[H241]] shall he not [[H3808]] hear? [[H8085]] he that formed [[H3335]] the eye, [[H5869]] shall he not [[H3808]] see? [[H5027]]

### 10
He that chastiseth [[H3256]] the heathen, [[H1471]] shall not [[H3808]] he correct? [[H3198]] he that teacheth [[H3925]] man [[H120]] knowledge, [[H1847]]

### 11
The Lord [[H3068]] knoweth [[H3045]] the thoughts [[H4284]] of man, [[H120]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] vanity. [[H1892]]

### 12
Blessed [[H835]] the man [[H1397]] whom [[H834]] thou chastenest, [[H3256]] O Lord, [[H3050]] and teachest [[H3925]] him out of thy law; [[H8451]]

### 13
That thou mayest give him rest [[H8252]] from the days [[H3117]] of adversity, [[H7451]] until [[H5704]] the pit [[H7845]] be digged [[H3738]] for the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] cast off [[H5203]] his people, [[H5971]] neither [[H3808]] will he forsake [[H5800]] his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 15
But [[H3588]] judgment [[H4941]] shall return [[H7725]] unto [[H5704]] righteousness: [[H6664]] and all [[H3605]] the upright [[H3477]] in heart [[H3820]] shall follow [[H310]] it. [[H310]]

### 16
Who [[H4310]] will rise up [[H6965]] for me against [[H5973]] the evildoers? [[H7489]] who [[H4310]] will stand up [[H3320]] for me against [[H5973]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity? [[H205]]

### 17
Unless [[H3884]] the Lord [[H3068]] my help, [[H5833]] my soul [[H5315]] had almost [[H4592]] dwelt [[H7931]] in silence. [[H1745]]

### 18
When [[H518]] I said, [[H559]] My foot [[H7272]] slippeth; [[H4131]] thy mercy, [[H2617]] O Lord, [[H3068]] held me up. [[H5582]]

### 19
In the multitude [[H7230]] of my thoughts [[H8312]] within [[H7130]] me thy comforts [[H8575]] delight [[H8173]] my soul. [[H5315]]

### 20
Shall the throne [[H3678]] of iniquity [[H1942]] have fellowship [[H2266]] with thee, which frameth [[H3335]] mischief [[H5999]] by [[H5921]] a law? [[H2706]]

### 21
They gather themselves together [[H1413]] against [[H5921]] the soul [[H5315]] of the righteous, [[H6662]] and condemn [[H7561]] the innocent [[H5355]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 22
But the Lord [[H3068]] is [[H1961]] my defence; [[H4869]] and my God [[H430]] the rock [[H6697]] of my refuge. [[H4268]]

### 23
And he shall bring [[H7725]] upon [[H5921]]  them [[H853]] their own iniquity, [[H205]] and shall cut them off [[H6789]] in their own wickedness; [[H7451]] the Lord [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] shall cut them off. [[H6789]]
