A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
In my distress [[H6869]] I cried [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and he heard [[H6030]] me. [[H6030]]

### 2
Deliver [[H5337]] my soul, [[H5315]] O Lord, [[H3068]] from lying [[H8267]] lips, [[H8193]] from a deceitful [[H7423]] tongue. [[H3956]]

### 3
What [[H4100]] shall be given [[H5414]] unto thee? or what [[H4100]] shall be done [[H3254]] unto thee, thou false [[H7423]] tongue? [[H3956]]

### 4
Sharp [[H8150]] arrows [[H2671]] of the mighty, [[H1368]] with [[H5973]] coals [[H1513]] of juniper. [[H7574]]

### 5
Woe [[H190]] is me, that [[H3588]] I sojourn [[H1481]] in Mesech, [[H4902]] I dwell [[H7931]] in [[H5973]] the tents [[H168]] of Kedar! [[H6938]]

### 6
My soul [[H5315]] hath long [[H7227]] dwelt [[H7931]] with [[H5973]] him that hateth [[H8130]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 7
I [[H589]] peace: [[H7965]] but when [[H3588]] I speak, [[H1696]] they [[H1992]] for war. [[H4421]]
