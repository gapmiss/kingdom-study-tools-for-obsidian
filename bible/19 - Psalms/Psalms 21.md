To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
The king [[H4428]] shall joy [[H8055]] in thy strength, [[H5797]] O Lord; [[H3068]] and in thy salvation [[H3444]] how [[H4100]] greatly [[H3966]] shall he rejoice! [[H1523]]

### 2
Thou hast given [[H5414]] him his heart's [[H3820]] desire, [[H8378]] and hast not [[H1077]] withholden [[H4513]] the request [[H782]] of his lips. [[H8193]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thou preventest [[H6923]] him with the blessings [[H1293]] of goodness: [[H2896]] thou settest [[H7896]] a crown [[H5850]] of pure gold [[H6337]] on his head. [[H7218]]

### 4
He asked [[H7592]] life [[H2416]] of [[H4480]] thee, thou gavest [[H5414]] him, length [[H753]] of days [[H3117]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

### 5
His glory [[H3519]] great [[H1419]] in thy salvation: [[H3444]] honour [[H1935]] and majesty [[H1926]] hast thou laid [[H7737]] upon [[H5921]] him. [[H5921]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] thou hast made [[H7896]] him most blessed [[H1293]] for ever: [[H5703]] thou hast made [[H2302]] him exceeding glad [[H8057]] with [[H854]] thy countenance. [[H6440]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] trusteth [[H982]] in the Lord, [[H3068]] and through the mercy [[H2617]] of the most High [[H5945]] he shall not [[H1077]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 8
Thine hand [[H3027]] shall find out [[H4672]] all [[H3605]] thine enemies: [[H341]] thy right hand [[H3225]] shall find out [[H4672]] those that hate [[H8130]] thee. [[H8130]]

### 9
Thou shalt make [[H7896]] them as a fiery [[H784]] oven [[H8574]] in the time [[H6256]] of thine anger: [[H6440]] the Lord [[H3068]] shall swallow them up [[H1104]] in his wrath, [[H639]] and the fire [[H784]] shall devour [[H398]] them. [[H398]]

### 10
Their fruit [[H6529]] shalt thou destroy [[H6]] from the earth, [[H776]] and their seed [[H2233]] from among the children [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] they intended [[H5186]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] thee: they imagined [[H2803]] a mischievous device, [[H4209]] they are not [[H1077]] able [[H3201]]

### 12
Therefore [[H3588]] shalt thou make [[H7896]] them turn their back, [[H7926]] thou shalt make ready [[H3559]] upon thy strings [[H4340]] against [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of them. [[H6440]]

### 13
Be thou exalted, [[H7311]] Lord, [[H3068]] in thine own strength: [[H5797]] will we sing [[H7891]] and praise [[H2167]] thy power. [[H1369]]
