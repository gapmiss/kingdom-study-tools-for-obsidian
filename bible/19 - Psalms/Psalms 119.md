### 1
Blessed [[H835]] the undefiled [[H8549]] in the way, [[H1870]] who walk [[H1980]] in the law [[H8451]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 2
Blessed [[H835]] they that keep [[H5341]] his testimonies, [[H5713]] seek [[H1875]] him with the whole [[H3605]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 3
They also [[H637]] do [[H6466]] no [[H3808]] iniquity: [[H5766]] they walk [[H1980]] in his ways. [[H1870]]

### 4
Thou [[H859]] hast commanded [[H6680]] to keep [[H8104]] thy precepts [[H6490]] diligently. [[H3966]]

### 5
O that [[H305]] my ways [[H1870]] were directed [[H3559]] to keep [[H8104]] thy statutes! [[H2706]]

### 6
Then [[H227]] shall I not [[H3808]] be ashamed, [[H954]] when I have respect [[H5027]] unto [[H413]] all [[H3605]] thy commandments. [[H4687]]

### 7
I will praise [[H3034]] thee with uprightness [[H3476]] of heart, [[H3824]] when I shall have learned [[H3925]] thy righteous [[H6664]] judgments. [[H4941]]

### 8
I will keep [[H8104]] thy statutes: [[H2706]] O forsake [[H5800]] me not [[H408]] utterly. [[H3966]]

### 9
Wherewithal [[H4100]] shall a young man [[H5288]] cleanse [[H2135]] his way? [[H734]] by taking heed [[H8104]] according to thy word. [[H1697]]

### 10
With my whole [[H3605]] heart [[H3820]] have I sought [[H1875]] thee: O let me not [[H408]] wander [[H7686]] from thy commandments. [[H4687]]

### 11
Thy word [[H565]] have I hid [[H6845]] in mine heart, [[H3820]] that [[H4616]] I might not [[H3808]] sin [[H2398]] against thee. [[H2398]]

### 12
Blessed [[H1288]] thou, [[H859]] O Lord: [[H3068]] teach [[H3925]] me thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 13
With my lips [[H8193]] have I declared [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] the judgments [[H4941]] of thy mouth. [[H6310]]

### 14
I have rejoiced [[H7797]] in the way [[H1870]] of thy testimonies, [[H5715]] as in [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] riches. [[H1952]]

### 15
I will meditate [[H7878]] in thy precepts, [[H6490]] and have respect [[H5027]] unto thy ways. [[H734]]

### 16
I will delight myself [[H8173]] in thy statutes: [[H2708]] I will not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] thy word. [[H1697]]

### 17
Deal bountifully [[H1580]] with [[H5921]] thy servant, [[H5650]] I may live, [[H2421]] and keep [[H8104]] thy word. [[H1697]]

### 18
Open [[H1540]] thou mine eyes, [[H5869]] that I may behold [[H5027]] wondrous things [[H6381]] out of thy law. [[H8451]]

### 19
I [[H595]] a stranger [[H1616]] in the earth: [[H776]] hide [[H5641]] not [[H408]] thy commandments [[H4687]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 20
My soul [[H5315]] breaketh [[H1638]] for the longing [[H8375]] unto [[H413]] thy judgments [[H4941]] at all [[H3605]] times. [[H6256]]

### 21
Thou hast rebuked [[H1605]] the proud [[H2086]] cursed, [[H779]] which do err [[H7686]] from thy commandments. [[H4687]]

### 22
Remove [[H1556]] from [[H5921]] me reproach [[H2781]] and contempt; [[H937]] for [[H3588]] I have kept [[H5341]] thy testimonies. [[H5713]]

### 23
Princes [[H8269]] also [[H1571]] did sit [[H3427]] speak [[H1696]] against me: thy servant [[H5650]] did meditate [[H7878]] in thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 24
Thy testimonies [[H5713]] also [[H1571]] my delight [[H8191]] my counsellers. [[H582]]

### 25
My soul [[H5315]] cleaveth [[H1692]] unto the dust: [[H6083]] quicken [[H2421]] thou me according to thy word. [[H1697]]

### 26
I have declared [[H5608]] my ways, [[H1870]] and thou heardest [[H6030]] me: teach [[H3925]] me thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 27
Make me to understand [[H995]] the way [[H1870]] of thy precepts: [[H6490]] so shall I talk [[H7878]] of thy wondrous works. [[H6381]]

### 28
My soul [[H5315]] melteth [[H1811]] for heaviness: [[H8424]] strengthen [[H6965]] thou me according unto thy word. [[H1697]]

### 29
Remove [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] me the way [[H1870]] of lying: [[H8267]] and grant me thy law [[H8451]] graciously. [[H2603]]

### 30
I have chosen [[H977]] the way [[H1870]] of truth: [[H530]] thy judgments [[H4941]] have I laid [[H7737]]

### 31
I have stuck [[H1692]] unto thy testimonies: [[H5715]] O Lord, [[H3068]] put me not [[H408]] to shame. [[H954]]

### 32
I will run [[H7323]] the way [[H1870]] of thy commandments, [[H4687]] when [[H3588]] thou shalt enlarge [[H7337]] my heart. [[H3820]]

### 33
Teach [[H3384]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] the way [[H1870]] of thy statutes; [[H2706]] and I shall keep [[H5341]] it the end. [[H6118]]

### 34
Give me understanding, [[H995]] and I shall keep [[H5341]] thy law; [[H8451]] yea, I shall observe [[H8104]] it with whole [[H3605]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 35
Make me to go [[H1869]] in the path [[H5410]] of thy commandments; [[H4687]] for [[H3588]] therein do I delight. [[H2654]]

### 36
Incline [[H5186]] my heart [[H3820]] unto [[H413]] thy testimonies, [[H5715]] and not [[H408]] to [[H413]] covetousness. [[H1215]]

### 37
Turn away [[H5674]] mine eyes [[H5869]] from beholding [[H7200]] vanity; [[H7723]] quicken [[H2421]] thou me in thy way. [[H1870]]

### 38
Stablish [[H6965]] thy word [[H565]] unto thy servant, [[H5650]] who [[H834]] to thy fear. [[H3374]]

### 39
Turn away [[H5674]] my reproach [[H2781]] which [[H834]] I fear: [[H3025]] for [[H3588]] thy judgments [[H4941]] good. [[H2896]]

### 40
Behold, [[H2009]] I have longed [[H8373]] after thy precepts: [[H6490]] quicken [[H2421]] me in thy righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 41
Let thy mercies [[H2617]] come [[H935]] also unto me, O Lord, [[H3068]] thy salvation, [[H8668]] according to thy word. [[H565]]

### 42
So shall I have wherewith [[H1697]] to answer [[H6030]] him that reproacheth [[H2778]] me: for [[H3588]] I trust [[H982]] in thy word. [[H1697]]

### 43
And take [[H5337]] not [[H408]] the word [[H1697]] of truth [[H571]] utterly [[H3966]] out of my mouth; [[H6310]] for [[H3588]] I have hoped [[H3176]] in thy judgments. [[H4941]]

### 44
So shall I keep [[H8104]] thy law [[H8451]] continually [[H8548]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

### 45
And I will walk [[H1980]] at liberty: [[H7342]] for [[H3588]] I seek [[H1875]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 46
I will speak [[H1696]] of thy testimonies [[H5713]] also before [[H5048]] kings, [[H4428]] and will not [[H3808]] be ashamed. [[H954]]

### 47
And I will delight myself [[H8173]] in thy commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I have loved. [[H157]]

### 48
My hands [[H3709]] also will I lift up [[H5375]] unto [[H413]] thy commandments, [[H4687]] which [[H834]] I have loved; [[H157]] and I will meditate [[H7878]] in thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 49
Remember [[H2142]] the word [[H1697]] unto thy servant, [[H5650]] upon [[H5921]] which [[H834]] thou hast caused me to hope. [[H3176]]

### 50
This [[H2063]] my comfort [[H5165]] in my affliction: [[H6040]] for [[H3588]] thy word [[H565]] hath quickened [[H2421]] me. [[H2421]]

### 51
The proud [[H2086]] have had me greatly [[H3966]] in derision: [[H3887]] have I not [[H3808]] declined [[H5186]] from thy law. [[H8451]]

### 52
I remembered [[H2142]] thy judgments [[H4941]] of old, [[H5769]] O Lord; [[H3068]] and have comforted [[H5162]] myself. [[H5162]]

### 53
Horror [[H2152]] hath taken hold upon [[H270]] me because of the wicked [[H7563]] that forsake [[H5800]] thy law. [[H8451]]

### 54
Thy statutes [[H2706]] have been [[H1961]] my songs [[H2158]] in the house [[H1004]] of my pilgrimage. [[H4033]]

### 55
I have remembered [[H2142]] thy name, [[H8034]] O Lord, [[H3068]] in the night, [[H3915]] and have kept [[H8104]] thy law. [[H8451]]

### 56
This [[H2063]] I had, [[H1961]] because [[H3588]] I kept [[H5341]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 57
my portion, [[H2506]] O Lord: [[H3068]] I have said [[H559]] that I would keep [[H8104]] thy words. [[H1697]]

### 58
I intreated [[H2470]] thy favour [[H6440]] with whole [[H3605]] heart: [[H3820]] be merciful [[H2603]] unto me according to thy word. [[H565]]

### 59
I thought [[H2803]] on my ways, [[H1870]] and turned [[H7725]] my feet [[H7272]] unto [[H413]] thy testimonies. [[H5713]]

### 60
I made haste, [[H2363]] and delayed [[H4102]] not [[H3808]] to keep [[H8104]] thy commandments. [[H4687]]

### 61
The bands [[H2256]] of the wicked [[H7563]] have robbed [[H5749]] me: I have not [[H3808]] forgotten [[H7911]] thy law. [[H8451]]

### 62
At midnight [[H2676]] I will rise [[H6965]] to give thanks [[H3034]] unto thee because of [[H5921]] thy righteous [[H6664]] judgments. [[H4941]]

### 63
I [[H589]] a companion [[H2270]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] fear [[H3372]] thee, and of them that keep [[H8104]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 64
The earth, [[H776]] O Lord, [[H3068]] is full [[H4390]] of thy mercy: [[H2617]] teach [[H3925]] me thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 65
Thou hast dealt [[H6213]] well [[H2896]] with [[H5973]] thy servant, [[H5650]] O Lord, [[H3068]] according unto thy word. [[H1697]]

### 66
Teach [[H3925]] me good [[H2898]] judgment [[H2940]] and knowledge: [[H1847]] for [[H3588]] I have believed [[H539]] thy commandments. [[H4687]]

### 67
Before [[H2962]] I [[H589]] was afflicted [[H6031]] I went astray: [[H7683]] but now [[H6258]] have I kept [[H8104]] thy word. [[H565]]

### 68
Thou [[H859]] good, [[H2896]] and doest good; [[H2895]] teach [[H3925]] me thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 69
The proud [[H2086]] have forged [[H2950]] a lie [[H8267]] against [[H5921]] me: I [[H589]] will keep [[H5341]] thy precepts [[H6490]] with whole [[H3605]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 70
Their heart [[H3820]] is as fat [[H2954]] as grease; [[H2459]] I [[H589]] delight [[H8173]] in thy law. [[H8451]]

### 71
good [[H2896]] for me that [[H3588]] I have been afflicted; [[H6031]] that [[H4616]] I might learn [[H3925]] thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 72
The law [[H8451]] of thy mouth [[H6310]] better [[H2896]] unto me than thousands [[H505]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver. [[H3701]]

### 73
Thy hands [[H3027]] have made [[H6213]] me and fashioned [[H3559]] me: give me understanding, [[H995]] that I may learn [[H3925]] thy commandments. [[H4687]]

### 74
They that fear [[H3373]] thee will be glad [[H8055]] when they see [[H7200]] me; because [[H3588]] I have hoped [[H3176]] in thy word. [[H1697]]

### 75
I know, [[H3045]] O Lord, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] thy judgments [[H4941]] right, [[H6664]] and thou in faithfulness [[H530]] hast afflicted [[H6031]] me. [[H6031]]

### 76
Let, I pray thee, [[H4994]] thy merciful kindness [[H2617]] be [[H1961]] for my comfort, [[H5162]] according to thy word [[H565]] unto thy servant. [[H5650]]

### 77
Let thy tender mercies [[H7356]] come [[H935]] unto me, that I may live: [[H2421]] for [[H3588]] thy law [[H8451]] my delight. [[H8191]]

### 78
Let the proud [[H2086]] be ashamed; [[H954]] for [[H3588]] they dealt perversely [[H5791]] with me without a cause: [[H8267]] I [[H589]] will meditate [[H7878]] in thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 79
Let those that fear [[H3373]] thee turn [[H7725]] unto me, and those that have known [[H3045]] thy testimonies. [[H5713]]

### 80
Let my heart [[H3820]] be [[H1961]] sound [[H8549]] in thy statutes; [[H2706]] that [[H4616]] I be not [[H3808]] ashamed. [[H954]]

### 81
My soul [[H5315]] fainteth [[H3615]] for thy salvation: [[H8668]] I hope [[H3176]] in thy word. [[H1697]]

### 82
Mine eyes [[H5869]] fail [[H3615]] for thy word, [[H565]] saying, [[H559]] When [[H4970]] wilt thou comfort [[H5162]] me? [[H5162]]

### 83
For [[H3588]] I am become [[H1961]] like a bottle [[H4997]] in the smoke; [[H7008]] do I not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 84
How many [[H4100]] the days [[H3117]] of thy servant? [[H5650]] when [[H4970]] wilt thou execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] on them that persecute [[H7291]] me? [[H7291]]

### 85
The proud [[H2086]] have digged [[H3738]] pits [[H7882]] for me, which [[H834]] not [[H3808]] after thy law. [[H8451]]

### 86
All [[H3605]] thy commandments [[H4687]] faithful: [[H530]] they persecute [[H7291]] me wrongfully; [[H8267]] help [[H5826]] thou me. [[H5826]]

### 87
They had almost [[H4592]] consumed [[H3615]] me upon earth; [[H776]] but I [[H589]] forsook [[H5800]] not [[H3808]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 88
Quicken [[H2421]] me after thy lovingkindness; [[H2617]] so shall I keep [[H8104]] the testimony [[H5715]] of thy mouth. [[H6310]]

### 89
For ever, [[H5769]] O Lord, [[H3068]] thy word [[H1697]] is settled [[H5324]] in heaven. [[H8064]]

### 90
Thy faithfulness [[H530]] unto all [[H1755]] generations: [[H1755]] thou hast established [[H3559]] the earth, [[H776]] and it abideth. [[H5975]]

### 91
They continue [[H5975]] this day [[H3117]] according to thine ordinances: [[H4941]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] thy servants. [[H5650]]

### 92
Unless [[H3884]] thy law [[H8451]] my delights, [[H8191]] I should then [[H227]] have perished [[H6]] in mine affliction. [[H6040]]

### 93
I will never [[H5769]] forget [[H7911]] thy precepts: [[H6490]] for [[H3588]] with them thou hast quickened [[H2421]] me. [[H2421]]

### 94
I [[H589]] thine, save [[H3467]] me; for [[H3588]] I have sought [[H1875]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 95
The wicked [[H7563]] have waited [[H6960]] for me to destroy [[H6]] me: I will consider [[H995]] thy testimonies. [[H5713]]

### 96
I have seen [[H7200]] an end [[H7093]] of all [[H3605]] perfection: [[H8502]] thy commandment [[H4687]] exceeding [[H3966]] broad. [[H7342]]

### 97
O how [[H4100]] love I [[H157]] thy law! [[H8451]] it [[H1931]] my meditation [[H7881]] all [[H3605]] the day. [[H3117]]

### 98
Thou through thy commandments [[H4687]] hast made me wiser [[H2449]] than mine enemies: [[H341]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] ever [[H5769]] with me. [[H5769]]

### 99
I have more understanding [[H7919]] than all [[H3605]] my teachers: [[H3925]] for [[H3588]] thy testimonies [[H5715]] my meditation. [[H7881]]

### 100
I understand [[H995]] more than the ancients, [[H2205]] because [[H3588]] I keep [[H5341]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 101
I have refrained [[H3607]] my feet [[H7272]] from every [[H3605]] evil [[H7451]] way, [[H734]] that [[H4616]] I might keep [[H8104]] thy word. [[H1697]]

### 102
I have not [[H3808]] departed [[H5493]] from thy judgments: [[H4941]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] hast taught [[H3384]] me. [[H3384]]

### 103
How [[H4100]] sweet are [[H4452]] thy words [[H565]] unto my taste! [[H2441]] than honey [[H1706]] to my mouth! [[H6310]]

### 104
Through thy precepts [[H6490]] I get understanding: [[H995]] therefore [[H5921]] I hate [[H8130]] every [[H3605]] false [[H8267]] way. [[H734]]

### 105
Thy word [[H1697]] a lamp [[H5216]] unto my feet, [[H7272]] and a light [[H216]] unto my path. [[H5410]]

### 106
I have sworn, [[H7650]] and I will perform [[H6965]] that I will keep [[H8104]] thy righteous [[H6664]] judgments. [[H4941]]

### 107
I am afflicted [[H6031]] very much: [[H3966]] quicken [[H2421]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] according unto thy word. [[H1697]]

### 108
Accept, [[H7521]] I beseech thee, [[H4994]] the freewill offerings [[H5071]] of my mouth, [[H6310]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and teach [[H3925]] me thy judgments. [[H4941]]

### 109
My soul [[H5315]] continually [[H8548]] in my hand: [[H3709]] yet do I not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] thy law. [[H8451]]

### 110
The wicked [[H7563]] have laid [[H5414]] a snare [[H6341]] for me: yet I erred [[H8582]] not [[H3808]] from thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 111
Thy testimonies [[H5715]] have I taken as an heritage [[H5157]] for ever: [[H5769]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] the rejoicing [[H8342]] of my heart. [[H3820]]

### 112
I have inclined [[H5186]] mine heart [[H3820]] to perform [[H6213]] thy statutes [[H2706]] alway, [[H5769]] the end. [[H6118]]

### 113
I hate [[H8130]] thoughts: [[H5588]] but thy law [[H8451]] do I love. [[H157]]

### 114
Thou [[H859]] my hiding place [[H5643]] and my shield: [[H4043]] I hope [[H3176]] in thy word. [[H1697]]

### 115
Depart [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] me, ye evildoers: [[H7489]] for I will keep [[H5341]] the commandments [[H4687]] of my God. [[H430]]

### 116
Uphold [[H5564]] me according unto thy word, [[H565]] that I may live: [[H2421]] and let me not [[H408]] be ashamed [[H954]] of my hope. [[H7664]]

### 117
Hold thou me up, [[H5582]] and I shall be safe: [[H3467]] and I will have respect [[H8159]] unto thy statutes [[H2706]] continually. [[H8548]]

### 118
Thou hast trodden down [[H5541]] all [[H3605]] them that err [[H7686]] from thy statutes: [[H2706]] for [[H3588]] their deceit [[H8649]] falsehood. [[H8267]]

### 119
Thou puttest away [[H7673]] all [[H3605]] the wicked [[H7563]] of the earth [[H776]] dross: [[H5509]] therefore [[H3651]] I love [[H157]] thy testimonies. [[H5713]]

### 120
My flesh [[H1320]] trembleth [[H5568]] for fear [[H6343]] of thee; and I am afraid [[H3372]] of thy judgments. [[H4941]]

### 121
I have done [[H6213]] judgment [[H4941]] and justice: [[H6664]] leave [[H3240]] me not [[H1077]] to mine oppressors. [[H6231]]

### 122
Be surety [[H6148]] for thy servant [[H5650]] for good: [[H2896]] let not [[H408]] the proud [[H2086]] oppress [[H6231]] me. [[H6231]]

### 123
Mine eyes [[H5869]] fail [[H3615]] for thy salvation, [[H3444]] and for the word [[H565]] of thy righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 124
Deal [[H6213]] with [[H5973]] thy servant [[H5650]] according unto thy mercy, [[H2617]] and teach [[H3925]] me thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 125
I [[H589]] thy servant; [[H5650]] give me understanding, [[H995]] that I may know [[H3045]] thy testimonies. [[H5713]]

### 126
time [[H6256]] for Lord, [[H3068]] to work: [[H6213]] they have made void [[H6565]] thy law. [[H8451]]

### 127
Therefore [[H5921]] I love [[H157]] thy commandments [[H4687]] above gold; [[H2091]] yea, above fine gold. [[H6337]]

### 128
Therefore [[H5921]] I esteem all [[H3605]] precepts [[H6490]] all [[H3605]] right; [[H3474]] I hate [[H8130]] every [[H3605]] false [[H8267]] way. [[H734]]

### 129
Thy testimonies [[H5715]] wonderful: [[H6382]] therefore [[H5921]] doth my soul [[H5315]] keep [[H5341]] them. [[H5341]]

### 130
The entrance [[H6608]] of thy words [[H1697]] giveth light; [[H215]] it giveth understanding [[H995]] unto the simple. [[H6612]]

### 131
I opened [[H6473]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and panted: [[H7602]] for [[H3588]] I longed [[H2968]] for thy commandments. [[H4687]]

### 132
Look [[H6437]] thou upon [[H413]] me, and be merciful [[H2603]] unto me, as thou usest [[H4941]] to do unto those that love [[H157]] thy name. [[H8034]]

### 133
Order [[H3559]] my steps [[H6471]] in thy word: [[H565]] and let not [[H408]] any [[H3605]] iniquity [[H205]] have dominion [[H7980]] over me. [[H7980]]

### 134
Deliver [[H6299]] me from the oppression [[H6233]] of man: [[H120]] so will I keep [[H8104]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 135
Make thy face [[H6440]] to shine [[H215]] upon thy servant; [[H5650]] and teach [[H3925]]  me [[H853]] thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 136
Rivers [[H6388]] of waters [[H4325]] run down [[H3381]] mine eyes, [[H5869]] because [[H5921]] they keep [[H8104]] not [[H3808]] thy law. [[H8451]]

### 137
Righteous [[H6662]] thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] and upright [[H3477]] thy judgments. [[H4941]]

### 138
Thy testimonies [[H5713]] thou hast commanded [[H6680]] righteous [[H6664]] and very [[H3966]] faithful. [[H530]]

### 139
My zeal [[H7068]] hath consumed [[H6789]] me, because [[H3588]] mine enemies [[H6862]] have forgotten [[H7911]] thy words. [[H1697]]

### 140
Thy word [[H565]] very [[H3966]] pure: [[H6884]] therefore thy servant [[H5650]] loveth [[H157]] it. [[H157]]

### 141
I [[H595]] small [[H6810]] and despised: [[H959]] do not [[H3808]] I forget [[H7911]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 142
Thy righteousness [[H6666]] an everlasting [[H5769]] righteousness, [[H6664]] and thy law [[H8451]] the truth. [[H571]]

### 143
Trouble [[H6862]] and anguish [[H4689]] have taken hold on [[H4672]] me: thy commandments [[H4687]] my delights. [[H8191]]

### 144
The righteousness [[H6664]] of thy testimonies [[H5715]] everlasting: [[H5769]] give me understanding, [[H995]] and I shall live. [[H2421]]

### 145
I cried [[H7121]] with whole [[H3605]] heart; [[H3820]] hear [[H6030]] me, O Lord: [[H3068]] I will keep [[H5341]] thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 146
I cried [[H7121]] unto thee; save [[H3467]] me, and I shall keep [[H8104]] thy testimonies. [[H5713]]

### 147
I prevented [[H6923]] the dawning [[H5399]] of the morning, and cried: [[H7768]] I hoped [[H3176]] in thy word. [[H1697]]

### 148
Mine eyes [[H5869]] prevent [[H6923]] the watches, [[H821]] that I might meditate [[H7878]] in thy word. [[H565]]

### 149
Hear [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] according unto thy lovingkindness: [[H2617]] O Lord, [[H3068]] quicken [[H2421]] me according to thy judgment. [[H4941]]

### 150
They draw nigh [[H7126]] that follow after [[H7291]] mischief: [[H2154]] they are far [[H7368]] from thy law. [[H8451]]

### 151
Thou [[H859]] near, [[H7138]] O Lord; [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] thy commandments [[H4687]] truth. [[H571]]

### 152
Concerning thy testimonies, [[H5713]] I have known [[H3045]] of old [[H6924]] that [[H3588]] thou hast founded [[H3245]] them for ever. [[H5769]]

### 153
Consider [[H7200]] mine affliction, [[H6040]] and deliver [[H2502]] me: for [[H3588]] I do not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] thy law. [[H8451]]

### 154
Plead [[H7378]] my cause, [[H7379]] and deliver [[H1350]] me: quicken [[H2421]] me according to thy word. [[H565]]

### 155
Salvation [[H3444]] far [[H7350]] from the wicked: [[H7563]] for [[H3588]] they seek [[H1875]] not [[H3808]] thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 156
Great [[H7227]] thy tender mercies, [[H7356]] O Lord: [[H3068]] quicken [[H2421]] me according to thy judgments. [[H4941]]

### 157
Many [[H7227]] my persecutors [[H7291]] and mine enemies; [[H6862]] do I not [[H3808]] decline [[H5186]] from thy testimonies. [[H5715]]

### 158
I beheld [[H7200]] the transgressors, [[H898]] and was grieved; [[H6962]] because [[H834]] they kept [[H8104]] not [[H3808]] thy word. [[H565]]

### 159
Consider [[H7200]] how [[H3588]] I love [[H157]] thy precepts: [[H6490]] quicken [[H2421]] me, O Lord, [[H3068]] according to thy lovingkindness. [[H2617]]

### 160
Thy word [[H1697]] true [[H571]] the beginning: [[H7218]] and every one [[H3605]] of thy righteous [[H6664]] judgments [[H4941]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 161
Princes [[H8269]] have persecuted [[H7291]] me without a cause: [[H2600]] but my heart [[H3820]] standeth in awe [[H6342]] of thy word. [[H1697]]

### 162
I [[H595]] rejoice [[H7797]] at [[H5921]] thy word, [[H565]] as one that findeth [[H4672]] great [[H7227]] spoil. [[H7998]]

### 163
I hate [[H8130]] and abhor [[H8581]] lying: [[H8267]] thy law [[H8451]] do I love. [[H157]]

### 164
Seven times [[H7651]] a day [[H3117]] do I praise [[H1984]] thee because of [[H5921]] thy righteous [[H6664]] judgments. [[H4941]]

### 165
Great [[H7227]] peace [[H7965]] have they which love [[H157]] thy law: [[H8451]] and nothing [[H369]] shall offend [[H4383]] them. [[H4383]]

### 166
Lord, [[H3068]] I have hoped [[H7663]] for thy salvation, [[H3444]] and done [[H6213]] thy commandments. [[H4687]]

### 167
My soul [[H5315]] hath kept [[H8104]] thy testimonies; [[H5713]] and I love [[H157]] them exceedingly. [[H3966]]

### 168
I have kept [[H8104]] thy precepts [[H6490]] and thy testimonies: [[H5713]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] my ways [[H1870]] before [[H5048]] thee. [[H5048]]

### 169
Let my cry [[H7440]] come near [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] thee, O Lord: [[H3068]] give me understanding [[H995]] according to thy word. [[H1697]]

### 170
Let my supplication [[H8467]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] thee: deliver [[H5337]] me according to thy word. [[H565]]

### 171
My lips [[H8193]] shall utter [[H5042]] praise, [[H8416]] when [[H3588]] thou hast taught [[H3925]] me thy statutes. [[H2706]]

### 172
My tongue [[H3956]] shall speak [[H6030]] of thy word: [[H565]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] thy commandments [[H4687]] righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 173
Let [[H1961]] thine hand [[H3027]] help [[H5826]] me; for [[H3588]] I have chosen [[H977]] thy precepts. [[H6490]]

### 174
I have longed [[H8373]] for thy salvation, [[H3444]] O Lord; [[H3068]] and thy law [[H8451]] my delight. [[H8191]]

### 175
Let my soul [[H5315]] live, [[H2421]] and it shall praise [[H1984]] thee; and let thy judgments [[H4941]] help [[H5826]] me. [[H5826]]

### 176
I have gone astray [[H8582]] like a lost [[H6]] sheep; [[H7716]] seek [[H1245]] thy servant; [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I do not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] thy commandments. [[H4687]]
