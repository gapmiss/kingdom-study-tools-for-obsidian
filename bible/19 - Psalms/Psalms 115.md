### 1
Not [[H3808]] unto us, O Lord, [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] unto us, but [[H3588]] unto thy name [[H8034]] give [[H5414]] glory, [[H3519]] for [[H5921]] thy mercy, [[H2617]] for [[H5921]] thy truth's [[H571]] sake. [[H571]]

### 2
Wherefore [[H4100]] should the heathen [[H1471]] say, [[H559]] Where [[H346]] now [[H4994]] their God? [[H430]]

### 3
But our God [[H430]] in the heavens: [[H8064]] he hath done [[H6213]] whatsoever [[H3605]] he hath pleased. [[H2654]]

### 4
Their idols [[H6091]] silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] the work [[H4639]] of men's [[H120]] hands. [[H3027]]

### 5
They have mouths, [[H6310]] but they speak [[H1696]] not: [[H3808]] eyes [[H5869]] have they, but they see [[H7200]] not: [[H7200]]

### 6
They have ears, [[H241]] but they hear [[H8085]] not: [[H3808]] noses [[H639]] have they, but they smell [[H7306]] not: [[H7306]]

### 7
They have hands, [[H3027]] but they handle [[H4184]] not: [[H3808]] feet [[H7272]] have they, but they walk [[H1980]] not: [[H3808]] neither [[H3808]] speak [[H1897]] they through their throat. [[H1627]]

### 8
They that make [[H6213]] them are [[H1961]] like unto them; [[H3644]] every one [[H3605]] that [[H834]] trusteth [[H982]] in them. [[H982]]

### 9
O Israel, [[H3478]] trust [[H982]] thou in the Lord: [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] their help [[H5828]] and their shield. [[H4043]]

### 10
O house [[H1004]] of Aaron, [[H175]] trust [[H982]] in the Lord: [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] their help [[H5828]] and their shield. [[H4043]]

### 11
Ye that fear [[H3373]] the Lord, [[H3068]] trust [[H982]] in the Lord: [[H3068]] he [[H1931]] their help [[H5828]] and their shield. [[H4043]]

### 12
The Lord [[H3068]] hath been mindful [[H2142]] of us: he will bless [[H1288]] he will bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] he will bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Aaron. [[H175]]

### 13
He will bless [[H1288]] them that fear [[H3373]] the Lord, [[H3068]] small [[H6996]] and [[H5973]] great. [[H1419]]

### 14
The Lord [[H3068]] shall increase [[H3254]] you more [[H5921]] and more, [[H5921]]  you [[H5921]] and your children. [[H1121]]

### 15
Ye [[H859]] blessed [[H1288]] of the Lord [[H3068]] which made [[H6213]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]]

### 16
The heaven, [[H8064]] the heavens, [[H8064]] the Lord's: [[H3068]] but the earth [[H776]] hath he given [[H5414]] to the children [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 17
The dead [[H4191]] praise [[H1984]] not [[H3808]] the Lord, [[H3050]] neither [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] that go down [[H3381]] into silence. [[H1745]]

### 18
But we [[H587]] will bless [[H1288]] the Lord [[H3050]] from this time forth [[H6258]] and for [[H5704]] evermore. [[H5769]] Praise [[H1984]] the Lord. [[H3050]]
