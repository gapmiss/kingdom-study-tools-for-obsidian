To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Gittith, [[H1665]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
O Lord [[H3068]] our Lord, [[H113]] how [[H4100]] excellent [[H117]] thy name [[H8034]] in all [[H3605]] the earth! [[H776]] who [[H834]] hast set [[H5414]] thy glory [[H1935]] above [[H5921]] the heavens. [[H8064]]

### 2
Out of the mouth [[H6310]] of babes [[H5768]] and sucklings [[H3243]] hast thou ordained [[H3245]] strength [[H5797]] because of [[H4616]] thine enemies, [[H6887]] that thou mightest still [[H7673]] the enemy [[H341]] and the avenger. [[H5358]]

### 3
When [[H3588]] I consider [[H7200]] thy heavens, [[H8064]] the work [[H4639]] of thy fingers, [[H676]] the moon [[H3394]] and the stars, [[H3556]] which [[H834]] thou hast ordained; [[H3559]]

### 4
What [[H4100]] is man, [[H582]] that [[H3588]] thou art mindful [[H2142]] of him? and the son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] that [[H3588]] thou visitest [[H6485]] him? [[H6485]]

### 5
For thou hast made him a little [[H4592]] lower [[H2637]] than the angels, [[H430]] and hast crowned [[H5849]] him with glory [[H3519]] and honour. [[H1926]]

### 6
Thou madest him to have dominion [[H4910]] over the works [[H4639]] of thy hands; [[H3027]] thou hast put [[H7896]] all [[H3605]] under [[H8478]] his feet: [[H7272]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] sheep [[H6792]] and oxen, [[H504]] yea, [[H1571]] and the beasts [[H929]] of the field; [[H7704]]

### 8
The fowl [[H6833]] of the air, [[H8064]] and the fish [[H1709]] of the sea, [[H3220]] passeth through [[H5674]] the paths [[H734]] of the seas. [[H3220]]

### 9
O Lord [[H3068]] our Lord, [[H113]] how [[H4100]] excellent [[H117]] thy name [[H8034]] in all [[H3605]] the earth! [[H776]]
