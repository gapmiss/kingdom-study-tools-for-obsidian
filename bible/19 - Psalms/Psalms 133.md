A Song [[H7892]] of degrees [[H4609]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Behold, [[H2009]] how [[H4100]] good [[H2896]] and how [[H4100]] pleasant [[H5273]] for brethren [[H251]] to dwell [[H3427]] together in unity! [[H3162]]

### 2
like the precious [[H2896]] ointment [[H8081]] upon [[H5921]] the head, [[H7218]] that ran down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] the beard, [[H2206]] Aaron's [[H175]] beard: [[H2206]] that went down [[H3381]] to [[H5921]] the skirts [[H6310]] of his garments; [[H4060]]

### 3
As the dew [[H2919]] of Hermon, [[H2768]] that descended [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2042]] of Zion: [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the Lord [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] the blessing, [[H1293]] life [[H2416]] for evermore. [[H5769]]
