### 1
The Lord [[H3068]] reigneth, [[H4427]] he is clothed [[H3847]] with majesty; [[H1348]] the Lord [[H3068]] is clothed [[H3847]] with strength, [[H5797]] he hath girded himself: [[H247]] the world [[H8398]] also [[H637]] is stablished, [[H3559]] that it cannot [[H1077]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 2
Thy throne [[H3678]] established [[H3559]] of old: [[H227]] thou [[H859]] from everlasting. [[H5769]]

### 3
The floods [[H5104]] have lifted up, [[H5375]] O Lord, [[H3068]] the floods [[H5104]] have lifted up [[H5375]] their voice; [[H6963]] the floods [[H5104]] lift up [[H5375]] their waves. [[H1796]]

### 4
The Lord [[H3068]] on high [[H4791]] mightier [[H117]] than the noise [[H6963]] of many [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] the mighty [[H117]] waves [[H4867]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 5
Thy testimonies [[H5713]] are very [[H3966]] sure: [[H539]] holiness [[H6944]] becometh [[H4998]] thine house, [[H1004]] O Lord, [[H3068]] for ever. [[H753]]
