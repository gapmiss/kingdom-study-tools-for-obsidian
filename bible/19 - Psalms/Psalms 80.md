To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H413]] Shoshannim-Eduth, [[H7802]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
Give ear, [[H238]] O Shepherd [[H7462]] of Israel, [[H3478]] thou that leadest [[H5090]] Joseph [[H3130]] like a flock; [[H6629]] thou that dwellest [[H3427]] the cherubims, [[H3742]] shine forth. [[H3313]]

### 2
Before [[H6440]] Ephraim [[H669]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] stir up [[H5782]] thy strength, [[H1369]] and come [[H1980]] save [[H3444]] us. [[H3444]]

### 3
Turn us again, [[H7725]] O God, [[H430]] and cause thy face [[H6440]] to shine; [[H215]] and we shall be saved. [[H3467]]

### 4
O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] how long [[H5704]] wilt thou be angry [[H6225]] against the prayer [[H8605]] of thy people? [[H5971]]

### 5
Thou feedest [[H398]] them with the bread [[H3899]] of tears; [[H1832]] and givest them tears [[H1832]] to drink [[H8248]] in great measure. [[H7991]]

### 6
Thou makest [[H7760]] us a strife [[H4066]] unto our neighbours: [[H7934]] and our enemies [[H341]] laugh [[H3932]] among themselves. [[H3932]]

### 7
Turn us again, [[H7725]] O God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] and cause thy face [[H6440]] to shine; [[H215]] and we shall be saved. [[H3467]]

### 8
Thou hast brought [[H5265]] a vine [[H1612]] out of Egypt: [[H4714]] thou hast cast out [[H1644]] the heathen, [[H1471]] and planted [[H5193]] it. [[H5193]]

### 9
Thou preparedst [[H6437]] before [[H6440]] it, and didst cause it to take deep [[H8328]] root, [[H8327]] and it filled [[H4390]] the land. [[H776]]

### 10
The hills [[H2022]] were covered [[H3680]] with the shadow [[H6738]] of it, and the boughs [[H6057]] thereof the goodly [[H410]] cedars. [[H730]]

### 11
She sent out [[H7971]] her boughs [[H7105]] unto [[H5704]] the sea, [[H3220]] and her branches [[H3127]] unto [[H413]] the river. [[H5104]]

### 12
Why [[H4100]] hast thou broken down [[H6555]] her hedges, [[H1447]] so that all [[H3605]] they which pass by [[H5674]] the way [[H1870]] do pluck [[H717]] her? [[H717]]

### 13
The boar [[H2386]] out of the wood [[H3293]] doth waste [[H3765]] it, and the wild beast [[H2123]] of the field [[H7704]] doth devour [[H7462]] it. [[H7462]]

### 14
Return, [[H7725]] we beseech [[H4994]] thee, O God [[H430]] of hosts: [[H6635]] look down [[H5027]] from heaven, [[H8064]] and behold, [[H7200]] and visit [[H6485]] this [[H2063]] vine; [[H1612]]

### 15
And the vineyard [[H3657]] which [[H834]] thy right hand [[H3225]] hath planted, [[H5193]] and the branch [[H1121]] thou madest strong [[H553]] for thyself. [[H553]]

### 16
burned [[H8313]] with fire, [[H784]] cut down: [[H3683]] they perish [[H6]] at the rebuke [[H1606]] of thy countenance. [[H6440]]

### 17
Let thy hand [[H3027]] be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the man [[H376]] of thy right hand, [[H3225]] upon [[H5921]] the son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] thou madest strong [[H553]] for thyself. [[H553]]

### 18
So will not [[H3808]] we go back [[H5472]] from [[H4480]] thee: quicken [[H2421]] us, and we will call [[H7121]] upon thy name. [[H8034]]

### 19
Turn us again, [[H7725]] O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] cause thy face [[H6440]] to shine; [[H215]] and we shall be saved. [[H3467]]
