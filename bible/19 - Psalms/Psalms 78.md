Maschil [[H4905]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
Give ear, [[H238]] O my people, [[H5971]] my law: [[H8451]] incline [[H5186]] your ears [[H241]] to the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 2
I will open [[H6605]] my mouth [[H6310]] in a parable: [[H4912]] I will utter [[H5042]] dark sayings [[H2420]] of [[H4480]] old: [[H6924]]

### 3
Which [[H834]] we have heard [[H8085]] and known, [[H3045]] and our fathers [[H1]] have told [[H5608]] us. [[H5608]]

### 4
We will not [[H3808]] hide [[H3582]] from their children, [[H1121]] shewing [[H5608]] to the generation [[H1755]] to come [[H314]] the praises [[H8416]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and his strength, [[H5807]] and his wonderful works [[H6381]] that [[H834]] he hath done. [[H6213]]

### 5
For he established [[H6965]] a testimony [[H5715]] in Jacob, [[H3290]] and appointed [[H7760]] a law [[H8451]] in Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] he commanded [[H6680]] our fathers, [[H1]] that they should make them known [[H3045]] to their children: [[H1121]]

### 6
That [[H4616]] the generation [[H1755]] to come [[H314]] might know [[H3045]] the children [[H1121]] should be born; [[H3205]] should arise [[H6965]] and declare [[H5608]] to their children: [[H1121]]

### 7
That they might set [[H7760]] their hope [[H3689]] in God, [[H430]] and not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] the works [[H4611]] of God, [[H410]] but keep [[H5341]] his commandments: [[H4687]]

### 8
And might not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] as their fathers, [[H1]] a stubborn [[H5637]] and rebellious [[H4784]] generation; [[H1755]] a generation [[H1755]] set [[H3559]] not their heart [[H3820]]  aright, [[H3808]] and whose spirit [[H7307]] was not [[H3808]] stedfast [[H539]] with [[H854]] God. [[H410]]

### 9
The children [[H1121]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] armed, [[H5401]] carrying [[H7411]] bows, [[H7198]] turned back [[H2015]] in the day [[H3117]] of battle. [[H7128]]

### 10
They kept [[H8104]] not [[H3808]] the covenant [[H1285]] of God, [[H430]] and refused [[H3985]] to walk [[H1980]] in his law; [[H8451]]

### 11
And forgat [[H7911]] his works, [[H5949]] and his wonders [[H6381]] that [[H834]] he had shewed [[H7200]] them. [[H7200]]

### 12
Marvellous things [[H6382]] did [[H6213]] he in the sight [[H5048]] of their fathers, [[H1]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the field [[H7704]] of Zoan. [[H6814]]

### 13
He divided [[H1234]] the sea, [[H3220]] and caused them to pass through; [[H5674]] and he made the waters [[H4325]] to stand [[H5324]] as [[H3644]] an heap. [[H5067]]

### 14
In the daytime [[H3119]] also he led [[H5148]] them with a cloud, [[H6051]] and all [[H3605]] the night [[H3915]] with a light [[H216]] of fire. [[H784]]

### 15
He clave [[H1234]] the rocks [[H6697]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and gave drink [[H8248]] as the great [[H7227]] depths. [[H8415]]

### 16
He brought [[H3318]] streams [[H5140]] also out of the rock, [[H5553]] and caused waters [[H4325]] to run down [[H3381]] like rivers. [[H5104]]

### 17
And they sinned [[H2398]] yet [[H5750]] more [[H3254]] against him by provoking [[H4784]] the most High [[H5945]] in the wilderness. [[H6723]]

### 18
And they tempted [[H5254]] God [[H410]] in their heart [[H3824]] by asking [[H7592]] meat [[H400]] for their lust. [[H5315]]

### 19
Yea, they spake [[H1696]] against God; [[H430]] they said, [[H559]] Can [[H3201]] God [[H410]] furnish [[H6186]] a table [[H7979]] in the wilderness? [[H4057]]

### 20
Behold, [[H2005]] he smote [[H5221]] the rock, [[H6697]] that the waters [[H4325]] gushed out, [[H2100]] and the streams [[H5158]] overflowed; [[H7857]] can [[H3201]] he give [[H5414]] bread [[H3899]] also? [[H1571]] can [[H518]] he provide [[H3559]] flesh [[H7607]] for his people? [[H5971]]

### 21
Therefore [[H3651]] the Lord [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] and was wroth: [[H5674]] so a fire [[H784]] was kindled [[H5400]] against Jacob, [[H3290]] and anger [[H639]] also [[H1571]] came up [[H5927]] against Israel; [[H3478]]

### 22
Because [[H3588]] they believed [[H539]] not [[H3808]] in God, [[H430]] and trusted [[H982]] not [[H3808]] in his salvation: [[H3444]]

### 23
Though he had commanded [[H6680]] the clouds [[H7834]] from above, [[H4605]] and opened [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of heaven, [[H8064]]

### 24
And had rained down [[H4305]] manna [[H4478]] upon [[H5921]] them to eat, [[H398]] and had given [[H5414]] them of the corn [[H1715]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 25
Man [[H376]] did eat [[H398]] angels' [[H47]] food: [[H3899]] he sent [[H7971]] them meat [[H6720]] to the full. [[H7648]]

### 26
He caused an east wind [[H6921]] to blow [[H5265]] in the heaven: [[H8064]] and by his power [[H5797]] he brought in [[H5090]] the south wind. [[H8486]]

### 27
He rained [[H4305]] flesh [[H7607]] also upon [[H5921]] them as dust, [[H6083]] and feathered [[H3671]] fowls [[H5775]] like as the sand [[H2344]] of the sea: [[H3220]]

### 28
And he let fall [[H5307]] in the midst [[H7130]] of their camp, [[H4264]] round about [[H5439]] their habitations. [[H4908]]

### 29
So they did eat, [[H398]] and were well [[H3966]] filled: [[H7646]] for he gave [[H935]] them their own desire; [[H8378]]

### 30
They were not [[H3808]] estranged [[H2114]] from their lust. [[H8378]] But while their meat [[H400]] yet [[H5750]] in their mouths, [[H6310]]

### 31
The wrath [[H639]] of God [[H430]] came [[H5927]] upon them, and slew [[H2026]] the fattest [[H4924]] of them, and smote down [[H3766]] the chosen [[H970]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 32
For all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] they sinned [[H2398]] still, [[H5750]] and believed [[H539]] not [[H3808]] for his wondrous works. [[H6381]]

### 33
Therefore their days [[H3117]] did he consume [[H3615]] in vanity, [[H1892]] and their years [[H8141]] in trouble. [[H928]]

### 34
When [[H518]] he slew [[H2026]] them, then they sought [[H1875]] him: and they returned [[H7725]] and inquired early [[H7836]] after God. [[H410]]

### 35
And they remembered [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] their rock, [[H6697]] and the high [[H5945]] God [[H410]] their redeemer. [[H1350]]

### 36
Nevertheless they did flatter [[H6601]] him with their mouth, [[H6310]] and they lied [[H3576]] unto him with their tongues. [[H3956]]

### 37
For their heart [[H3820]] was not right [[H3559]] with [[H5973]] him, neither [[H3808]] were they stedfast [[H539]] in his covenant. [[H1285]]

### 38
But he, [[H1931]] full of compassion, [[H7349]] forgave [[H3722]] iniquity, [[H5771]] and destroyed [[H7843]] not: [[H3808]] yea, many time [[H7235]] a turned away, [[H7725]] he his anger [[H639]] and did not [[H3808]] stir up [[H5782]] all [[H3605]] his wrath. [[H2534]]

### 39
For he remembered [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] flesh; [[H1320]] a wind [[H7307]] that passeth away, [[H1980]] and cometh not again. [[H7725]]

### 40
How oft [[H4100]] did they provoke [[H4784]] him in the wilderness, [[H4057]] grieve [[H6087]] him in the desert! [[H3452]]

### 41
Yea, they turned back [[H7725]] and tempted [[H5254]] God, [[H410]] and limited [[H8428]] the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 42
They remembered [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] his hand, [[H3027]] the day [[H3117]] when [[H834]] he delivered [[H6299]] them from [[H4480]] the enemy. [[H6862]]

### 43
How [[H834]] he had wrought [[H7760]] his signs [[H226]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and his wonders [[H4159]] in the field [[H7704]] of Zoan: [[H6814]]

### 44
And had turned [[H2015]] their rivers [[H2975]] into blood; [[H1818]] and their floods, [[H5140]] that they could not [[H1077]] drink. [[H8354]]

### 45
He sent [[H7971]] divers sorts of flies [[H6157]] among them, which devoured [[H398]] them; and frogs, [[H6854]] which destroyed [[H7843]] them. [[H7843]]

### 46
He gave [[H5414]] also their increase [[H2981]] unto the caterpiller, [[H2625]] and their labour [[H3018]] unto the locust. [[H697]]

### 47
He destroyed [[H2026]] their vines [[H1612]] with hail, [[H1259]] and their sycomore trees [[H8256]] with frost. [[H2602]]

### 48
He gave up [[H5462]] their cattle [[H1165]] also to the hail, [[H1259]] and their flocks [[H4735]] to hot thunderbolts. [[H7565]]

### 49
He cast [[H7971]] upon them the fierceness [[H2740]] of his anger, [[H639]] wrath, [[H5678]] and indignation, [[H2195]] and trouble, [[H6869]] by sending [[H4917]] evil [[H7451]] angels [[H4397]]

### 50
He made [[H6424]] a way [[H5410]] to his anger; [[H639]] he spared [[H2820]] not [[H3808]] their soul [[H5315]] from death, [[H4194]] but gave [[H5462]] their life [[H2416]] over to the pestilence; [[H1698]]

### 51
And smote [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in Egypt; [[H4714]] the chief [[H7225]] of strength [[H202]] in the tabernacles [[H168]] of Ham: [[H2526]]

### 52
But made his own people [[H5971]] to go forth [[H5265]] like sheep, [[H6629]] and guided [[H5090]] them in the wilderness [[H4057]] like a flock. [[H5739]]

### 53
And he led [[H5148]] them on safely, [[H983]] so that they feared [[H6342]] not: [[H3808]] but the sea [[H3220]] overwhelmed [[H3680]] their enemies. [[H341]]

### 54
And he brought [[H935]] them to [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of his sanctuary, [[H6944]] this [[H2088]] mountain, [[H2022]] his right hand [[H3225]] had purchased. [[H7069]]

### 55
He cast out [[H1644]] the heathen [[H1471]] also before [[H6440]] them, and divided [[H5307]] them an inheritance [[H5159]] by line, [[H2256]] and made the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] to dwell [[H7931]] in their tents. [[H168]]

### 56
Yet they tempted [[H5254]] and provoked [[H4784]] the most high [[H5945]] God, [[H430]] and kept [[H8104]] not [[H3808]] his testimonies: [[H5713]]

### 57
But turned back, [[H5472]] and dealt unfaithfully [[H898]] like their fathers: [[H1]] they were turned aside [[H2015]] like a deceitful [[H7423]] bow. [[H7198]]

### 58
For they provoked him to anger [[H3707]] with their high places, [[H1116]] and moved him to jealousy [[H7065]] with their graven images. [[H6456]]

### 59
When God [[H430]] heard [[H8085]] he was wroth, [[H5674]] and greatly [[H3966]] abhorred [[H3988]] Israel: [[H3478]]

### 60
So that he forsook [[H5203]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of Shiloh, [[H7887]] the tent [[H168]] he placed [[H7931]] among men; [[H120]]

### 61
And delivered [[H5414]] his strength [[H5797]] into captivity, [[H7628]] and his glory [[H8597]] into the enemy's [[H6862]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 62
He gave [[H5462]] his people [[H5971]] over also unto the sword; [[H2719]] and was wroth [[H5674]] with his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 63
The fire [[H784]] consumed [[H398]] their young men; [[H970]] and their maidens [[H1330]] were not [[H3808]] given to marriage. [[H1984]]

### 64
Their priests [[H3548]] fell [[H5307]] by the sword; [[H2719]] and their widows [[H490]] made no [[H3808]] lamentation. [[H1058]]

### 65
Then the Lord [[H136]] awaked [[H3364]] as one out of sleep, [[H3463]] like a mighty man [[H1368]] that shouteth [[H7442]] by reason of wine. [[H3196]]

### 66
And he smote [[H5221]] his enemies [[H6862]] in the hinder parts: [[H268]] he put [[H5414]] them to a perpetual [[H5769]] reproach. [[H2781]]

### 67
Moreover he refused [[H3988]] the tabernacle [[H168]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] and chose [[H977]] not [[H3808]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Ephraim: [[H669]]

### 68
But chose [[H977]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] which [[H834]] he loved. [[H157]]

### 69
And he built [[H1129]] his sanctuary [[H4720]] like [[H3644]] high [[H7311]] like the earth [[H776]] which he hath established [[H3245]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 70
He chose [[H977]] David [[H1732]] also his servant, [[H5650]] and took [[H3947]] him from the sheepfolds: [[H4356]]

### 71
From following [[H310]] the ewes great with young [[H5763]] he brought [[H935]] him to feed [[H7462]] Jacob [[H3290]] his people, [[H5971]] and Israel [[H3478]] his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 72
So he fed [[H7462]] them according to the integrity [[H8537]] of his heart; [[H3824]] and guided [[H5148]] them by the skilfulness [[H8394]] of his hands. [[H3709]]
