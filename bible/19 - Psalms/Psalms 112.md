### 1
Praise [[H1984]] ye the Lord. [[H3050]] Blessed [[H835]] the man [[H376]] feareth [[H3372]] the Lord, [[H3068]] delighteth [[H2654]] greatly [[H3966]] in his commandments. [[H4687]]

### 2
His seed [[H2233]] shall be [[H1961]] mighty [[H1368]] upon earth: [[H776]] the generation [[H1755]] of the upright [[H3477]] shall be blessed. [[H1288]]

### 3
Wealth [[H1952]] and riches [[H6239]] in his house: [[H1004]] and his righteousness [[H6666]] endureth [[H5975]] for ever. [[H5703]]

### 4
Unto the upright [[H3477]] there ariseth [[H2224]] light [[H216]] in the darkness: [[H2822]] gracious, [[H2587]] and full of compassion, [[H7349]] and righteous. [[H6662]]

### 5
A good [[H2896]] man [[H376]] sheweth favour, [[H2603]] and lendeth: [[H3867]] he will guide [[H3557]] his affairs [[H1697]] with discretion. [[H4941]]

### 6
Surely [[H3588]] he shall not [[H3808]] be moved [[H4131]] for ever: [[H5769]] the righteous [[H6662]] shall be [[H1961]] in everlasting [[H5769]] remembrance. [[H2143]]

### 7
He shall not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] of evil [[H7451]] tidings: [[H8052]] his heart [[H3820]] is fixed, [[H3559]] trusting [[H982]] in the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 8
His heart [[H3820]] established, [[H5564]] he shall not [[H3808]] be afraid, [[H3372]] until [[H5704]] he see [[H7200]] upon his enemies. [[H6862]]

### 9
He hath dispersed, [[H6340]] he hath given [[H5414]] to the poor; [[H34]] his righteousness [[H6666]] endureth [[H5975]] for ever; [[H5703]] his horn [[H7161]] shall be exalted [[H7311]] with honour. [[H3519]]

### 10
The wicked [[H7563]] shall see [[H7200]] and be grieved; [[H3707]] he shall gnash [[H2786]] with his teeth, [[H8127]] and melt away: [[H4549]] the desire [[H8378]] of the wicked [[H7563]] shall perish. [[H6]]
