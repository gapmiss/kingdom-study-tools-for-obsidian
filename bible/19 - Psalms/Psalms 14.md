To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
The fool [[H5036]] hath said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] no [[H369]] God. [[H430]] They are corrupt, [[H7843]] they have done abominable [[H8581]] works, [[H5949]] none [[H369]] that doeth [[H6213]] good. [[H2896]]

### 2
The Lord [[H3068]] looked down [[H8259]] from heaven [[H8064]] upon [[H5921]] the children [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] to see [[H7200]] if there were [[H3426]] any that did understand, [[H7919]] seek [[H1875]] God. [[H430]]

### 3
They are all [[H3605]] gone aside, [[H5493]] they are together [[H3162]] become filthy: [[H444]] none [[H369]] that doeth [[H6213]] good, [[H2896]] no, [[H369]] not [[H1571]] one. [[H259]]

### 4
Have all [[H3605]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] no [[H3808]] knowledge? [[H3045]] who eat up [[H398]] my people [[H5971]] they eat [[H398]] bread, [[H3899]] and call [[H7121]] not [[H3808]] upon the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
There [[H8033]] were they in great [[H6343]] fear: [[H6342]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] in the generation [[H1755]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 6
Ye have shamed [[H954]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the poor, [[H6041]] because [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] his refuge. [[H4268]]

### 7
Oh that [[H5414]] the salvation [[H3444]] of Israel [[H3478]] out of Zion! [[H6726]] when the Lord [[H3068]] bringeth back [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7622]] of his people, [[H5971]] Jacob [[H3290]] shall rejoice, [[H1523]] Israel [[H3478]] shall be glad. [[H8055]]
