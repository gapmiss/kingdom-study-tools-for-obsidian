A Prayer [[H8605]] of Moses [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]]

### 1
Lord, [[H136]] thou [[H859]] hast been [[H1961]] our dwelling place [[H4583]] in all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 2
Before [[H2962]] the mountains [[H2022]] were brought forth, [[H3205]] or ever thou hadst formed [[H2342]] the earth [[H776]] and the world, [[H8398]] even from everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting, [[H5769]] thou [[H859]] God. [[H410]]

### 3
Thou turnest [[H7725]] man [[H582]] to [[H5704]] destruction; [[H1793]] and sayest, [[H559]] Return, [[H7725]] ye children [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] a thousand [[H505]] years [[H8141]] in thy sight [[H5869]] as [[H3117]] yesterday [[H865]] when [[H3588]] it is past, [[H5674]] and a watch [[H821]] in the night. [[H3915]]

### 5
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; [[H2229]] they are [[H1961]] a sleep: [[H8142]] in the morning [[H1242]] like grass [[H2682]] groweth up. [[H2498]]

### 6
In the morning [[H1242]] it flourisheth, [[H6692]] and groweth up; [[H2498]] in the evening [[H6153]] it is cut down, [[H4135]] and withereth. [[H3001]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] we are consumed [[H3615]] by thine anger, [[H639]] and by thy wrath [[H2534]] are we troubled. [[H926]]

### 8
Thou hast set [[H7896]] our iniquities [[H5771]] before [[H5048]] thee, our secret [[H5956]] in the light [[H3974]] of thy countenance. [[H6440]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] our days [[H3117]] are passed away [[H6437]] in thy wrath: [[H5678]] we spend [[H3615]] our years [[H8141]] as [[H3644]] a tale [[H1899]]

### 10
The days [[H3117]] of our years [[H8141]] threescore [[H7657]] years [[H8141]] and ten; and if [[H518]] by reason of strength [[H1369]] fourscore [[H8084]] years, [[H8141]] yet their strength [[H7296]] labour [[H5999]] and sorrow; [[H205]] for [[H3588]] it is soon [[H2440]] cut off, [[H1468]] and we fly away. [[H5774]]

### 11
Who [[H4310]] knoweth [[H3045]] the power [[H5797]] of thine anger? [[H639]] even according to thy fear, [[H3374]] thy wrath. [[H5678]]

### 12
So [[H3651]] teach [[H3045]] to number [[H4487]] our days, [[H3117]] that we may apply [[H935]] hearts [[H3824]] unto wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 13
Return, [[H7725]] O Lord, [[H3068]] how long? [[H5704]] and let it repent [[H5162]] thee concerning [[H5921]] thy servants. [[H5650]]

### 14
O satisfy [[H7646]] us early [[H1242]] with thy mercy; [[H2617]] that we may rejoice [[H7442]] and be glad [[H8055]] all [[H3605]] our days. [[H3117]]

### 15
Make us glad [[H8055]] according to the days [[H3117]] thou hast afflicted [[H6031]] us, the years [[H8141]] we have seen [[H7200]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 16
Let thy work [[H6467]] appear [[H7200]] unto [[H413]] thy servants, [[H5650]] and thy glory [[H1926]] unto [[H5921]] their children. [[H1121]]

### 17
And let the beauty [[H5278]] of the Lord [[H136]] our God [[H430]] be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] us: and establish [[H3559]] thou the work [[H4639]] of our hands [[H3027]] upon [[H5921]] us; yea, the work [[H4639]] of our hands [[H3027]] establish [[H3559]] thou it. [[H3559]]
