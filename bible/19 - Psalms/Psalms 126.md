A Song [[H7892]] of degrees. [[H4609]]

### 1
When the Lord [[H3068]] turned again [[H7725]] the captivity [[H7870]] of Zion, [[H6726]] we were [[H1961]] like them that dream. [[H2492]]

### 2
Then [[H227]] was our mouth [[H6310]] filled [[H4390]] with laughter, [[H7814]] and our tongue [[H3956]] with singing: [[H7440]] then [[H227]] said [[H559]] they among the heathen, [[H1471]] The Lord [[H3068]] hath done [[H6213]] great things [[H1431]] for [[H5973]] them. [[H5973]]

### 3
The Lord [[H3068]] hath done [[H6213]] great things [[H1431]] for [[H5973]] us; we are [[H1961]] glad. [[H8056]]

### 4
Turn again [[H7725]] our captivity, [[H7622]] O Lord, [[H3068]] as the streams [[H650]] in the south. [[H5045]]

### 5
They that sow [[H2232]] in tears [[H1832]] shall reap [[H7114]] in joy. [[H7440]]

### 6
He that goeth [[H3212]] forth [[H1980]] and weepeth, [[H1058]] bearing [[H5375]] precious [[H4901]] seed, [[H2233]] shall doubtless come [[H935]] again [[H935]] with rejoicing, [[H7440]] bringing [[H5375]] his sheaves [[H485]]
