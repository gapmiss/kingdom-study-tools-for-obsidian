---

To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] Al-taschith, [[H516]] Michtam [[H4387]] of David; [[H1732]] when Saul [[H7586]] sent, [[H7971]] and they watched [[H8104]] the house [[H1004]] to kill him. [[H4191]]

### 1
Deliver [[H5337]] me from mine enemies, [[H341]] O my God: [[H430]] defend [[H7682]] me from them that rise up against [[H6965]] me. [[H6965]]

### 2
Deliver [[H5337]] me from the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity, [[H205]] and save [[H3467]] me from bloody [[H1818]] men. [[H582]]

### 3
For, [[H3588]] lo, [[H2009]] they lie in wait [[H693]] for my soul: [[H5315]] the mighty [[H5794]] are gathered [[H1481]] against [[H5921]] me; not [[H3808]] my transgression, [[H6588]] nor [[H3808]] my sin, [[H2403]] O Lord. [[H3068]]

### 4
They run [[H7323]] and prepare themselves [[H3559]] without [[H1097]] fault: [[H5771]] awake [[H5782]] to help [[H7125]] me, and behold. [[H7200]]

### 5
Thou [[H859]] therefore, O Lord [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] awake [[H6974]] to visit [[H6485]] all [[H3605]] the heathen: [[H1471]] be not [[H408]] merciful [[H2603]] to any [[H3605]] wicked [[H205]] transgressors. [[H898]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 6
They return [[H7725]] at evening: [[H6153]] they make a noise [[H1993]] like a dog, [[H3611]] and go round about [[H5437]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2009]] they belch out [[H5042]] with their mouth: [[H6310]] swords [[H2719]] in their lips: [[H8193]] for [[H3588]] who, [[H4310]] doth hear? [[H8085]]

### 8
But thou, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H3068]] shalt laugh [[H7832]] at them; thou shalt have all [[H3605]] the heathen [[H1471]] in derision. [[H3932]]

### 9
his strength [[H5797]] will I wait [[H8104]] upon [[H413]] thee: for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] my defence. [[H4869]]

### 10
The God [[H430]] of my mercy [[H2617]] shall prevent [[H6923]] me: God [[H430]] shall let me see [[H7200]] upon mine enemies. [[H8324]]

### 11
Slay [[H2026]] them not, [[H408]] lest [[H6435]] my people [[H5971]] forget: [[H7911]] scatter [[H5128]] them by thy power; [[H2428]] and bring them down, [[H3381]] O Lord [[H136]] our shield. [[H4043]]

### 12
the sin [[H2403]] of their mouth [[H6310]] the words [[H1697]] of their lips [[H8193]] let them even be taken [[H3920]] in their pride: [[H1347]] and for cursing [[H423]] and lying [[H3585]] they speak. [[H5608]]

### 13
Consume [[H3615]] in wrath, [[H2534]] consume [[H3615]] that they not [[H369]] and let them know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] ruleth [[H4910]] in Jacob [[H3290]] unto the ends [[H657]] of the earth. [[H776]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 14
And at evening [[H6153]] let them return; [[H7725]] let them make a noise [[H1993]] like a dog, [[H3611]] and go round about [[H5437]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 15
Let them [[H1992]] wander up and down [[H5128]] for meat, [[H398]] and grudge [[H3885]] if [[H518]] they be not [[H3808]] satisfied. [[H7646]]

### 16
But I [[H589]] will sing [[H7891]] of thy power; [[H5797]] yea, I will sing aloud [[H7442]] of thy mercy [[H2617]] in the morning: [[H1242]] for [[H3588]] thou hast been [[H1961]] my defence [[H4869]] and refuge [[H4498]] in the day [[H3117]] of my trouble. [[H6862]]

### 17
Unto [[H413]] thee, O my strength, [[H5797]] will I sing: [[H2167]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] my defence, [[H4869]] the God [[H430]] of my mercy. [[H2617]]
