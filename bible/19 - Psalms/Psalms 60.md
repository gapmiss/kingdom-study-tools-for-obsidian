To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Shushan-eduth, [[H7799]] Michtam [[H4387]] of David, [[H1732]] to teach; [[H3925]] when he strove with [[H5327]] Aram-naharaim [[H758]] and with [[H854]] Aram-zobah, [[H758]] when Joab [[H3097]] returned, [[H7725]] and smote [[H5221]]  of [[H853]] Edom [[H123]] in the valley [[H1516]] of salt [[H4417]] twelve [[H8147]] thousand. [[H505]]

### 1
O God, [[H430]] thou hast cast us off, [[H2186]] thou hast scattered [[H6555]] us, thou hast been displeased; [[H599]] O turn [[H7725]] thyself again. [[H7725]] to us [[H7725]]

### 2
Thou hast made the earth [[H776]] to tremble; [[H7493]] thou hast broken [[H6480]] it: heal [[H7495]] the breaches [[H7667]] thereof; for [[H3588]] it shaketh. [[H4131]]

### 3
Thou hast shewed [[H7200]] thy people [[H5971]] hard things: [[H7186]] thou hast made us to drink [[H8248]] the wine [[H3196]] of astonishment. [[H8653]]

### 4
Thou hast given [[H5414]] a banner [[H5251]] to them that fear [[H3373]] thee, that it may be displayed [[H5127]] because [[H6440]] of the truth. [[H7189]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
That [[H4616]] thy beloved [[H3039]] may be delivered; [[H2502]] save [[H3467]] thy right hand, [[H3225]] and hear me. [[H6030]]

### 6
God [[H430]] hath spoken [[H1696]] in his holiness; [[H6944]] I will rejoice, [[H5937]] I will divide [[H2505]] Shechem, [[H7927]] and mete out [[H4058]] the valley [[H6010]] of Succoth. [[H5523]]

### 7
Gilead [[H1568]] mine, and Manasseh [[H4519]] mine; Ephraim [[H669]] also the strength [[H4581]] of mine head; [[H7218]] Judah [[H3063]] my lawgiver; [[H2710]]

### 8
Moab [[H4124]] my washpot; [[H5518]] over [[H5921]] Edom [[H123]] will I cast out [[H7993]] my shoe: [[H5275]] Philistia, [[H6429]] triumph [[H7321]] thou because [[H5921]] of me. [[H5921]]

### 9
Who [[H4310]] will bring [[H2986]] me the strong [[H4692]] city? [[H5892]] who [[H4310]] will lead [[H5148]] me into [[H5704]] Edom? [[H123]]

### 10
not [[H3808]] thou, [[H859]] O God, [[H430]] hadst cast us off? [[H2186]] and O God, [[H430]] didst not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] with our armies? [[H6635]]

### 11
Give [[H3051]] us help [[H5833]] from trouble: [[H6862]] for vain [[H7723]] the help [[H8668]] of man. [[H120]]

### 12
Through God [[H430]] we shall do [[H6213]] valiantly: [[H2428]] for he [[H1931]] shall tread down [[H947]] our enemies. [[H6862]]
