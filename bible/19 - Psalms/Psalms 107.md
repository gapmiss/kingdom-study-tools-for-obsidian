### 1
O give thanks [[H3034]] unto the Lord, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] good: [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] his mercy [[H2617]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 2
Let the redeemed [[H1350]] of the Lord [[H3068]] say [[H559]] whom [[H834]] he hath redeemed [[H1350]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the enemy; [[H6862]]

### 3
And gathered [[H6908]] them out of the lands, [[H776]] from the east, [[H4217]] and from the west, [[H4628]] from the north, [[H6828]] and from the south. [[H3220]]

### 4
They wandered [[H8582]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] in a solitary [[H3452]] way; [[H1870]] they found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] city [[H5892]] to dwell [[H4186]] in. [[H4186]]

### 5
Hungry [[H7457]] and [[H1571]] thirsty, [[H6771]] their soul [[H5315]] fainted [[H5848]] in them. [[H5848]]

### 6
Then they cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] in their trouble, [[H6862]] he delivered [[H5337]] them out of their distresses. [[H4691]]

### 7
And he led them forth [[H1869]] by the right [[H3477]] way, [[H1870]] that they might go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] a city [[H5892]] of habitation. [[H4186]]

### 8
Oh that would praise [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] his goodness, [[H2617]] and his wonderful works [[H6381]] to the children [[H1121]] of men! [[H120]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] he satisfieth [[H7646]] the longing [[H8264]] soul, [[H5315]] and filleth [[H4390]] the hungry [[H7457]] soul [[H5315]] with goodness. [[H2896]]

### 10
Such as sit [[H3427]] in darkness [[H2822]] and in the shadow of death, [[H6757]] bound [[H615]] in affliction [[H6040]] and iron; [[H1270]]

### 11
Because [[H3588]] they rebelled against [[H4784]] the words [[H561]] of God, [[H410]] and contemned [[H5006]] the counsel [[H6098]] of the most High: [[H5945]]

### 12
Therefore he brought down [[H3665]] their heart [[H3820]] with labour; [[H5999]] they fell down, [[H3782]] and none [[H369]] to help. [[H5826]]

### 13
Then they cried [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] in their trouble, [[H6862]] he saved [[H3467]] them out of their distresses. [[H4691]]

### 14
He brought them out [[H3318]] of darkness [[H2822]] and the shadow of death, [[H6757]] and brake sunder. [[H5423]] their bands [[H4147]] in [[H4147]]

### 15
Oh that would praise [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] his goodness, [[H2617]] and his wonderful works [[H6381]] to the children [[H1121]] of men! [[H120]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] he hath broken [[H7665]] the gates [[H1817]] of brass, [[H5178]] and cut sunder. [[H1438]] the bars [[H1280]] of iron [[H1270]] in [[H1270]]

### 17
Fools [[H191]] because [[H1870]] of their transgression, [[H6588]] and because of their iniquities, [[H5771]] are afflicted. [[H6031]]

### 18
Their soul [[H5315]] abhorreth [[H8581]] all manner [[H3605]] of meat; [[H400]] and they draw near [[H5060]] unto [[H5704]] the gates [[H8179]] of death. [[H4194]]

### 19
Then they cry [[H2199]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] in their trouble, [[H6862]] he saveth [[H3467]] them out of their distresses. [[H4691]]

### 20
He sent [[H7971]] his word, [[H1697]] and healed [[H7495]] them, and delivered [[H4422]] from their destructions. [[H7825]]

### 21
Oh that would praise [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] his goodness, [[H2617]] and his wonderful works [[H6381]] to the children [[H1121]] of men! [[H120]]

### 22
And let them sacrifice [[H2076]] the sacrifices [[H2077]] of thanksgiving, [[H8426]] and declare [[H5608]] his works [[H4639]] with rejoicing. [[H7440]]

### 23
They that go down [[H3381]] to the sea [[H3220]] in ships, [[H591]] that do [[H6213]] business [[H4399]] in great [[H7227]] waters; [[H4325]]

### 24
These [[H1992]] see [[H7200]] the works [[H4639]] of the Lord, [[H3068]] and his wonders [[H6381]] in the deep. [[H4688]]

### 25
For he commandeth, [[H559]] and raiseth [[H5975]] the stormy [[H5591]] wind, [[H7307]] which lifteth up [[H7311]] the waves [[H1530]] thereof. [[H1530]]

### 26
They mount up [[H5927]] to the heaven, [[H8064]] they go down [[H3381]] again to the depths: [[H8415]] their soul [[H5315]] is melted [[H4127]] because of trouble. [[H7451]]

### 27
They reel to and fro, [[H2287]] and stagger [[H5128]] like a drunken man, [[H7910]] and are at their wits' [[H2451]] end. [[H1104]]

### 28
Then they cry [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] the Lord [[H3068]] in their trouble, [[H6862]] and he bringeth them out [[H3318]] of their distresses. [[H4691]]

### 29
He maketh [[H6965]] the storm [[H5591]] a calm, [[H1827]] so that the waves [[H1530]] thereof are still. [[H2814]]

### 30
Then are they glad [[H8055]] because [[H3588]] they be quiet; [[H8367]] so he bringeth [[H5148]] them unto [[H413]] their desired [[H2656]] haven. [[H4231]]

### 31
Oh that would praise [[H3034]] the Lord [[H3068]] his goodness, [[H2617]] and his wonderful works [[H6381]] to the children [[H1121]] of men! [[H120]]

### 32
Let them exalt [[H7311]] him also in the congregation [[H6951]] of the people, [[H5971]] and praise [[H1984]] him in the assembly [[H4186]] of the elders. [[H2205]]

### 33
He turneth [[H7760]] rivers [[H5104]] into a wilderness, [[H4057]] and the watersprings [[H4325]] into dry ground; [[H6774]]

### 34
A fruitful [[H6529]] land [[H776]] into barrenness, [[H4420]] for the wickedness [[H7451]] of them that dwell [[H3427]] therein. [[H3427]]

### 35
He turneth [[H7760]] the wilderness [[H4057]] into a standing [[H98]] water, [[H4325]] and dry [[H6723]] ground [[H776]] into watersprings. [[H4325]]

### 36
And there [[H8033]] he maketh the hungry [[H7457]] to dwell, [[H3427]] that they may prepare [[H3559]] a city [[H5892]] for habitation; [[H4186]]

### 37
And sow [[H2232]] the fields, [[H7704]] and plant [[H5193]] vineyards, [[H3754]] which may yield [[H6213]] fruits [[H6529]] of increase. [[H8393]]

### 38
He blesseth [[H1288]] them also, so that they are multiplied [[H7235]] greatly; [[H3966]] and suffereth not [[H3808]] their cattle [[H929]] to decrease. [[H4591]]

### 39
Again, they are minished [[H4591]] and brought low [[H7817]] through oppression, [[H6115]] affliction, [[H7451]] and sorrow. [[H3015]]

### 40
He poureth [[H8210]] contempt [[H937]] upon [[H5921]] princes, [[H5081]] and causeth them to wander [[H8582]] in the wilderness, [[H8414]] no [[H3808]] way. [[H1870]]

### 41
Yet setteth he the poor [[H34]] on high [[H7682]] from affliction, [[H6040]] and maketh [[H7760]] families [[H4940]] like a flock. [[H6629]]

### 42
The righteous [[H3477]] shall see [[H7200]] and rejoice: [[H8055]] and all [[H3605]] iniquity [[H5766]] shall stop [[H7092]] her mouth. [[H6310]]

### 43
Whoso [[H4310]] wise, [[H2450]] and will observe [[H8104]] these [[H428]] even they shall understand [[H995]] the lovingkindness [[H2617]] of the Lord. [[H3068]]
