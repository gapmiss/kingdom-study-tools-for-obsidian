To the chief Musician [[H5329]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Korah, [[H7141]] Maschil. [[H4905]]

### 1
We have heard [[H8085]] with our ears, [[H241]] O God, [[H430]] our fathers [[H1]] have told [[H5608]] us, work [[H6467]] thou didst [[H6466]] in their days, [[H3117]] in the times [[H3117]] of old. [[H6924]]

### 2
thou [[H859]] didst drive out [[H3423]] the heathen [[H1471]] with thy hand, [[H3027]] and plantedst [[H5193]] them; thou didst afflict [[H7489]] the people, [[H3816]] and cast them out. [[H7971]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] they got [[H3423]] not [[H3808]] the land [[H776]] in possession by their own sword, [[H2719]] neither [[H3808]] did their own arm [[H2220]] save [[H3467]] them: but [[H3588]] thy right hand, [[H3225]] and thine arm, [[H2220]] and the light [[H216]] of thy countenance, [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] thou hadst a favour [[H7521]] unto them. [[H7521]]

### 4
Thou [[H859]] art my King, [[H4428]] O God: [[H430]] command [[H6680]] deliverances [[H3444]] for Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 5
Through thee will we push down [[H5055]] our enemies: [[H6862]] through thy name [[H8034]] will we tread them under [[H947]] that rise up against [[H6965]] us. [[H6965]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] trust [[H982]] in my bow, [[H7198]] neither [[H3808]] shall my sword [[H2719]] save [[H3467]] me. [[H3467]]

### 7
But [[H3588]] thou hast saved [[H3467]] us from our enemies, [[H6862]] and hast put them to shame [[H954]] that hated [[H8130]] us. [[H8130]]

### 8
In God [[H430]] we boast [[H1984]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long, and praise [[H3034]] thy name [[H8034]] for ever. [[H5769]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 9
But [[H637]] thou hast cast off, [[H2186]] and put us to shame; [[H3637]] and goest not forth [[H3318]] with our armies. [[H6635]]

### 10
Thou makest us to turn [[H7725]] back [[H268]] from [[H4480]] the enemy: [[H6862]] and they which hate [[H8130]] us spoil [[H8154]] for themselves. [[H8154]]

### 11
Thou hast given [[H5414]] us like sheep [[H6629]] for meat; [[H3978]] and hast scattered [[H2219]] us among the heathen. [[H1471]]

### 12
Thou sellest [[H4376]] thy people [[H5971]] for nought, [[H1952]] and dost not [[H3808]] increase [[H7235]] by their price. [[H4242]]

### 13
Thou makest [[H7760]] us a reproach [[H2781]] to our neighbours, [[H7934]] a scorn [[H3933]] and a derision [[H7047]] to them that are round about [[H5439]] us. [[H5439]]

### 14
Thou makest [[H7760]] us a byword [[H4912]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] a shaking [[H4493]] of the head [[H7218]] among the people. [[H3816]]

### 15
My confusion [[H3639]] continually [[H3117]] before [[H5048]] me, and the shame [[H1322]] of my face [[H6440]] hath covered [[H3680]] me, [[H3680]]

### 16
For the voice [[H6963]] of him that reproacheth [[H2778]] and blasphemeth; [[H1442]] by reason [[H6440]] of the enemy [[H341]] and avenger. [[H5358]]

### 17
All [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] is come upon [[H935]] us; yet have we not [[H3808]] forgotten [[H7911]] thee, neither [[H3808]] have we dealt falsely [[H8266]] in thy covenant. [[H1285]]

### 18
Our heart [[H3820]] is not [[H3808]] turned [[H5472]] back, [[H268]] neither have our steps [[H838]] declined [[H5186]] from [[H4480]] thy way; [[H734]]

### 19
Though [[H3588]] thou hast sore broken [[H1794]] us in the place [[H4725]] of dragons, [[H8577]] and covered [[H3680]] us with the shadow of death. [[H6757]]

### 20
If [[H518]] we have forgotten [[H7911]] the name [[H8034]] of our God, [[H430]] or stretched out [[H6566]] our hands [[H3709]] to a strange [[H2114]] god; [[H410]]

### 21
Shall not [[H3808]] God [[H430]] search out? [[H2713]] this [[H2063]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] knoweth [[H3045]] the secrets [[H8587]] of the heart. [[H3820]]

### 22
Yea, [[H3588]] for [[H5921]] thy sake are we killed [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long; we are counted [[H2803]] as sheep [[H6629]] for the slaughter. [[H2878]]

### 23
Awake, [[H5782]] why [[H4100]] sleepest [[H3462]] thou, O Lord? [[H136]] arise, [[H6974]] cast off [[H2186]] not [[H408]] for ever. [[H5331]]

### 24
Wherefore [[H4100]] hidest [[H5641]] thou thy face, [[H6440]] forgettest [[H7911]] our affliction [[H6040]] and our oppression? [[H3906]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] our soul [[H5315]] is bowed down [[H7743]] to the dust: [[H6083]] our belly [[H990]] cleaveth [[H1692]] unto the earth. [[H776]]

### 26
Arise [[H6965]] for our help, [[H5833]] and redeem [[H6299]] us for thy mercies' [[H2617]] sake. [[H4616]]
