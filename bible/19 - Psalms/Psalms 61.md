To the chief Musician [[H5329]] upon [[H5921]] Neginah, [[H5058]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Hear [[H8085]] my cry, [[H7440]] O God; [[H430]] attend unto [[H7181]] my prayer. [[H8605]]

### 2
From the end [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] will I cry [[H7121]] unto [[H413]] thee, when my heart [[H3820]] is overwhelmed: [[H5848]] lead [[H5148]] me to the rock [[H6697]] is higher [[H7311]] than [[H4480]] I. [[H4480]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] thou hast been [[H1961]] a shelter [[H4268]] for me, a strong [[H5797]] tower [[H4026]] from [[H6440]] the enemy. [[H341]]

### 4
I will abide [[H1481]] in thy tabernacle [[H168]] for ever: [[H5769]] I will trust [[H2620]] in the covert [[H5643]] of thy wings. [[H3671]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] thou, [[H859]] O God, [[H430]] hast heard [[H8085]] my vows: [[H5088]] thou hast given [[H5414]] the heritage [[H3425]] of those that fear [[H3373]] thy name. [[H8034]]

### 6
Thou wilt prolong [[H3254]] the king's [[H4428]] life: [[H3117]] his years [[H8141]] as [[H3644]] many [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 7
He shall abide [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] God [[H430]] for ever: [[H5769]] O prepare [[H4487]] mercy [[H2617]] and truth, [[H571]] may preserve [[H5341]] him. [[H5341]]

### 8
So [[H3651]] will I sing praise [[H2167]] unto thy name [[H8034]] for ever, [[H5703]] that I may daily [[H3117]] perform [[H7999]] my vows. [[H5088]]
