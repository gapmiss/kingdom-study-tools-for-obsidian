### 1
Why [[H4100]] standest [[H5975]] thou afar off, [[H7350]] O Lord? [[H3068]] hidest [[H5956]] thou in times [[H6256]] of trouble? [[H6869]]

### 2
The wicked [[H7563]] in pride [[H1346]] doth persecute [[H1814]] the poor: [[H6041]] let them be taken [[H8610]] in the devices [[H4209]] that [[H2098]] they have imagined. [[H2803]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the wicked [[H7563]] boasteth [[H1984]] of [[H5921]] his heart's [[H5315]] desire, [[H8378]] and blesseth [[H1288]] the covetous, [[H1214]] the Lord [[H3068]] abhorreth. [[H5006]]

### 4
The wicked, [[H7563]] through the pride [[H1363]] of his countenance, [[H639]] will not [[H1077]] seek [[H1875]] God [[H430]] not [[H369]] in all [[H3605]] his thoughts. [[H4209]]

### 5
His ways [[H1870]] are always [[H6256]] grievous; [[H2342]] thy judgments [[H4941]] far above [[H4791]] out of his sight: [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] his enemies, [[H6887]] he puffeth [[H6315]] at them. [[H6315]]

### 6
He hath said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] I shall not [[H1077]] be moved: [[H4131]] for never [[H1755]] in adversity. [[H7451]]

### 7
His mouth [[H6310]] is full [[H4390]] of cursing [[H423]] and deceit [[H4820]] and fraud: [[H8496]] under [[H8478]] his tongue [[H3956]] mischief [[H5999]] and vanity. [[H205]]

### 8
He sitteth [[H3427]] in the lurking places [[H3993]] of the villages: [[H2691]] in the secret places [[H4565]] doth he murder [[H2026]] the innocent: [[H5355]] his eyes [[H5869]] are privily set [[H6845]] against the poor. [[H2489]]

### 9
He lieth in wait [[H693]] secretly [[H4565]] as a lion [[H738]] in his den: [[H5520]] he lieth in wait [[H693]] to catch [[H2414]] the poor: [[H6041]] he doth catch [[H2414]] the poor, [[H6041]] when he draweth [[H4900]] him into his net. [[H7568]]

### 10
He croucheth, [[H1794]] humbleth [[H7817]] himself, that the poor [[H2489]] may fall [[H5307]] by his strong ones. [[H6099]]

### 11
He hath said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] God [[H410]] hath forgotten: [[H7911]] he hideth [[H5641]] his face; [[H6440]] he will never [[H5331]] see [[H7200]]

### 12
Arise, [[H6965]] O Lord; [[H3068]] O God, [[H410]] lift up [[H5375]] thine hand: [[H3027]] forget [[H7911]] not [[H408]] the humble. [[H6035]]

### 13
Wherefore [[H5921]] doth the wicked [[H7563]] contemn [[H5006]] God? [[H430]] he hath said [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] Thou wilt not [[H3808]] require [[H1875]]

### 14
Thou hast seen [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] beholdest [[H5027]] mischief [[H5999]] and spite, [[H3708]] to requite [[H5414]] with thy hand: [[H3027]] the poor [[H2489]] committeth [[H5800]] himself unto [[H5921]] thee; thou [[H859]] art [[H1961]] the helper [[H5826]] of the fatherless. [[H3490]]

### 15
Break [[H7665]] thou the arm [[H2220]] of the wicked [[H7563]] and the evil [[H7451]] seek out [[H1875]] his wickedness [[H7562]] thou find [[H4672]] none. [[H1077]]

### 16
The Lord [[H3068]] King [[H4428]] for ever [[H5769]] and ever: [[H5703]] the heathen [[H1471]] are perished [[H6]] out of his land. [[H776]]

### 17
Lord, [[H3068]] thou hast heard [[H8085]] the desire [[H8378]] of the humble: [[H6035]] thou wilt prepare [[H3559]] their heart, [[H3820]] thou wilt cause thine ear [[H241]] to hear: [[H7181]]

### 18
To judge [[H8199]] the fatherless [[H3490]] and the oppressed, [[H1790]] that the man [[H376]] of [[H4480]] the earth [[H776]] may no [[H1077]] more [[H3254]] oppress. [[H6206]]
