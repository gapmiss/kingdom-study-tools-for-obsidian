### 1
Judge [[H8199]] me, O God, [[H430]] and plead [[H7378]] my cause [[H7379]] against an ungodly [[H3808]] nation: [[H1471]] O deliver [[H6403]] me from the deceitful [[H4820]] and unjust [[H5766]] man. [[H376]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] thou [[H859]] the God [[H430]] of my strength: [[H4581]] why [[H4100]] dost thou cast me off? [[H2186]] why [[H4100]] go [[H1980]] I mourning [[H6937]] because of the oppression [[H3906]] of the enemy? [[H341]]

### 3
O send out [[H7971]] thy light [[H216]] and thy truth: [[H571]] let them [[H1992]] lead [[H5148]] me; let them bring [[H935]] me unto [[H413]] thy holy [[H6944]] hill, [[H2022]] and to [[H413]] thy tabernacles. [[H4908]]

### 4
Then will I go [[H935]] unto [[H413]] the altar [[H4196]] of God, [[H430]] unto [[H413]] God [[H410]] my exceeding [[H8057]] joy: [[H1524]] yea, upon the harp [[H3658]] will I praise [[H3034]] thee, O God [[H430]] my God. [[H430]]

### 5
Why [[H4100]] art thou cast down, [[H7817]] O my soul? [[H5315]] and why [[H4100]] art thou disquieted [[H1993]] within [[H5921]] me? hope [[H3176]] in God: [[H430]] for [[H3588]] I shall yet [[H5750]] praise [[H3034]] him, the health [[H3444]] of my countenance, [[H6440]] and my God. [[H430]]
