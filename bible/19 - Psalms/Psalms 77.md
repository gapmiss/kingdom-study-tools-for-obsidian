To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] to [[H5921]] Jeduthun, [[H3038]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]]

### 1
I cried [[H6817]] unto [[H413]] God [[H430]] with my voice, [[H6963]] unto [[H413]] God [[H430]] with my voice; [[H6963]] and he gave ear [[H238]] unto [[H413]] me. [[H413]]

### 2
In the day [[H3117]] of my trouble [[H6869]] I sought [[H1875]] the Lord: [[H136]] my sore [[H3027]] ran [[H5064]] in the night, [[H3915]] and ceased [[H6313]] not: [[H3808]] my soul [[H5315]] refused [[H3985]] to be comforted. [[H5162]]

### 3
I remembered [[H2142]] God, [[H430]] and was troubled: [[H1993]] I complained, [[H7878]] and my spirit [[H7307]] was overwhelmed. [[H5848]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 4
Thou holdest [[H270]] mine eyes [[H5869]] waking: [[H8109]] I am so troubled [[H6470]] that I cannot [[H3808]] speak. [[H1696]]

### 5
I have considered [[H2803]] the days [[H3117]] of old, [[H6924]] the years [[H8141]] of ancient times. [[H5769]]

### 6
I call to remembrance [[H2142]] my song [[H5058]] in the night: [[H3915]] I commune [[H7878]] with [[H5973]] mine own heart: [[H3824]] and my spirit [[H7307]] made diligent search. [[H2664]]

### 7
Will the Lord [[H136]] cast off [[H2186]] for ever? [[H5769]] and he be favourable [[H7521]] no [[H3808]] will more? [[H3254]]

### 8
Is his mercy [[H2617]] clean gone [[H656]] for ever? [[H5331]] doth promise [[H562]] fail [[H1584]] for evermore? [[H1755]]

### 9
Hath God [[H410]] forgotten [[H7911]] to be gracious? [[H2589]] hath he in anger [[H639]] shut up [[H7092]] his tender mercies? [[H7356]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 10
And I said, [[H559]] This [[H1931]] my infirmity: [[H2470]] the years [[H8141]] of the right hand [[H3225]] of the most High. [[H5945]]

### 11
I will remember [[H2142]] the works [[H4611]] of the Lord: [[H3050]] surely [[H3588]] I will remember [[H2142]] thy wonders [[H6382]] of old. [[H6924]]

### 12
I will meditate [[H1897]] also of all [[H3605]] thy work, [[H6467]] and talk [[H7878]] of thy doings. [[H5949]]

### 13
Thy way, [[H1870]] O God, [[H430]] in the sanctuary: [[H6944]] who [[H4310]] great [[H1419]] a God [[H410]] as God? [[H430]]

### 14
Thou [[H859]] the God [[H410]] that doest [[H6213]] wonders: [[H6382]] thou hast declared [[H3045]] thy strength [[H5797]] among the people. [[H5971]]

### 15
Thou hast with arm [[H2220]] redeemed [[H1350]] thy people, [[H5971]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and Joseph. [[H3130]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 16
The waters [[H4325]] saw [[H7200]] thee, O God, [[H430]] the waters [[H4325]] saw [[H7200]] thee; they were afraid: [[H2342]] the depths [[H8415]] also [[H637]] were troubled. [[H7264]]

### 17
The clouds [[H5645]] poured out [[H2229]] water: [[H4325]] the skies [[H7834]] sent out [[H5414]] a sound: [[H6963]] thine arrows [[H2687]] also [[H637]] went abroad. [[H1980]]

### 18
The voice [[H6963]] of thy thunder [[H7482]] in the heaven: [[H1534]] the lightnings [[H1300]] lightened [[H215]] the world: [[H8398]] the earth [[H776]] trembled [[H7264]] and shook. [[H7493]]

### 19
Thy way [[H1870]] in the sea, [[H3220]] and thy path [[H7635]] in the great [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] and thy footsteps [[H6119]] are not [[H3808]] known. [[H3045]]

### 20
Thou leddest [[H5148]] thy people [[H5971]] like a flock [[H6629]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron. [[H175]]
