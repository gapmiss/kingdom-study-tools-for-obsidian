### 1
Why [[H4100]] do the heathen [[H1471]] rage, [[H7283]] and the people [[H3816]] imagine [[H1897]] a vain thing? [[H7385]]

### 2
The kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] set themselves, [[H3320]] and the rulers [[H7336]] take counsel [[H3245]] together, [[H3162]] against [[H5921]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and against [[H5921]] his anointed, [[H4899]]

### 3
Let us break asunder, [[H5423]] their bands [[H4147]] and cast away [[H7993]] their cords [[H5688]] from [[H4480]] us. [[H4480]]

### 4
He that sitteth [[H3427]] in the heavens [[H8064]] shall laugh: [[H7832]] the Lord [[H136]] shall have them in derision. [[H3932]]

### 5
Then [[H227]] shall he speak [[H1696]] unto [[H413]] them in his wrath, [[H639]] and vex [[H926]] them in his sore displeasure. [[H2740]]

### 6
Yet have I [[H589]] set [[H5258]] my king [[H4428]] upon [[H5921]] my holy [[H6944]] hill [[H2022]] of Zion. [[H6726]]

### 7
I will declare [[H5608]] the decree: [[H2706]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath said [[H559]] unto [[H413]] me, Thou [[H859]] my Son; [[H1121]] this day [[H3117]] have I [[H589]] begotten [[H3205]] thee. [[H3205]]

### 8
Ask [[H7592]] of [[H4480]] me, and I shall give [[H5414]] the heathen [[H1471]] thine inheritance, [[H5159]] and the uttermost parts [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] thy possession. [[H272]]

### 9
Thou shalt break [[H7489]] them with a rod [[H7626]] of iron; [[H1270]] thou shalt dash them in pieces [[H5310]] like a potter's [[H3335]] vessel. [[H3627]]

### 10
Be wise [[H7919]] now [[H6258]] therefore, O ye kings: [[H4428]] be instructed, [[H3256]] ye judges [[H8199]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 11
Serve [[H5647]] the Lord [[H3068]] with fear, [[H3374]] and rejoice [[H1523]] with trembling. [[H7461]]

### 12
Kiss [[H5401]] the Son, [[H1248]] lest [[H6435]] he be angry, [[H599]] and ye perish [[H6]] the way, [[H1870]] when [[H3588]] his wrath [[H639]] is kindled [[H1197]] but a little. [[H4592]] Blessed [[H835]] all [[H3605]] they that put their trust [[H2620]] in him. [[H2620]]
