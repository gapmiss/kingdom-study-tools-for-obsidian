To the chief Musician, [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] Song [[H7892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 1
Let God [[H430]] arise, [[H6965]] let his enemies [[H341]] be scattered: [[H6327]] let them also that hate [[H8130]] him flee [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 2
As smoke [[H6227]] is driven away, [[H5086]] drive away: [[H5086]] as wax [[H1749]] melteth [[H4549]] before [[H6440]] the fire, [[H784]] let the wicked [[H7563]] perish [[H6]] at the presence [[H6440]] of God. [[H430]]

### 3
But let the righteous [[H6662]] be glad; [[H8055]] let them rejoice [[H5970]] before [[H6440]] God: [[H430]] yea, let them exceedingly [[H8057]] rejoice. [[H7797]]

### 4
Sing [[H7891]] unto God, [[H430]] sing praises [[H2167]] to his name: [[H8034]] extol [[H5549]] him that rideth [[H7392]] upon the heavens [[H6160]] by his name [[H8034]] JAH, [[H3050]] and rejoice [[H5937]] before [[H6440]] him. [[H6440]]

### 5
A father [[H1]] of the fatherless, [[H3490]] and a judge [[H1781]] of the widows, [[H490]] God [[H430]] in his holy [[H6944]] habitation. [[H4583]]

### 6
God [[H430]] setteth [[H3427]] the solitary [[H3173]] in families: [[H1004]] he bringeth out [[H3318]] those which are bound [[H615]] with chains: [[H3574]] but [[H389]] the rebellious [[H5637]] dwell [[H7931]] in a dry [[H6707]]

### 7
O God, [[H430]] when thou wentest forth [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] thy people, [[H5971]] when thou didst march [[H6805]] through the wilderness; [[H3452]] Selah: [[H5542]]

### 8
The earth [[H776]] shook, [[H7493]] the heavens [[H8064]] also [[H637]] dropped [[H5197]] at the presence [[H6440]] of God: [[H430]] Sinai [[H5514]] itself [[H2088]] at the presence [[H6440]] of God, [[H430]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 9
Thou, O God, [[H430]] didst send [[H5130]] a plentiful [[H5071]] rain, [[H1653]] whereby thou [[H859]] didst confirm [[H3559]] thine inheritance, [[H5159]] when it was weary. [[H3811]]

### 10
Thy congregation [[H2416]] hath dwelt [[H3427]] therein: thou, O God, [[H430]] hast prepared [[H3559]] of thy goodness [[H2896]] for the poor. [[H6041]]

### 11
The Lord [[H136]] gave [[H5414]] the word: [[H562]] great [[H7227]] the company [[H6635]] of those that published [[H1319]]

### 12
Kings [[H4428]] of armies [[H6635]] did flee [[H5074]] apace: [[H5074]] and she that tarried [[H5116]] at home [[H1004]] divided [[H2505]] the spoil. [[H7998]]

### 13
Though [[H518]] ye have lien [[H7901]] among [[H996]] the pots, [[H8240]] the wings [[H3671]] of a dove [[H3123]] covered [[H2645]] with silver, [[H3701]] and her feathers [[H84]] with yellow [[H3422]] gold. [[H2742]]

### 14
When the Almighty [[H7706]] scattered [[H6566]] kings [[H4428]] in it, it was as snow [[H7949]] in Salmon. [[H6756]]

### 15
The hill [[H2022]] of God [[H430]] the hill [[H2022]] of Bashan; [[H1316]] an high [[H1386]] hill [[H2022]] the hill [[H2022]] of Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 16
Why [[H4100]] leap [[H7520]] ye, ye high [[H1386]] hills? [[H2022]] the hill [[H2022]] God [[H430]] desireth [[H2530]] to dwell in; [[H3427]] yea, [[H637]] the Lord [[H3068]] will dwell [[H7931]] for ever. [[H5331]]

### 17
The chariots [[H7393]] of God [[H430]] twenty thousand, [[H7239]] thousands [[H505]] of angels: [[H8136]] the Lord [[H136]] among them, Sinai, [[H5514]] in the holy [[H6944]]

### 18
Thou hast ascended [[H5927]] on high, [[H4791]] thou hast led captivity [[H7628]] captive: [[H7617]] thou hast received [[H3947]] gifts [[H4979]] for men; [[H120]] yea, the rebellious [[H5637]] also, [[H637]] that the Lord [[H3050]] God [[H430]] might dwell [[H7931]]

### 19
Blessed [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H136]] daily [[H3117]] loadeth [[H6006]] us the God [[H410]] of our salvation. [[H3444]] Selah. [[H5542]]

### 20
our God [[H410]] the God [[H410]] of salvation; [[H4190]] and unto God [[H3069]] the Lord [[H136]] the issues [[H8444]] from death. [[H4194]]

### 21
But [[H389]] God [[H430]] shall wound [[H4272]] the head [[H7218]] of his enemies, [[H341]] the hairy [[H8181]] scalp [[H6936]] of such an one as goeth on still [[H1980]] in his trespasses. [[H817]]

### 22
The Lord [[H136]] said, [[H559]] I will bring again [[H7725]] from Bashan, [[H1316]] I will bring again [[H7725]] from the depths [[H4688]] of the sea: [[H3220]]

### 23
That [[H4616]] thy foot [[H7272]] may be dipped [[H4272]] in the blood [[H1818]] of enemies, [[H341]] the tongue [[H3956]] of thy dogs [[H3611]] in the same. [[H3611]]

### 24
They have seen [[H7200]] thy goings, [[H1979]] O God; [[H430]] the goings [[H1979]] of my God, [[H410]] my King, [[H4428]] in the sanctuary. [[H6944]]

### 25
The singers [[H7891]] went before, [[H6923]] the players on instruments [[H5059]] after; [[H310]] among [[H8432]] the damsels [[H5959]] playing with timbrels. [[H8608]]

### 26
Bless [[H1288]] ye God [[H430]] in the congregations, [[H4721]] the Lord, [[H136]] from the fountain [[H4726]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
There [[H8033]] little [[H6810]] Benjamin [[H1144]] their ruler, [[H7287]] the princes [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] their council, [[H7277]] the princes [[H8269]] of Zebulun, [[H2074]] the princes [[H8269]] of Naphtali. [[H5321]]

### 28
Thy God [[H430]] hath commanded [[H6680]] thy strength: [[H5797]] strengthen, [[H5810]] O God, [[H430]] that which [[H2098]] thou hast wrought [[H6466]] for us. [[H6466]]

### 29
Because of thy temple [[H1964]] at [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] shall kings [[H4428]] bring [[H2986]] presents [[H7862]] unto thee. [[H7862]]

### 30
Rebuke [[H1605]] the company [[H2416]] of spearmen, [[H7070]] the multitude [[H5712]] of the bulls, [[H47]] with the calves [[H5695]] of the people, [[H5971]] submit himself [[H7511]] with pieces [[H7518]] of silver: [[H3701]] scatter [[H967]] thou the people [[H5971]] delight [[H2654]] in war. [[H7128]]

### 31
Princes [[H2831]] shall come out [[H857]] of [[H4480]] Egypt; [[H4714]] Ethiopia [[H3568]] shall soon stretch out [[H7323]] her hands [[H3027]] unto God. [[H430]]

### 32
Sing [[H7891]] unto God, [[H430]] ye kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth; [[H776]] O sing praises [[H2167]] unto the Lord; [[H136]] Selah: [[H5542]]

### 33
To him that rideth [[H7392]] upon the heavens [[H8064]] of heavens, [[H8064]] of old; [[H6924]] lo, [[H2005]] he doth send out [[H5414]] his voice, [[H6963]] a mighty [[H5797]] voice. [[H6963]]

### 34
Ascribe [[H5414]] ye strength [[H5797]] unto God: [[H430]] his excellency [[H1346]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and his strength [[H5797]] in the clouds. [[H7834]]

### 35
O God, [[H430]] terrible [[H3372]] out of thy holy places: [[H4720]] the God [[H410]] of Israel [[H3478]] he [[H1931]] that giveth [[H5414]] strength [[H5797]] and power [[H8592]] unto people. [[H5971]] Blessed [[H1288]] God. [[H430]]
