A Psalm [[H4210]] of David, [[H1732]] to bring to remembrance. [[H2142]]

### 1
O Lord, [[H3068]] rebuke [[H3198]] me not [[H408]] in thy wrath: [[H7110]] neither chasten [[H3256]] me in thy hot displeasure. [[H2534]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] thine arrows [[H2671]] stick fast [[H5181]] in me, and thy hand [[H3027]] presseth me sore. [[H5181]]

### 3
no [[H369]] soundness [[H4974]] in my flesh [[H1320]] because [[H6440]] of thine anger; [[H2195]] neither [[H369]] rest [[H7965]] in my bones [[H6106]] because [[H6440]] of my sin. [[H2403]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] mine iniquities [[H5771]] are gone over [[H5674]] mine head: [[H7218]] as an heavy [[H3515]] burden [[H4853]] they are too heavy [[H3513]] for [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 5
My wounds [[H2250]] stink [[H887]] are corrupt [[H4743]] because [[H6440]] of my foolishness. [[H200]]

### 6
I am troubled; [[H5753]] I am bowed down [[H7817]] greatly; [[H3966]] I go [[H1980]] mourning [[H6937]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long. [[H3117]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] my loins [[H3689]] are filled [[H4390]] with a loathsome [[H7033]] and no [[H369]] soundness [[H4974]] in my flesh. [[H1320]]

### 8
I am feeble [[H6313]] and sore [[H3966]] broken: [[H1794]] I have roared [[H7580]] by reason of the disquietness [[H5100]] of my heart. [[H3820]]

### 9
Lord, [[H136]] all [[H3605]] my desire [[H8378]] before [[H5048]] thee; and my groaning [[H585]] is not [[H3808]] hid [[H5641]] from [[H4480]] thee. [[H4480]]

### 10
My heart [[H3820]] panteth, [[H5503]] my strength [[H3581]] faileth [[H5800]] me: as for the light [[H216]] of mine eyes, [[H5869]] it [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] is gone [[H369]] from [[H854]] me. [[H854]]

### 11
My lovers [[H157]] and my friends [[H7453]] stand aloof [[H5975]] from [[H5048]] my sore; [[H5061]] and my kinsmen [[H7138]] stand [[H5975]] afar off. [[H7350]]

### 12
They also that seek after [[H1245]] my life [[H5315]] lay snares [[H5367]] and they that seek [[H1875]] my hurt [[H7451]] speak [[H1696]] mischievous things, [[H1942]] and imagine [[H1897]] deceits [[H4820]] all [[H3605]] the day [[H3117]] long. [[H3117]]

### 13
But I, [[H589]] as a deaf [[H2795]] heard [[H8085]] not; [[H3808]] and as a dumb man [[H483]] openeth [[H6605]] not [[H3808]] his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 14
Thus I was [[H1961]] as a man [[H376]] that [[H834]] heareth [[H8085]] not, [[H3808]] and in whose mouth [[H6310]] no [[H369]] reproofs. [[H8433]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] in thee, O Lord, [[H3068]] do I hope: [[H3176]] thou [[H859]] wilt hear, [[H6030]] O Lord [[H136]] my God. [[H430]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] I said, [[H559]] lest [[H6435]] they should rejoice [[H8055]] over me: when my foot [[H7272]] slippeth, [[H4131]] they magnify [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5921]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] ready [[H3559]] to halt, [[H6761]] and my sorrow [[H4341]] continually [[H8548]] before [[H5048]] me. [[H5048]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] I will declare [[H5046]] mine iniquity; [[H5771]] I will be sorry [[H1672]] for my sin. [[H2403]]

### 19
But mine enemies [[H341]] lively, [[H2416]] they are strong: [[H6105]] and they that hate [[H8130]] me wrongfully [[H8267]] are multiplied. [[H7231]]

### 20
They also that render [[H7999]] evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good [[H2896]] are mine adversaries; [[H7853]] because [[H8478]] I follow [[H7291]] good [[H2896]]

### 21
Forsake [[H5800]] me not, [[H408]] O Lord: [[H3068]] O my God, [[H430]] be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from [[H4480]] me. [[H4480]]

### 22
Make haste [[H2363]] to help [[H5833]] me, O Lord [[H136]] my salvation. [[H8668]]
