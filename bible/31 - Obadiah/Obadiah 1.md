### 1
The vision [[H2377]] of Obadiah. [[H5662]] Thus [[H3541]] saith [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H3069]] concerning Edom; [[H123]] We have heard [[H8085]] a rumour [[H8052]] from [[H853]] the Lord, [[H3068]] and an ambassador [[H6735]] is sent [[H7971]] among the heathen, [[H1471]] Arise [[H6965]] ye, and let us rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] her in battle. [[H4421]]

### 2
Behold, [[H2009]] I have made [[H5414]] thee small [[H6996]] among the heathen: [[H1471]] thou [[H859]] art greatly [[H3966]] despised. [[H959]]

### 3
The pride [[H2087]] of thine heart [[H3820]] hath deceived [[H5377]] thee, thou that dwellest [[H7931]] in the clefts [[H2288]] of the rock, [[H5553]] whose habitation [[H7931]] high; [[H4791]] that saith [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] Who [[H4310]] shall bring me down [[H3381]] to the ground? [[H776]]

### 4
Though [[H518]] thou exalt [[H1361]] as the eagle, [[H5404]] and though [[H518]] thou set [[H7760]] thy nest [[H7064]] among [[H996]] the stars, [[H3556]] thence [[H8033]] will I bring thee down, [[H3381]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord. [[H3068]]

### 5
If [[H518]] thieves [[H1590]] came [[H935]] to thee, if [[H518]] robbers [[H7703]] by night, [[H3915]] (how [[H349]] art thou cut off!) [[H1820]] would they not [[H3808]] have stolen [[H1589]] till they had enough? [[H1767]] if [[H518]] the grapegatherers [[H1219]] came [[H935]] to thee, would they not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] grapes? [[H5955]]

### 6
How [[H349]] are of Esau [[H6215]] searched out! [[H2664]] are his hidden things [[H4710]] sought up! [[H1158]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of thy confederacy [[H1285]] have brought [[H7971]] thee to [[H5704]] the border: [[H1366]] the men [[H582]] that were at peace [[H7965]] with thee have deceived [[H5377]] thee, prevailed [[H3201]] against thee; thy bread [[H3899]] have laid [[H7760]] a wound [[H4204]] under [[H8478]] thee: none [[H369]] understanding [[H8394]] in him. [[H8394]]

### 8
Shall I not [[H3808]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] saith [[H5002]] the Lord, [[H3068]] even destroy [[H6]] the wise [[H2450]] out of Edom, [[H123]] and understanding [[H8394]] out of the mount [[H2022]] of Esau? [[H6215]]

### 9
And thy mighty [[H1368]] O Teman, [[H8487]] shall be dismayed, [[H2865]] to the end that [[H4616]] every one [[H376]] of the mount [[H2022]] of Esau [[H6215]] may be cut off [[H3772]] by slaughter. [[H6993]]

### 10
For violence [[H2555]] against thy brother [[H251]] Jacob [[H3290]] shame [[H955]] shall cover [[H3680]] thee, and thou shalt be cut off [[H3772]] for ever. [[H5769]]

### 11
In the day [[H3117]] that thou stoodest [[H5975]] on the other side, [[H5048]] in the day [[H3117]] that the strangers [[H2114]] carried away captive [[H7617]] his forces, [[H2428]] and foreigners [[H5237]] entered into [[H935]] his gates, [[H8179]] and cast [[H3032]] lots [[H1486]] upon [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] even [[H1571]] thou [[H859]] as one [[H259]] of them. [[H259]]

### 12
But thou shouldest not [[H408]] have looked [[H7200]] on the day [[H3117]] of thy brother [[H251]] in the day [[H3117]] that he became a stranger; [[H5237]] neither [[H408]] shouldest thou have rejoiced [[H8055]] over the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] in the day [[H3117]] of their destruction; [[H6]] neither [[H408]] shouldest thou have spoken [[H6310]] proudly [[H1431]] in the day [[H3117]] of distress. [[H6869]]

### 13
Thou shouldest not [[H408]] have entered [[H935]] into the gate [[H8179]] of my people [[H5971]] in the day [[H3117]] of their calamity; [[H343]] yea, [[H1571]] thou [[H859]] shouldest not [[H408]] have looked [[H7200]] on their affliction [[H7451]] in the day [[H3117]] of their calamity, [[H343]] nor [[H408]] have laid [[H7971]] on their substance [[H2428]] in the day [[H3117]] of their calamity; [[H343]]

### 14
Neither [[H408]] shouldest thou have stood [[H5975]] in [[H5921]] the crossway, [[H6563]] to cut off [[H3772]] those of his that did escape; [[H6412]] neither [[H408]] shouldest thou have delivered up [[H5462]] those of his that did remain [[H8300]] in the day [[H3117]] of distress. [[H6869]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] the day [[H3117]] of the Lord [[H3068]] near [[H7138]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the heathen: [[H1471]] as [[H834]] thou hast done, [[H6213]] it shall be done [[H6213]] unto thee: thy reward [[H1576]] shall return [[H7725]] upon thine own head. [[H7218]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] as [[H834]] ye have drunk [[H8354]] upon [[H5921]] my holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] shall all [[H3605]] the heathen [[H1471]] drink [[H8354]] continually, [[H8548]] yea, they shall drink, [[H8354]] and they shall swallow down, [[H3886]] and they shall be [[H1961]] as though they had not [[H3808]] been. [[H3808]]

### 17
But upon mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] shall be [[H1961]] deliverance, [[H6413]] and there shall be [[H1961]] holiness; [[H6944]] and the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] shall possess [[H3423]] their possessions. [[H4180]]

### 18
And the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] shall be [[H1961]] a fire, [[H784]] and the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] a flame, [[H3852]] and the house [[H1004]] of Esau [[H6215]] for stubble, [[H7179]] and they shall kindle [[H1814]] in them, and devour [[H398]] them; and there shall not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] remaining [[H8300]] of the house [[H1004]] of Esau; [[H6215]] for [[H3588]] the Lord [[H3068]] hath spoken [[H1696]]

### 19
And the south [[H5045]] shall possess [[H3423]] the mount [[H2022]] of Esau; [[H6215]] and the plain [[H8219]] the Philistines: [[H6430]] and they shall possess [[H3423]] the fields [[H7704]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and the fields [[H7704]] of Samaria: [[H8111]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 20
And the captivity [[H1546]] of this [[H2088]] host [[H2426]] of the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] that [[H834]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] unto [[H5704]] Zarephath; [[H6886]] and the captivity [[H1546]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] which [[H834]] in Sepharad, [[H5614]] shall possess [[H3423]] the cities [[H5892]] of the south. [[H5045]]

### 21
And saviours [[H3467]] shall come up [[H5927]] on mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] to judge [[H8199]]  the [[H853]] mount [[H2022]] of Esau; [[H6215]] and the kingdom [[H4410]] shall be [[H1961]] the Lord's. [[H3068]]
