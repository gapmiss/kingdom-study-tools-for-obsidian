# Fulsome

**FUL'SOME**, _adjective_

**1.** Nauseous; offensive.

He that brings _fulsome_ objects to my view, with nauseous images my fancy fills.

**2.** Rank; offensive to the smell; as a rank and _fulsome_ smell.

**3.** Lustful; as _fulsome_ ewes.

**4.** Tending to obscenity; as a _fulsome_ epigram.

These are the English definitions of _fulsome_ but I have never witnessed such applications of the word in the United States. It seems then that full and foul are radically the same word, the primary sense of which is stuffed, crowded, from the sense of putting on or in. In the United States, the compound fullsome takes its signification from full, in the sense of cloying or satiating, and in England, _fulsome_ takes its predominant sense from foulness.
