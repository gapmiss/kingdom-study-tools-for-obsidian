# Forest

**FOR'EST**, _noun_ \[Latin foris.\]

**1.** An extensive wood, or a large tract of land covered with trees. In America, the word is usually applied to a wood of native growth, or a tract of woodland which has never been cultivated. It differs from wood or woods chiefly in extent. We read of the Hercynian _forest_ in Germany, and the _forest_ of Ardennes, in France or Gaul.

**2.** In law, in Great Britain, a certain territory of woody grounds and pastures, privileged for wild beasts and fowls of _forest_ chase and warren, to rest and abide in, under the protection of the king, for his pleasure. In this sense, the word has no application in America.

Forest laws, laws for governing and regulating forests, and preserving game.

**FOR'EST**, _verb transitive_ To cover with trees or wood.
