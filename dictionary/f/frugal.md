# Frugal

**FRU'GAL**, _adjective_ \[Latin frugalis. See [[Fruit]].\]

Economical in the use or appropriation of money, goods or provisions of any kind; saving unnecessary expense, either of money or of any thing else which is to be used or consumed; sparing; not profuse, prodigal or lavish. We ought to be _frugal_ not only in the expenditure of money and of goods, but in the employment of time. It is followed by of, before the thing saved; as _frugal_ of time. It is not synonymous with parsimonious, nor with thrifty, as now used.
