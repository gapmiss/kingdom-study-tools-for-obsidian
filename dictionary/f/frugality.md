# Frugality

**FRUGAL'ITY**, _noun_

**1.** Prudent economy; good husbandry or housewifery; a sparing use or appropriation of money or commodities; a judicious use of any thing to be expended or employed; that careful management of money or goods which expends nothing unnecessarily, and applies what is used to a profitable purpose; that use in which nothing is wasted. It is not equivalent to parsimony, the latter being an excess of _frugality_ and a fault. _frugality_ is always a virtue. Nor is it synonymous with thrift, in its proper sense; for thrift is the effect of _frugality_

Without _frugality_ none can become rich, and with it few would be poor.

**2.** A prudent and sparing use or appropriation of any thing; as _frugality_ of praise.
