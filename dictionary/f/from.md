# From

**FROM**, _preposition_

The sense of _from_ may be expressed by the noun distance, or by the adjective distant, or by the participles, departing, removing to a distance. Thus it is one hundred miles _from_ Boston to Hartford. He took his sword _from_ his side. Light proceeds _from_ the sun. Water issues _from_ the earth in springs. Separate the coarse wool _from_ the fine. Men have all sprung _from_ Adam. Men often go _from_ good to bad, and _from_ bad to worse. The merit of an action depends on the principle _from_ which it proceeds. Men judge of facts _from_ personal knowledge, or _from_ testimony. We should aim to judge _from_ undeniable premises.

The sense of _from_ is literal or figurative, but it is uniformly the same.

In certain phrases, generally or always elliptical, _from_ is followed by certain adverbs, denoting place, region or position, indefinitely, no precise point being expressed; as,

**FROM** above, _from_ the upper regions.

**FROM** afar, _from_ a distance.

**FROM** beneath, _from_ a place or region below.

**FROM** far, _from_ a distant place.

**FROM** high, _from_ on high, _from_ a high place, _from_ an upper region, or _from_ heaven.
