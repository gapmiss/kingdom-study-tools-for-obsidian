# Friendship

**FRIEND'SHIP**, _noun_ frend'ship.

**1.** An attachment to a person, proceeding from intimate acquaintance, and a reciprocation of kind offices, or from a favorable opinion of the amiable and respectable qualities of his mind. _friendship_ differs from benevolence, which is good will to mankind in general, and from that love which springs from animal appetite. True _friendship_ is a noble and virtuous attachment, springing from a pure source, a respect for worth or amiable qualities. False _friendship_ may subsist between bad men, as between thieves and pirates. This is a temporary attachment springing from interest, and may change in a moment to enmity and rancor.

There can be no _friendship_ without confidence, and no confidence without integrity.

There is little _friendship_ in the world.

The first law of _friendship_ is sincerity.

**2.** Mutual attachment; intimacy.

If not in _friendship_ live at least in peace.

**3.** Favor; personal kindness.

His friendships, still a few confined, were always of the middling kind.

**4.** Friendly aid; help; assistance.

**5.** Conformity; affinity; correspondence; aptness to unite.

We know those colors which have a _friendship_ with each other.
