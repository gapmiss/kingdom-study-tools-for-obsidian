# Floscular

**FLOS'CULAR**,

FLOS'CULE, _noun_ \[Latin flosculus.\] In botany, a partial or lesser floret of an aggregate flower.

**FLOS FERRI**, _noun_ \[Latin flower of iron.\] A mineral, a variety of arragonite, called by Jameson, after Hauy, coralloidal arragonite. It occurs in little cylinders, sometimes diverging and ending in a point, and sometimes branched, like coral. Its structure is fibrous, and the surface, which is smooth, or garnished with little crystalline points, is often very white, with a silken luster. It takes this name from its being often found in cavities in veins of sparry iron.
