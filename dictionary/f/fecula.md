# Fecula

**FEC'ULA**, _noun_

**1.** The green matter of plants; chlorophyll.

**2.** Starch or farina; called also amylaceous _fecula_

This term is applied to any pulverulent matter obtained from plants by simply breaking down the texture, washing with water, and subsidence. Hence its application to starch and the green _fecula_ though entirely different in chimical properties.
