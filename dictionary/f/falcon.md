# Falcon

**FAL'CON**, _noun_ Sometimes _pronoun_ fawcon. \[Latin falco, a hawk. The _falcon_ is probably so named from its curving beak or talons.\]

**1.** A hawk; but appropriately, a hawk trained to sport, as in falconry, which see. It is said that this name is, by sportsmen, given to the female alone; for the male is smaller, weaker and less courageous, and is therefore called tircelet or tarsel.

This term, in ornithology, is applied to a division of the genus Falco, with a short hooked beak and very long wings, the strongest armed and most courageous species, and therefore used in falconry.

**2.** A sort of cannon, whose diameter at the bore is five inches and a quarter, and carrying shot of two pounds and a half.
