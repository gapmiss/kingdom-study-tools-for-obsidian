# Fright

**FRIGHT**, _noun_ frite. \[Gr. to fear, that is, to shrink or shiver.\]

Sudden and violent fear; terror; a passion excited by the sudden appearance of danger. It expresses more than fear, and is distinguished from fear and dread, by its sudden invasion and temporary existence; _fright_ being usually of short duration, whereas fear and dread may be long continued.
