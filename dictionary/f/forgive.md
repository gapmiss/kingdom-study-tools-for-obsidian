# Forgive

**FORGIVE**, _verb transitive_ forgiv'. _preterit tense_ forgave; _participle passive_ forgiven. \[Latin remitto. See [[Give]].\]

**1.** To pardon; to remit, as an offense or debt; to overlook an offense, and treat the offender as not guilty. The original and proper phrase is to _forgive_ the offense, to send it away, to reject it, that is, not to impute it, \[put it to\] the offender. But by an easy transition, we also use the phrase, to _forgive_ the person offending.

**FORGIVE** us our debts.

If we _forgive_ men their trespasses, your heavenly father will also _forgive_ you. [[Matthew 6#12|Matthew 6:12]].

As savages never forget a favor, so they never _forgive_ an injury.

It is to be noted that pardon, like _forgive_ may be followed by the name or person, and by the offense; but remit can be followed by the offense only. We _forgive_ or pardon the man, but we do not remit him.

**2.** To remit as a debt, fine or penalty.
