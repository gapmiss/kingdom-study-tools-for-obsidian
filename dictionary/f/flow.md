# Flow

**FLOW**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin fluo, contracted from fugo, for it forms fluri, fuctum. In one case, the word would agree with the root of blow, Latin flo; in the other, with the root of fly.\]

**1.** To move along an inclined plane, or on descending ground, by the operation of gravity, and with a continual change of place among the particles or parts, as a fluid. A solid body descends or moves in mass, as a ball or a wheel; but in the flowing of liquid substances, and others consisting of very fine particles, there is a constant change of the relative position of some parts of the substance, as in the case with a stream of water, of quicksilver, and of sand. Particles at the bottom and sides of the stream, being somewhat checked by friction, move slower than those in the middle and near the surface of the current. Rivers _flow_ from springs and lakes; tears _flow_ from the eyes.
