# Fealty

**FE'ALTY**, _noun_ \[Latin fidelis.\]

Fidelity to a lord; faithful adherence of a tenant or vassal to the superior of whom he holds his lands; loyalty. Under the feudal system of tenures, every vassal or tenant was bound to be true and faithful to his lord, and to defend him against all his enemies. This obligation was called his fidelity or _fealty_ and an oath of _fealty_ was required to be taken by all tenants to their landlords. The tenant was called a liege man; the land, a liege fee; and the superior, liege lord. \[See [[Liege]].\]
