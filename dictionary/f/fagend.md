# Fagend

**FAGEND**', _noun_ \[fag and end. See [[Fag]], _verb intransitive_ supra.\]

**1.** The end of a web of cloth, generally of coarser materials.

**2.** The refuse or meaner part of any thing.

**3.** Among seamen, the untwisted end of a rope; hence, to fag out, is to become untwisted and loose.

We observe that the use of this word among seamen leads to the true sense of the verb, as well as the noun. The sense is, to open by receding, or to yield and become lax, and hence weak.
