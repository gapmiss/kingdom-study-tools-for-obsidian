# Felony

**FEL'ONY**, _noun_ \[See [[Felon]].\] In common law, any crime which incurs the forfeiture of lands or goods. Treason was formerly comprised under the name of _felony_ but is now distinguished from crimes thus denominated, although it is really a _felony_ All offenses punishable with death are felonies; and so are some crimes not thus punished, as suicide, homicide by chance-medley, or in self-defense, and petty larceny. Capital punishment therefore does not necessarily enter into the true idea or definition of felony; the true criterion of _felony_ being forfeiture of lands or goods. But the idea of _felony_ has been so generally connected with that of capital punishment, that law and usage now confirm that connection. Thus if a statute makes any new offense a _felony_ it is understood to mean a crime punishable with death.
