# Facility

**FACIL'ITY**, _noun_ \[Latin facilitas, from facilis, easy.\]

**1.** Easiness to be performed; freedom from difficulty; ease. He performed the work or operation with great _facility_

Though _facility_ and hope of success might invite some other choice.

**2.** Ease of performance; readiness proceeding from skill or use; dexterity. Practice gives a wonderful _facility_ in executing works of art.

**3.** Pliancy; ductility; easiness to be persuaded; readiness of compliance, usually in a bad sense, implying a disposition to yield to solicitations to evil.

It is a great error to take _facility_ for good nature: tenderness without discretion, is no better than a more pardonable folly.

**4.** Easiness of access; complaisance; condescension; affability.

He offers himself to the visits of a friend with _facility_
