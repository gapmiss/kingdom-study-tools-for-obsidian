# February

**FEB'RUARY**, _noun_ \[Latin Februarius. The Latin word is said to be named from februo, to purify by sacrifice, and thus to signify the month of purification, as the people were, in this month, purified by sacrifices and oblations. The word februo is said to be a Sabine word, connected with ferveo, ferbeo, to boil, as boiling was used in purifications.

This practice bears a resemblance to that of making atonement among the Jews; but the connection between ferveo and _february_ is doubtful.

The name of the second month in the year, introduced into the Roman calendar by Numa. In common years, this month contains 28 days; in the bissextile or leap year, 29 days.
