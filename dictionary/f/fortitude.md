# Fortitude

**FOR'TITUDE**, _noun_ \[Latin fortitudo, from fortis, strong.\]

That strength or firmness of mind or soul which enables a person to encounter danger with coolness and courage, or to bear pain or adversity without murmuring, depression or despondency. _fortitude_ is the basis or source of genuine courage or intrepidity in danger, of patience in suffering, of forbearance under injuries, and of magnanimity in all conditions of life. We sometimes confound the effect with the cause, and use _fortitude_ as synonymous with courage or patience; but courage is an active virtue or vice, and patience is the effect of _fortitude_

Fortitude is the guard and support of the other virtues.
