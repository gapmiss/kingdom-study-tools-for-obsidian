# Fowl

**FOWL**, _noun_ \[Latin fugio, fugo, Gr. and signifying the flying animal.\]

A flying or winged animal; the generic name of certain animals that move through the air by the aid of wings. Fowls have two feet, are covered with feathers, and have wings for flight. Bird is a young _fowl_ or chicken, and may well be applied to the smaller species of fowls. But it has usurped the place of _fowl_ and is used improperly as the generic term.

**FOWL** is used as a collective noun. We dined on fish and _fowl_

Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the _fowl_ of the air. [[Genesis 1#20|Genesis 1:20]].

But this use in America is not frequent. We generally use the plural, fowls. The word is colloquially used for poultry, or rather, in a more limited sense, for barn door fowls.

**FOWL**, _verb intransitive_ To catch or kill wild fowls for game or food; as by means of bird-lime, decoys, nets and snares, or by pursuing them with hawks, or by shooting.
