# Fortuitous

**FORTU'ITOUS**, _adjective_ \[Latin fortuitus, from the root of fors, forte, fortuna. The primary sense is to come, to fall, to happen. See [[Fare]].\]

Accidental; casual; happening by chance; coming or occurring unexpectedly, or without any known cause. We speak of _fortuitous_ events, when they occur without our foreseeing or expecting them, and of a _fortuitous_ concourse of atoms, when we suppose the concourse not to result from the design and power of a controlling agent. But an event cannot be in fact _fortuitous_ \[See Accidental and Casual.\]
