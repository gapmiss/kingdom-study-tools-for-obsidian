# Farthing

**F'ARTHING**, _noun_

**1.** The fourth of a penny; a small copper coin of Great Britain, being the fourth of a penny in value. In America we have no coin of this kind. We however use the word to denote the fourth part of a penny in value, but the penny is of different value from the English penny, and different in different states. It is becoming obsolete, with the old denominations of money.

**2.** Farthings, in the plural, copper coin.

**3.** Very small price or value. It is not worth a _farthing_ that is, it is of very little worth, or worth nothing.

**4.** A division of land. \[Not now used.\]

Thirty acres make a farthing-land; nine farthings a Cornish acre; and four Cornish acres a knight's fee.
