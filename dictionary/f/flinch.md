# Flinch

**FLINCH**, _verb intransitive_ \[I have not found this word in any other language; but the sense of it occurs in blench, and not improbably it is from the same root, with a different prefix.\]

**1.** To shrink; to withdraw from any suffering or undertaking, from pain or danger; to fail of proceeding, or of performing any thing. Never _flinch_ from duty. One of the parties flinched from the combat.

A child, by a constant course of kindness, may be accustomed to bear very rough usage without flinching or complaining.

**2.** To fail.
