# Fin

**FIN**, _noun_ \[Latin pinna or penna. The sense is probably a shoot, or it is from diminishing. See [[Fine]].\]

The _fin_ of a fish consists of a membrane supported by rays, or little bony or cartilaginous ossicles. The fins of fish serve to keep their bodies upright, and to prevent wavering or vacillation. The fins, except the caudal, do not assist in progressive motion; the tail being the instrument of swimming.

**FIN**, _verb transitive_ To carve or cut up a chub.
