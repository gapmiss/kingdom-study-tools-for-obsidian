# Form

**FORM**, _noun_ \[Latin forma.\]

**1.** The shape or external appearance of a body; the figure, as defined by lines and angles; that manner of being peculiar to each body, which exhibits it to the eye as distinct from every other body. Thus we speak of the _form_ of a circle, the _form_ of a square or triangle, a circular _form_ the _form_ of the head or of the human body, a handsome _form_ an ugly _form_ a frightful _form_

Matter is the basis or substratum of bodies, _form_ is the particular disposition of matter in each body which distinguishes its appearance from that of every other body.
