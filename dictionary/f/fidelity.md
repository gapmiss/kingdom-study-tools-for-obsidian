# Fidelity

**FIDEL'ITY**, _noun_ \[Latin fidelitas, from fides, faith, fido, to trust. See [[Faith]].\]

**1.** Faithfulness; careful and exact observance of duty, or performance of obligations. We expect _fidelity_ in a public minister, in an agent or trustee, in a domestic servant, in a friend.

The best security for the _fidelity_ of men, is to make interest coincide with duty.

**2.** Firm adherence to a person or party with which one is united, or to which one is bound; loyalty; as the _fidelity_ of subjects to their king or government; the _fidelity_ of a tenant or liege to his lord.

**3.** Observance of the marriage covenant; as the _fidelity_ of a husband or wife.

**4.** Honesty; veracity; adherence to truth; as the _fidelity_ of a witness.
