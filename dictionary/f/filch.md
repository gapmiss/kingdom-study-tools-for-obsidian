# Filch

**FILCH**, _verb transitive_ \[This word, like pilfer, is probably from the root of file, or peel, to strip or rub off. But I know not from what source we have received it.\]

To steal something of little value; to pilfer; to steal; to pillage; to take wrongfully from another.

Fain would they _filch_ that little food away.

But he that filches from me my good name,

Robs me of that which not enriches him,

And makes me poor indeed.
