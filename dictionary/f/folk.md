# Folk

**FOLK**, _noun_ foke. \[Latin vulgus. The sense is a crowd, from collecting or pressing, not from following, but from the same root, as to follow is to press toward. Gr. Originally and properly it had no plural, being a collective noun; but in modern use, in America, it has lost its singular number, and we hear it only in the plural. It is a colloquial word, not admissible into elegant style.\]

**1.** People in general, or any part of them without distinction. What do folks say respecting the war? Men love to talk about the affairs of other folks.

**2.** Certain people, discriminated from others; as old folks, and young folks. Children sometimes call their parents, the old folks. So we say sick folks; poor folks; proud folks.

**3.** In scripture, the singular number is used; as a few sick folk; impotent _folk_ [[Mark 6#5|Mark 6:5]]. [[John 5#3|John 5:3]].

**4.** Animals.

The coneys are but a feeble _folk_ [[Proverbs 30#26|Proverbs 30:26]].
