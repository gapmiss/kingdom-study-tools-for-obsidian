# Farewell

**FA'REWELL**, a compound of fare, in the imperative, and well. Go well; originally applied to a person departing, but by custom now applied both to those who depart and those who remain. It expresses a kind wish, a wish of happiness to those who leave or those who are left.

The verb and adverb are often separated by the pronoun; fare you well; I wish you a happy departure; may you be well in your absence.

It is sometimes an expression of separation only. _farewell_ the year; _farewell_ ye sweet groves; that is, I take my leave of you.

**FA'REWELL**, _noun_

**1.** A wish of happiness or welfare at parting; the parting compliment; adieu.

**2.** Leave; act of departure.

And takes her _farewell_ of the glorious sun.

Before I take my _farewell_ of the subject.
