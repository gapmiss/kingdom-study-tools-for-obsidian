# Ye

**YE**, _pronoun_ The nominative plural of the second person, of which thou is the singular. But the two words have no radical connection. _ye_ is now used only in the sacred and solemn style. In common discourse and writing, you is exclusively used.

But _ye_ are washed, but _ye_ are sanctified. [[1 Corinthians 6#2|1 Corinthians 6:2]].
