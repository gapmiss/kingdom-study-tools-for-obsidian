# You

**YOU**, _pronoun_ Yu. \[You has been considered as in the plural only, and is so treated in the Saxon grammar. But from the Belgic dialect, it appears to be in the singular as well as the plural, and our universal popular usage, in applying it to a single person with a verb in the singular number, is correct. Yourself is in the singular number.\]

**1.** The pronoun of the second person, in the nominative or objective case. In familiar language, it is applied to an individual, as thou is in the solemn style. In the plural, it is used in the solemn style in the objective case.

In vain _you_ tell your parting lover, _you_ wish fair winds may waft him over.

He that despiseth _you_ despiseth me. [[Luke 10#3|Luke 10:3]].

**2.** _you_ is used, like on in French, for any one. This at a distance looks like a rock; but as _you_ approach it, _you_ see a little cabin.
