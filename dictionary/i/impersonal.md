# Impersonal

**IMPER'SONAL**, _adjective_ \[Latin impersonalis; in and personalis, from persona. See [[Person]].\]

In grammar, an _impersonal_ verb is one which is not employed with the first and second persons, I and thou or you, we and ye, for nominatives, and which has no variation of ending to express them, but is used only with the termination of the third person singular, with it for a nominative in English, and without a nominative in Latin; as, it rains, it becomes us to be modest; Latin toedet; libet; pugnatur.
