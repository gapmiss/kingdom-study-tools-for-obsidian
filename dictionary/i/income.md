# Income

**IN'COME**, _noun_ in'cum. \[in and come.\] That gain which proceeds from labor, business or property of any kind; the produce of a farm; the rent of houses; the proceeds of professional business; the profits of commerce or of occupation; the interest of money or stock in funds. _income_ is often used synonymously with revenue, but _income_ is more generally applied to the gain of private persons, and revenue to that of a sovereign or of a state. We speak of the annual _income_ of a gentleman, and the annual revenue of the state.

**1.** A coming in; admission; introduction. \[Not in use.\]
