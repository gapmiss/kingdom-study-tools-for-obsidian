# Integrity

**INTEG'RITY**, _noun_ \[Latin integritas, from integer.\]

**1.** Wholeness; entireness; unbroken state. The constitution of the U.States guaranties to each state the _integrity_ of its territories. The contracting parties guarantied the _integrity_ of the empire.

**2.** The entire, unimpaired state of any thing, particularly of the mind; moral soundness or purity; incorruptness; uprightness; honesty. _integrity_ comprehends the whole moral character, but has a special reference to uprightness in mutual dealings, transfers of property, and agencies for others.

The moral grandeur of independent _integrity_ is the sublimest thing in nature, before which the pomp of eastern magnificence and the splendor of conquest are odious as well as perishable.

**3.** Purity; genuine, unadulterated, unimpaired state; as the _integrity_ of language.
