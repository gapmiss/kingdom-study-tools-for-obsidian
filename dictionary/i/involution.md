# Involution

**INVOLU'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin involutio. See [[Involve]].\]

**1.** The action of involving or infolding.

**2.** The state of being entangled or involved; complication.

All things are mixed and causes blended by mutual involutions.

**3.** In grammar, the insertion of one or more clauses or members of a sentence between the agent or subject and the verb; a third intervening member within a second, etc.; as, habitual falsehood, if we may judge from experience, infers absolute depravity.

**4.** In algebra, the raising of a quantity from its root to any power assigned. Thus 2x2x2=8. Here 8, the third power of 2, is found in _involution_ or multiplying the number into itself, and the product by the same number.
