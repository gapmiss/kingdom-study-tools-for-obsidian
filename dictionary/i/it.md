# It

**IT**, _pronoun_ \[Latin id.\]

**1.** A substitute or pronoun of the neuter gender, sometimes called demonstrative, and standing for any thing except males and females, 'Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of _it_ are the issues of life.' [[Proverbs 9#12|Proverbs 9:12]]. Here _it_ is the substitute for heart.

**2.** _it_ is much used as the nominative case or word to verbs called impersonal; as _it_ rains; _it_ snows. In this case, there is no determinate thing to which _it_ can be referred.

In other cases, _it_ may be referred to matter, affair, or some other word. Is _it_ come to this?

**3.** Very often, _it_ is used to introduce a sentence, preceding a verb as a nominative, but referring to a clause or distinct member of the sentence. 'It is well ascertained, that the figure of the earth is an oblate spheroid.' What is well ascertained?

The answer will show:the figure of the earth is an oblate spheroid; _it_ \[that\] is well ascertained. Here _it_ represents the clause of the sentence, 'the figure of the earth, ' etc. If the order of the sentence is inverted, the use of _it_ is superseded. The figure of the earth is an oblate spheroid; that is well ascertained.

**IT**, like that, is often a substitute for a sentence or clause of a sentence.

**4.** _it_ often begins a sentence, when a personal pronoun, or the name of a person, or a masculine noun follows. _it_ is I:be not afraid. _it_ was Judas who betrayed Christ. When a question is asked, _it_ follows the verb; as, who was _it_ that betrayed Christ?

**5.** _it_ is used also for the state of a person or affair.

How is _it_ with our general?

**6.** _it_ is used after intransitive verbs very indefinitely and sometimes ludicrously, but rarely in an elevated style.

If Abraham brought all with him, _it_ is not probable he meant to walk _it_ back for his pleasure.

The Lacedemonians, at the straits of Thermopylae, when their arms failed them, fought _it_ out with nails and teeth.

Whether the charmer sinner _it_ or saint _it_
