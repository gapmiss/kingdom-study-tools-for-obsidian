# Iceberg

**ICEBERG**, _noun_ \[ice and a hill.\] A hill or mountain of ice, or a vast body of ice accumulated in valleys in high northern latitudes.

This term is applied to such elevated masses as exist in the valleys of the frigid zones; to those which are found on the surface of fixed ice; and to ice of great thickness and highth in a floating state. These lofty floating masses are sometimes detached from the icebergs on shore, and sometimes formed at a distance from any land. They are found in both the frigid zones, and are sometimes carried towards the equator as low as 40 degrees.
