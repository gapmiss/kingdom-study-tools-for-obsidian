Insolvent law, or act of insolvency, a law which liberates a debtor from imprisonment, or exempts him from liability to arrest and imprisonment on account of any debt previously contracted. These terms may be considered as generic, comprehending also bankrupt laws, which protect a man's future acquisitions from his creditors. But in a limited sense, as the words are now generally used, an _insolvent_ law extends only to protect the person of the debtor form imprisonment on account of debts previously contracted.
