# Invective

**INVEC'TIVE**, _noun_ \[Latin inveho. See [[Inveigh]].\] A railing speech or expression; something uttered or written, intended to cast opprobrium, censure or reproach on another; a harsh or reproachful accusation. It differs from reproof, as the latter may come from a friend and be intended to the good of the person reproved; but _invective_ proceeds from an enemy, and is intended to give pain or to injure.

**INVEC'TIVE**, _adjective_ Satirical; abusive; railing.
