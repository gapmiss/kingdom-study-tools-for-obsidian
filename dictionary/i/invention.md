# Invention

**INVEN'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin inventio.\]

**1.** The action or operation of finding out something new; the contrivance of that which did not before exist; as the _invention_ of logarithms; the _invention_ of the art of printing; the _invention_ of the orrery. _invention_ differs from discovery. _invention_ is applied to the contrivance and production of something that did not before exist. Discovery brings to light that which existed before, but which was not know. We are indebted to _invention_ for the thermometer and barometer. We are indebted to discovery for the knowledge of the isles in the Pacific ocean, and for the knowledge of galvanism, and many species of earth not formerly known. This distinction is important, though not always observed.

**2.** That which is invented. The cotton gin is the _invention_ of Whitney; the steam boat is the _invention_ of Fulton. The Doric, Ionic and Corinthian orders are said to be inventions of the Greeks; the Tuscan and Composite are inventions of the Latins.

**3.** Forgery; fiction. Fables are the inventions of ingenious men.

**4.** In painting, the finding or choice of the objects which are to enter into the composition of the piece.

**5.** In poetry, it is applied to whatever the poet adds to the history of the subject.

**6.** In rhetoric, the finding and selecting of arguments to prove and illustrate the point in view.

**7.** The power of inventing; that skill or ingenuity which is or may be employed in contriving any thing new. Thus we say, a man of _invention_

**8.** Discovery; the finding of things hidden or before unknown. \[Less proper.\]
