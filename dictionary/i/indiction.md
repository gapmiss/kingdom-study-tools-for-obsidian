# Indiction

**INDIC'TION**, _noun_ \[Low Latin indictio, indico.\]

**1.** Declaration; proclamation.

**2.** In chronology, a cycle of fifteen years, instituted by Constantine the Great; originally, a period of taxation. Constantine having reduced the time which the Romans were obliged to serve in the army to fifteen years, imposed a tax or tribute at the end of that term, to pay the troops discharged. This practice introduced the keeping of accounts by this period. But, as it is said, in honor of the great victory of Constantine over Mezentius, Sep. 24, _adjective_ D. 312, by which christianity was more effectually established, the council of Nice ordained that accounts of years should no longer be kept by Olympiads, but that the _indiction_ should be used as the point from which to reckon and date years. This was begun Jan.1, _adjective_ D. 313.
