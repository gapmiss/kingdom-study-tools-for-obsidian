# Implicit

**IMPLIC'IT**, _adjective_ \[Latin implicitus, from implico, supra.\]

**1.** Infolded; entangled; complicated.

In his woolly fleece

I cling _implicit_ \[Little used.\]

**2.** Implied; tacitly comprised; fairly to be understood, though not expressed in words; as an _implicit_ contract or agreement.

**3.** Resting on another; trusting to the word or authority of another, without doubting or reserve, or without examining into the truth of the thing itself. Thus we give _implicit_ credit or confidence to the declarations of a person of known veracity. We receive with _implicit_ faith whatever God has clearly revealed.
