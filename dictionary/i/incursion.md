# Incursion

**INCUR'SION**, _noun_ \[Latin incursio, from incurro. See [[Incur]].\]

**1.** Literally, a running into; hence, an entering into a territory with hostile intention; an inroad; applied to the expeditions of small parties or detachments of an enemy's army, entering a territory for attack, plunder or destruction of a post or magazine. Hence it differs from invasion, which is the hostile entrance of any army for conquest. During the revolution, the British troops made an _incursion_ to Danbury, and destroyed the magazines. In opposing this _incursion_ Gen. Wooster was killed.

**2.** Attack; occurrence; as sins of daily _incursion_ \[Unusual.\]
