# Incision

**INCIS'ION**, _noun_ s as z. \[Latin incisio, from incido, to cut.\]

**1.** A cutting; the act of cutting into a substance.

**2.** A cut; a gash; the separation of the surface of any substance made by a sharp instrument. The surgeon with his knife makes an _incision_ in the flesh, and the gardener, in a tree; but we do not say, an _incision_ is made with a plow or a spade; at least such phraseology is unusual.

**3.** Separation of viscid matter by medicines.
