# Immemorial

**IMMEMO'RIAL**, _adjective_ \[Latin in and memor, memoria.\]

Beyond memory; an epithet given to time or duration, etc., whose beginning is not remembered, or cannot be traced and ascertained; as when it is said a man has possessed an estate in fee from time _immemorial_ or time out of mind. Such possession constitutes prescription, or prescriptive right. So we speak of _immemorial_ use, custom or practice. In England, a thing is said to be _immemorial_ when it commenced before the reign of Edward II.
