# Idiotism

**ID'IOTISM**, _noun_ \[Gr. a form of speech taken from the vulgar.\]

**1.** An idiom; a peculiarity of expression; a mode of expression peculiar to a language; a peculiarity in the structure of words and phrases.

Scholars sometimes give terminations and idiotisms suitable to their native language, to words newly invented.

**2.** Idiocy.

But it would be well to restrain this word to its proper signification, and keep idiocy and _idiotism_ distinct.
