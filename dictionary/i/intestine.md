# Intestine

**INTEST'INE**, _adjective_ \[Latin intestinus, from intus, within.\]

**1.** Internal; inward; opposed to external; applied to the human or other animal body; as an _intestine_ disease.

**2.** Internal with regard to a state or country; domestic, not foreign; as _intestine_ feuds; _intestine_ war; _intestine_ enemies. It is to be remarked that this word is usually or always applied to evils. We never say, _intestine_ happiness or prosperity; _intestine_ trade, manufactures or bills; but _intestine_ broils, trouble, disorders, calamities, war, etc. We say, internal peace, welfare, prosperity, or internal broils, war, trade, etc. This restricted use of _intestine_ seems to be entirely arbitrary.

**INTEST'INE**, _noun_ Usually in the plural, intestines. The bowels; the canal or tube that extends, with convolutions, from the right orifice of the stomach to the anus.
