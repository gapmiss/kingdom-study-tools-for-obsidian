# Imitate

**IMI'TATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin imitor; allied perhaps to Gr. similar, equal.\]

**1.** To follow in manners; to copy in form, color or quality. We _imitate_ another in dress or manners; we _imitate_ a statue, a painting, a sound, an action, when we make or do that which resembles it. We should seek the best models to _imitate_ and in morals and piety, it is our duty to _imitate_ the example of our Savior. But as we cannot always make an exact similitude of the original, hence,

**2.** To attempt or endeavor to copy or resemble; as, to _imitate_ the colors of the rainbow, or any of the beauties of nature. Cicero appears to have imitated the Greek orators.

**3.** To counterfeit.

This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,

And that sustain'd an imitated shield.

**4.** To pursue the course of a composition, so as to use like images and examples.
