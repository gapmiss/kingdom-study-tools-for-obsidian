# Induct

**INDUCT**', _verb transitive_ \[Latin inductus, from induco; in and duco, to lead.\]

Literally, to being in or introduce. Hence, appropriately,

**1.** To introduce, as to a benefice or office; to put in actual possession of an ecclesiastical living or of any other office, with the customary forms and ceremonies.
