# Inoculate

**INOC'ULATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin inoculo; in and occulus, the eye.\]

**1.** To bud; to insert the bud of a tree or plant in another tree or plant, for the purpose of growth on the new stock. All sorts of stone fruit, apples, pears, etc. may be inoculated. We _inoculate_ the stock with a foreign bud.

**2.** To communicate a disease to a person by inserting infectious matter in his skin or flesh; as, to _inoculate_ a person with the matter of small pox or cow pox. When the latter disease is communicated, it is called vaccination.

**INOC'ULATE**, _verb intransitive_ To propagate by budding; to practice inoculation. The time to _inoculate_ is when the buds are formed at the extremities of the same year's shoot, indicating that the spring growth for that season is complete.
