# Ingredient

**INGRE'DIENT**, _noun_ \[Latin ingrediens, entering into; ingredior; in and gradior. See [[Grade]].\]

That which enters into a compound, or is a component part of any compound or mixture. It is particularly applied to the simples in medicinal compositions, but admits of a very general application. We say, an ointment or a decoction is composed of certain ingredients; and Addison wondered that learning was not thought a proper _ingredient_ in the education of a woman of quality or fortune.
