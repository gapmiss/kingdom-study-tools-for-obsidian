# Impiety

**IMPI'ETY**, _noun_ \[Latin impietas; in and pietas, pius.\]

**1.** Ungodliness; irreverence towards the Supreme being; contempt of the divine character and authority; neglect of the divine precepts. These constitute different degrees of _impiety_

**2.** Any act of wickedness, as blasphemy and scoffing at the Supreme Being, or at his authority; profaneness. Any expression of contempt for God or his laws, constitutes an _impiety_ of the highest degree of criminality. Disobedience to the divine commands or neglect of duty implies contempt for his authority, and is therefore _impiety_ _impiety_ when it expresses the temper or disposition, has no plural; but it is otherwise when it expresses an act of wickedness, for all such acts are impieties.
