# Incredible

**INCRED'IBLE**, _adjective_ \[Latin incredibilis; in and credibilis, credible.\]

That cannot be believed; not to be credited; too extraordinary and improbable to admit of belief.

Why should it be thought a thing _incredible_ with you, that God should raise the dead? [[Acts 26#8|Acts 26:8]].
