# Innocence

**IN'NOCENCE**

IN'NOCENCY, _noun_ \[Latin innocentia; in and noceo, to hurt.\]

**1.** Properly, freedom from any quality that can injure; innoxiousness; harmlessness; as the _innocence_ of a medicine which can do no harm. In this sense, the noun is not obsolete, though less used than the adjective.

**2.** In a moral sense, freedom from crime, sin or guilt; untainted purity of heart and life; unimpaired integrity.

Enjoyment left nothing to ask--innocence left nothing to fear.

**3.** Freedom from guilt or evil intentions; simplicity of heart; as the _innocence_ of a child.

**4.** Freedom from the guilt of a particular sin or crime. This is the sense in which the word is most generally used, for perfect _innocence_ cannot be predicated of man. A man charged with theft or murder may prove his _innocence_

**5.** The state of being lawfully conveyed to a belligerent, or of not being contraband; as the _innocence_ of a cargo, or of any merchandize.
