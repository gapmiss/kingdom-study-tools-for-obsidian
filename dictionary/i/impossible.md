# Impossible

**IMPOSS'IBLE**, _adjective_ \[Latin impossibilis; in and possibilis, from possum, to be able.\]

**1.** That cannot be. It is _impossible_ that two and two should make five, or that a circle and a square make five, or that a circle and a square should be the same thing, or that a thing should be, and not be at the same time.

**2.** Impracticable; not feasible; that cannot be done.

With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. [[Matthew 19#26|Matthew 19:26]].

Without faith it is _impossible_ to please God. [[Hebrews 11#6|Hebrews 11:6]].

There are two kinds of impossibilities; physical and moral. That is a physical impossibility, which is contrary to the law of nature. A thing is said to be morally _impossible_ when in itself it is possible, but attended with difficulties or circumstances which give it the appearance of being _impossible_ \[See [[Possible]], Practicable and Impracticable.\]
