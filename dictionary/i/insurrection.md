# Insurrection

**INSURREC'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin insurgo; in and surgo, to rise.\]

**1.** A rising against civil or political authority; the open and active opposition of a number of persons to the execution of a law in a city or state. It is equivalent to sedition, except that sedition expresses a less extensive rising of citizens. It differs from rebellion, for the latter expresses a revolt, or an attempt to overthrow the government, to establish a different one or to place the country under another jurisdiction. It differs from mutiny, as it respects the civil or political government; whereas a mutiny is an open opposition to law in the army or navy. _insurrection_ is however used with such latitude as to comprehend either sedition or rebellion.

It is found that this city of old time hath made _insurrection_ against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. [[Ezra 4#19|Ezra 4:19]].

**2.** A rising in mass to oppose an enemy. \[Little used.\]
