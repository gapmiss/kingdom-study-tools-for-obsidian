# Infection

**INFEC'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin inficio.\] The act of infecting, or the act by which poisonous matter, morbid miasmata or exhalations produce disease in a healthy body. The words contagion and _infection_ are frequently confounded. The proper distinction between them is this. Contagion is the virus or effluvium generated in a diseased body, and capable of producing the specific disease in a healthy body by contact or otherwise. Marsh miasm is not properly contagion. _infection_ is any thing that taints or corrupts; hence it includes contagion, and any other morbid, noxious matter which may excite disease in a healthy body. Hence,

**1.** The morbid cause which excites disease in a healthy or uninfected body. This cause may be contagion from a diseased body, or other poisonous or noxious matter received into the body or under the skin. The _infection_ of the plague and of yellow fever, is said to be imported in ships and conveyed in clothing; persons are said to take the _infection_ from a diseased person, or from the air of apartments where the sick are confined. The _infection_ spreads in a city, or it is free from _infection_ Pestilential exhalations are called infections.

Infection is used in two acceptations; first, as denoting the effluvium or infectious matter exhaled from the person of one diseased, in which sense it is synonymous with contagion; and secondly, as signifying the act of communication of such morbid effluvium, by which disease is transferred.

**2.** That which taints, poisons or corrupts by communication from one to another; as the _infection_ of error or of evil example.

**3.** Contamination by illegality, as in cases of contraband goods.

**4.** Communication of like qualities.

Mankind are gay or serious by _infection_
