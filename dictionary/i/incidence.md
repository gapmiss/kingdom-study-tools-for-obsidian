# Incidence

**IN'CIDENCE**, _noun_ \[Latin incidens; incido, to fall on; in and cado, to fall.\]

**1.** Literally, a falling on; whence, an accident or casualty.

**2.** The manner of falling on, or the direction in which one body falls on or strikes another. The angle which the line of falling, or the direction of a moving body striking another, makes with the place struck, is called the angle of _incidence_ When rays of light striking a body are reflected, the angle of _incidence_ and the angle of reflection are equal.

In equal incidences there is a considerable inequality of refractions.
