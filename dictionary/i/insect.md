The class of insects, in the Linnean system, is divided into seven orders, the last of which \[Aptera\] includes the Crustacea, which breathe by gills, and the Arachnids, which have no antennae, now forming two distinct classes.

The term _insect_ has been applied, but improperly, to other small invertebral animals of the Linnean class Vermes.

**2.** Any thing small or contemptible.
