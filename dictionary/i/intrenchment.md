# Intrenchment

**INTRENCH'MENT**, _noun_ Properly, a trench or ditch only; but as the earth thrown out of a trench forms a part, and often the most necessary and useful part of a fortification, hence _intrenchment_ is generally understood to signify a ditch and parapet, and sometimes it signifies fascines covered with earth, gabions, bags filled with earth, or other materials collected to cover men from an enemy's fire.

On our side we have thrown up intrenchments on Winter and Prospect hills.
