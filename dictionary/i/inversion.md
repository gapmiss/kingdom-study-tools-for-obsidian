# Inversion

**INVER'SION**, _noun_ \[Latin inversio. See [[Invert]].\]

**1.** Change of order, so that the last becomes first and the first last; a turning or change of the natural order of things.

It is just the _inversion_ of an act of parliament; your Lordship first signed it, and then it was passed among the lords and commons.

**2.** Change of places, so that each takes the place of the other.

**3.** A turning backwards; a contrary rule of operation. Problems in geometry and arithmetic are often proved by _inversion_ as division by multiplication, and multiplication by division.

**4.** In grammar, a change of the natural order of words; as, 'of all vices, impurity is one of the most detestable.' instead of 'impurity is one of the most detestable of all vices.'

**5.** In music, the change of position either of a subject or of a chord.
