# If

**IF**, _verb transitive_ It is used as the sign of a condition, or it introduces a conditional sentence. It is a verb, without a specified nominative. In like manner we use grant, admit, suppose. Regularly, _if_ should be followed, as it was formerly, by the substitute or pronoun that, referring to the succeeding sentence or proposition. _if_ that John shall arrive in season, I will send him with a message. But that is now omitted, and the subsequent sentence, proposition or affirmation may be considered as the object of the verb. Give John shall arrive; grant, suppose, admit that he shall arrive, I will send him with a message. The sense of _if_ or give, in this use, is grant, admit, cause to be, let the fact be, let the thing take place. _if_ then is equivalent to grant, allow, admit. 'If thou wilt, thou canst make me whole, ' that is, thou canst make me whole, give the fact, that thou wilt.

**IF** thou art the son of God, command that these stones be made bread. [[Matthew 14#28|Matthew 14:28]].
