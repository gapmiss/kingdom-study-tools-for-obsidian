# Isthmus

**ISTHMUS**, _noun_ ist'mus. \[Latin\] A neck or narrow slip of land by which two continents are connected, or by which a peninsula is united to the mainland. Such is the Neck, so called, which connects Boston with the main land at Roxbury. But the word is applied to land of considerable extent, between seas; as the _isthmus_ of Darien, which connects North and South America, and the _isthmus_ between the Euxine and Caspian seas.
