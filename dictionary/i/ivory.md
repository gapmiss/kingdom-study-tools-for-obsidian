# Ivory

**I'VORY**, _noun_ \[Latin ebur.\] The tusk of an elephant, a hard, solid substance, of a fine white color. This tooth is sometimes six or seven feet in length, hollow from the base to a certain highth, and filled with a compact medullary substance, seeming to contain a great number of glands. The _ivory_ of Ceylon and Achem does not become yellow in wearing, and hence is preferred to that of Guinea.
