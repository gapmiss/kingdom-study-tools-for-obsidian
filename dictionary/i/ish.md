# Ish

**ISH**, a termination of English words, is, in Sax. isc. Dan.isk, G. isch; and not improbably, it is the termination esque, in French, as in grotesque, It.esco, in grotesco, and the Latin termination of the inceptive verb, as in fervesco. Annexed to English adjectives, _ish_ denotes diminutive, or a small degree of the quality; as whitish, from white; yellowish, from yellow.

**ISH** annexed to names forms a possessive adjective; as in Swedish, Danish, English.

**ISH** annexed to common nouns forms an adjective denoting a participation of the qualities expressed by the noun; as foolish, from fool; roguish, from rogue; brutish, from brute. This is the more common use of this termination.
