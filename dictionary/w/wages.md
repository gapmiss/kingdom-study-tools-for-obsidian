# Wages

**WAGES**, _noun_ plural in termination, but singular in signification.

**1.** Hire; reward; that which is paid or stipulated for services; but chiefly for services by manual labor, or for military and naval services. We speak of servants _wages_ a laborers _wages_ or soldiers wages; but we never apply the word to the rewards given to men in office, which are called fees or salary. The word is however sometimes applied to the compensation given to representatives in the legislature. \[U. States\]
