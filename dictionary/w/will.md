# Will

**WILL**, _noun_ \[See the Verb.\]

**1.** That faculty of the mind by which we determine either to do or forbear an action; the faculty which is exercised in deciding, among two or more objects, which we shall embrace or pursue. The _will_ is directed or influenced by the judgment. The understanding or reason compares different objects, which operate as motives; the judgment determines which is preferable, and the _will_ decides which to pursue. In other words, we reason with respect to the value or importance of things; we then judge which is to be preferred; and we _will_ to take the most valuable. These are but different operations of the mind, soul, or intellectual part of man. Great disputes have existed respecting the freedom of the _will_ _will_ is often quite a different thing from desire.
