# Withal

**WITHAL**, _adverb_ Withaul. \[with and all.\]

**1.** With the rest; together with; likewise; at the same time.

If you choose that, then I am yours _withal_

How modest in exception, and _withal_ how terrible in constant resolution!

**2.** It is sometimes used for with. But the word is not elegant, nor much used.
