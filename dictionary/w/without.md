# Without

**WITHOUT**, _preposition_

**1.** Not with; as _without_ success.

**2.** In a state of destitution or absence from.

There is no living with thee nor _without_ thee.

**3.** In a state of destitution or absence from.

There is no living with thee nor _without_ thee.

**4.** Beyond; not within.

Eternity, before the world and after, is _without_ our reach.

**5.** Supposing the negation or omission of.

**WITHOUT** the separation of the two monarchies, the most advantageous terms from the French must end in our destruction.

**6.** Independent of; not by the use of. Men like to live _without_ labor.

Wise men will do it _without_ a law.

**7.** On the outside of; as _without_ the gate; _without_ doors.

**8.** With exemption from. That event cannot happen _without_ great damage to our interests.

**9.** Unless; except.

**WITHOUT**, when it precedes a sentence or member of a sentence, has been called a conjunction. This is a mistake. You will not enjoy health, _without_ you use much exercise. In this sentence, _without_ is a preposition still, but followed by a member of a sentence, instead of a single noun. It has no property of a connective or conjunction, and does not fall within the definition. You will not enjoy health, this fact following being removed, or not taking place; you use exercise. This use of _without_ is nearly superseded by unless and except, among good writers and speakers; but is common in popular discourse or parlance.

**WITHOUT**, _adverb_

**1.** Not on the inside; not within.

These were from _without_ the growing miseries.

**2.** Out of doors.

**3.** Externally; not in the mind.

**WITHOUT** were fightings, within were fears. [[2 Corinthians 7#5|2 Corinthians 7:5]].
