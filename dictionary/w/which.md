# Which

**WHICH**, _pronoun_ relative or substitute. \[I have not found this word in any other language. I think it may be from the root of quick. See [[What and Wight]].\]

**1.** A word called a relative or pronoun relative, because it relates to another word or thing, usually to some word that precedes it in the sentence. I call it also a substitute, as it supplies the place of a noun, or of an adjective, or of a sentence or clause. 1. The garden _which_ I cultivate, that is , the garden, _which_ garden I cultivate. 2. We are bound to obey all the divine commands, _which_ we cannot do without divine aid. Here _which_ represents the words, obey the divine commands. 3. You declared him to be innocent, _which_ he is not. Here _which_ stands for innocent. In the foregoing uses, _which_ is not used in the masculine gender, that is, it does not in modern usage represent a person.

**2.** _which_ is much used in asking questions, for the purpose of obtaining the designation of a particular person or thing by the answer, and in this use, it is of the masculine as well as of the neuter gender. There are two or three things to be done; _which_ shall I do first? _which_ man is it?
