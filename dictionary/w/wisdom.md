# Wisdom

**WISDOM**, _noun_ s as z. \[G. See [[Wise]].\]

**1.** The right use or exercise of knowledge; the choice of laudable ends, and of the best means to accomplish them. This is _wisdom_ in act, effect, or practice. If _wisdom_ is to be considered as a faculty of the mind, it is the faculty of discerning or judging what is most just, proper and useful, and if it is to be considered as an acquirement, it is the knowledge and use of what is best, most just, most proper, most conducive to prosperity or happiness. _wisdom_ in the first sense, or practical _wisdom_ is nearly synonymous with discretion. It differs somewhat from prudence, in this respect; prudence is the exercise of sound judgment in avoiding evils; _wisdom_ is the exercise of sound judgment either in avoiding evils or attempting good. Prudence then is a species, of which _wisdom_ is the genus.

**WISDOM** gained by experience, is of inestimable value.

It is hoped that our rulers will act with dignity and wisdom; that they will yield every thing to reason, and refuse every thing to force.

**6.** Profitable words or doctrine. [[Psalms 37#30|Psalms 37:30]].
