# We

**WE**, _pronoun_ _plural_ of I; or rather a different word, denoting the person speaking and another or others with him. I and John, the speaker calls _we_ or I and John and Thomas; or I and many others. In the objective case, us. _we_ is used to express men in general, including the speaker.

Vice seen too oft, familiar with her face, _we_ first endure, then pity, then embrace.
