# Whence

**WHENCE**, _adverb_

**1.** From what place.

**WHENCE** and what art thou?

**2.** From what source. _whence_ shall we derive hope? _whence_ comes this honor?

**WHENCE** hath this man this wisdom? [[Matthew 13#27|Matthew 13:27]].

**3.** From which premises, principles or facts. These facts or principles are admitted, _whence_ it follows, that judgment must be entered for the plaintiff.

**4.** How; by what way or means. [[Mark 12#37|Mark 12:37]].

**5.** In general, from which person, cause, place, principle or circumstance.

From _whence_ may be considered as tautological, from being implied in whence; but the use is well authorized, and in some cases the use of it seems to give force or beauty to the phrase. We ascended the mountain, from _whence_ we took a view of the beautiful plains below.

Of _whence_ is not now used.
