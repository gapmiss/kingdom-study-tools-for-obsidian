# Were

**WERE**, _pronoun_ er, which when prolonged, becomes ware. This is used as the imperfect tense plural of be; we _were_ you _were_ they were; and in some other tenses. It is the Danish verb vaerer, to be, to exist, and in origin has no connection with be, nor with was. It is united with be, to supply its want of tenses, as went is with go.
