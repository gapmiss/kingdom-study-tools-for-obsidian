**WARRANTY**, _noun_

**1.** In law, a promise or covenant by deed, made by the bargainer for himself and his heirs, to warrant or secure the bargainee and his heirs against all men in the enjoyment of an estate or other thing granted. Such _warranty_ passes from the seller to the buyer, from the feoffor to the feoffee, and from the releaser to the releasee. _warranty_ is real, when annexed to lands and tenements granted in fee or for life, etc. And is in deed or in law; and personal, when it respects goods sold or their quality.

In common recoveries, a fictitious person is called to _warranty_ In the sale of goods or personal property, the seller warrants the title; the _warranty_ is express or implied. If a man sells goods which are not his own, or which he has no right to sell, the purchaser may have satisfaction for the injury. And if the seller expressly warrants the goods to be sound and not defective, and they prove to be otherwise, he must indemnify the purchaser; of the law implies a contract in the _warranty_ to make good any defect. But the _warranty_ must be at the time of sale, and not afterwards.

**2.** Authority; justificatory mandate or precept.
