# War

**WAR**, _noun_ \[G., to perplex, embroil, disturb. The primary sense of the root is to strive, struggle, urge, drive, or to turn, to twist.\]

**1.** A contest between nations or states, carried on by force, either for defense, or for revenging insults and redressing wrongs, for the extension of commerce or acquisition of territory, or for obtaining and establishing the superiority and dominion of one over the other. These objects are accomplished by the slaughter or capture of troops, and the capture and destruction of ships, towns and property. Among rude nations, _war_ is often waged and carried on for plunder. As _war_ is the contest of nations or states, it always implies that such contest is authorized by the monarch or the sovereign power of the nation. When _war_ is commenced by attacking a nation in peace, it si called an offensive _war_ and such attack is aggressive. When _war_ is undertaken to repel invasion or the attacks of an enemy, it is called defensive, and a defensive _war_ is considered as justifiable. Very few of the wars that have desolated nations and deluged the earth with blood, have been justifiable. Happy would it be for mankind, if the prevalence of Christian principles might ultimately extinguish the spirit of _war_ and if the ambition to be great, might yield to the ambition of being good.

Preparation for _war_ is sometimes the best security for peace.
