# Whatever

**WHATEVER**, _pronoun_ \[what and ever.\]

**1.** Being this or that; being of one nature or another; being one thing or another; any thing that may be. _whatever_ is read, let it be read with attention. _whatever_ measure may be adopted, let it be with due caution. _whatever_ you do, let it be done with prudence.

**2.** All that; the whole that; all particulars that.

At once came forth _whatever_ creeps.
