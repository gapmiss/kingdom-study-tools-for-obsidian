# Who

**WHO**, _pronoun_ relative. _pronoun_ hoo. **\[**Latin _who_ is undoubtedly a contracted word in English as in Latin. See [[What and Wight]].\]

**1.** _who_ is a pronoun relative, always referring to persons. It forms whose in the genitive or possessive case, answering to the Latin Cujus, and whom in the objective or accusative case. _who_ whose and whom, are in both numbers. Thus we say, the man or woman _who_ was with us; the men or women _who_ were with us; the men or women whom we saw.

**2.** Which of many. Are you satisfied _who_ did the mischief?

**3.** It is much used in asking questions; as, _who_ am I? _who_ art thou? _who_ is this? _who_ are these? In this case, the purpose is to obtain the name or designation of the person or character.

**4.** It has sometimes a disjunctive sense.

There thou tellst of kings, and _who_ aspire; _who_ fall, _who_ rise, _who_ triumph, _who_ do moan.

**5.** Whose is of all genders. Whose book is this?

This question whose solution I require--

As _who_ should say, elliptically for as one _who_ should say.
