# Wonder

**WONDER**, _noun_ \[G., Gr., to show; and hence a sight; a panic.\]

**1.** That emotion which is excited by novelty, or the presentation to the sight or mind, of something new, unusual, strange, great, extraordinary, or not well understood; something that arrests the attention by its novelty, grandeur or inexplicableness. _wonder_ expresses less than astonishment, and much less than amazement. It differs from admiration, in not being necessarily accompanied with love, esteem or approbation, nor directed to persons. But _wonder_ sometimes is nearly allied to astonishment, and the exact extent of the meaning of such words can hardly be graduated.
