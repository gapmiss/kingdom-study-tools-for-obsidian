# What

**WHAT**, pronoun relative or substitute. \[G., Latin See [[Wight]].\]

**1.** That which. Say _what_ you will, is the same as say that which you will.

**2.** Which part. Consider _what_ is due to nature, and _what_ to art or labor.

**3.** _what_ is the substitute for a sentence or clause of a sentence. I tell thee _what_ corporal, I could tear her. Here _what_ relates to the last clause, I could tear her; this is _what_ I tell you.

**4.** _what_ is used as an adjective, of both genders, often in specifying sorts or particulars. See _what_ colors this silk exhibits. I know _what_ qualities you desire in a friend; that is, I know the qualities which you desire.

**5.** _what_ is much used in asking questions. _what_ sort of character is this? _what_ poem is this? _what_ man is this we see coming?

**6.** _what_ time, at the time or on the day when.

**WHAT** time the morn mysterious visions brings.

**7.** To how great a degree.

**WHAT** a partial judges are our love and hate!

**8.** Whatever.

Whether it was the shortness of his foresight, the strength of his will--or _what_ it was--

**9.** Some part, or some. The year before, he had so used the matter, that _what_ by force, _what_ by policy, he had taken from the Christians above thirty castles; that is, he had taken above thirty castles; that is, he had taken above thirty castles, a part or some by force, a part or some by policy; or _what_ may be interpreted partly. Sometimes _what_ has no verb to govern it, and it must be considered as adverbially used. _what_ with carrying apples and fuel, he finds himself in a hurry; that is, partly, in part.

**10.** _what_ is sometimes used elliptically for _what_ is this, or how is this?

**WHAT**! Could ye not watch with me one hour? [[Matthew 26#8|Matthew 26:8]].

**11.** _what_ is used interrogatively and elliptically, as equivalent to _what_ will be the consequence? _what_ will follow? As in the phrase, _what_ if I undertake this business myself?

**WHAT** though, that is, grant this or that; allow it to be so.

**WHAT** ho, an exclamation of calling.
