# Would

**WOULD**, **WUD**, _preterit tense_ of will, G., Latin

**WOULD** is used as an auxiliary verb in conditional forms of speech. I _would_ go, if I could. This form of expression denotes will or resolution, under a condition or supposition. You _would_ go, He _would_ go, denote simply an event, under a condition or supposition. The condition implied in _would_ is not always expressed. By pleasure and pain, I _would_ be understood to mean what delights or molests us--; that is, if it should be asked what I mean by pleasure and pain, I _would_ thus explain what I wish to have understood. In this form of expression, which is very common, there seems to be an implied allusion to an inquiry, or to the supposition of something not expressed.

**WOULD** has the sense of wish or pray, particularly in the phrases, _would_ to God, _would_ God we had died in Egypt, I _would_ that ye knew what conflict I have; that is, I could wish such a thing, if the wish could avail. Here also there is an implied condition.

**WOULD** is used also for wish to do, or to have. What wouldst thou? What _would_ he?
