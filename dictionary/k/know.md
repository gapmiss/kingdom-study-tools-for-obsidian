# Know

**KNOW**, _verb transitive_ no. _preterit tense_ knew; _participle passive_ known. \[Latin nosco, cognosco, Gr. although much varied in orthography. Nosco makes novi, which, with g or c prefixed, gnovi or cnovi, would coincide with _know_ knew. So Latin cresco, crevi, coincides with grow, grew. The radical sense of knowing is generally to take, receive, or hold.\]
