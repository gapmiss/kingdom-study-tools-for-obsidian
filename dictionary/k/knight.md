# Knight

**KNIGHT**, _noun_ nite.

**1.** Originally, a _knight_ was a youth, and young men being employed as servants, hence it came to signify a servant. But among our warlike ancestors, the word was particularly applied to a young man after he was admitted to the privilege of bearing arms. The admission to this privilege was a ceremony of great importance, and was the origin of the institution of knighthood. Hence, in feudal times, a _knight_ was a man admitted to military rank by a certain ceremony. This privilege was conferred on youths of family and fortune, and hence sprung the honorable title of _knight_ in modern usage. A _knight_ has the title of Sir.

**2.** A pupil or follower.

**3.** A champion.

**KNIGHT** of the post, a _knight_ dubbed at the whipping post or pillory; a hireling witness.

**KNIGHT** of the shire, in England, one of the representatives of a county in parliament, originally a _knight_ but now any gentleman having an estate in land of six hundred pounds a year is qualified.

**KNIGHT**, _verb transitive_ nite. To dub or create a _knight_ which is done by the king who gives the person kneeling a blow with a sword, and says, rise, Sir.
