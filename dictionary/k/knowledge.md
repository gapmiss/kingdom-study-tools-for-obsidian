# Knowledge

**1.** A clear and certain perception of that which exists, or of truth and fact; the perception of the connection and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of our ideas.

We can have no _knowledge_ of that which does not exist. God has a perfect _knowledge_ of all his works. Human _knowledge_ is very limited, and is mostly gained by observation and experience.

**2.** Learning; illumination of mind.

Ignorance is the curse of God, _knowledge_ the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.

**3.** Skill; as a _knowledge_ of seamanship.

**4.** Acquaintance with any fact or person. I have no _knowledge_ of the man or thing.

**5.** Cognizance; notice. [[Ruth 2#10|Ruth 2:10]].

**6.** Information; power of knowing.

**7.** Sexual intercourse. But it is usual to prefix carnal; as carnal _knowledge_

**KNOWLEDGE**, for acknowledge or avow, is not used.
