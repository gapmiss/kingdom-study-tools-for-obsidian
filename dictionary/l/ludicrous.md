# Ludicrous

**LU'DICROUS**, _adjective_ \[Latin ludicer, from ludo, to sport.\]

Sportive; burlesque; adapted to raise laughter, without scorn or contempt. _ludicrous_ differs from ridiculous; the latter implying contempt or derision.

Plutarch quotes this instance of Homer's judgment, in closing a _ludicrous_ scene with decency and instruction.
