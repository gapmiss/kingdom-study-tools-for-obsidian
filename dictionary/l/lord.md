**5.** A nobleman; a title of honor in Great Britain given to those who are noble by birth or creation; a peer of the realm, including dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts and barons. Archbishops and bishops also, as members of the house of lords, are lords of parliament. Thus we say, lords temporal and spiritual. By courtesy also the title is given to the sons of dukes and marquises, and to the eldest sons of earls.

**6.** An honorary title bestowed on certain official characters; as _lord_ advocate, _lord_ chamberlain, _lord_ chancellor, _lord_ chief justice, etc.

The word is applied to Christ, [[Psalms 110#1|Psalms 110:1]]. [[Colossians 3#16|Colossians 3:16]]. and to the Holy Spirit, [[2 Thessalonians 3#1|2 Thessalonians 3:1]]. As a title of respect, it is applied to kings, [[Genesis 40#1|Genesis 40:1]]. [[2 Samuel 19#7|2 Samuel 19:7]]. to princes and nobles, Gen 42. [[Daniel 4#19|Daniel 4:19]]. to a husband, [[Genesis 18#1|Genesis 18:1]]. to a prophet, [[1 Kings 18#1|1 Kings 18:1]]. [[2 Kings 2#1|2 Kings 2:1]]. and to a respectable person, Gen 24. Christ is called the _lord_ of glory, [[1 Corinthians 2#8|1 Corinthians 2:8]]. and _lord_ of lords, [[Revelation 19#1|Revelation 19:1]].
