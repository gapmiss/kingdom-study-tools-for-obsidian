# Luck

**LUCK**, _noun_

That which happens to a person; an event, good or ill, affecting a man's interest or happiness, and which is deemed casual; fortune. _luck_ respects persons and their proceedings. We never say, in a literal sense, that a plant has the _luck_ to grow in a particular place; or a fossil has the _luck_ to be of a particular form. We say, a person has the good _luck_ to escape from danger; or the ill _luck_ to be ensnared or to suffer loss. He has had good _luck_ or bad _luck_ in gaming, fishing or hunting. _luck_ or what we call chance, accident, fortune, is an event which takes place without being intended or foreseen, or from some cause not under human control; that which cannot be previously known or determined with certainty by human skill or power.

Consider the gift of _luck_ as below the care of a wise man.
