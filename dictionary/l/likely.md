# Likely

**LI'KELY**, _adjective_ \[that is, like-like.\]

**1.** Probable; that may be rationally though or believed to have taken place in time past, or to be true now or hereafter; such as is more reasonable than the contrary. A _likely_ story, is one which evidence, or the circumstances of the case render probable, and therefore credible.

**2.** Such as may be liked; pleasing; as a _likely_ man or woman.

\[This use of _likely_ is not obsolete, as Johnson affirms, nor is it vulgar. But the English and their descendants in America differ in the application. The English apply the word to external appearance, and with them, _likely_ is equivalent to handsome, well formed; as a _likely_ man, a _likely_ horse. In America, the word is usually applied to the endowments of the mind, or to pleasing accomplishments. With us, a _likely_ man, is a man of good character and talents, or of good dispositions or accomplishments, that render him pleasing or respectable.\]

**LI'KELY**, _adverb_ Probably.

While man was innocent, he was _likely_ ignorant of nothing important for him to know.
