# Light

**LIGHT**, _noun_ lite. \[Latin lux, _light_ and luceo, to shine. Eng. luck, both in elements and radical sense.\]

**1.** That ethereal agent or matter which makes objects perceptible to the sense of seeing, but the particles of which are separately invisible. It is now generally believed that _light_ is a fluid, or real matter, existing independent of other substances, with properties peculiar to itself. Its velocity is astonishing, as it passes through a space of nearly twelve millions of miles in a minute. _light_ when decomposed, is found to consist of rays differently colored; as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The sun is the principal source of _light_ in the solar system; but _light_ is also emitted from bodies ignited, or in combustion, and is reflected from enlightened bodies, as the moon. _light_ is also emitted from certain putrefying substances. It is usually united with heat, but it exists also independent of it.
