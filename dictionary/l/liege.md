# Liege

**LIEGE**, _adjective_ \[Latin ligo, to bind; Gr. to bind, to bend; a withe.\]

**1.** Bound by a feudal tenure; obliged to be faithful and loyal to a superior, as a vassal to his lord; subject; faithful; as a _liege_ man. By _liege_ homage, a vassal was bound to serve his lord against all, without excepting his sovereign; or against all, excepting a former lord to whom he owed like service.

**2.** Sovereign; as a _liege_ lord. \[See the noun.\]

**LIEGE**, _noun_ \[supra.\]

**1.** A vassal holding a fee by which he is bound to perform certain services and duties to his lord.

**2.** A lord or superior; a sovereign.

\[Note. This is a false application of the word, arising probably from transferring the word from the vassal to the lord; the lord of _liege_ men, being called _liege_ lord.
