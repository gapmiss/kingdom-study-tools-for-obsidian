# Legal

**LE'GAL**, _adjective_ \[Latin legalis, from lex, legis, law.\]

**1.** According to law; in conformity with law; as a _legal_ standard or test; a _legal_ procedure.

**2.** Lawful; permitted by law; as a _legal_ trade. Anything is _legal_ which the laws do not forbid.

**3.** According to the law of works, as distinguished from free grace; or resting on works for salvation.

**4.** Pertaining to law; created by law.

The exception must be confined to _legal_ crimes.

So we use the phrase, criminal law.
