# Logic

**LOG'IC**, _noun_ \[Latin id; Gr. from reason, to speak.\]

The art of thinking and reasoning justly.

Logic is the art of using reason well in our inquiries after truth, and the communication of it to others.

Logic may be defined, the science or history of the human mind, as it traces the progress of our knowledge from our first conceptions through their different combinations, and the numerous deductions that result from comparing them with one another.

Correct reasoning implies correct thinking and legitimate inferences from premises, which are principles assumed or admitted to be just. _logic_ then includes the art of thinking, as well as the art of reasoning.

The purpose of _logic_ is to direct the intellectual powers in the investigation of truth, and in the communication of it to others.
