# Lamprey

**LAM'PREY**, _noun_ \[Latin labor, to slip, and most probably the animal is name from slipping. If, however, the sense is taken from licking the rocks, as Camden supposes, it accords with the sense of the technical name of the genus petromyzon, the rock-sucker.\]

A genus of anguilliform fishes, resembling the eel, and moving in water by winding, like the serpent on land. This fish has seven spiracles on each side of the neck, and a fistula or aperture on the top of the head, but no pectoral or ventral fins. The marine or sea _lamprey_ is sometimes found so large as to weigh four or five pounds.

Lamprel and lampron. \[See _lamprey_ \]
