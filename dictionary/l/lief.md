# Lief

**LIEF**, _adjective_ \[See [[Love]].\] Dear; beloved. _obsolete_

**LIEF**, _adverb_ \[supra. This word coincides with love, Latin lubet, libet, and the primary sense is to be free, prompt, ready.\]

Gladly; willingly; freely; used in familiar speech, in the phrase, I had as _lief_ go as not. It has been supposed that had in this phrase is a corruption of would. At any rate it is anomalous.
