We _love_ our parents and our children, on account of their connection with us, and on account of many qualities which please us. We _love_ to retire to a cool shade in summer. We _love_ a warm room in winter. we _love_ to hear an eloquent advocate. The christian loves his Bible. In short, we _love_ whatever gives us pleasure and delight, whether animal or intellectual; and if our hearts are right, we _love_ God above all things, as the sum of all excellence and all the attributes which can communicate happiness to intelligent beings. In other words, the christian loves God with the _love_ of complacency in his attributes, the _love_ of benevolence towards the interest of his kingdom, and the _love_ of gratitude for favors received.

**LOVE**, _noun_

**1.** An affection of the mind excited by beauty and worth of any kind, or by the qualities of an object which communicate pleasure, sensual or intellectual. It is opposed to hatred. _love_ between the sexes, is a compound affection, consisting of esteem, benevolence, and animal desire. _love_ is excited by pleasing qualities of any kind, as by kindness, benevolence, charity, and by the qualities which render social intercourse agreeable. In the latter case, _love_ is ardent friendship, or a strong attachment springing from good will and esteem, and the pleasure derived from the company, civilities and kindness of others.

Between certain natural relatives, _love_ seems to be in some cases instinctive. Such is the _love_ of a mother for her child, which manifests itself toward an infant, before any particular qualities in the child are unfolded. This affection is apparently as strong in irrational animals as in human beings.

We speak of the _love_ of amusements, the _love_ of books, the _love_ of money, and the _love_ of whatever contributes to our pleasure or supposed profit.

The _love_ of God is the first duty of man, and this springs from just views of his attributes or excellencies of character, which afford the highest delight to the sanctified heart. Esteem and reverence constitute ingredients in this affection, and a fear of offending him is its inseparable effect.
