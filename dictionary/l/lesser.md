# Lesser

**LESS'ER**, _adjective_ \[This word is a corruption; but too well established to be discarded.\]

Less; smaller. Authors always write the _lesser_ Asia.

By the same reason, may a man in a state of nature, punish the _lesser_ breaches of that law.

God made the _lesser_ light to rule the night. [[Genesis 1#16|Genesis 1:16]].
