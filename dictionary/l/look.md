# Look

**LOOK**, _verb intransitive_ \[See [[Light]]. The primary sense is to stretch, to extend, to shoot, hence to direct the eye. We observe its primary sense is nearly the same as that of seek. Hence, to _look_ for is to seek.\]

**1.** To direct the eye towards an object, with the intention of seeing it.

When the object is within sight, _look_ is usually followed by on or at. We _look_ on or at a picture; we _look_ on or at the moon; we cannot _look_ on or at the unclouded sun, without pain.

At, after _look_ is not used in our version of the Scriptures. In common usage, at or on is now used indifferently in many cases, and yet in other cases, usage has established a preference. In general, on is used in the more solemn forms of expression. Moses was afraid to _look_ on God. The Lord _look_ on you and judge. In these and similar phrases, the use of at would be condemned, as expressing too little solemnity.

In some cases, at seems to be more properly used before very distant objects; but the cases can hardly be defined.

The particular direction of the eye is expressed by various modifying words; as, to _look_ down, to _look_ up, to _look_ back to _look_ forward, to _look_ from, to _look_ round, to _look_ out, to _look_ under. When the object is not in sight, _look_ is followed by after, or for. Hence, to _look_ after, or _look_ for, is equivalent to seek or search, or to expect.

**2.** To see; to have the sight or view of.

Fate sees thy life lodged in a brittle glass, and looks it through, but to it cannot pass.

**3.** To direct the intellectual eye; to apply the mind or understanding; to consider; to examine. _look_ at the conduct of this man; view it in all its aspects. Let every man _look_ into the state of his own heart. Let us _look_ beyond the received notions of men on this subject.
