**1.** A mark or character, written, printed, engraved or painted; used as the representative of a sound, or of an articulation of the human organs of speech.

As sounds are audible and communicate ideas to others by the ear, so letters are visible representatives of sounds, and communicate the thoughts of others by means of the eye.
