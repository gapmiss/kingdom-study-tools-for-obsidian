# Leprosy

**LEP'ROSY**, _noun_ \[See [[Leper]].\] A foul cutaneous disease, appearing in dry, white, thin, scurfy scabs, attended with violent itching. It sometimes covers the whole body, rarely the face. One species of it is called elephantiasis.

The term _leprosy_ is applied to two very distinct diseases, the scaly and the tuberculated, or the proper _leprosy_ and the elephantiasis. The former is characterized by smooth laminated scales, sometimes livid, but usually whitish; in the latter, the skin is thickened, livid and tuberculated. It is called the black _leprosy_ but this term is also applied to the livid variety of the scaly _leprosy_
