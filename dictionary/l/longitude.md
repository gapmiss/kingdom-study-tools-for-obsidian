**1.** Properly length; as the _longitude_ of a room; but in this sense not now used. Appropriately, in geography,

**2.** The distance of any place on the globe from another place, eastward or westward; or the distance of any place from a given meridian. Boston, in Massachusetts, is situated in the 71st degree of _longitude_ west from Greenwich. To be able to ascertain precisely the _longitude_ of a ship at sea, is a great desideratum in navigation.
