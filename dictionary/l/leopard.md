# Leopard

**LEOPARD**, _noun_ lep'ard. \[Latin leo, lion, and pardus, pard. Gr. from Heb. to separate, that is, spotted, broken into spots.\]

A rapacious quadruped of the genus Felis. It differs from the panther and the once in the beauty of its color, which is of a lively yellow, with smaller spots than those of the two latter, and disposed in groups. It is larger than the once and less than the panther. This animal is found in Africa and Asia, and so rapacious as to spare neither man nor beast.
