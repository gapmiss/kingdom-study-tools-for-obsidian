**LA'CONISM**,

LAC'QUER, _noun_ A kind of varnish. The basis of lackers is a solution of the substance called seed-lack or shell-lack, in spirit of wine or alcohol. Varnishes applied to metals improve their color and preserve them from tarnishing.

Lackers consist of different resins in a state of solution, of which the most common are mastick, sandarach, lack, benzoin, copal, amber, and asphalt. The menstrua are either expressed or essential oils, or spirit of wine.

**LACK'ER**, _verb transitive_ To varnish; to smear over with lacker, for the purpose of improving color or preserving from tarnishing and decay.
