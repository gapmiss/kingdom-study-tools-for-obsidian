# Liable

**LI'ABLE**, _adjective_ \[Latin ligo. See [[Liege]].\]

**1.** Bound; obliged in law or equity; responsible; answerable. The surety is _liable_ for the debt of his principal. The parent is not _liable_ for debts contracted by a son who is a minor, except for necessaries.

This use of _liable_ is now common among lawyers. The phrase is abridged. The surety is _liable_ that is, bound to pay the debt of his principal.

**2.** Subject; obnoxious; exposed.

Proudly secure, yet _liable_ to fall.

Liable, in this sense, is always applied to evils. We never say, a man is _liable_ to happiness or prosperity, but he is _liable_ to disease, calamities, censure; he is _liable_ to err, to sin, to fall.
