# Laziness

**LA'ZINESS**, _noun_ \[from lazy.\]

**1.** The state or quality of being lazy; indisposition to action or exertion; indolence; sluggishness; heaviness in motion; habitual sloth. _laziness_ differs from idleness; the latter being a mere defect or cessation of action, but _laziness_ is sloth, with natural or habitual disinclination to action.

Laziness travels so slowly, that poverty soon overtakes him.

**2.** Slowness; tardiness.
