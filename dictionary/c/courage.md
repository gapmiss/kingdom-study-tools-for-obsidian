# Courage

**COURAGE**, _noun_ \[Latin , the heart.\] Bravery; intrepidity; that quality of mind which enables men to encounter danger and difficulties with firmness, or without fear or depression of spirits; valor; boldness; resolution. It is a constituent part of fortitude; but fortitude implies patience to bear continued suffering.

**COURAGE** that grows from constitution, often forsakes a man when he has occasion for it; _courage_ which arises from a sense of duty, acts in a uniform manner.

Be strong and of good _courage_ [[Deuteronomy 31#6|Deuteronomy 31:6]].
