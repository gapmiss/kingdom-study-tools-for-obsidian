**CALOTTE**,

CALOYERS, or CALOGERI, _noun_ Monks of the Greek church, of three orders; archari, or novices; ordinary professed, or microchemi; and the more perfect, called megalochemi. They are also divided into cenobites, who are employed in reciting their offices, from midnight to sunrise; anchorets, who retire and live in hermitages; and recluses, who shut themselves up in grottos and caverns, on the mountains, and live on alms furnished to them by the monasteries.
