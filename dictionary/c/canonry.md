**CANONRY**,

CANONSHIP, _noun_ An ecclesiastical benefice, in a cathedral or collegiate church, which has a prebend or stated allowance out of the revenues of the church commonly annexed to it. The benifice filled by a canon. A prebend may subsist without a canonry; but a canonicate is inseparable from a prebend.
