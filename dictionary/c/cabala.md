# Cabala

**CABALA**, \[See the preceding word. It is from the sense of reception.\] Tradition, or a mysterious kind of science among Jewish Rabbins, pretended to have been delivered to the ancient Jews by revelation, and transmitted by oral tradition; serving for the interpretation of difficult passages of scripture. This science consists chiefly in understanding the combination of certain letters, words and numbers, which are alleged to be significant. Every letter, word, number and accent of the law is supposed to contain a mystery, and the cabalists pretend even to foretell future events by the study of this science.

**CABAL**, _verb intransitive_ To unite in a small party to promote private views by intrigue; to intrigue; to unite in secret artifices to effect some design.
