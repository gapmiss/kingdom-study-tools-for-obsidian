# Confessor

**CONFESS'OR**, _noun_

**1.** One who confesses; one who acknowledges his sins.

**2.** One who makes a profession of his faith in the Christian religion. The word is appropriately used to denote one who avows his religion in the face of danger, and adheres to it, in defiance of persecution and torture. It was formerly used as synonymous with martyr; afterwards it was applied to those who, having been persecuted and tormented, were permitted to die in peace. It was used also for such Christians as lived a good life, and died with the reputation of sanctity.

**3.** A priest; one who hears the confessions of others, and has power to grant them absolution.
