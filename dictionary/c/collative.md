# Collative

**COLLATIVE**, _adjective_ Advowsons are presentative, _collative_ or donative. An advowson _collative_ is where the bishop and patron are one and the same person; in which case the bishop cannot present to himself, but he does, by one act of collation or conferring the benefice, the whole that is done, in common cases, by both presentation and institution.
