# Clot

**CLOT**, _noun_ \[See [[Clod]].\] A concretion, particularly of soft or fluid matter, which concretes into a mass or lump; as a _clot_ of blood. Clod and _clot_ appear to be radically the same word; but we usually apply clod to a hard mass of earth, and _clot_ to a mass of softer substances, or fluids concreted.

**CLOT**, _verb intransitive_

**1.** To concrete; to coagulate, as soft or fluid matter into a thick, inspissated mass; as milk or blood clots.

**2.** To form into clots or clods; to adhere; as, clotted glebe.
