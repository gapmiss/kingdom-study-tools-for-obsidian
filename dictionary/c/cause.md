# Cause

**CAUSE**, _noun_ s as z.

**1.** A suit or action in court; any legal process which a party institutes to obtain his demand, or by which he seeks his right or his supposed right. This is a legal, scriptural and popular use of the word, coinciding nearly with case from cado, and action from ago, to urge or drive.

The _cause_ of both parties shall come before the judges. [[Exodus 22#5|Exodus 22:5]].

**2.** That which produces an effect; that which impels into existence, or by its agency or operation produces what did not before exist; that by virtue of which any thing is done; that from which any thing proceeds, and without which it would not exist.

**CAUSE** is a substance exerting its power into act, to make a thing begin to be.

**3.** The reason or motive that urges, moves, or impels the mind to act or decide.

For this _cause_ have I raised up Pharaoh. [[Exodus 9#16|Exodus 9:16]].

And David said, is there not a cause? [[1 Samuel 17#29|1 Samuel 17:29]].

**4.** Sake; account.

I did it not for his _cause_ that had done the wrong. [[2 Corinthians 6#1|2 Corinthians 6:1]]. \[See [[Sake]].\]

**5.** That which a party or nation pursues; or rather pursuit, prosecution of an object. We say, Bible Societies are engaged in a noble _cause_ \[See the first definition.\] Hence the word _cause_ is used to denote that which a person or thing favors; that to which the efforts of an intelligent being are directed; as, to promote religion is to advance the _cause_ of God. So we say, the _cause_ of truth or of justice. In all its applications, _cause_ retains something of its original meaning, struggle, impelling force, contest, effort to obtain or to effect something.

**6.** Without _cause_ without good reason; without a reason or motive to justify the act.

They hate me without _cause_ [[Psalms 35#19|Psalms 35:19]]. [[Psalms 69#4|Psalms 69:4]].

**CAUSE**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To produce; to bring into existence.

They caused great joy to all the brethren. [[Acts 15#3|Acts 15:3]].

**2.** To effect by agency, power or influence.

I will _cause_ it to rain on the earth forty days. [[Genesis 7#4|Genesis 7:4]].

I will _cause_ him to fall by the sword. [[2 Kings 19#7|2 Kings 19:7]].

**CAUSE**, _verb intransitive_ To assign insufficient _cause_
