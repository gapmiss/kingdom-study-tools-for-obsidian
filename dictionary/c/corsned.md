**CORSNED**, _noun_ The morsel of execration, or curse; a piece of bread consecrated by exorcism, and to be swallowed by a suspected person, as a trial of his innocence. If guilty, it was supposed the bread would produce convulsions and paleness, and find no passage. If innocent, it was believed it would turn to nourishment.
