# Cloy

**CLOY**, _verb transitive_

**1.** Strictly, to fill; to glut. Hence, to satisfy, as the appetite; to satiate. And as the appetite when satisfied rejects additional food, hence, to fill to lothing; to surfeit.

Who can _cloy_ the hungry edge of appetite

By bare imagination of a feast?

**2.** To spike up a gun; to drive a spike into the vent.

**3.** In farriery, to prick a horse in shoeing.

\[In the two latter senses, I believe the word is little used, and not at all in America.\]
