# Concerning

**CONCERNING**, _participle present tense_ Pertaining to; regarding; having relation to.

The Lord hath spoken good _concerning_ Israel. [[Numbers 10#29|Numbers 10:29]].

I have accepted thee _concerning_ this thing. [[Genesis 19#21|Genesis 19:21]].

This word has been considered a preposition, but most improperly; _concerning_ when so called, refers to a verb, sentence or proposition; as in the first example, the word applies to the preceding afirmation. The Lord hath spoken good, which speaking good is _concerning_ Israel. _concerning_ in this case, refers to the first clause of the sentence.
