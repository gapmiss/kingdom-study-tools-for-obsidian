# Cuckoo

**CUCKOO**, _noun_ \[Latin , Gr. See [[Gawk]].\] A bird of the genus Cuculus, whose name is supposed to be called from its note. The note is a call to love, and continued only during the amorous season. It is said the _cuckoo_ lays its eggs in a nest formed by another bird, by which they are hatched.
