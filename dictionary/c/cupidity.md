# Cupidity

**CUPIDITY**, _noun_ \[Latin , to desire, to covet.\] An eager desire to possess something; an ardent wishing or longing; inordinate or unlawful desire of wealth or power. It is not used, I believe, for the animal appetite, like lust or concupiscence, but for desire of the mind.

No property is secure when it becomes large enough to tempt the _cupidity_ of indigent power.
