# Century

**CENTURY**, _noun_

**1.** In a general sense, a hundred; any thing consisting of a hundred parts.

**2.** A division of the Roman people for the purpose of electing magistrates and enacting laws, the people voting by centuries; also, a company consisting of a hundred men.

**3.** A period of a hundred years. This is the most common signification of the word; and as we begin our modern computation of time from the incarnation of Christ, the word is generally applied to some term of a hundred years subsequent to that event; as the fist or second _century_ or the tenth _century_ If we intend to apply the word to a different era, we use an explanatory adjunct; as the third _century_ before the Christian era, or after the reign of Cyrus.

**4.** The Centuries of Magdeburg, a title given to an ecclesiastical history, arranged in 13 centuries, compiled by a great number of Protestants at Magdeburg.
