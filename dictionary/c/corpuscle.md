# Corpuscle

**CORPUSCLE**, _noun_ \[Latin , body.\] A minute particle, or physical atom; corpuscles are the very small bodies which compose large bodies, not the elementary principles of matter, but such small particles simple or compound, as are not dissolved or dissipated by ordinary heat.

It will add much to our satisfaction, if those corpuscles can be discovered by microscopes.
