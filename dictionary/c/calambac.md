# Calambac

**CALAMBAC**, _noun_ Aloes-wood, xyloe-aloes, a drug, which is the product of a tree growing in China and some of the Indian isles. It is of a light spungy texture, very porous, and the pores so filled with a soft fragrant resin, that it may be indented by the fingers and chewed like mastich. It is also called tambac. The two coarser kinds are called lignum aloes, and calambour.
