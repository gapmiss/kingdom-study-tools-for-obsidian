# Companion

**COMPANION**, _noun_

**1.** One who keeps company with another; one with whom a person frequently associates, and converses. It differs from friend, says Johnson, as acquaintance from confidence. The word does not necessarily imply friendship; but a _companion_ is often or generally a friend.

A _companion_ of fools shall be destroyed. [[Proverbs 13#20|Proverbs 13:20]].

**2.** One who accompanies another; as two persons meeting casually and traveling together are called companions. So soldiers are called companions in arms.

**3.** A partner; an associate.

Epaphroditus, my brother, and _companion_ in labor, and fellow soldier. [[Philippians 2#25|Philippians 2:25]].

**4.** A fellow; a mate.

**5.** A sort of wooden porch placed over the entrance or stair case of the cabin in merchant ships. Hence the ladder by which officers ascend to and descend from the quarter deck is called the _companion_ ladder.
