# Circumvallation

**CIRCUMVALLATION**, _noun_

**1.** In the art of war, a surrounding with a wall or rampart; also, a wall, rampart, or parapet with a trench, surrounding the camp of a besieging army, to prevent desertion, and guard the army against any attempt of an enemy to relieve the place besieged.

**2.** The rampart, or fortification surrounding a besieged place.

\[Note. This word, from the Latin, vallo, or vallum, vallus, denotes properly the wall or rampart thrown up; but as the rampart is formed by entrenching, and the trench makes a part of the fortification, the word is applied to both. See [[Eng]]. Wall.\]
