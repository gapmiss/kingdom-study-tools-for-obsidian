# Cringle

**CRINGLE**, _noun_ \[See [[Crank and Cringe]].\]

**1.** A withe for fastening a gate. \[Local.\]

**2.** In marine language, a hole in the boltrope of a sail, formed by intertwisting the division of a rope, called a strand, alternately round itself, and through the strand of the colt-rope, till it becomes three-fold, and takes the shape of a ring. Its use is to receive the ends of the ropes by which the sail is drawn up to its yard, or to extend the leech by the bow-line-bridles.

Iron-cringles or hanks, are open rings running on the stays, to which the heads of the stay sails are made fast.
