# Climate

**CLIMATE**, _noun_

**1.** In geography, a part of the surface of the earth, bounded by two circles parallel to the equator, and of such a breadth that the longest day in the parallel nearest the pole is half an hour longer than that nearest to the equator. The beginning of a _climate_ is a parallel circle in which the longest day is half and hour shorter than that at the end. The climates begin at the equator, where the day is 12 hours long; and at the end of the first _climate_ the longest day is 12 hours long, and this increase of half an hour constitutes a _climate_ to the polar circles; from which climates are measured by the increase of a month.

**2.** In a popular sense, a tract of land, region or country, differing from another in the temperature of the air; or any region or country with respect to the temperature of the air, the seasons, and their peculiar qualities, without any regard to the length of the days, or to geographical position. Thus we say, a warm or cold climate; a moist or dry climate; a happy climate; a genial climate; a mountainous _climate_

**CLIMATE**, _verb intransitive_ To dwell; to reside in a particular region.
