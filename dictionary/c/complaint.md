Even to day is my _complaint_ bitter. [[Job 23#2|Job 23:2]].

**2.** The cause or subject of _complaint_ or murmuring.

The poverty of the clergy hath been the _complaint_ of all who wish well to the church.

**3.** The cause of _complaint_ or of pain and uneasiness in the body; a malady; a disease; usually applied to disorders not violent; as a _complaint_ in the bowels or breast.

**4.** Accusation; a charge against an offender, made by a private person or informer to a justice of the peace or other proper officer, alleging that the offender has violated the law, and claiming the penalty due to the prosecutor.
