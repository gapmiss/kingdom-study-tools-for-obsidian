# Clover

**CLOVER**,

**CLOVER**\-GRASS, _noun_ A genus of plants, called Trifolium, trefoil, or three-leafed, Fr. trefle. The species are numerous. The red _clover_ is generally cultivated for fodder and for enriching land. The white _clover_ is also excellent food for cattle, either green or dry, and from its flowers the bee collects no small portion of its stores of honey.

To live in _clover_ is to live luxuriously, or in abundance; a phrase borrowed from the luxuriant growth of _clover_ and the feeding of cattle in _clover_
