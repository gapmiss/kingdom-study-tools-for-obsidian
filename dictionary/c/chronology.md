# Chronology

**CHRONOLOGY**, _noun_ The science of time; the method of measuring, or computing time by regular divisions or periods, according to the revolutions of the sun, or moon; of ascertaining the true periods or years when past events or transactions took place; and arranging them in their proper order according to their dates.

If history without _chronology_ is dark and confused; _chronology_ without history is dry and insipid.
