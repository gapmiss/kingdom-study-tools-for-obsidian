# Contradiction

**CONTRADICTION**, _noun_ \[Latin\]

**1.** An assertion of the contrary to what has been said or affirmed; denial; contrary declaration.

**2.** Opposition, whether by words, reproaches or attempts to defeat.

Consider him that endured such _contradiction_ of sinners against himself. [[Hebrews 12#3|Hebrews 12:3]].

**3.** Direct opposition or repugnancy; inconsistency with itself; incongruity or contrariety of things, words, thoughts or propositions. These theorems involve a _contradiction_

If we perceive truth, we thereby perceive whatever is false in _contradiction_ to it.
