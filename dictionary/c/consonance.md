# Consonance

**CONSONANCE**, _noun_ \[Latin , to sound together; to sound. See [[Sound and Tone]].\]

**1.** Accord or agreement of sounds. In music, _consonance_ is an accord of sounds which produces an agreeable sensation in the ear, as the third, fifth and eighth. It denotes also the according intervals. When the interval of a _consonance_ is invariable, it is called perfect; but when it may be either major or minor, it is termed imperfect.

**2.** Agreement; accord; congruity; consistency; agreeableness; suitableness; as the _consonance_ of opinions among judges; the _consonance_ of a ritual to the scriptures.
