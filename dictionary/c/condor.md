# Condor

**CONDOR**, _noun_ The largest species of fowl hitherto discovered; a native of South America. Some naturalists class it with the vulture; others, with the eagle. The wings of the largest, when expanded, are said to extend 15 or 18 feet; and the fowl has strength to bear off a calf or a deer.

The size of the _condor_ has been greatly exaggerated. It is about the size of the Lammer-geyer or vulture of the Alps, which it resembles in its habits. It is properly a vulture.
