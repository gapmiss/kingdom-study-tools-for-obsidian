**CLOUT**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To patch; to mend by sewing on a piece or patch; as clouted shoon, in Milton. This is the sense as understood by Johnson. Mason understands the word clouted to signify nailed, studded with small nails, from the French clouter, and the following words in Shakespeare, Whose rudeness answered my steps too loud, give some countenance to Masons interpretation. In this case, the verb _clout_ must signify, to nail, or fasten with nails; to stud.

**2.** To cover with a piece of cloth.

**3.** To join clumsily; as clouted sentences.

**4.** To cover or arm with an iron plate.

**5.** To strike; to give a blow.

**CLOUT**ed cream, in Gay, is evidently a mistake for clotted cream.
