# Chirograph

**CHIROGRAPH**, _noun_

**1.** Anciently a deed, which, requiring a counterpart, was engrossed twice on the same piece of parchment, with a space between, in which was written _chirograph_ through which the parchment was cut, and one part given to each party. It answered to what is now called a charter-party.

**2.** A fine, so called from the manner of engrossing, which is still retained in the chirographers office in England.
