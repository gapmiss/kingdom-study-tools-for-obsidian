# Chorography

**CHOROGRAPHY**, _noun_ The art or practice of making a map of a particular region, country, or province; or of marking its limits, bounds or position. _chorography_ differs from geography, as the description of a particular country differs from that of the whole earth; and from topography, as the description of a country differs from that of a town, city or district.
