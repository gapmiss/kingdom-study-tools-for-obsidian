**1.** One who frequents any place of sale for the sake of purchasing goods; one who purchases goods or wares.

**2.** One who frequents or visits any place for procuring what he wants. We say, a mill has many customers. Hence a person who receives supplies is called a customer; the smith, the shoemaker and the tailor have their customers; and the coffee-house has its customers.
