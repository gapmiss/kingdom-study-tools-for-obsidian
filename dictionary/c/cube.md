**CUBE**, _noun_ \[Gr., Latin , a die or cube; to set or throw down, that which is set or laid, a solid mass.\]

**1.** In geometry, a regular solid body, with six equal sides, and containing equal angles.

**2.** In arithmetic, the product of a number multiplied into itself, and that product multiplied into the same number; or it is formed by multiplying any number twice by itself; as, 4 times 4 = 16, and 16 times 4 = 64, the _cube_ of 4.

The law of the planets is, that the squares of the times of their revolutions are in proportion to the cubes of their mean distances.

**CUBE** root, is the number or quantity, which, multiplied into itself, and then into the product, produces the cube; or which, twice multiplied into itself, produces the number of which it is the root; thus, 3 is the _cube_ root or side of 27, for 3 times 3 = 9, and 3 times 9 = 27.
