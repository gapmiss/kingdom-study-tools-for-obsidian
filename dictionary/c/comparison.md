# Comparison

**COMPARISON**, _noun_

**1.** The act of comparing; the act of considering the relation between persons or things, with a view to discover their agreement or resemblance, or their disagreement or difference.

We learn to form a correct estimate of men and their actions by _comparison_

**2.** The state of being compared.

If we rightly estimate what we call good and evil, we shall find it lies much in _comparison_

**3.** Comparative estimate; proportion.

Who is left among you that saw this house in its first glory? And how do you see it now? Is it not in your eyes in _comparison_ of it as nothing? [[Haggai 2#3|Haggai 2:3]].

**4.** In grammar, the formation of an adjective in its several degrees of signification; as strong, stronger, strongest; greenish, green, greener, greenest; glorious, more glorious, most glorious. In English, there are strictly four degrees of _comparison_

**5.** A simile, similitude, or illustration by similitude.

Whereto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what _comparison_ shall we compare it? [[Mark 4#30|Mark 4:30]].

**6.** In rhetoric, a figure by which two things are considered with regard to a third, which is common to them both; as, a hero is like a lion in courage. Here courage is common to hero and lion, and constitutes the point of resemblance.

The distinction between similitude and _comparison_ is, that the former has reference to the quality; the latter, to the quantity. _comparison_ is between more and less; similitude is between good and gad. Hannibal--hung like a tempest on the declivities of the Alps--is a likeness by similitude. The sublimity of the scriptural prophets exceeds that of Homer, as much as thunder is louder than a whisper--is a likeness by _comparison_

But _comparison_ has reference to quality as well as quantity.
