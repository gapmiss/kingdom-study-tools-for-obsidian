# Crustalogy

**CRUSTALOGY**, _noun_ \[Latin , a shell, Gr., discourse.\] That part of zoology which treats of crustaceous animals, arranging them in orders, tribes and families, and describing their forms and habits.

\[Crustaceology, the word sometimes used, is ill-formed, and its derivatives inconveniently long. Who can endure such words as crustaceological?\]
