# Contraries

**CONTRARIES**, _noun_ \[See [[Contrary]].\] In logic, propositions which destroy each other, but of which the falsehood of one does not establish the truth of the other.

If two universals differ in quality, they are contraries; as, every vine is a tree; no vine is a tree. These can never be both true together; but they may be both false.
