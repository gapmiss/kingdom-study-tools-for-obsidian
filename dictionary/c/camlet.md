# Camlet

**CAMLET**, _noun_ A stuff originally made of camels hair. It is now made, sometimes of wool, sometimes of silk, sometimes of hair, especially that of goats, with wool or silk. In some, the warp is silk and wool twisted together, and the woof is hair. The pure oriental _camlet_ is made solely from the hair of a sort of goat, about Angora. Camlets are now make in Europe.
