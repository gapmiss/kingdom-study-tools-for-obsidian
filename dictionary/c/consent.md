# Consent

**CONSENT**, _noun_ \[Latin , to be of one mind, to agree; to think, feel or perceive. See [[Sense and Assent]].\]

**1.** Agreement of the mind to what is proposed or state by another; accord; hence, a yielding of the mind or will to that which is proposed; as, a parent gives his _consent_ to the marriage of his daughter. We generally use this word in cases where power, rights, and claims are concerned. We give _consent_ when we yield that which we have a right to withhold; but we do not give _consent_ to a mere opinion, or abstract proposition. In this case, we give our assent. But assent is also used in conceding what we may withhold. We give our assent to the marriage of a daughter. Consequently, assent has a more extensive application than _consent_ But the distinction is not always observed. _consent_ often amounts to permission.

Defraud ye not one another, except with _consent_ for a time. [[1 Corinthians 7#5|1 Corinthians 7:5]].

**2.** Accord of minds; agreement; unity of opinion.

All with one _consent_ began to make excuse. [[Luke 14#18|Luke 14:18]].

**3.** Agreement; coherence; correspondence in parts, qualities, or operation.

Such is the worlds great harmony that springs from union, order, full _consent_ of things.

**4.** In the animal economy, an agreement, or sympathy, by which one affected part of the system affects some distant part. This _consent_ is supposed to exist in, or be produced by the nerves; and the affections to be communicated from one part to another by means of their ramifications and distribution through the body. Thus, the stone in the bladder, by vellicating the fibers, will produce spasms and colic in the bowels; a shameful thing seen or heard will produce blushing in the cheeks. But many facts indicate that other causes than nervous communication produce sympathy.

**CONSENT**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin See the Noun.\]

**1.** Literally, to think with another. Hence, to agree or accord. More generally, to agree in mind and will; to yield to what one has the power, the right, or the disposition to withhold, or refuse to grant.
