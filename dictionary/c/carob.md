# Carob

**CAROB**, _noun_ The carob-tree, Ceratonia siliqua, a native of Spain, Italy, and the Levant. It is an evergreen, growing in hedges, and producing long, flat, brown-colored pods, filled with a mealy, succulent pulp, of a sweetish taste. In times of scarcity, these pods are eaten by poor people, but they are apt to cause griping and lax bowels.
