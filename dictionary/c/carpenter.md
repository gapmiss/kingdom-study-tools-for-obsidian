# Carpenter

**CARPENTER**, _noun_ An artificer who works in timber; a framer and builder of houses, and of ships. Those who build houses are called house-carpenters, and those who build ships are called ship-carpenters.

In New England, a distinction is often made between the man who frames, and the man who executes the interior wood-work of a house. The framer is the _carpenter_ and the finisher is called joiner. This distinction is noticed by Johnson, and seems to be a genuine English distinction. But in some other parts of America, as in New-York, the term _carpenter_ includes both the framer and the joiner; and in truth both branches of business are often performed by the same person. The word is never applied, as in Italy and Spain, to a coach-maker.
