# Calyx

**CALYX**, _noun_ _plural_ calyxes. The outer covering of a flower, being the termination of the cortical epidermis or outer bark of the plant, which, in most plants, incloses and supports the bottom of the corol. In Linnes system, it comprehends the perianth, the involucrum, the ament, the spath, the glume, the calyptra, and the volva. But in general it signifies the perianth, and the leaves are generally green.

The opinion of Linne that the _calyx_ is the continuation of the epidermis is now considered erroneous.
