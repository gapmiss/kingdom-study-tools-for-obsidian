# Clerk

**CLERK**, _noun_

**1.** A clergyman, or ecclesiastic; a man in holy orders.

**2.** A man that can read.

Everyone that could read--being accounted a _clerk_

**3.** A man of letters; a scholar.

The foregoing significations are found in the English laws, and histories of the church; as in the rude ages of the church, learning was chiefly confined to the clergy. In modern usage.

**4.** A writer; one who is employed in the use of the pen, in an office public or private, for keeping records, and accounts; as the _clerk_ of a court. In some cases _clerk_ is synonymous with secretary; but not always. A _clerk_ is always an officer subordinate to a higher officer, board, corporation or person; whereas, a secretary may be either a subordinate officer, or the head of an office or department.

**5.** A layman who is the reader of responses in church service.
