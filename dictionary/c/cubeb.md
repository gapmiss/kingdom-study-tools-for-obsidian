# Cubeb

**CUBEB**, _noun_ The small spicy berry of the Piper cubeba, from Java and the other E. India isles. It was formerly called, from its short stems, Piper caudatum, or tailed pepper. It resembles a grain of pepper, but is somewhat longer. In aromatic warmth and pungency, it is far inferior to pepper.
