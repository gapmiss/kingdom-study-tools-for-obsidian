# Congratulate

**CONGRATULATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin , grateful, pleasing. See [[Grace]].\] To profess ones pleasure or joy to another on account of an event deemed happy or fortunate, as on the birth of a child, success in an enterprise, victory, escape from danger, etc.; to wish joy to another. We _congratulate_ the nation on the restoration of peace.

Formerly this verb was followed by to. The subjects of England may _congratulate_ to themselves. But this use of to is entirely obsolete. The use of with after this verb, I _congratulate_ with my country, is perhaps less objectionable, but is rarely used. The intransitive sense of the verb may therefore be considered as antiquated, and no longer legitimate.
