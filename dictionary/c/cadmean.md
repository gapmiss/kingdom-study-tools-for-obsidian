# Cadmean

**CADMEAN**,

CADMIA, _noun_ An oxyd of zink which collects on the sides of furnaces where zink is sublimed, as in brass founderies. This substance is readily volatilized on charcoal, by the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, and it burns with the usual beautiful combustion of zink. Pulverized, mixed with charcoal powder, wrapped in sheet copper, and heated with the compound blowpipe, it readily forms brass.
