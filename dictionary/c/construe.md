# Construe

**CONSTRUE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin See [[Construct]].\]

**1.** To arrange words in their natural order; to reduce from a transposed to a natural order, so as to discover the sense of a sentence; hence, to interpret; and when applied to a foreign language, to translate; to render into English; as, to _construe_ Greek, Latin or French.

**2.** To interpret; to explain; to show or to understand the meaning.

I pray that I may not be so understood or construed.

Thus we are put to _construe_ and paraphrase our own words.
