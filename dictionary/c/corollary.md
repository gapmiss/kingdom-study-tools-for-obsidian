# Corollary

**COROLLARY**, _noun_ \[Latin , coronet, a crown.

**1.** A conclusion or consequence drawn from premises, or from what is advanced or demonstrated. If it is demonstrated that a triangle which has equal sides, has also equal angles, it follows as a _corollary_ that a triangle which has three equal sides, has its three angles equal.

A _corollary_ is an inference from a preceding proposition.
