# Carat

**CARAT**, _noun_

**1.** The weight of four grains, used by gold-smiths and jewelers in weighing precious stones and pearls.

**2.** The weight that expresses the fineness of gold. The whole mass of gold is divided into 24 equal parts, and as many 24th parts as it contains of pure gold, it is called gold of so many carats. Thus gold of twenty-two parts of pure metal, is gold of twenty-two carats. The _carat_ in Great Britain is divided into four grains; among the Germans into twelve parts; and among the French into thirty-two.

**3.** The value of any thing.
