# Church

**CHURCH**, _noun_

**1.** A house consecrated to the worship of God, among Christians; the Lords house. This seems to be the original meaning of the word. The Greek, to call out or call together, denotes an assembly or collection. But, Lord, a term applied by the early Christians to Jesus Christ; and the house in which they worshipped was named from the title. So _church_ goods, bona ecclesiastica; the Lords day, dies dominica.

**6.** The worshipers of Jehovah or the true God, before the advent of Christ; as the Jewish _church_

**7.** The body of clergy, or ecclesiastics, in distinction from the laity. Hence, ecclesiastical authority.
