# Condense

**CONDENSE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin , to make thick or close. See [[Dense]].\]

**1.** To make more close, thick or compact; to cause the particles of a body to approach, or to unite more closely, either by their own attraction or affinity, or by mechanical force. Thus, vapor is said to be condensed into water by the application of cold; and air is condensed in a tube by pressure. Hence the word is sometimes equivalent to compress.

**2.** To make thick; to inspissate; applied to soft compressible substances.

**3.** To compress into a smaller compass, or into a close body; to crowd; applied to separate individuals. Thus we say to _condense_ ideas into a smaller compass.

**CONDENSE**, _verb intransitive_ To become close or more compact, as the particles of a body; to approach or unite more closely; to grow thick.

Vapors _condense_ and coalesce into small parcels.

**CONDENSE**, _adjective_ Close in texture or composition; compact; firm; dense; condensated. \[See [[Dense]], which is generally used.\]
