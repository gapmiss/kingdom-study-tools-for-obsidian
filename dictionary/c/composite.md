# Composite

**COMPOSITE**, _adjective_ In architecture, the _composite_ order is the last of the five orders of columns; so called because its capital is composed out of those of the other orders or columns, borrowing a quarter-round from the Tuscan and Doric, a row of leaves from the Corinthian, and volutes from the Ionic. Its cornice has simple modillions or dentils. It is called also the Roman or the Italic order.

**COMPOSITE** numbers are such as can be measured exactly by a number exceeding unity, as 6 by 2 or e; so that r is the lowest _composite_ number. _composite_ numbers between themselves, are those which have a common measure besides unity; as 12 and 15, both which are measured by e.
