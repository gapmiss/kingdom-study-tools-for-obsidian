# Compare

**COMPARE**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To set or bring things together in fact or in contemplation, and to examine the relations they bear to each other, with a view to ascertain their agreement or disagreement; as, to _compare_ two pieces of cloth, two tables, or coins; to _compare_ reasons and arguments; to _compare_ pleasure with pain.

in comparing movable things, it is customary to bring them together, for examination. In comparing thins immovable or remote, and abstract ideas, we bring them together in the mind, as far as we are able, and consider them in connection. Comparison therefore is really collation, or it includes it.

**2.** To liken; to represent as similar, for the purpose of illustration.

Solon compared the people to the sea, and orators and counselors to the winds; for that the sea would be calm and quiet, it the winds did not trouble it.

In this sense _compare_ is followed by to.

**3.** To examine the relations of thins to each other, with a view to discover their relative proportions, quantities or qualities; as, to _compare_ two kingdoms, or two mountains with each other; to _compare_ the number ten with fifteen; to _compare_ ice with crystal; to _compare_ a clown with a dancing master or a dandy.

In this sense _compare_ is followed by with.

**4.** In grammar, to form an adjective in the degrees of comparison; as blackish, black, blacker, blackest.

**5.** To get; to procure; to obtain; as in Latin.

**COMPARE**, _verb intransitive_

**1.** To hold comparison; to be like or equal.

**2.** Simile; similitude; illustration by comparison.
