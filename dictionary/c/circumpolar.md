# Circumpolar

**CIRCUMPOLAR**, _adjective_ About the pole; an appellation given to stars, which are so near the north pole, as to revolve round it without setting. The number of these depends on the latitude of the spectator. We apply it to the north polar region and stars, but the word is applicable to either pole.
