# Corody

**CORODY**, CORRODY, _noun_ An allowance of meat, drink or clothing, due to the king from an abbey or other religious house, for the sustenance of such one of his servants, as he thinks good to bestow on it. An allowance for the maintenance of any of the kings servants living in an abbey.

Corodies are a right of sustenance, or to receive certain allotments of victuals and provision for ones maintenance. In lieu of which, a pension or sum of money is sometimes substituted.

The king is entitled to a _corody_ out of every bishopric, that is, to send one of his chaplains to be maintained by the bishop, or to have a pension allowed, till the bishop promotes him to a benefice. \[This has fallen into disuse.\] According to the Italian, the latter word is the correct orthography.
