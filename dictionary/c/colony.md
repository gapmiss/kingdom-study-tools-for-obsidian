# Colony

**COLONY**, _noun_

**1.** A company or body of people transplanted from their mother country to a remote province or country to cultivate and inhabit it, and remaining subject to the jurisdiction of the parent state; as the British colonies in America or the Indies; the Spanish colonies in South America. When such settlements cease to be subject to the parent state, they are no longer denominated colonies.

The first settles of New England were the best of Englishmen, well educated, devout Christians, and zealous lovers of liberty. There was never a _colony_ formed of better materials.

**2.** The country planted or colonized; a plantation; also, the body of inhabitants in a territory colonized, including the descendants of the first planters. The people, though born in the territory, retain the name of colonists, till they cease to be subjects of the parent state.

**3.** A collection of animals; as colonies of shell-fish.
