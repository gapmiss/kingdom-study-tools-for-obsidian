# Cloister

**CLOISTER**, _noun_

**1.** Literally, a close; a close, or inclosed place. A monastery or nunnery; a house inhabited by monks or nuns. In a more limited sense, the principal part of a regular monastery, consisting of a square, erected between the church, the chapter-house and the refectory, and over which is the dormitory. The proper use of the _cloister_ is for the monks to meet in for conversation. The _cloister_ is square, and has its name from being inclosed on its four sides with buildings. Hence in architecture, a building is said to be in the form of a _cloister_ when there are buildings on each of the four sides of the court.

**2.** A peristyle; a piazza.
