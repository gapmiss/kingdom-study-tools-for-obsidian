When the merchant gives a _credit_ he sells his wares on an expressed or implied promise that the purchaser will pay for them at a future time. The seller believes in the solvability and probity of the purchaser, and delivers his goods on that belief or trust; or he delivers them on the _credit_ or reputation of the purchaser. The purchaser takes what is sold, on _credit_ In like manner, money is loaned on the _credit_ of the borrower.

**9.** Public _credit_ the confidence which men entertain in the ability and disposition of a nation, to make good its engagements with its creditors; or the estimation in which individuals hold the public promises of payment, whether such promises are expressed or implied. The term is also applied to the general _credit_ of individuals in a nation; when merchants and others are wealthy, and punctual in fulfilling engagements; or when they transact business with honor fidelity; or when transfers of property are made with ease for ready payment. So we speak of the _credit_ of a bank, when general confidence is placed in its ability to redeem its notes; and the _credit_ of a mercantile house rests on its supposed ability and probity, which induce men to trust to its engagements.
