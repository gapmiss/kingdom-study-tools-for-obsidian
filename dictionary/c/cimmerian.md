# Cimmerian

**CIMMERIAN**, _adjective_ Pertaining to Cimmerium, a town at the mouth of the Palus Maeotis. The ancients pretended that this country was involved in darkness; whence the phrase _cimmerian_ darkness, to denote a deep or continual obscurity. The country is now called Crimea, or Krim-Tartary.
