# Challenge

**CHALLENGE**, _noun_ Literally, a calling, or crying out, the primary sense of many words expressing a demand, as claim. Hence appropriately,

**1.** A calling upon one to fight in single combat; an invitation or summons, verbal or written, to decide a controversy by a duel. Hence the letter containing the summons is also called a _challenge_

**2.** A claim or demand made of a right or supposed right.

There must be no _challenge_ of superiority.

**3.** Among hunters, the opening and crying of hounds at the first finding the scent of their game.

**4.** In law, an exception to jurors; the claim of a party that certain jurors shall not sit in trial upon him or his cause; that is, a calling them off. The right of _challenge_ is given both in civil and criminal trials, for certain causes which are supposed to disqualify a juror to be an impartial judge. The right of _challenge_ extends either to the whole panel or array, or only to particular jurors, called a _challenge_ to the polls. A principal _challenge_ is that which the law allows without cause assigned. A _challenge_ to the favor, is when the party alleges a special cause. In criminal cases, a prisoner may _challenge_ twenty jurors, without assigning a cause. This is called a peremptory _challenge_
