**1.** A small inlet, bay or cove; a recess in the shore of the sea, or of a river.

They discovered a certain _creek_ with a shore. [[Acts 27#39|Acts 27:39]].

**2.** Any turn in winding.

**3.** A prominence or jut in a winding coast. \[This sense is probably not legitimate.\]

**4.** In some of the American States, a small river. This sense is not justified by etymology, but as streams often enter into creeks and small bays or form them, the name has been extended to small streams in general.
