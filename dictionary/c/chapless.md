# Chapless

**CHAPLESS**, _noun_

**1.** A garland or wreath to be worn on the head; the circle of a crown.

**2.** A string of beads used by the Roman Catholics, by which they count the number of their prayers. They are made sometimes of coral, of wood, of diamonds, etc., and are called parternosters. The invention is ascribed to Peter the hermit, who probably learnt it in the East, as the Orientals use a kind of chaplet, called a chain, rehearsing one of the perfections of God on each link, or head. The Great Mogul is said to have eighteen of these chains, all precious tones. The Turks also use a kind of chaplet in reciting their prayers.

**3.** In architecture, a little molding, carved into round beads, pearls, olives or the like.

**4.** In horsemanship, a chapelet, which see.

**5.** A tuft of feathers on a peacocks head.

**6.** A small chapel or shrine.
