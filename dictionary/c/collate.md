# Collate

**COLLATE**, _verb transitive_ Literally, to bring or lay together. Hence,

**1.** To lay together and compare, by examining the points in which two or more things of a similar kind agree or disagree; applied particularly to manuscripts and books; as, to _collate_ copies of the Hebrew Scriptures.

**2.** To confer or bestow a benefice on a clergyman, by a bishop who has it in his own gift or patronage; or more strictly, to present and institute a clergyman in a benefice, when the same person is both the ordinary and the patron; followed by to.

If the patron neglects to present, the bishop may _collate_ his clerk to the church.

**3.** To bestow or confer; but now seldom used, except as in the second definition.

**COLLATE**, _verb intransitive_ To place in a benefice, as by a bishop.

If the bishop neglects to _collate_ within six months, the right to do it devolves on the archbishop.
