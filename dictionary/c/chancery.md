# Chancery

**CHANCERY**, _noun_

**1.** In Great Britain, the highest court of justice, next to the parliament, consisting of two distinct tribunals; one ordinary, being a court of common law; the other extraordinary, or a court of equity. The ordinary legal court holds pleas of recognizance acknowledged in the _chancery_ writs of scire facias, for repeal of letters patent, writs of partition, and all personal action by or against any officer of the court. But if the parties come to issue, in fact, this court cannot try it by a jury; but the record must be delivered to the kings bench. Rom this court issue all original writs that pass under the great seal, commissions of charitable uses, bankruptcy, idiocy, lunacy, etc.

The extraordinary court, or court of equity, proceeds upon rules of equity and conscience, moderates the rigor of the common law, and gives relief in cases where there is no remedy in the common law courts.

**2.** In the United States, a court of equity.
