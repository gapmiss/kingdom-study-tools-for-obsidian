# Capitulary

**CAPITULARY**, _noun_

**1.** An act passed in a chapter, either of knights, canons or religious.

**2.** The body of laws or statutes of a chapter, or of an ecclesiastical council. This name is also given to the laws, civil and ecclesiastical, made by Charlemagne, and other princes, in general councils and assemblies of the people. Some indeed have alledged that these are supplements to laws. They are so called, because they are divided into chapters or sections.

**3.** The member of a chapter.
