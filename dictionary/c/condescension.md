# Condescension

**CONDESCENSION**, _noun_ Voluntary descent from rank, dignity or just claims; relinquishment of strict right; submission to inferiors in granting requests or performing acts which strict justice does not require. Hence, courtesy.

It forbids pride and commands humility, modesty and _condescension_ to others.

Raphael, amidst his tenderness, shows such a dignity and _condescension_ in all his behavior, as are suitable to a superior nature.
