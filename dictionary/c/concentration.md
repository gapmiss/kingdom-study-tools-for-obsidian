# Concentration

**CONCENTRATION**, _noun_ The act of concentrating; the act of bringing nearer together; collection into a central point; compression into a narrow space; the state of being brought to a point.

Note. The verb concentrate is sometimes accented on the first syllable. The reason is, with the primary accent on the first syllable, and a secondary accent on the third, the pronunciation of the participles, concentrating, concentrated, is much facilitated.
