# Chaff

**CHAFF**, _noun_

**1.** The husk, or dry calyx of corn, and grasses. In common language, the word is applied to the husks when separated from the corn by thrashing, riddling or winnowing. The word is sometimes used rather improperly to denote straw cut small for the food of cattle.

**2.** Refuse; worthless matter; especially that which is light, and apt to be driven by the wind. In scripture, false doctrines, fruitless designs, hypocrites and ungodly men are compared to _chaff_ [[Psalms 1#4|Psalms 1:4]]; [[Jeremiah 23#28|Jeremiah 23:28]]; [[Isaiah 33#11|Isaiah 33:11]]; [[Matthew 3#12|Matthew 3:12]].
