# Continency

CONTINENCE, CONTINENCY _noun_ \[Latin , to hold, or withhold; con and teneo, to hold. See [[Tenet]].\]

**1.** In a general sense, the restraint which a person imposes upon his desires and passions; self-command.

**2.** Appropriately, the restraint of the passion for sexual enjoyment; resistance of concupiscence; forbearance of lewd pleasures; hence, chastity. But the term is usually applied to males, as chastity is to females. Scipio the younger exhibited the nobles example of continence recorded in Pagan history; an example surpassed only by that of Joseph in sacred history.

**3.** Forbearance of lawful pleasure.

Content without lawful venery, is continence; without unlawful, is chastity.

**4.** Moderation in the indulgence of sexual enjoyment.

Chastity is either abstinence or continence; abstinence is that of virgins or widows; continence, that of married persons.

**5.** Continuity; uninterrupted course. \[Not now used.\]
