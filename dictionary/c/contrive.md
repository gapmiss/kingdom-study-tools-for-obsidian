# Contrive

**CONTRIVE**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To invent; to devise; to plan.

Our poet has always some beautiful design, which he first establishes, and then contrives the means which will naturally conduct him to his end.

**2.** To wear out.

\[This must be from the Latin Contero, contrivi, and if the French controuver, and Italian controvare, are the same word differently applied, the primary sense is, to invent by rubbing, that is, by ruminating; or to strike out, as in forge. But the word is probably from trouver, to find.\]

**CONTRIVE**, _verb intransitive_ To form or design; to plan; to scheme.

How shall we _contrive_ to hide our shame? \[This verb is really transitive, but followed by a verb, in the place of an object or name.\]
