# Chert

**CHERT**, _noun_ In mineralogy, a subspecies of rhomboidal quartz; called also hornstone, petrosilex or rock flint. It is less hard than common quartz; its fracture usually dull and splintery, sometimes more or less conchoidal. It is more or less translucent, sometimes at the edges, and sometimes the whole mass, if thin, has the strong translucency of certain horns. Its colors are numerous and usually dull. It is usually amorphous, sometimes globular, or in nodules. It occurs often in veins, especially metallic, in primitive mountains.

**CHERT** is also applied to other minerals besides hornstone. Aikin calls a variety of flint, flinty _chert_ and the Derbyshire miners apply the term, black _chert_ to a fusible mineral, whereas the hornstone above described is infusible.
