**CONTRAST**, _noun_

**1.** Opposition or dissimilitude of figures, by which one contributes to the visibility or effect of the other. _contrast_ in this sense, is applicable to things of a similar kind. We never speak of a _contrast_ between a man and a mountain, or between a dog and a tree; but we observe the _contrast_ between an oak and a shrub, and between a palace and a cottage.

**2.** Opposition, or difference of position, attitude, etc., of figures, or of their several members; as in painting and sculpture.

**3.** Opposition of things or qualities; or the placing of opposite things in view, to exhibit the superior excellence of one to more advantage. What a _contrast_ between modesty and impudence, or between a well-bred man and a clown!
