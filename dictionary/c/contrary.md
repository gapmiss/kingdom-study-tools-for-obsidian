This adjective, in many phrases, is to be treated grammatically as an adverb, or as an adjective referring to a sentence or affirmation; as, this happened _contrary_ to my expectations. The word here really belongs to the affirmation or fact declared, this happened; for _contrary_ does not, like an adverb, express the manner of happening, but that the fact itself was _contrary_ to my expectation. According, agreeable, pursuant, antecedent, prior, anterior, etc., are often used in the like manner.
