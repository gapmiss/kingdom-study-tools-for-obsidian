# Conjugate

**CONJUGATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin , to couple; to yoke, to marry. See [[Join and Yoke]].\]

**1.** To join; to unite in marriage. \[Not now used.\]

**2.** In grammar, to distribute the parts or inflections of a verb, into the several voices, modes, tenses, numbers and persons, so as to show their connections, distinctions, and modes of formation. Literally, to connect all the inflectious of a verb, according to their derivation, or all the variations of one verb. In English, as the verb undergoes few variations, conjugation consists chiefly in combining the words which unitedly form the several tenses in the several persons.
