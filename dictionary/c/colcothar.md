# Colcothar

**COLCOTHAR**, _noun_ The brown red oxyd of iron which remains after the distillation of the acid from sulphate of iron; used for polishing glass and other substances. It is called by artists crocus, or crocus martis.

The sulphate of iron is called _colcothar_ or chalcite, when the calcination has been carried so far as to drive off a considerable part of the acid.
