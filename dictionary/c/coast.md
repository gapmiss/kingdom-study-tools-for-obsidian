# Coast

**COAST**, _noun_

**1.** The exterior line, limit or border of a country, as in Scripture. From the river to the uttermost sea shall your _coast_ be. [[Deuteronomy 11#24|Deuteronomy 11:24]]. And ships shall come from the _coast_ of Chittim. [[Numbers 24#24|Numbers 24:24]]. Hence the word may signify the whole country within certain limits. [[Exodus 10#4|Exodus 10:4]].

**2.** The edge or margin of the land next to the sea; the sea-shore. This is the more common application of the word; and it seems to be used for sea-coast, the border of the sea. Hence it is never used for the bank of a river.

**3.** A side; applied to objects indefinitely, by Bacon and Newton. This is a correct use of the word, but now obsolete.

**4.** The country near the sea-shore; as, populous towns along the _coast_

The _coast_ is clear, is a proverbial phrase signifying, the danger is over; the enemies have marched off, or left the _coast_

**COAST**, _verb intransitive_

**1.** To sail near a coast; to sail by or near the shore, or in sight of land.

The ancients coasted only in their navigation.

**2.** To sail from port to port in the same country.

**COAST**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To sail by or near to; as, to _coast_ the American shore.

**2.** To draw near; to approach; to follow.
