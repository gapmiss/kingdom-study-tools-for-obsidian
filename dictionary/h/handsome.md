# Handsome

**HAND'SOME**, _adjective_

**1.** Properly, dexterous; ready; convenient.

For a thief it is so _handsome_ as it may seem it was first invented for him.

This sense is either from the original meaning of hand, or from the use of the hand, or rather of the right hand. In this sense the word is still used. We say of a well fought combat and victory, it is a _handsome_ affair, an affair well performed, done with dexterity or skill. \[See [[Handy]].\]

**2.** Moderately beautiful, as the person or other thing; well made; having symmetry of parts; well formed. It expresses less than beautiful or elegant; as a _handsome_ woman or man; she has a _handsome_ person or face. So we say, a _handsome_ house; a _handsome_ type.

**3.** Graceful in manner; marked with propriety and ease; as a _handsome_ address.

**4.** Ample; large; as _handsome_ fortune.

**5.** Neat; correct; moderately elegant; as a _handsome_ style or composition.

**6.** Liberal; generous; as a _handsome_ present.

The applications of this word in popular language are various and somewhat indefinite. In general, when applied to things, it imports that the form is agreeable to the eye, or to just taste; and when applied to manner, it conveys the idea of suitableness or propriety with grace.

**HAND'SOME**, as a verb, to render neat or beautiful, is not an authorized word.
