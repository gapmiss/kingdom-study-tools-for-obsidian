# Holy

**HO'LY**, _adjective_

**1.** Properly, whole, entire or perfect, in a moral sense. Hence, pure in heart, temper or dispositions; free from sin and sinful affections. Applied to the Supreme Being, _holy_ signifies perfectly pure, immaculate and complete in moral character; and man is more or less _holy_ as his heart is more or less sanctified, or purified from evil dispositions. We call a man _holy_ when his heart is conformed in some degree to the image of God, and his life is regulated by the divine precepts. Hence, _holy_ is used as nearly synonymous with good, pious, godly.

Be ye holy; for I am _holy_ [[1 Peter 1#16|1 Peter 1:16]].

**2.** Hallowed; consecrated or set apart to a sacred use, or to the service or worship of God; a sense frequent in Scripture; as the _holy_ sabbath; _holy_ oil; _holy_ vessels; a _holy_ nation; the _holy_ temple; a _holy_ priesthood.

**3.** Proceeding from pious principles, or directed to pious purposes; as _holy_ zeal.

**4.** Perfectly just and good; as the _holy_ law of God.

**5.** Sacred; as a _holy_ witness.
