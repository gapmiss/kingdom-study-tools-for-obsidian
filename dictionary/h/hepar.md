# Hepar

**HE'PAR**, _noun_ \[Latin _hepar_ the liver.\] A combination of sulphur with an alkali was formerly called by chimists _hepar_ sulphuris, liver of sulphur, from its brown red color. The term has been applied to all combinations of alkali or earth with sulphur or phosphorus.

The hepars are by modern chimists called sulphurets.
