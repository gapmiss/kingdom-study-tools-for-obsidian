# Harshness

**H'ARSHNESS**, _noun_ Roughness to the touch; opposed to softness and smoothness.

**1.** Sourness; austereness; as the _harshness_ of fruit.

**2.** Roughness to the ear; as the _harshness_ of sound or of a voice, or of verse.

_'Tis not enough no _harshness_ gives offense,_

The sound must seem an echo to the sense.
