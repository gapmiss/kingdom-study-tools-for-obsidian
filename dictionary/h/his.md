# His

**HIS**, _pronoun_ possessive of he, and pronounced hiz.

**1.** Of him. Thus in Alfred's Orosius, 'Sume for _his_ ege ne dorstan.' Some for fear of _his_ durst not; literally, for _his_ awe, for awe of him. Lib.3.8. In this instance, _his_ does not express what belongs to the antecedent of _his_ \[Philip, \] but the fear which others entertained of him.

**2.** The present use of _his_ is as a pronominal adjective, in any case indifferently, corresponding to the Latin suus. Thus, tell John _his_ papers are ready. I will deliver _his_ papers to _his_ messenger. He may take _his_ son's books. When the noun is omitted, _his_ stands as its substitute, either in the nominative or objective case. Tell John this book is _his_ He may take mine and I will take _his_

**3.** _his_ was formerly used for its, but improperly, and the use has ceased.

**4.** It was formerly used as the sign of the possessive. The man _his_ ground, for the man's ground. This use has also ceased.

**5.** _his_ is still used as a substitute for a noun, preceded by of; as all ye saints of his; he ministers of _his_

**HIS**self is no longer used.
