# Heliacal

**HELI'ACAL**, _adjective_ \[Latin heliacus; Gr. the sun.\]

Emerging from the light of the sun, or passing into it. The _heliacal_ rising of a star, is when, after being in conjunction with it and invisible, it emerges from the light so as to be visible in the morning before sunrising. On the contrary, the _heliacal_ setting of a star, is when the sun approaches so near as to render it invisible by its superior splendor.
