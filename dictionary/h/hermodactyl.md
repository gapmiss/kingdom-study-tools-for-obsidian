# Hermodactyl

**HERMODAC'TYL**, _noun_ \[Gr. Mercury, and a finger; Mercury's finger.\]

In the Materia Medic, a root brought from Turkey. It is in the shape of a heart flatted, of a white color, compact, but easy to be cut or pulverized, of a viscous sweetish taste, with a slight degree of acrimony. Some suppose it to be the root of the

Colchicum variegatum; others, the root of the Iris tuberosa. It was anciently in great repute as a cathartic; but that which is now furnished has little or no cathartic quality.
