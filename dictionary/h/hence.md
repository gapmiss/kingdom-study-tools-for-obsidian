**HENCE**, _adverb_ hens.

**1.** From this place.

Arise, let us go _hence_ [[John 14#31|John 14:31]].

I will send thee far _hence_ to the Gentiles. [[Acts 22#21|Acts 22:21]].

**2.** From this time; in the future; as a week hence; a year _hence_

**3.** From this cause or reason, noting a consequence, inference or deduction from something just before stated.

**HENCE** perhaps it is, that Solomon calls the fear of the Lord, the beginning of wisdom.

It sometimes denotes an inference or consequence, resulting from something that follows.

Come they not _hence_ even from your lusts--[[James 4#1|James 4:1]].

**4.** From this source or original.

All other faces borrowed hence--

**HENCE** signifies from this, and from before _hence_ is not strictly correct. But from _hence_ is so well established by custom, that it may not be practicable to correct the use of the phrase.

**HENCE** is used elliptically and imperatively, for go hence; depart hence; away; be gone.

**HENCE**, with your little ones.

**HENCE**, as a verb, to send off, as used by Sidney, is improper.
