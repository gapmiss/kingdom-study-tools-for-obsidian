# Hers

**HERS**, _pronoun_ hurz, _pronoun_ fem. possessive; as, this house is _hers_ that is, this is the house of her. But perhaps it would be more correct to consider _hers_ as a substitute for the noun and adjective, in the nominative case. Of the two houses, hers is the best, that is, her house is the best.
