# Holly

**HOL'LY**, _noun_ \[perhaps Latin ilex, for hilex; Latin celo.\]

The holm tree, of the genus Ilex, of several species. The common _holly_ grows from 20 to 30 feet high; the stem by age becomes large, and is covered with a grayish smooth bark, and set with branches which form a sort of cone. The leaves are oblong oval, of a lucid green on the upper surface, but pale on the under surface; the edges are indented and waved, with sharp thorns terminating each of the points. The flowers grow in clusters and are succeeded by roundish berries, which turn to a beautiful red about Michaelmas. This tree is a beautiful evergreen.
