# However

**HOWEV'ER**, _adverb_ \[how and ever.\] In whatever manner or degree; as, _however_ good or bad style may be.

**1.** At all events; at least.

Our chief end is to be freed from all, if it may be, _however_ from the greatest evils.

**2.** Nevertheless; notwithstanding; yet. I shall not oppose your design; I cannot _however_ approve of it.

You might howe'er have took a fairer way.
