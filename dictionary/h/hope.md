# Hope

**HOPE**, _noun_ \[Latin cupio.\]

**1.** A desire of some good, accompanied with at least a slight expectation of obtaining it, or a belief that it is obtainable. _hope_ differs from wish and desire in this, that it implies some expectation of obtaining the good desired, or the possibility of possessing it. _hope_ therefore always gives pleasure or joy; whereas wish and desire may produce or be accompanied with pain and anxiety.

The hypocrite's _hope_ shall perish. [[Job 8#13|Job 8:13]].

He wish'ed, but not with hope--

Sweet hope! kind cheat!

He that lives upon _hope_ will die fasting.

**2.** Confidence in a future event; the highest degree of well founded expectation of good; as a _hope_ founded on God's gracious promises; a scriptural sense.

A well founded scriptural _hope_ is, in our religion, the source of ineffable happiness.

**3.** That which gives hope; he or that which furnishes ground of expectation, or promises desired good. The _hope_ of Israel is the Messiah.

**HOPE**, _verb transitive_ To desire with expectation of good, or a belief that it may be obtained. But as a transitive verb, it is seldom used, and the phrases in which it is so used are elliptical, for being understood.

Full in the gap, and hopes the hunted bear.
