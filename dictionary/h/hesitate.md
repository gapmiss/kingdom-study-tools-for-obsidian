# Hesitate

**HES'ITATE**, _verb intransitive_ s as z. \[Latin haesito, haereo, to hang.\]

**1.** To stop or pause respecting decision or action; to be doubtful as to fact, principle or determination; to be in suspense or uncertainty; as, he hesitated whether to accept the offer or not. We often _hesitate_ what judgment to form.

It is never transitive, unless by poetic license.

Just hint a fault, and _hesitate_ dislike.

**2.** To stammer; to stop in speaking.
