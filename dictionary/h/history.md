# History

**HIS'TORY**, _noun_ \[Latin historia; Gr. knowing, learned, and to inquire, to explore, to learn by inspection or inquiry.\]

**1.** An account of facts, particularly of facts respecting nations or states; a narration of events in the order in which they happened, with their causes and effects. _history_ differs from annals. Annals relate simply the facts and events of each year, in strict chronological order, without any observations of the annalist. _history_ regards less strictly the arrangement of events under each year, and admits the observations of the writer. This distinction however is not always regarded with strictness.

History is of different kinds, or treats of different subjects; as a _history_ of government or political history; _history_ of the christian church, or ecclesiastical history; _history_ of war and conquests, or military history; _history_ of law; _history_ of commerce; _history_ of the crusades, etc. In these and similar examples, _history_ is written narrative or relation. What is the _history_ of nations, but a narrative of the follies, crimes and miseries of man?

**1.** Narration; verbal relation of facts or events; story. We listen with pleasure to the soldier or the seaman, giving a _history_ of his adventures.

**2.** Knowledge of facts and events.

**3.** Description; an account of things that exist; as natural _history_ which comprehends a description of the works of nature, particularly of animals, plants and minerals; a _history_ of animals, or zoology; a _history_ of plants.

**4.** An account of the origin, life and actions of an individual person. We say, we have a concise _history_ of the prisoner in the testimony offered to the court.

A formal written account of an individual's life, is called biography.
