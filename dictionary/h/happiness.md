# Happiness

**HAP'PINESS**, _noun_ \[from happy.\] The agreeable sensations which spring from the enjoyment of good; that state of a being in which his desires are gratified, by the enjoyment of pleasure without pain; felicity; but _happiness_ usually expresses less than felicity, and felicity less than bliss. _happiness_ is comparative. To a person distressed with pain, relief from that pain affords happiness; in other cases we give the name _happiness_ to positive pleasure or an excitement of agreeable sensations. _happiness_ therefore admits of indefinite degrees of increase in enjoyment, or gratification of desires. Perfect _happiness_ or pleasure unalloyed with pain, is not attainable in this life.

**2.** Good luck; good fortune.

**3.** Fortuitous elegance; unstudied grace.

For there's a _happiness_ as well as care.
