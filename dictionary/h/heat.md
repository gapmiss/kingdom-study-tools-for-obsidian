# Heat

**HEAT**, _noun_ \[Latin aestus, for haestus, or caestus.\]

**1.** _heat_ as a cause of sensation, that is, the matter of _heat_ is considered to be a subtil fluid, contained in a greater or less degree in all bodies. In modern chemistry, it is called caloric. It expands all bodies in different proportions, and is the cause of fluidity and evaporation. A certain degree of it is also essential to animal and vegetable life. _heat_ is latent, when so combined with other matter as not to be perceptible. It is sensible, when it is evolved and perceptible.

**2.** _heat_ as a sensation, is the effect produced on the sentient organs of animals, by the passage of caloric, disengaged from surrounding bodies, to the organs. When we touch or approach a hot body, the caloric or _heat_ passes from that body to our organs of feeling, and gives the sensation of _heat_ On the contrary, when we touch a cold body, the caloric passes from the hand to that body, and causes a sensation of cold.

Note. This theory of _heat_ seems not to be fully settled.
