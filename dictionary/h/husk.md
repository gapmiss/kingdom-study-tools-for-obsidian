# Husk

**HUSK**, _noun_ The external covering of certain fruits or seeds of plants. It is the calyx of the flower or glume of corn and grasses, formed of valves embracing the seed. The husks of the small grains, when separated, are called chaff; but in America we apply the word chiefly to the covering of the ears or seeds of maiz, which is never denominated chaff. It is sometimes used in England for the rind, skin or hull of seeds.

**HUSK**, _verb transitive_ To strip off the external integument or covering of the fruits or seeds of plants; as, to _husk_ maiz.
