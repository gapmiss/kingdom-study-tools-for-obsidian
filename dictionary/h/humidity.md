# Humidity

**HUMID'ITY**, _noun_ Moisture; dampness; a moderate degree of wetness which is perceptible to the eye or touch, occasioned by the absorption of a fluid, or its adherence to the surface of a body. When a cloth has imbibed any fluid to such a degree that it can be felt, we call it humid; but when no _humidity_ is perceptible, we say it is dry. Quicksilver communicates no _humidity_ to our hands or clothes, for it does not adhere to them; but it will adhere to gold, tin and lead, and render them humid and soft to the touch.

**1.** Moisture in the form of visible vapor, or perceptible in the air.
