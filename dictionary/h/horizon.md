# Horizon

**HOR'IZON**, _noun_ \[Gr. to bound, a limit.\] The line that terminates the view, when extended on the surface of the earth; or a great circle of the sphere, dividing the world into two parts or hemispheres; the upper hemisphere which is visible, and the lower which is hid. The _horizon_ is sensible, and rational or real. The sensible, apparent, or visible _horizon_ is a lesser circle of the sphere, which divides the visible part of the sphere from the invisible. It is eastern or western; the eastern is that wherein the sun and stars rise; the western, that wherein they set. The rational, true, or astronomical _horizon_ is a great circle whose plane passes through the center of the earth, and whose poles are the zenith and nadir. This _horizon_ would bound the sight, if the eye could take in the whole hemisphere.
