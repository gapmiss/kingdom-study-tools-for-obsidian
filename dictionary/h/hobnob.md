# Hobnob

**HOB'NOB**, _adverb_ Take, or not take; a familiar invitation to reciprocal drinking.

Hobson's choice, a vulgar proverbial expression, denoting without an alternative. It is said to have had its origin in the name of a person who let horses and coaches, and obliged every customer to take in his turn that horse which stood next the stable door.
