# Hamlet

**HAM'LET**, _noun_ A small village; a little cluster of houses in the country.

This word seems originally to have signified the seat of a freeholder, comprehending the mansion house and adjacent buildings. It now denotes a small collection of houses in the country, in distinction from a city, a large town or township.

The country wasted and the hamlets burned.
