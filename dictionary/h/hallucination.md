# Hallucination

**HALLUCINA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin hallucinatio, from hallucinor, to blunder.\]

**1.** Error; blunder; mistake. \[Little used.\]

**2.** In medicine, faulty sense \[dysaesthesia, \] or erroneous imagination. Hallucinations of the senses, arise from some defect in the organs of sense, or from some unusual circumstances attending the object, as when it is seen by moonlight; and they are sometimes symptoms of general disease, as in fevers. Maniacal hallucinations arise from some imaginary or mistaken idea. Similar hallucinations occur in revery.
