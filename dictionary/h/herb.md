# Herb

**HERB**, _noun_ erb. \[Latin herba.\]

**1.** A plant or vegetable with a soft or succulent stalk or stem, which dies to the root every year, and is thus distinguished from a tree and a shrub, which have ligneous or hard woody stems.

**2.** In the Linnean botany, that part of a vegetable which springs from the root and is terminated by the fructification, including the stem or stalk, the leaves, the fulcra or props, and the hibernacle.

The word _herb_ comprehends all the grasses, and numerous plants used for culinary purposes.
