# Purchase

**PUR'CHASE**, _verb transitive_ \[This word seems to be considered by Blackstone as formed from the Latin perquisitio. This is an error. The word is from the root of chase; purchaser is to pursue to the end or object, and hence to obtain. In Law Latin, _purchase_ the noun, was written purchacium. The legal use of the word in obtaining writs, shows best its true origin; to _purchase_ a writ, is to sue out a writ, that is, to seek it out; for sue, seek, and Latin sequor, are all of one origin, and synonymous with chase.\]
