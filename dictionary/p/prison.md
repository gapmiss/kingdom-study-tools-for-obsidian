# Prison

**PRISON**, _noun_ priz'n. \[Latin prendo.\]

**1.** In a general sense, any place of confinement or involuntary restraint; but appropriately, a public building for the confinement or safe custody of debtors and criminals committed by process of law; a jail. Originally, a _prison_ as Lord Coke observes, was only a place of safe custody; but it is now employed as a place of punishment. We have state-prisons, for the confinement of criminals by way of punishment.

**2.** Any place of confinement or restraint.

_The tyrant Aeolus,_

With power imperial curbs the struggling winds,

And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.
