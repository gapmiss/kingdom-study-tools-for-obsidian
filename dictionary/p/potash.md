# Potash

**POT'ASH**, _noun_ \[pot and ashes.\] The popular name of vegetable fixed alkali in an impure state, procured from the ashes of plants by lixiviation and evaporation. The matter remaining after evaporation is refined in a crucible or furnace, and the extractive substance burnt off or dissipated. Refined _potash_ is called pearlash. The plants which yield the greatest quantity of _potash_ are wormwood and fumitory.

By recent discoveries of Sir H. Davy, it appears that _potash_ is a metallic oxyd; the metal is called potassium, and the alkali, in books of science, is called potassa.
