# Pro

**PRO**, a Latin and Greek preposition, signifying for, before, forth, is probably contracted from prod, coinciding with It. proda, a prow, prode, brave; having the primary sense of moving forward. See [[Prodigal]]. In the phrase, _pro_ and con, that is, _pro_ and contra, it answers to the English for; for and against.

In composition, _pro_ denotes fore, forth, forward.
