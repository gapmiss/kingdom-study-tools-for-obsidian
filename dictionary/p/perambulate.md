# Perambulate

**PERAM'BULATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin perambulo; per and ambulo, to walk.\]

To walk through or over; properly and technically, to pass through or over for the purpose of surveying or examining something; to visit as overseers; as, to _perambulate_ a parish. So in New England, the laws require the select men of towns to appoint suitable persons annually to _perambulate_ the borders or bounds of the township, and renew the boundaries, or see that the old ones are in a good state.
