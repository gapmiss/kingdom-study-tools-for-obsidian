# Pod

**POD**, _noun_ The pericarp, capsule or seed vessel of certain plants. The silique or _pod_ is an oblong, membranaceous, two valved pericarp, having the seeds fixed along both sutures. A legume is a pericarp of two valves, in which the seeds are fixed along one suture only.

According to these descriptions, the seed vessels of peas and beans are legumes, and not pods; but in popular language, _pod_ is used for the legume as well as for the silique or siliqua. In New England, it is the only word in popular use.

**POD**, _verb intransitive_ To swell; to fill; also, to produce pods.
