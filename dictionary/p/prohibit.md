# Prohibit

**PROHIB'IT**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin prohibeo; pro and habeo, to hold.\]

**1.** To forbid; to interdict by authority; applicable to persons or things, but implying authority or right. God prohibited Adam to eat of the fruit of a certain tree. The moral law prohibits what is wrong and commands what is right. We _prohibit_ a person to do a thing, and we _prohibit_ the thing to be done.

**2.** To hinder; to debar; to prevent; to preclude.

_Gates of burning adamant,_

Barr'd over us, _prohibit_ all egress.
