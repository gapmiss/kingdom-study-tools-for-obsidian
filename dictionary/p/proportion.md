# Proportion

**PROPORTION**, _noun_ \[Latin proportio; pro and portio, part or share. See [[Portion]].\]

**1.** The comparative relation of any one thing to another. Let a man's exertions be in _proportion_ to his strength.

**2.** The identity or similitude of two ratios. _proportion_ differs from ratio. Ratio is the relation which determines the quantity of one thing from the quantity of another, without the intervention of a third. Thus the ratio of 5 and [[Isaiah 2#1|Isaiah 2:1]]; the ratio of 8 and 16 is 2. _proportion_ is the sameness or likeness of two such relations. Thus 5 is to 10, as 8 to 16, or A is to B, as C is to D; that is, 5 bears the same relation to 10, as 8 does to 16. Hence we say, such numbers are in _proportion_

**PROPORTION**, in mathematics, an equality or ratios.

The term _proportion_ is sometimes improperly used for ratio. The ratio between two quantities, is expressed by the quotient of one divided by the other; thus, the ratio of 10 to 5 is 2, and the ratio of 16 to 8 is 2. These two equal ratios constitute a _proportion_ which is expressed by saying, 10 is to 5 as 16 is to 8; or more concisely, 10:5::16:8. \[See Ratio.\]

**3.** In arithmetic, a rule by which, when three numbers are given, a fourth number is found, which bears the same relation to the third as the second does to the first; or a fourth number is found, bearing the same relation to the second as the first does to the third. The former is called direct, and the latter, inverse _proportion_

**4.** Symmetry; suitable adaptation of one part or thing to another; as the _proportion_ of one limb to another in the human body; the _proportion_ of the length and breadth of a room to its highth.
