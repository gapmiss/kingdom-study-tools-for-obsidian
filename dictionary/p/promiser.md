# Promiser

**PROM'ISER**, _noun_ One who promises; one who engages, assures, stipulates or covenants. Fear, says Dryden, is a great _promiser_ We may say that hope is a very liberal _promiser_

The import of a promise, when disputed, is not to be determined by the sense of the _promiser_ nor by the expectations of the promisee.

\[Note. In law language, promisor is used, but without necessity or advantage.\]
