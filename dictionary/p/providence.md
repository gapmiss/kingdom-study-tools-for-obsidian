# Providence

**PROV'IDENCE**, _noun_ \[Latin providentia.\]

**1.** The act of providing or preparing for future use or application.

Providence for war is the best prevention of it. \[Now little used.\]

**2.** Foresight; timely care; particularly, active foresight, or foresight accompanied with the procurement of what is necessary for future use, or with suitable preparation. How many of the troubles and perplexities of life proceed from want of providence!

**3.** In theology, the care and superintendence which God exercises over his creatures. He that acknowledges a creation and denies a _providence_ involves himself in a palpable contradiction; for the same power which caused a thing to exist is necessary to continue its existence. Some persons admit a general _providence_ but deny a particular _providence_ not considering that a general _providence_ consists of particulars. A belief in divine _providence_ is a source of great consolation to good men. By divine _providence_ is often understood God himself.

**4.** Prudence in the management of one's concerns or in private economy.
