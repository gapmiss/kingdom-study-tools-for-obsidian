# Presumption

**PRESUMP'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin proesumption.\]

**1.** Supposition of the truth or real existence of something without direct or positive proof of the fact, but grounded on circumstantial or probable evidence which entitles it to belief. _presumption_ in law is of three sorts, violent or strong, probable, and light.

Next to positive proof, circumstantial evidence or the doctrine of presumptions must take place; for when the fact cannot be demonstratively evinced, that which comes nearest to the proof of the fact is the proof of such circumstances as either necessarily or usually attend such facts. These are called presumptions. Violent _presumption_ is many times equal to full proof.

**2.** Strong probability; as in the common phrase, the _presumption_ is that an event has taken place, or will take place.

**3.** Blind or headstrong confidence; unreasonable adventurousness; a venturing to undertake something without reasonable prospect of success, or against the usual probabilities of safety; presumptuousness.

Let my _presumption_ not provoke thy wrath.

I had the _presumption_ to dedicate to you a very unfinished price.

**4.** Arrogance. He had the _presumption_ to attempt to dictate to the council.

**5.** Unreasonable confidence in divine favor.

The awe of his majesty will keep us from _presumption_
