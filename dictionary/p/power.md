# Power

**POW'ER**, _noun_ \[The Latin has posse, possum, potes, potentia. The primary sense of the verb is to strain, to exert force.\]

**1.** In a philosophical sense, the faculty of doing or performing any thing; the faculty of moving or of producing a change in something; ability or strength. A man raises his hand by his own _power_ or by _power_ moves another body. The exertion of _power_ proceeds from the will, and in strictness, no being destitute of will or intelligence, can exert _power_ _power_ in man is active or speculative. Active _power_ is that which moves the body; speculative _power_ is that by which we see, judge, remember, or in general, by which we think.

Power may exist without exertion. We have _power_ to speak when we are silent.

Power has been distinguished also into active and passive, the _power_ of doing or moving, and the _power_ of receiving impressions or of suffering. In strictness, passive _power_ is an absurdity in terms. To say that gold has a _power_ to be melted, is improper language, yet for want of a more appropriate word, _power_ is often used in a passive sense, and is considered as two-fold; viz.as able to make or able to receive any change.

**2.** Force; animal strength; as the _power_ of the arm, exerted in lifting, throwing or holding.

**5.** Ability, natural or moral. We say, a man has the _power_ of doing good; his property gives him the _power_ of relieving the distressed; or he has the _power_ to persuade others to do good; or it is not in his _power_ to pay his debts. The moral _power_ of man is also his _power_ of judging or discerning in moral subjects.

**6.** In mechanics, that which produces motion or force, or which may be applied to produce it. Thus the inclined plane is called a mechanical _power_ as it produces motion, although this in reality depends on gravity. The wheel and axle, and the lever, are mechanical powers, as they may be applied to produce force. These powers are also called forces, and they are of two kinds, moving _power_ and sustaining _power_

**8.** That quality in any natural body which produces a change or makes an impression on another body; as the _power_ of medicine; the _power_ of heat; the _power_ of sound.

**9.** Force; strength; momentum; as the _power_ of the wind, which propels a ship or overturns a building.
