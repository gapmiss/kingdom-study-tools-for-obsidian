# Pardon

**P'ARDON**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin per and dono, to give; per having the sense of the English for in forgive, and re in Latin remitto, properly to give back or away.\]

**1.** To forgive; to remit; as an offense or crime. Guilt implies a being bound or subjected to censure, penalty or punishment. To _pardon_ is to give up this obligation, and release the offender. We apply the word to the crime or to the person. We _pardon_ an offense, when we remove it from the offender and consider him as not guilty; we _pardon_ the offender, when we release or absolve him from his liability to suffer punishment.

I pray thee, _pardon_ my sin. [[1 Samuel 15#25|1 Samuel 15:25]].

**2.** To remit, as a penalty.

I _pardon_ thee thy life before thou ask it.

**3.** To excuse, as for a fault.

**4.** _pardon_ me, is a phrase used when one asks for excuse, or makes an apology, and it is often used in this sense, when a person means civilly to deny or contradict what another affirms.

**P'ARDON**, _noun_ Forgiveness; the release of an offense or of the obligation of the offender to suffer a penalty, or to bear the displeasure of the offended party. We seek the _pardon_ of sins, transgressions and offenses.

**1.** Remission of a penalty. An amnesty is a general _pardon_

**2.** Forgiveness received.
