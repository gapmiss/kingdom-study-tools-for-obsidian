# Preside

**PRESI'DE**, _verb intransitive_ s as z. \[Latin proesideo; proe, before, and sedeo, to sit.\]

**1.** To be set over for the exercise of authority; to direct, control and govern, as the chief officer. A man may _preside_ over a nation or province; or he may _preside_ over a senate, or a meeting of citizens. The word is used chiefly in the latter sense. We say, a man presides over the senate with dignity. Hence it usually denotes temporary superintendence and government.

**2.** To exercise superintendence; to watch over as inspector.
