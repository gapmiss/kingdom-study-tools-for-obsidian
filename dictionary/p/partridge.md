**P'ARTRIDGE**, _noun_ \[Latin perdix.\] A wild fowl of the genus Tatrao. Latham arranges the _partridge_ and quail in a genus under the name of Perdix, and assigns the grous to the genus Tetrao. The _partridge_ is esteemed a great delicacy at the table.

The term _partridge_ is applied in Pennsylvania to the bird called quail in New England, a peculiar species of Perdix; in New England it is applied to the ruffed grous, a species of Tetrao.
