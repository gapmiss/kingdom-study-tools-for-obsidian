# Pommel

**POMMEL**, _verb transitive_ \[from the noun.\] To beat as with a pommel, that is, with something thick or bulky; to bruise.

\[The French se pommeler, to grow dapple, to curdle, is from the same source; but the sense is to make knobs or lumps, and hence to variegate, or make spots like knobs. The Welsh have from the same root, or _pwmp_, a mass, _pwmpiaw_, to form a round mass, and to thump, to bang, Eng. to bump.\]
