# Praise

**PRAISE**, _noun_ s as z. \[Latin pretium.\]

**1.** Commendation bestowed on a person for his personal virtues or worthy actions, on meritorious actions themselves, or on any thing valuable; approbation expressed in words or song. _praise_ may be expressed by an individual, and in this circumstance differs from fame, renown, and celebrity, which are the expression of the approbation of numbers, or public commendation. When _praise_ is applied to the expression of public approbation, it may be synonymous with renown, or nearly so. A man may deserve the _praise_ of an individual, or of a nation.

There are men who always confound the _praise_ of goodness with the practice.
