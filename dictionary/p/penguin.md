# Penguin

**PEN'GUIN**, _noun_ \[Latin pinguidine, with fatness.\]

**1.** A genus of fowls of the order of Palmipeds. The _penguin_ is an aquatic fowl with very short legs, with four toes, three of which are webbed; the body is clothed with short feathers, set as compactly as the scales of a fish; the wings are small like fins, and covered with short scale-like feathers, so that they are useless in flight. Penguins seldom go on shore, except in the season of breeding, when they burrow like rabbits. On land they stand erect; they are tame and may be driven like a flock of sheep. In water they swim with rapidity, being assisted by their wings. These fowls are found only in the southern latitudes.

**2.** A species of fruit.
