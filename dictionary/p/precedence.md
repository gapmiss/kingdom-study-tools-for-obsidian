# Precedence

**PRECE'DENCE**

PRECE'DENCY, _noun_ The act or state of going before; priority in time; as the _precedence_ of one event.

**1.** The state of going or being before in rank or dignity or the place of honor; the right to a more honorable place in public processions, in seats or in the civilities of life. _precedence_ depends on the order of nature or rank established by God himself, as that due to age; or on courtesy, custom or political distinction, as that due to a governor or senator, who, though younger in years, takes rank of a subordinate officer, though older; or it is settled by authority, as in Great Britain. In the latter case, a violation of the right of _precedence_ is actionable.

**2.** The foremost in ceremony.

**3.** Superiority; superior importance or influence.

Which of the different desires has precedency in determining the will to the next action.
