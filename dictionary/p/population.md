# Population

**POPULA'TION**, _noun_ The act or operation of peopling or furnishing with inhabitants; multiplication of inhabitants. The value of our western lands is annually enhanced by _population_

**1.** The whole number of people or inhabitants in a country. The _population_ of England is estimated at ten millions of souls; that of the United States in 1823, was ten millions.

A country may have a great _population_ and yet not be populous.

**2.** The state of a country with regard to its number of inhabitants, or rather with regard to its numbers compared with their expenses, consumption of goods and productions, and earnings.

Neither is the _population_ to be reckoned only by number; for a smaller number that spend more and earn less, do wear out an estate sooner than a greater number that live lower and gather more.
