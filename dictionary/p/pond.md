# Pond

**POND**, _noun_ \[Latin pono; pontus, the sea.\]

**1.** A body of stagnant water without an outlet, larger than a puddle, and smaller than a lake; or a like body of water with a small outlet. In the United States, we give this name to collections of water in the interior country, which are fed by springs, and from which issues a small stream. These ponds are often a mile or two or even more in length, and the current issuing from them is used to drive the wheels of mills and furnaces.

**2.** A collection of water raised in a river by a dam, for the purpose of propelling mill-wheels. These artificial ponds are called mill-ponds.

**POND** for fist. \[See [[Fish]]-pond.\]

**POND**, _verb transitive_ \[from the noun.\] To make a pond; to collect in a _pond_ by stopping the current of a river.

**POND**, _verb transitive_ To ponder. \[Not in use.\]
