# Predecessor

**PREDECES'SOR**, _noun_ \[Latin proe and decedo, to depart.\] A person who has preceded another in the same office. The king, the president, the judge, or the magistrate, follows the steps of his _predecessor_ or he does not imitate the example of his predecessors. It is distinguished from ancestor, who is of the same blood; but it may perhaps be sometimes used for it.
