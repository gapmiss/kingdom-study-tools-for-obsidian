# Preference

**PREF'ERENCE**, _noun_ The act of preferring one thing before another; estimation of one thing above another; choice of one thing rather than another.

Leave the critics on either side to contend about the _preference_ due to this or that sort of poetry.

It has to, above, before, or over, before the thing postponed. All men give the _preference_ to Homer as an epic poet. The human body has the _preference_ above or before those of brutes.

The knowledge of things alone gives a value to our reasonings, and _preference_ of one man's knowledge over another's.
