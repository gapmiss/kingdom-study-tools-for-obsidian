# Plural

**PLU'RAL**, _adjective_ \[Latin pluralis, from plus, pluris, more.\]

**1.** Containing more than one; consisting of two or more, or designating two or more; as a _plural_ word.

**2.** In grammar, the _plural_ number is that which designates more than one, that is, any number except one. Thus in most languages, a word in the _plural_ number expresses two or more. But the Greek has a dual number to express two; and the _plural_ expresses more than two.
