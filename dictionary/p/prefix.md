# Prefix

**PREFIX**', _verb transitive_ \[Latin proefigo; proe, before, and figo, to fix.\]

**1.** To put or fix before, or at the beginning of another thing; as, to _prefix_ a syllable to a word; to _prefix_ an advertisement to a book.

**2.** To set or appoint beforehand; as, to _prefix_ the hour of meeting.

A time _prefix_ and think of me at last.

**3.** To settle; to establish.

I would _prefix_ some certain boundary between the old statutes and the new.

**PRE'FIX**, _noun_ A letter, syllable or word put to the beginning of a word, usually to vary its signification. A _prefix_ is united with the word, forming a part of it; hence it is distinguished from a preposition; as pre, in prefix; con, in coniure; with, in withstand. Prefixes are sometimes called particles, or inseparable prepositions.
