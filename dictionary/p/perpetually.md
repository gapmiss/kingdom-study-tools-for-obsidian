# Perpetually

**PERPET'UALLY**, _adverb_ Constantly; continually; applied to things which proceed without intermission, or which occur frequently or at intervals, without limitation. A perennial spring flows perpetually; the weather varies _perpetually_

The Bible and common prayer book in the vulgar tongue, being _perpetually_ read in churches, have proved a kind of standard for language.
