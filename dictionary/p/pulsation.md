# Pulsation

**PULSA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin pulsatio, supra.\] The beating or throbbing of the heart or of an artery, in the process of carrying on the circulation of the blood. The blood being propelled by the contraction of the heart, causes the arteries to dilate, so as to render each dilation perceptible to the touch in certain parts of the body, as in the radial artery, etc.

**1.** In law, any touching of another's body willfully or in anger. This constitutes battery.

By the Cornelian law, _pulsation_ as well as verberation is prohibited.
