# Presbytery

**PRES'BYTERY**, _noun_ A body of elders in the christian church.

Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the _presbytery_ [[1 Timothy 4#14|1 Timothy 4:14]].

**1.** In ecclesiastical government, a judicatory consisting of all the pastors of churches within a certain district, and one ruling elder, a layman, from each parish, commissioned to represent the parish in conjunction with the minister. This body receives appeals from the kirk-session, and appeals from the _presbytery_ may be carried to the provincial synod.

The _presbytery_ of the churches in the United States is composed in a manner nearly similar.
