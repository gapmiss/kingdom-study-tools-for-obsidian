# Precision

**PRECI'SION**, _noun_ s as z. \[Latin proecisio.\] Exact limitation; exactness; accuracy. _precision_ in the use of words is a prime excellence in discourse; it is indispensable in controversy, in legal instruments and in mathematical calculations. Neither perspicuity nor _precision_ should be sacrificed to ornament.
