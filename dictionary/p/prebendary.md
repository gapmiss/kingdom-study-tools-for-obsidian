# Prebendary

**PREB'ENDARY**, _noun_ An ecclesiastic who enjoys a prebend; the stipendiary of a cathedral church.

A _prebendary_ differs from a canon in this; the _prebendary_ receives his prebend in consideration of his officiating in the church; the canon merely in consequence of his being received into the cathedral or college.
