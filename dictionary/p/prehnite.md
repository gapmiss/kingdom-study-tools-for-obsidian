# Prehnite

**PREHN'ITE**, _noun_ A mineral of the silicious kind, of an apple green or greenish gray color. It has been called shorl, emerald, chrysoprase, felspath, chrysolite, and zeolite. It has some resemblance to zeolite, but differs from it in several particulars, and is therefore considered to be a particular species.

Prehnite is near to stilbite, and is classed by the French with the family of zeolites.

It is massive or crystallized, but the form of its crystals cannot be determined in consequence of their aggregation.
