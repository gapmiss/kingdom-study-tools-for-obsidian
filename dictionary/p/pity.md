# Pity

**PITY**, _noun_ \[The Latin, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese languages unite _pity_ and piety in the same word, and the word may be from the root of compassion; Latin patior, to suffer.\]

**1.** The feeling or suffering of one person, excited by the distresses of another; sympathy with the grief or misery of another; compassion or fellow-suffering.

He that hath _pity_ upon the poor lendeth to the Lord. [[Proverbs 19#17|Proverbs 19:17]].

In Scripture however, the word _pity_ usually includes

compassion accompanied with some act of charity or benevolence, and not simply a fellow feeling of distress.

**PITY** is always painful, yet always agreeable.

**2.** The ground or subject of pity; cause of grief; thing to be regretted.

What _pity_ is it

That we can die but once to serve our country!

That he is old, the more is the _pity_ his white hairs do witness it.

In this sense, the word has a plural. It is a thousand pities he should waste his estate in prodigality.

**PIT'Y**, _verb transitive_ To feel pain or grief for one in distress; to have sympathy for; to compassionate; to have tender feelings for one, excited by his unhappiness.

Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. [[Psalms 103#1|Psalms 103:1]].

_Taught by that power who pities me,_

I learn to _pity_ them.
