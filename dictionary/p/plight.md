# Plight

**PLIGHT**, _verb transitive_ plite. \[Latin plico; flecto, to bend; ligo. See [[Alloy and Ply]].\]

**1.** To pledge; to give as security for the performance of some act; but never applied to property or goods. We say, he plighted his hand, his faith, his vows, his honor, his truth or troth. Pledge is applied to property as well as to word, faith, truth, honor, etc. To _plight_ faith is, as it were, to deposit it in pledge for the performance of an act, on the non-performance of which, the pledge is forfeited.

**2.** To weave; to braid.

\[This is the primary sense of the word, Latin plico, but now obsolete.\]

**PLIGHT**, _noun_ plite. Literally, a state of being involved, \[Latin plicatus, implicatus, implicitus; \] hence, perplexity, distress, or a distressed state or condition; as a miserable _plight_ But the word by itself does not ordinarily imply distress. Hence,

**1.** Condition; state; and sometimes good case; as, to keep cattle in _plight_

In most cases, this word is now accompanied with an adjective which determines its signification; as bad plight; miserable or wretched plight; good _plight_

**2.** Pledge; gage.

The Lord, whose hand must take my _plight_

**3.** A fold \[Latin plica; \] a double; a plait.

All in a silken Camus, lily white,

Purfled upon with many a folded _plight_

**4.** A garment. \[Not used.\]
