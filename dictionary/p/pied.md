# Pied

**PI'ED**, _adjective_ \[allied probably to pie, in piebald, and a contracted word, perhaps from the root of Latin pictus.\]

Variegated with spots of different colors; spotted. We now apply the word chiefly or wholly to animals which are marked with large spots of different colors. If the spots are small, we use speckled. This distinction was not formerly observed, and in some cases, _pied_ is elegantly used to express a diversity of colors in small spots.
