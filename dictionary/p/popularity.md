# Popularity

**POPULAR'ITY**, _noun_ \[Latin popularitas.\] Favor of the people; the state of possessing the affections and confidence of the people in general; as the _popularity_ of the ministry; the _popularity_ of a public officer or of a preacher. It is applied also to things; as the _popularity_ of a law or public measure; the _popularity_ of a book or poem. The most valuable trait in a patriot's character is to forbear all improper compliances for gaining _popularity_

I have long since learned the little value which is to be placed in _popularity_ acquired by any other way than virtue; I have also learned that it is often obtained by other means.

The man whose ruling principle is duty--is never perplexed with anxious corroding calculations of interest and _popularity_

**1.** Representation suited to vulgar or common conception; that which is intended or adapted to procure the favor of the people. \[Little used.\]
