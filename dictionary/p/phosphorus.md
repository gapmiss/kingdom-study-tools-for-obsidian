**PHOS'PHORUS**

PHOS'PHOR, _noun_ \[Latin from the Greek. See [[Phosphor]].\]

**1.** The morning star.

**2.** _phosphorus_ in chemistry, a combustible substance, hitherto undecomposed. It is of a yellowish color and semi-transparent, resembling fine wax. It burns in common air with great rapidity; and in oxygen gas, with the greatest vehemence. Even at the common temperature, it combines with oxygen, undergoing a slow combustion and emitting a luminous vapor. It is originally obtained from urine; but it is now manufactured from bones, which consist of phosphate of lime.
