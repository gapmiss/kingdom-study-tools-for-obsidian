# Prorogation

**PROROGA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin prorogatio. See [[Prorogue]].\]

**1.** Continuance in time or duration; a lengthening or prolongation of time; as the _prorogation_ of something already possessed. \[This use is uncommon.\]

**2.** In England, the continuance of parliament from one session to another, as an adjournment is a continuance of the session from day to day. This is the established language with respect to the parliament of Great Britain. In the United States, the word is, I believe, rarely or never used; adjournment being used not only in its etymological sense, but for _prorogation_ also.
