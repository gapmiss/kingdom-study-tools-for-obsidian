# Pillage

**PILL'AGE**, _noun_

**1.** Plunder; spoil; that which is taken from another by open force, particularly and chiefly from enemies in war.

**2.** The act of plundering.

**3.** In architecture, a square pillar behind a column to bear up the arches.

**PILL'AGE**, _verb transitive_ To strip of money or goods by open violence; as, troops _pillage_ the camp or towns of an enemy; to plunder; to spoil. It differs from stealing, as it implies open violence, and from robbery, which may be committed by one individual on another; whereas pillaging is usually the act of bands or numbers. To _pillage_ and to rob are however sometimes used synonymously.
