# Problem

**PROB'LEM**, _noun_ \[Latin problema; Gr. to throw forward, and to throw; Latin pello.\] A question proposed.

**1.** In logic, a preposition that appears neither absolutely true nor false, and consequently may be asserted either in the affirmative or negative.

**2.** In geometry, a proposition in which some operation or construction is required, as to divide a line or an angle, to let fall a perpendicular, etc.

**3.** In general, any question involving doubt or uncertainty, and requiring some operation, experiment or further evidence for its solution.

The _problem_ is, whether a strong and constant belief that a thing will be, helps any thing to the effecting of the thing.
