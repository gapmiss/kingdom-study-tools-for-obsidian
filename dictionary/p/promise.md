# Promise

**PROM'ISE**, _noun_ \[Latin promissum, from promitto, to send before or forward; pro and mitto, to send.\]

**1.** In a general sense, a declaration, written or verbal, made by one person to another, which binds the person who makes it, either in honor, conscience or law, to do or forbear a certain act specified; a declaration which gives to the person to whom it is made, a right to expect or to claim the performance or forbearance of the act. The _promise_ of a visit to my neighbor, gives him a right to expect it, and I am bound in honor and civility to perform the _promise_ Of such a _promise_ human laws have no cognizance; but the fulfillment of it is one of the minor moralities, which civility, kindness and strict integrity require to be observed.

**2.** In law, a declaration, verbal or written, made by one person to another for a good or valuable consideration, in the nature of a covenant, by which the promiser binds himself, and as the case may be, his legal representatives, to do or forbear some act; and gives to the promisee a legal right to demand and enforce a fulfillment.

**3.** A binding declaration of something to be done or given for another's benefit; as the _promise_ of a grant of land. A _promise_ may be absolute or conditional; lawful or unlawful; express or implied. An absolute _promise_ must be fulfilled at all events. The obligation to fulfill a conditional _promise_ depends on the performance of the condition. An unlawful _promise_ is not binding, because it is void; for it is incompatible with a prior paramount obligation of obedience to the laws. An express _promise_ is one expressed in words or writing. An implied _promise_ is one which reason and justice dictate. If I hire a man to perform a day's labor, without any declaration that I will pay him, the law presumes a _promise_ on my part that I will give him a reasonable reward, and will enforce much implied _promise_

**4.** Hopes; expectation, or that which affords expectation of future distinction; as a youth of great _promise_

My native country was full of youthful _promise_

**5.** That which is promised; fulfillment or grant of what is promised.

He commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the _promise_ of the Father. [[Acts 1#4|Acts 1:4]].

**6.** In Scripture, the _promise_ of God is the declaration or assurance which God has given in his word of bestowing blessings on his people. Such assurance resting on the perfect justice, power, benevolence and immutable veracity of God, cannot fail of performance.

The Lord is not slack concerning his promises. [[2 Peter 3#4|2 Peter 3:4]].

**PROM'ISE**, _verb transitive_ To make a declaration to another, which binds the promiser in honor, conscience or law, to do or forbear some act; as, to _promise_ a visit to a friend; to _promise_ a cessation of hostilities; to _promise_ the payment of money.

**1.** To afford reason to expect; as, the year promises a good harvest.

**2.** To make declaration or give assurance of some benefit to be conferred; to pledge or engage to bestow.

**2.** In popular use, this verb sometimes threatens or assures of evil. The rogue shall be punished, I _promise_ you.
