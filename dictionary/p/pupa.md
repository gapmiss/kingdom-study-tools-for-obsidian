# Pupa

**PU'PA**, _noun_ \[Latin supra.\] In natural history, an insect in that state in which it resembles an infant in swaddling clothes. As some insects in this state have a bright exterior, as if gilded, it has been called chrysalis or aurelia, from the Gr. and Latin aurum, gold; but as this gilded appearance belongs to few insects, the term _pupa_ is now more generally used.
