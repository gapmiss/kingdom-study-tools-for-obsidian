# Participle

**P'ARTICIPLE**, _noun_ \[Latin participium, from participo; pars, part, and capio, to take.\]

**1.** In grammar, a word so called because it partakes of the properties of a noun and of a verb; as having, making, in English; habens, faciens, in Latin. The English participles having, making, become nouns by prefixing the to them; as the having of property; the making of instruments. But all participles do not partake of the properties of a noun, as the passive participles for example, had, made.

Participles sometimes lose the properties of a verb and become adjectives, as willing, in the phrase, a willing heart; engaging, as engaging manners; accomplished, as an accomplished orator.

**2.** Any thing that participates of different things. \[Not used.\]
