# Pretor

**PRE'TOR**, _noun_ \[Latin proetor, from the root of proe, before.\]

Among the ancient Romans, a judge; an officer answering to the modern chief justice or chancellor, or to both. In later times, subordinate judges appointed to distribute justice in the provinces, were created and called pretors or provincial pretors. These assisted the consuls in the government of the provinces.

In modern times, the word is sometimes used for a mayor or magistrate.
