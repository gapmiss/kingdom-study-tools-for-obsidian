# Promontory

**PROM'ONTORY**, _noun_ \[Latin promontorium; pro, forward, and mons, a mountain.\] In geography, a high point of land or rock, projecting into the sea beyond the line of the coast; a head land. It differs from a cape in denoting high land; a cape may be a similar projection of land high or low.

If you drink tea on a _promontory_ that overhangs the sea, it is preferable to an assembly.
