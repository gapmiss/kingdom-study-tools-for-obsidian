# Possible

**POS'SIBLE**, _adjective_ \[Latin possibilis, from posse. See [[Power]].\]

That may be or exist; that may be now, or may happen or come to pass; that may be done; not contrary to the nature of things. It is _possible_ that the Greeks and Turks may now be engaged in battle. It is _possible_ that peace of Europe may continue a century. It is not physically _possible_ that a stream should ascend a mountain, but it is _possible_ that the Supreme Being may suspend a law of nature, that is, his usual course of proceeding. It is not _possible_ that 2 and 3 should be 7, or that the same action should be morally right and morally wrong.

This word when pronounced with a certain emphasis, implies improbability. A thing is _possible_ but very improbable.
