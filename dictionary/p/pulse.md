**2.** The stroke with which a medium is affected by the motion of light, sound, etc.; oscillation; vibration.

Sir Isaac Newton demonstrates that the velocities of the pulses of an elastic fluid medium are in a ratio compounded of half the ratio of the elastic force directly, and half the ratio of the density inversely.

To feel one's _pulse_ metaphorically, to sound one's opinion; to try or to know one's mind.
