# Pull

**PULL**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin vello.\]

**1.** To draw; to draw towards one or to make an effort to draw. _pull_ differs from draw; we use draw when motion follows the effort, and _pull_ is used in the same sense; but we may also _pull_ forever without drawing or moving the thing. This distinction may not be universal. _pull_ is opposed to push.
