# Presage

**PRE'SAGE**, _noun_ \[Latin proesagium; proe, before, and sagio, to perceive or foretell.\] Something which foreshows a future event; a prognostic; a present fact indicating something to come.

Joy and shout, _presage_ of victory.

**PRESA'GE**, _verb transitive_ To forebode; to foreshow; to indicate by some present fact what is to follow or come to pass. A fog rising from a river in an autumnal morning presages a pleasant day. A physical phenomenon cannot be considered as presaging an event, unless it has some connection with it in cause. Hence the error of vulgar superstition, which presages good or evil from facts which can have no relation to the future event.

**1.** To foretell; to predict; to prophesy.

Wish'd freedom I _presage_ you soon will find.

**PRESA'GE**, _verb intransitive_ To form or utter a prediction; with of. We may _presage_ of heats and rains. We may _presage_ of heats and rains. \[Not common nor elegant.\]
