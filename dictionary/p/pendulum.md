# Pendulum

**PEND'ULUM**, _noun_ \[Latin pendulus, _pendulum_ \] A vibrating body suspended from a fixed point; as the _pendulum_ of a clock. The oscillations of a _pendulum_ depend on gravity, and are always performed in nearly equal times, supposing the length of the _pendulum_ and the gravity to remain the same.
