# Parsimonious

**PARSIMO'NIOUS**, _adjective_ \[See [[Parsimony]].\] Sparing in the use or expenditure of money; covetous; near; close. It differs from frugal, in implying more closeness or narrowness of mind, or an attachment to property somewhat excessive, or a disposition to spend less money that is necessary or honorable.

Extraordinary funds for one campaign may spare us the expense of many years; whereas a long _parsimonious_ war will drain us of more men and money.

\[It is sometimes used in a good sense for frugal.\]
