# Portrait

**PORTRAIT**, _noun_ \[Eng. to portray; pour; for, fore, and traire; Latin trahere; Eng. to draw.\] A picture or representation of a person, and especially of a face, drawn from the life.

In portraits, the grace, and we may add, the likeness, consist more in the general air than in the exact similitude of every feature.
