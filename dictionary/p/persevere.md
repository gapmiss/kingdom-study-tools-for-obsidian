# Persevere

**PERSEVE'RE**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin persevero. The last component part of this word, severo, must be the same as in assevero, with the radical sense of set, fixed or continued. So persist is formed with per and sisto, to stand. Constant and continue have a like primary sense. So we say, to hold on.\]

To persist in any business or enterprise undertaken; to pursue steadily any design or course commenced; not to give over or abandon what is undertaken; applied alike to good and evil.

Thrice happy, if they know

Their happiness, and _persevere_ upright!

To _persevere_ in any evil course, makes you unhappy in this life.
