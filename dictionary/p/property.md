**4.** The exclusive right of possessing, enjoying and disposing of a thing; ownership. In the beginning of the world, the Creator gave to man dominion over the earth, over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air, and over every living thing. This is the foundation of man's _property_ in the earth and in all its productions. Prior occupancy of land and of wild animals gives to the possessor the _property_ of them. The labor of inventing, making or producing any thing constitutes one of the highest and most indefeasible titles to _property_ _property_ is also acquired by inheritance, by gift or by purchase. _property_ is sometimes held in common, yet each man's right to his share in common land or stock is exclusively his own. One man may have the _property_ of the soil, and another the right of use, by prescription or by purchase.

Literary _property_ the exclusive right of printing, publishing and making profit by one's own writings. No right or title to a thing can be so perfect as that which is created by a man's own labor and invention. The exclusive right of a man to his literary productions, and to the use of them for his own profit, is entire and perfect, as the faculties employed and labor bestowed are entirely and perfectly his own. On what principle then can a legislature or a court determine that an author can enjoy only a temporary _property_ in his own productions? If a man's right to his own productions in writing is as perfect as to the productions of his farm or his shop, how can the former by abridged or limited, while the latter is held without limitation? Why do the productions of manual labor rank higher in the scale of rights or _property_ than the productions of the intellect?
