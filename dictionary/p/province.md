# Province

**PROV'INCE**, _noun_ \[Latin provincia; usually supposed to be formed from pro and vinco, to conquer. This is very doubtful, as provinco was not used by the Romans.\]

**1.** Among the Romans, a country of considerable extent, which being reduced under their dominion, was new-modeled, subjected to the command of an annual governor sent from Rome, and to such taxes and contributions as the Romans saw fit to impose. That part of France next to the Alps, was a Roman _province_ and still bears the name Provence.

**2.** Among the moderns, a country belonging to a kingdom or state, either by conquest or colonization, usually situated at a distance from the kingdom or state, but more or less dependent on it or subject to it. Thus formerly, the English colonies in North America were provinces of Great Britain, as Nova Scotia and Canada still are. The provinces of the Netherlands formerly belonged to the house of Austria and to Spain.

**3.** A division of a kingdom or state, of considerable extent. In England, a division of the ecclesiastical state under the jurisdiction of an archbishop, of which there are two, the _province_ of Canterbury and that of York.

**4.** A region of country; in a general sense; a tract; a large extent.

Over many a tract

Of heaven they march'd, and many a _province_ wide.

They never look abroad into the provinces of the intellectual world.

**5.** The proper office or business of a person. It is the _province_ of the judge to decide causes between individuals.

The woman's _province_ is to be careful in her economy, and chaste in her affection.
