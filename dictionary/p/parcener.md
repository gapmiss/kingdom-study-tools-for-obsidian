# Parcener

**P'ARCENER**, _noun_ \[Latin pars.\] _parcener_ or co-parcener is a co-heir, or one who holds lands by descent from an ancestor in common with another or with others; as when land descends to a man's daughters, sisters, aunts, cousins, or their representatives. In this case, all the heirs inherit as parceners or co-heirs.
