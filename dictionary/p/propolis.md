# Propolis

**PRO'POLIS**, _noun_ \[Gr. before the city, or the front of the city.\]

A thick odorous substance having some resemblance to wax and smelling like storax; used by bees to stop the holes and crevices in their hives to prevent the entrance of cold air, etc. Pliny represents it as the third coat; the first he calls commosis; the second pissoceros; the third, more solid than the others, he calls _propolis_

This account of the _propolis_ may not be perfectly correct, as authors do not agree in their descriptions of it.
