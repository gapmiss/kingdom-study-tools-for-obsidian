# Porch

**PORCH**, _noun_ \[Latin porticus, from porta, a gate, entrance or passage, or from portus, a shelter.\]

**1.** In architecture, a kind of vestibule supported by columns at the entrance of temples, halls, churches or other buildings.

**2.** A portico; a covered walk.

**3.** By way of distinction, the _porch_ was a public portico in Athens, where Zeno, the philosopher, taught his disciples. It was called the painted _porch_ from the pictures of Polygnotus and other eminent painters, with which it was adorned. Hence, the _porch_ is equivalent to the school of the Stoics.
