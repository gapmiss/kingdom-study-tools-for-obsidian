# Pusillanimity

**PUSILLANIM'ITY**, _noun_ \[Latin pusillanimitas; pusillus, small, weak, and animus, courage.\] Want of that firmness and strength of mind which constitutes courage or fortitude; weakness of spirit; cowardliness; that feebleness of mind which shrinks from trifling or imaginary dangers.

It is obvious to distinguish between an act of _pusillanimity_ and an act of great modesty or humility.
