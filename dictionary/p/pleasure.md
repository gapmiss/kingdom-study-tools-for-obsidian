# Pleasure

**PLEASURE**, _noun_ plezh'ur.

**1.** The gratification of the senses or of the mind; agreeable sensations or emotions; the excitement, relish or happiness produced by enjoyment or the expectation of good; opposed to pain. We receive _pleasure_ from the indulgence of appetite; from the view of a beautiful landscape; from the harmony of sounds; from agreeable society; from the expectation of seeing an absent friend; from the prospect of gain or success of any kind. _pleasure_ bodily and mental, carnal and spiritual, constitutes the whole of positive happiness, as pain constitutes the whole of misery.

**PLEASURE** is properly positive excitement of the passions or the mind; but we give the name also to the absence of excitement, when that excitement is painful; as when we cease to labor, or repose after fatigue, or when the mind is tranquilized after anxiety or agitation.

**PLEASURE** is susceptible of increase to any degree; but the word when unqualified, expresses less excitement or happiness than delight or joy.

**2.** Sensual or sexual gratification.

**3.** Approbation.
