# Pilgrimage

**PIL'GRIMAGE**, _noun_ A long journey, particularly a journey to some place deemed sacred and venerable, in order to pay devotion to the relics of some deceased saint. Thus in the middle ages, kings, princes, bishops and others made pilgrimages to Jerusalem, in pious devotion to the Savior. Pilgrims now resort to Loretto, in Italy, to visit the chamber of the blessed virgin, and the Mohammedans make pilgrimages to Mecca, where their prophet was buried.

**1.** In Scripture, the journey of human life. [[Genesis 47#9|Genesis 47:9]].

**2.** Time irksomely spent.
