# Psaltery

**PSAL'TERY**, _noun_ \[Gr.\] An instrument of music used by the Hebrews, the form of which is not now known. That which is now used is a flat instrument in form of a trapezium or triangle truncated at the top, strung with thirteen chords of wire, mounted on two bridges at the sides, and struck with a plectrum or crooked stick.

Praise the Lord with harp; sing to him with the _psaltery_ and an instrument of ten strings. [[Psalms 33#2|Psalms 33:2]].
