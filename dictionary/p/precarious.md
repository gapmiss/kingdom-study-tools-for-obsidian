# Precarious

**PRECA'RIOUS**, _adjective_ \[Latin precarius, from precor, to pray or entreat; primarily, depending on request, or on the will of another.

**1.** Depending on the will or pleasure of another; held by courtesy liable to be changed or lost at the pleasure of another. A privilege depending on another's will is _precarious_ or held by a _precarious_ tenure.

**2.** Uncertain; held by a doubtful tenure; depending on unknown or unforeseen causes or events. Temporal prosperity is precarious; personal advantages, health, strength and beauty are all _precarious_ depending on a thousand accidents.

We say also, the weather is precarious; a phrase in which we depart not more from the primary sense of the word, than we do in a large part of all the words in the language.
