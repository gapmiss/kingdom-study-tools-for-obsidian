# Preoccupy

**PREOC'CUPY**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin proeoccupo; proe, before, and occupo, to seize.\]

**1.** To take possession before another; as, to _preoccupy_ a country or land not before occupied.

**2.** To prepossess; to occupy by anticipation or prejudices.

I think it more respectful to the reader to leave something to reflections, than to _preoccupy_ his judgment.
