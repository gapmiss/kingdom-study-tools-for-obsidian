# Poet

**PO'ET**, _noun_ \[Latin poeta. See [[Poem]].\]

**1.** The author of a poem; the inventor or maker of a metrical composition.

A _poet_ is a maker, as the word signifies; and he who cannot make, that is, invent, hath his name for nothing.

**2.** One skilled in making poetry, or who has a particular genius for metrical composition; one distinguished for poetic talents. Many write verses who cannot be called poets.
