# Pool

**POOL**, _noun_ \[Latin palus; Gr. probably from setting, standing, like Latin stagnum, or from issuing, as a spring.\]

A small collection of water in a hollow place, supplied by a spring, and discharging its surplus water by an outlet. It is smaller than a lake, and in New England is never confounded with pond or lake. It signifies with us, a spring with a small basin or reservoir on the surface of the earth. It is used by writers with more latitude, and sometimes signifies a body of stagnant water.
