**PARE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin paro; Gr. lame; to mutilate; Heb. to create; to cut off. The primary sense is to thrust or drive, hence to drive off, to separate, to stop by setting or repelling, as in parry, or to drive off or out, as in separating or producing.\]

**1.** To cut off, as the superficial substance or extremities of a thing; to shave off with a sharp instrument; as, to _pare_ an apple or an orange; to _pare_ the nails; to _pare_ a horse's hoof; to _pare_ land in agriculture.

When _pare_ is followed by the thing diminished, the noun is in the objective case; as, to _pare_ the nails. When the thing separated is the object, _pare_ is followed by off or away; as, to _pare_ off the rind of fruit; to _pare_ away redundances.
