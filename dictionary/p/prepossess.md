# Prepossess

**PREPOSSESS**', _verb transitive_ \[pre and possess.\] To preoccupy, as ground or land; to take previous possession of.

**1.** To preoccupy the mind or heart so as to preclude other things; hence, to bias or prejudice. A mind prepossessed with opinions favorable to a person or cause, will not readily admit unfavorable opinions to take possession, nor yield to reasons that disturb the possessors. When a lady has prepossessed the heart or affections of a man, he does not readily listen to suggestions that tend to remove the prepossession. _prepossess_ is more frequently used in a good sense than prejudice.
