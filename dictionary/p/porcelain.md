# Porcelain

**POR'CELAIN**, _noun_ \[Latin portulaca.\]

**1.** The finest species of earthen ware, originally manufactured in China and Japan, but now made in several European countries. All earthen wares which are white and semi-transparent, are called porcelains, but they differ much in their fineness and beauty. The _porcelain_ of China is said to be made of two species of earth, the petuntse, which is fusible, and the kaolin, which is not fusible, or not with the degree of heat which fuses the petuntse, and that in _porcelain_ the substances are only semi-vitrified, or one substance only is vitrified, the other not. Hence it is concluded that _porcelain_ is an intermediate substance between earth and glass. Hence the second degree of fusibility, of which emollescence is the first, is called by Kirwan the _porcelain_ state.

**2.** The plant called purslain, which see.
