# Pongo

**PON'GO**, _noun_ A name of the orang outang.

The name _pongo_ was applied by Buffon to a large species of orang outang, which is now ascertained to have been an imaginary animal. It is applied by Cuvier to the largest species of ape known, which inhabits Borneo, and resembles the true orang outang in its general form and erect position, but has the cheek pouches and lengthened muzzle of the baboon. It has also been applied \[Ed.Encyc.\] to the Simia troglodytes or chimpanzee of Curvier, a native of W. Africa.
