# Prophecy

**PROPH'ECY**, _noun_ \[Gr. to foretell, before and to tell. This ought to be written prophesy.\]

**1.** A foretelling; prediction; a declaration of something to come. As God only knows future events with certainty, no being but God or some person informed by him, can utter a real _prophecy_ The prophecies recorded in Scripture, when fulfilled, afford most convincing evidence of the divine original of the Scriptures, as those who uttered the prophecies could not have foreknown the events predicted without supernatural instruction. [[2 Peter 1#19|2 Peter 1:19]].

**2.** In Scripture, a book of prophecies; a history; as the _prophecy_ of Ahijah. [[2 Chronicles 9#29|2 Chronicles 9:29]].

**3.** Preaching; public interpretation of Scripture; exhortation or instruction. [[Proverbs 31#1|Proverbs 31:1]].
