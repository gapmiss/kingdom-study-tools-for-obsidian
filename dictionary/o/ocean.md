# Ocean

**OCEAN**, _noun_ o'shun. \[Latin oceanus; Gr.; Heb. to encompass, whence a circle. This is probably an error. The word seems to have for its origin greatness or extent.\]

**1.** The vast body of water which covers more than three fifths of the surface of the globe, called also the sea, or great sea. It is customary to speak of the _ocean_ as if divided into three parts, the Atlantic _ocean_ the Pacific _ocean_ and the Indian ocean; but the _ocean_ is one mass or body, partially separated by the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa on one side, and by America on the other.

**2.** An immense expanse; as the boundless _ocean_ of eternity; oceans of duration and space.

**OCEAN**, _adjective_ o'shun. Pertaining to the main or great sea; as the _ocean_ wave; _ocean_ stream.
