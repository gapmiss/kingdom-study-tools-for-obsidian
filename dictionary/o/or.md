# Or

**OR**, a termination of Latin nouns, is a contraction of vir, a man, _or_ from the same radix. The same word vir, is in our mother tongue, wer, and from this we have the English termination er.

It denotes an agent, as in actor, creditor. We annex it to many words of English origin, as in lessor, as we do er to words of Latin and Greek origin, as in astronomer, laborer. In general, _or_ is annexed to words of Latin, and er to those of English origin.

**OR**, _conjunction_ \[It seems that _or_ is a mere contraction of other.\]

A connective that marks an alternative. 'You may read _or_ may write; ' that is, you may do one of the things at your pleasure, but not both. It corresponds to either. You may either ride to London, _or_ to Windsor. It often connects a series of words _or_ propositions, presenting a choice of either. He may study law _or_ medicine _or_ divinity, _or_ he may enter into trade.

**OR** sometimes begins a sentence, but in this case it expresses an alternative with the foregoing sentence. [[Matthew 7#4|Matthew 7:4]] and 9.

In poetry, _or_ is sometimes used for either.

For thy vast bounties are so numberless, that them _or_ to conceal _or_ else to tell is equally impossible.

**OR** is often used to express an alternative of terms, definitions _or_ explanations of the same thing in different words. Thus we say, a thing is a square, _or_ a figure under four equal sides and angles.

**OR** ever. In this phrase, _or_ is supposed to be a corruption of ere.

**OR**, in heraldry, gold. \[Latin aurum.\]
