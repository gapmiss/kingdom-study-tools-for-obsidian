# Origin

**OR'IGIN**, _noun_ \[Latin origo.\]

**1.** The first existence or beginning of any thing; as the _origin_ of Rome. In history it is necessary, if practicable, to trace all events to their _origin_

**2.** Fountain; source; cause; that from which any thing primarily proceeds; that which gives existence or beginning. The apostasy is believed to have been the _origin_ of moral evil. The _origin_ of many of our customs is lost in antiquity. Nations, like individuals, are ambitious to trace their descent from an honorable _origin_
