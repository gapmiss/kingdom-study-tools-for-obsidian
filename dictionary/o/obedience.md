# Obedience

**OBE'DIENCE**, _noun_ \[Latin obedientia. See [[Obey]].\]

Compliance with a command, prohibition or known law and rule of duty prescribed; the performance of what is required or enjoined by authority, or the abstaining from what is prohibited, in compliance with the command or prohibition. To constitute _obedience_ the act or forbearance to act must be in submission to authority; the command must be known to the person, and his compliance must be in consequence of it, or it is not _obedience_ _obedience_ is not synonymous with obsequiousness; the latter often implying meanness or servility, and _obedience_ being merely a proper submission to authority. That which duty requires implies dignity of conduct rather than servility. _obedience_ may be voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary _obedience_ alone can be acceptable to God.

Government must compel the _obedience_ of individuals; otherwise who will seek its protection or fear its vengeance?
