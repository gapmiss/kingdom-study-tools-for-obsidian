# Offertory

**OF'FERTORY**, _noun_ The act of offering, or the thing offered. \[Little used.\]

**1.** _offertory_ was properly an anthem chanted or a voluntary played on the organ during the offering and a part of the mass, in the Catholic church; but since the reformation it denotes certain sentences in the communion-office, read while the alms are collecting.

**2.** Anciently, the linen on which the offering was laid.
