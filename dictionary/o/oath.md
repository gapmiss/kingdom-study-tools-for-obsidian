# Oath

**OATH**, _noun_

A solemn affirmation or declaration, made with an appeal to God for the truth of what is affirmed. The appeal to God in an _oath_ implies that the person imprecates his vengeance and renounces his favor if the declaration is false, or if the declaration is a promise, the person invokes the vengeance of God if he should fail to fulfill it. A false _oath_ is called perjury.
