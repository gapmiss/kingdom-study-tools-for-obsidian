# Omen

**O'MEN**, _noun_ \[Latin omen; Heb. an augur.\]

A sign or indication of some future event; a prognostic. Superstition and ignorance multiply omens; philosophy and truth reject all omens, except such as may be called causes of the events. Without a miracle, how can one event be the _omen_ of another with which it has no connection?
