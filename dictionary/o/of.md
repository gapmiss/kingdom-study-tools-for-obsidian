**OF**, _preposition_ ov. \[Gr.\]

**1.** From or out of; proceeding from, as the cause, source, means, author or agent bestowing.

Hence _of_ is the sign _of_ the genitive case, the case that denotes production; as the son _of_ man, the son proceeding from man, produced from man. This is the primary sense, although we now say, produced by man. 'Part _of_ these were slain; ' that is, a number separate, for part denotes a division; the sense then is, a number from or out _of_ the whole were slain. So also, 'some _of_ these were slain; ' that is, some from or out _of_ others. 'I have known him _of_ old, or _of_ a child; ' that is, from old times, from a child. 'He is _of_ the race _of_ kings; ' that is, descended from kings. 'He is _of_ noble blood or birth, or _of_ ignoble origin.' 'No particle _of_ matter, or no body can move _of_ itself; ' that is, by force or strength proceeding from itself, derived from itself.

'The quarrel is not now _of_ fame and tribute, or _of_ wrongs done; ' that is, from fame or wrongs, as the cause, and we may render it concerning, about, relating to.

'Of this little he had some to spare; ' that is, some from the whole. It may be rendered out _of_

'Of all our heroes thou canst boast alone; ' that is, thou alone from the number _of_ heroes. This may be rendered among.

'The best _of_ men, the most renowned _of_ all; ' that is, the best from the number _of_ men, the most renowned from the whole; denoting primarily separation, like part.

'I was well entertained _of_ the English Consul; ' that is, entertained from the Consul; my entertainment was from the Consul. This use is obsolete, and we use by in lieu _of_ it.

'This does _of_ right belong to us; ' that is, from right, de jure; our title proceeds from right.

'The chariot was all _of_ cedar; ' that is, made from cedar. So we say, made _of_ gold, made _of_ clay; an application corresponding with our modern use _of_ from; manufactured from wool, or from raw materials. Hence we say, cloth consisting _of_ wool. 'This is a scheme _of_ his own devising; ' that is, from his own devising or device. 'If any man minister, let him do it as _of_ the ability which God giveth; ' that is, as from the ability, as the source _of_ action.

'Of happy, he is become miserable; ' that is, from happy; from being happy, he has passed to being miserable. 'Of necessity this must prove ruinous; ' that is, from necessity, as the cause or source. 'Of a hundred take fifty; ' that is, from a hundred, or out _of_ a hundred, from among a hundred.

**OF** sometimes implies a part or share.

It is a duty to communicate _of_ those blessings we have received.

From is then the primary sense _of_ this preposition; a sense retained in off, the same word differently written for distinction. But this sense is appropriately lost in many _of_ its applications; as a man _of_ genius, a man _of_ courage, a man _of_ rare endowments, a fossil _of_ a red color, or _of_ a hexagonal figure. he lost all hope _of_ relief. This is an affair _of_ the cabinet. He is a man _of_ decayed fortune. What is the price _of_ corn? We say that _of_ in these and similar phrases, denotes property or possession, making _of_ the sign _of_ the genitive or possessive case. These applications, however, all proceeded from the same primary sense. That which proceeds from or is produced by a person, is naturally the property or possession _of_ that person, as the son _of_ John; and this idea _of_ property in the course _of_ time would pass to things not thus produced, but still bearing a relation to another thing. Thus we say, the father _of_ a son, as well as the son _of_ a father. In both senses, other languages also use the same word, as in the French de, de la, and Italian di, dell. _of_ then has one primary sense, from, departing, issuing, proceeding from or out _of_ and a derivative sense denoting possession or property.
