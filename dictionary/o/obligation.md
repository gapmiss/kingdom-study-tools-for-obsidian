# Obligation

**OBLIGA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin obligatio.\]

**1.** The binding power of a vow, promise, oath or contract, or of law, civil, political or moral, independent of a promise; that which constitutes legal or moral duty, and which renders a person liable to coercion and punishment for neglecting it. The laws and commands of God impose on us an _obligation_ to love him supremely, and our neighbor as ourselves. Every citizen is under an _obligation_ to obey the laws of the state. Moral _obligation_ binds men without promise or contract.

**2.** The binding force of civility, kindness or gratitude, when the performance of a duty cannot be enforced by law. Favors conferred impose on men an _obligation_ to make suitable returns.

**3.** Any act by which a person becomes bound to do something to or for another, or to forbear something.

**4.** In law, a bond with a condition annexed and a penalty for non-fulfillment.
