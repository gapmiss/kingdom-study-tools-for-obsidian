# Obstinacy

**OB'STINACY**, _noun_ \[Latin obstinatio, from obsto, to stand against, to oppose; ob and sto.\]

**1.** A fixedness in opinion or resolution that cannot be shaken at all, or not without great difficulty; firm and usually unreasonable adherence to an opinion, purpose or system; a fixedness that will not yield to persuasion, arguments or other means. _obstinacy_ may not always convey the idea of unreasonable or unjustifiable firmness; as when we say, soldiers fight with _obstinacy_ But often, and perhaps usually, the word denotes a fixedness of resolution which is not to be vindicated under the circumstances; stubbornness; pertinacity; persistency.

**2.** Fixedness that will not yield to application, or that yields with difficulty; as the _obstinacy_ of a disease or evil.
