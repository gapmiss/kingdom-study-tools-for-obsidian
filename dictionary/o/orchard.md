# Orchard

**OR'CHARD**, _noun_ \[See [[Yard]].\]

An inclosure for fruit trees. In Great Britain, a department of the garden appropriated to fruit trees of all kinds, but chiefly to apple trees. In America, any piece of land set with apple trees, is called an orchard; and orchards are usually cultivated land, being either grounds for mowing or tillage. In some parts of the country, a piece of ground planted with peach trees is called a peach _orchard_ But in most cases, I believe the _orchard_ in both countries is distinct from the garden.
