# Ode

**ODE**, _noun_ \[Latin ode; Gr.\] A short poem or song; a poetical composition proper to be set to music or sung; a lyric poem. The _ode_ is of the greater or less kind; the less is characterized by sweetness and ease; the greater by sublimity, rapture and quickness of transition.

Pindar has left Olympic odes, Pythian odes, Nemean odes, and Isthmian odes.

The _ode_ consists of unequal verses in stanzas or strophes.
