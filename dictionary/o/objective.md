# Objective

**OBJECT'IVE**, _adjective_

**1.** Belonging to the object; contained in the object.

Objective certainty, is when the proposition is certainly true in itself; and subjective, when we are certain of the truth of it. The one is in things, the other in our minds.

**2.** In grammar, the _objective_ case is that which follows a transitive verb or a preposition; that case in which the object of the verb is placed, when produced or affected by the act expressed by the verb. This case in English answers to the oblique cases of the Latin.
