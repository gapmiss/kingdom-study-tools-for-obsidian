# Oration

**ORA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin oratio, from oro, to pray, to utter.\]

**1.** A speech or discourse composed according to the rules of oratory, and spoken in public. Orations may be reduced to three kinds; demonstrative, deliberative, and judicial.

**2.** In modern usage, an _oration_ differs from a sermon, from an argument at the bar, and from a speech before a deliberative assembly. The word is now applied chiefly to discourses pronounced on special occasions, as a funeral _oration_ an _oration_ on some anniversary, etc. and to academic declamations.

**3.** A harangue; a public speech or address.
