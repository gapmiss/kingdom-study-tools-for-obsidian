# Object

**OB'JECT**, _noun_ \[Latin objectum, objectus. See the Verb.\]

**1.** That about which any power or faculty is employed, or something apprehended or presented to the mind by sensation or imagination. Thus that quality of a rose which is perceived by the sense of smell, is an _object_ of perception. When the _object_ is not in contact with the organ of sense, there must be some medium through which we obtain the perception of it. The impression which objects make on the senses, must be by the immediate application of them to the organs of sense, or by means of the medium that intervenes between the organs and the objects.

**2.** That to which the mind is directed for accomplishment or attainment; end; ultimate purpose. Happiness is the _object_ of every man's desires; we all strive to attain that _object_ Wealth and honor are pursued with eagerness as desirable objects.

**3.** Something presented to the senses or the mind, to excite emotion, affection or passion.

This passenger felt some degree of concern at the sight of so moving an _object_

In this sense, the word uttered with a particular emphasis, signifies something that may strongly move our pity, abhorrence or disgust. What an object!

**4.** In grammar, that which is produced, influenced or acted on by something else; that which follows a transitive verb. When we say, 'God created the world, ' world denotes the thing produced, and is the _object_ after the verb created. When we say, 'the light affects the eye, ' eye denotes that which is affected or acted on. When we say, 'instruction directs the mind or opinions, ' mind and opinions, ' mind and opinions are the objects influenced.
