# Obtain

**OBTA'IN**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin obtineo; ob and teneo, to hold.\]

**1.** To get; to gain; to procure; in a general sense, to gain possession of a thing, whether temporary or permanent; to acquiare. this word usually implies exertion to get possession, and in this it differs from receive, which may or may not imply exertion. it differs from acquire, as genus from species; acquire being properly applied only to things permanently possessed; but _obtain_ is applied both to things of temporary and of permanent possession. We _obtain_ loans of money on application; we _obtain_ answers to letters; we _obtain_ spirit from liquors by distillation and salts by evaporation. We _obtain_ by seeking; we often receive without seeking. We acquire or _obtain_ a good title to lands by deed, or by a judgment of court; but we do not acquire spirit by distillation; nor do we acquire an answer to a letter or an application.

He shall _obtain_ the kingdom by flatteries. [[Daniel 11#21|Daniel 11:21]].

In whom we have obtained an inheritance. [[Ephesians 1#11|Ephesians 1:11]].

**2.** To keep; to hold.
