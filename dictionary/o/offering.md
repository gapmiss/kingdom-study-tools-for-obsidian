# Offering

**OF'FERING**, _participle present tense_ Presenting; proposing; sacrificing; bidding; presenting to the eye or mind.

**OF'FERING**, _noun_ That which is presented in divine service; an animal or a portion of bread or corn, or of gold and silver, or other valuable articles, presented to God as an atonement for sin, or as a return of thanks for his favors, or for other religious purpose; a sacrifice; an oblation. In the Mosaic economy, there were burnt-offerings, sin-offerings, peace-offerings, trespass-offerings, thank-offerings, wave-offerings, and wood-offerings. Pagan nations also present offerings to their deities. Christ by the _offering_ of himself has superseded the use of all other offerings, having made atonement for all men.

When thou shalt make his soul an _offering_ for sin, he shall see his seed - [[Isaiah 53#10|Isaiah 53:10]].
