**OC'ULIST**, _noun_ \[from Latin oculus, the eye.\] One skilled in diseases of the eyes, or one who professes to cure them.

Oculus beli, a semi-pellucid gem, a variety of agate of a grayish white color, variegated with yellow, and with a black central nucleus. Its variegations resemble the pupil and iris of the eye.

Oculus cati, cat's eye or asteria, a beautiful gem approaching the nature of the opal, having a bright color which seems to be lodged deep in the stone, and which shifts as it is moved in various directions. It is larger than a pea, and generally of a semi-circular form, naturally smooth. It is found in the East and West Indies, and in Europe.

Oculus mundi, otherwise called hydrophane and lapis mutabilis, a precious stone of an opake whitish brown color, but becoming transparent by infusion in an aqueous fluid, and resuming its opacity when dry. It is found in beds over the opals in Hungary, Silesia and Saxony, and over the chalcedonies and agates in Iceland.
