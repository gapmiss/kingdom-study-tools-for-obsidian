# Opportune

**OPPORTU'NE**, _adjective_ \[Latin opportunus; ob and porto, to bear or bring; probably from the root of fero or porto, to bear. The sense of the verb opporto, would be to bring to or upon. See [[Impart]], Importune. In this and all words of like signification, the primary sense is to fall, come or bring to. See Luck, Fortune, Season.\]

Properly, having come or being present at a proper time; hence, seasonable; timely; well timed. It agrees with seasonable rather than with convenient, though the sense of the latter may be included in it.

Perhaps in view of those bright confines, whence with neighboring arms, and _opportune_ excursion, we may chance re-enter heaven.
