# Occur

**OCCUR**', _verb intransitive_ \[Latin occurro; ob and curro, to run.\]

**1.** Primarily, to meet; to strike against; to clash; and so used by Bentley, but this application is obsolete.

**2.** To meet or come to the mind; to be presented to the mind, imagination or memory. We say, no better plan occurs to me or to my mind; it does not _occur_ to my recollection; the thought did not _occur_ to me.

There doth not _occur_ to me any use of this experiment for profit.

**3.** To appear; to meet the eye; to be found here and there. This word occurs in twenty places in the Scriptures; the other word does not _occur_ in a single place; it does not _occur_ in the sense suggested.

**4.** To oppose; to obviate. \[Not used.\]
