# Opal

**O'PAL**, _noun_ \[Latin opalus or opalum.\] A stone of the silicious genus, and of several varieties. It is one of the most beautiful of this genus, by reason of its changeableness of color by reflection and refraction. Kirwan distributes opals into four families, _opal_ semi-opal, pitch stone \[pechstein, \] and ligniform. Jameson divides _opal_ into seven kinds.

Opal is a subspecies of indivisible quartz.
