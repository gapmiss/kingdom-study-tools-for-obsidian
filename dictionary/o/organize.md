# Organize

**OR'GANIZE**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To form with suitable organs; to construct so that one part may cooperate with another.

Those nobler faculties of the soul organized matter could never produce.

**2.** To sing in parts; as, to _organize_ the hallelujah.

**3.** To distribute into suitable parts and appoint proper officers, that the whole may act as one body; as, to _organize_ an army. So we say, to _organize_ the house of representatives, which is done by the appointment of officers and verification of the powers of the several members. So we say, a club, a party or a faction is organized, when it takes a systemized form.

This original and supreme will organizes the government.
