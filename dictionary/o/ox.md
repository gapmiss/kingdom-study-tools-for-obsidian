# Ox

**OX**, _noun_ _plural_ oxen. _pronoun_ ox'n.

The male of the bovine genus of quadrupeds, castrated and grown to his size or nearly so. The young male is called in America a steer. The same animal not castrated is called a bull. These distinctions are well established with us in regard to domestic animals of this genus. When we speak of wild animals of this kind, _ox_ is sometimes applied both to the male and female, and in zoology, the same practice exists in regard to the domestic animals. Sop in common usage, a pair of bulls yoked may be sometimes called oxen. We never apply the name _ox_ to the cow or female of the domestic kind. Oxen in the plural may comprehend both the male and female.
