# Squeamish

**SQUEAMISH**, _adjective_ \[probably from the root of wamble.\] Literally, having a stomach that is easily turned, or that readily nauseates any thing; hence, nice to excess in taste; fastidious; easily disgusted; apt to be offended at trifling improprieties; scrupulous.

Quoth he, that honors very _squeamish_ that takes a basting for a blemish.

His muse is rustic, and perhaps too plain the men of _squeamish_ taste to entertain.
