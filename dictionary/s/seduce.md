# Seduce

**SEDU'CE**, _v_. _t_. \[Latin _seduco_; _se_, from, and _duco_, to lead.\]

**1.** To draw aside or entice from the path of rectitude and duty in any manner, by flattery,

promises, bribes or otherwise; to tempt and lead to iniquity; to corrupt; to deprave.

Me the gold of France did not _seduce_. _Shak_.

In the latter times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to _seducing_ spirits.

Tim. 4.

**2.** To entice to a surrender of chastity. He that can _seduce_ a female is base enough to betray her.
