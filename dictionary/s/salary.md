# Salary

**SAL'ARY**, _noun_ \[Latin salarium; said to be from sal, salt, which was part of the pay of Roman soldiers.\]

The recompense or consideration stipulated to be paid to a person for services, usually a fixed sum to be paid by the year, as to governors, magistrates, settled clergymen, instructors of seminaries, or other officers, civil or ecclesiastical. When wages are stated or stipulated by the month, week or day, we do not call the compensation _salary_ but pay or wages; as in the case of military men and laborers.
