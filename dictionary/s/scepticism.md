**1.** The doctrines and opinions of the Pyrrhonists or sceptical philosophers; universal doubt; the scheme of philosophy which denies the certainty of any knowledge respecting the phenomena of nature.

**2.** In theology, a doubting of the truth of revelation, or a denial of the divine origin of the christian religion, or of the being, perfections or truth of God.
