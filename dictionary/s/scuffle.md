# Scuffle

**SCUF'FLE**, _noun_ \[This is a different orthography of _shuffle_; from _shove_, or its root.\]

**1.** A contention or trial of strength between two persons, who embrace each other's bodies; a struggle with close embrace, to decide which shall throw the other; in distinction from from _wrestling_, which is a trial of strength and dexterity at arm's lenght. Among our common people, it is not unusual for two persons to commence a contest by wrestling, and at last _close_ _in_, as it is called, and decide the contest by a _scuffle_.

**2.** A confused contest; a tumultuous struggle for victory or superiority; a fight.

The dog leaps upon the serpent and tears it to pieces; but in the _scuffle_, the cradle happened to be overturned. _L' Estrange._

**SCUF'FLE**, _verb intransitive_

**1.** To strive or struggle with close embrace, as two men or boys,

**2.** To strive or contend tumultuously, as small parties.

A gallant man prefers to fight to great disadvantages in the field, in an orderly way, rather than to _scuffle_ with an undisciplined rabble. _K. Charles_.
