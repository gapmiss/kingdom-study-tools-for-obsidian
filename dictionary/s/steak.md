# Steak

**STEAK**, _noun_ \[G., a piece.\] A slice of beef or pork broiled, or cut for broiling. \[As far as my observation extends, this word is never applied to any species of meat, except to beef and pork, nor to these dressed in any way except by broiling. Possible it may be used of a piece fried.\]
