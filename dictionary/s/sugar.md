# Sugar

**SUGAR**, _noun_ **SHUG'AR**. \[Latin saccharum.\]

**1.** A well known substance manufactured chiefly from the _sugar_ cane, arundo saccharifera; but in the United States, great quantities of this article are made from the _sugar_ maple; and in France, a few years since, it was extensively manufactured from the beet. The saccharine liquor is concentrated by boiling, which expels the water; lime is added to neutralize the acid that is usually present; the gresser impurities rise to the surface, and are separated in the form of scum; and finally as the liquor cools, the _sugar_ separates from the melasses in grains. The sirup or melasses is drained off, leaving the _sugar_ in the state known in commerce by the name of raw or muscovado _sugar_ This is farther purified by means of clay, or more extensively by bullocks' blood, which forming a coagulum, envelops the impurities. Thus clarified, it takes the names of lump, loaf, refined, etc. according to the different degrees of purification. _sugar_ is a proximate element of the vegetable kingdom, and is found in most ripe fruits and many farinaceous roots. By fermentation, _sugar_ is converted into alcohol, and hence forms the basis of those substances which are used for making intoxicating liquors, as melasses, grapes, apples, malt, etc.

The ultimate elements of _sugar_ are oxygen, carbon and hydrogen. Of all vegetable principles, it is considered by Dr. Rush as the most wholesome and nutritious.

**2.** A chimical term; as the _sugar_ of lead.

**SUGAR**, _verb transitive_ **SHUG'AR**. To impregnate, season, cover, sprinkle or mix with _sugar_

**1.** To sweeten.

But flattery still in sugar'd words betrays.

**SUGAR** of lead, acetate of lead.
