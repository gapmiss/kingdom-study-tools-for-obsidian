# Shall

**SHALL**,

**1.** _Shall_ is primarily in the present, and in our mother tongue was followed by a verb in the infinitive, like other verbs. 'Ic _sceal_ fram the _beon_ gefullod.' I _have need_ to be baptized of thee. 'Ic nu _sceal singan_ sar-cwidas.' I must now sing mornful songs.

We still use _shall_ and _should_ before another verb in the infinitive, without the sign _to_; but significance of _shall_ is considerably deflected from its primitive sense. It is now treated as a mere auxiliary to other verbs, serving to form some of the tenses. In the present tense, _shall_, before a verb in the infinitive, forms the future tense; but its force and effect are different with different persons or personal pronouns. Thus in the first person, _shall_ simply foretells or declares what will take place; as, I or we _shall_ ride to town on Monday. This declaration simply informs another of a fact that is to take place. The sense of _shall_ here is changed from an expression of need or duty, to that of previous statement or information, grounded on intention or resolution. When uttered with emphasis, 'I _shall_ go, ' it expresses firm determination, but not a promise.

**2.** In the second and third persons, _shall_ implies a promise, command or determination. 'You _shall_ receive your wages, ' 'he _shall_ receive his wages, ' imply that you or he _ought_ to receive them; but usage gives these phrases the force of a _promise_ in the person uttering them.

When _shall_ is uttered with emphasis in such phrases, it expresses determination in the speaker, and implies an authority to enforce the act. 'Do you refuse to go? Does he refuse to go? But you or he _shall_ go.'

**3.** _Shall I go, _shall_ he go_, interrogatively, asks, for permission or direction. But _shall you go_, asks for information of another's intention.

**4.** But after another verb, _shall_, in the third person, simply foretells. He says that he _shall_ leave town to-morrow. So also in the second person; you say that you _shall_ ride to-morrow.

**5.** After _if_, and some verbs which expresscondition or supposition, _shall_, in all the persons, simply foretells; as,

If I _shall_ say, or we _shall_ say,

Thou _shalt_ say, ye or you _shall_ say,

He _shall_ say_, they_ _shall_ _say_.

**6.** _Should_, in the first person, implies a conditional event. 'I _should_ have written a letter yesterday, had I not been interrupted.' Or it expresses obligation, and that in all the persons.

I _should_, have paid the bill on demand; it was my duty, your duty, his duty to

Thou _shouldest_, pay the bill on demand, but it was not paid.

He _should_,

You _should_,

**7.** _Should_, though properly the past tense of _shall_, is often used to express a contingent future event; as, if it _should_ rain to-morrow; if you _should_ go to London next week; if he _should_ arrive within a month. In like manner after _though, grant, admit, allow_.
