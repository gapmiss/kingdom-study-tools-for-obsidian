# Sensory

**SENS'ORY**,

**1.** The seat of sense; Darwin uses sensorium to express not only the medullary part of the brain, spinal marrow, nerves, organs of sense and the muscles, but also that living principle or spirit of animation which resides throughout the body, without being cognizable to our senses, except by its effects. The canges which occasionally take place in the sensorium, as during exertions of volition, or the sensations of pleasure and pain, he terms _sensorial motions_.

**2.** Organ of sense; as double _sensories_; two eyes, two ears, etc.
