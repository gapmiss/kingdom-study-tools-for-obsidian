# Shear

**SHEAR**, _verb transitive_ _preterit tense_ _sheared_; _participle passive_ _sheared_ or shorn. The old _preterit tense_ _shore_ is entirely obsolete.

**1.** To cut or clip something from the surface with an instrument of two blades; to separate any thing from the surface by shears, scissors or a like instrument; as, to _shear_ sheep; to _shear_ cloth. It is appropriately used for the cutting of wool from sheep on their skins, for clipping the nap from cloth, but may be applied to other things; as, a _horse_ shears the ground in feeding much closer than an ox.

**2.** To separate by shears; as, to _shear_ a fleece.

**3.** To reap. \[_Not in use_.\] _Scotish._

**SHEAR**, To deviate. \[See _Sheer_.\]
