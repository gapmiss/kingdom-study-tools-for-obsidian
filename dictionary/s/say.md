# Say

**SAY**, _verb transitive_ _preterit tense_ and _participle passive_ said, contracted from sayed.

**1.** To speak; to utter in words; as, he said nothing; he said many things; he says not a word. _say_ a good word for me.

It is observable that although this word is radically synonymous with speak and tell, yet the uses are applications of these words are different. Thus we _say_ to speak an oration, to tell a story; but in these phrases, _say_ cannot be used. Yet to _say_ a lesson is good English, though not very elegant. We never use the phrases to _say_ a sermon or discourse, to _say_ an argument, to _say_ a speech, to _say_ testimony.

A very general use of _say_ is to introduce a relation, narration or recital, either of the speaker himself or of something said or done or to be done by another. Thus Adam said, this is bone of my bone; Noah said, blessed be the Lord God of Shem. If we _say_ we have no sin, we deceive ourselves. _say_ to the cities of Judah, behold your God. I cannot _say_ what I should do in a similar case. _say_ thus precedes a sentence. But it is perhaps impracticable to reduce the peculiar and appropriate uses of _say_ speak and tell, to general rules. They can be learned only by observation.

\[Note - This verb is not properly intransitive. In the phrase, 'as when we _say_ Plato is no fool, ' the last clause is the object after the verb; that is, 'we _say_ what follows.' If this verb is properly intransitive in any case, it is in the phrase, 'that is to _say_ ' but in such cases, the subsequent clause is the object of the verb, being that which is said, uttered or related.\]
