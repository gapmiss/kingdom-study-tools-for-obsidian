# Synonymous

**SYNON'YMOUS**, _adjective_ Expressing the same thing; conveying the same idea. We rarely find two words precisely _synonymous_ Wave and billow are sometimes _synonymous_ but not always. When we speak of the large rolling swell of the sea, we may call it a wave or a billow; but when we speak of the small swell of a pond, we may call it a wave, but we may not call it a billow.
