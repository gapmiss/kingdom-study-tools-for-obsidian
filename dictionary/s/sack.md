**SACK**, _verb transitive_ \[From comparing this word and _sack_ a bag, in several languages, it appears that they are both from one root, and that the primary sense is to strain, pull, draw; hence _sack_ a bag, is a tie, that which is tied or drawn together; and _sack_ to pillage, is to pull, to strip, that is, to take away by violence.\]

To plunder or pillage, as a town or city. Rome was twice taken and sacked in the reign of one pope. This word is never, I believe, applied to the robbing of persons, or pillaging of single houses, but to the pillaging of towns and cities; and as towns are usually or often sacked, when taken by assault, the word may sometimes include the sense of taking by storm.

The Romans lay under the apprehension of seeing their city sacked by a barbarous enemy.

**SACK**, _noun_ The pillage or plunder of a town or city; or the storm and plunder of a town; as the _sack_ of Troy.
