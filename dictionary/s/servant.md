# Servant

**SERV'ANT**, \[**L**. _servans_, from _servo_, to keep or hold; properly one that waits, that is, stops, holds, attends, or one that is bound.\]

**1.** A person, male or female, that attends another for the pupose of performing menial offices for him, ot who is employed by another for such offices or for other labor, and is subject to his command. The word is correlative to _master_. _Servant_ differs from _slave_, as the servant's subjection to a master is voluntary, the slave's is not. Every slave is a _servant_ but every _servant_ is not a slave.

Servants are of various kinds; as _household_ or _domestic servants_, menial servants; _laborers_, who are hired by the day, week or other term, and do not reside with their employers, ot if they board in the same house, are employed abroad and not in the domestic services; _apprentices_, who are bound for a term of years to serve a master, for the purpose of learning his trade or occupation.

In a _legal sense_, stewards, factors, bailifs and other agents, are _servants_ for the time they are employed in such character, as they act in subordination to others.

**2.** One in a state of subjection.

**3.**In _Scripture_, a slave; a bondman; one purchased for money, and who was compelled to serve till the year of jubilee; also, one purchased for a term of years.

**4.** The subject of a king; as the _servents_ of David or of Saul.

The Syrians became _servants_ to David. [[2 Samuel 8#2|2 Samuel 8:2]].

**5.** A person who voluntarily serves another or acts as his minister; as joshua was the _servant_ of Moses, and the apostles the apostles the _servants_ of Christ. So Christ himself is called a _servant_, [[Isaiah 42#1|Isaiah 42:1]]. Moses is called the _servant_ of the Lord, Duet. 34.

**6.** A person employed or used as an unstrument in accomplishing God's purposes of mercy or wrath. So Nebuchadnezzar is called the _servant_ of God. [[Jeremiah 25#9|Jeremiah 25:9]].

**7.** One who yields obedience to another. The saints are called _servants_ of God, or of righteousness; and the wicked are called the _servants_ of sin.

**8.** That which yields obedience, or acts on subordination as an instrument.

**9.** One that makes painful sacrifices in compliance with the weakness or wants of others.

**10.** A person of base condition or ignoble spirit.

**11.** A word of civilith. I am, sir, your humble or obedient _servant_.

Our betters tell us they are our humble _servants_, but understand us to be their slaves. _Swift._
