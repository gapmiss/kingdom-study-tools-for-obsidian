# Schism

**SCHISM**, _noun_ sizm. \[Latin schisma; Gr. to divide, Latin scindo.\]

**1.** In a general sense, division or separation; but appropriately, a division or separation in a church or denomination of christians, occasioned by diversity of opinions; breach of unity among people of the same religious faith.

\- Set bounds to our passions by reason, to our errors by truth, and to our schisms by charity.

In Scripture, the word seems to denote a breach of charity, rather than a difference of doctrine.

**2.** Separation; division among tribes or classes of people.
