**SHACK**, _noun_ In _ancient customs of England_, a liberty of witer pasturage. In Norfolk and Suffolk, the lord of the manot has a _shack_, that is, liberty of feeding his sheep at pleasure on his tenants' lands during the dix winter months.

In New England, _shack_ is used in a somewhat similar sense for mast or the food of swine, and for feeding at large or in the forest, \[for we have no manors, \] and I have heard a shiftless fellow, a vagabond, called a _shack_.
