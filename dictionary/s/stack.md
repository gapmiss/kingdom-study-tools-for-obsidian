# Stack

**STACK**, _noun_

**1.** A large conical pile of hay, grain or straw, sometimes covered with thatch. In America, the _stack_ differs from the cock only in size, both being conical. A long pile of hay or grain is called a rick. In England, this distinction is not always observed. This word in Great Britain is sometimes applied to a pile of wood containing 108 cubic feet, and also to a pile of poles; but I believe never in America.

Against every pillar was a _stack_ of billets above a mans highth.

**2.** A number of funnels or chimneys standing together. We say, a _stack_ of chimneys; which is correct, as a chimney is a passage. But we also call the whole _stack_ a chimney. Thus we say, the chimney rises ten feet above the roof.

**STACK**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To lay in a conical or other pile; to make into a large pile; as, to _stack_ hay or grain.

**2.** In England, to pile wood, poles, etc.
