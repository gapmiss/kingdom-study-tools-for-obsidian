# Syllable

**SYL'LABLE**, _noun_ \[Latin syllaba; Gr. to comprehend, and to take.\]

**1.** A letter, or a combination of letters, uttered together, or at a single effort or impulse of the voice. A vowel may form a _syllable_ by itself, as a, the definitive, or in amen; e in even; o in over, and the like. A _syllable_ may also be formed of a vowel and one consonant, as in go, do, in, at; or a _syllable_ may be formed by a vowel with two articulations, one preceding, the other following it, as in can, but, tun; or a _syllable_ may consist of a combination of consonants, with one vowel or diphthong, as strong, short, camp, voice.

A _syllable_ sometimes forms a word, and is then significant, as in go, run, write, sun, moon. In other cases, a _syllable_ is merely part of a word, and by itself is not significant. Thus ac, in active, has no signification.

At least one vowel or open sound is essential to the formation of a syllable; hence in every word there must be as many syllables as there are single vowels, or single vowels and diphthongs. A word is called according to the number of syllables it contains, viz.

Monosyllable, a word of one _syllable_

Dissyllable, a word of two syllables.

Trisyllable, a word of three syllables.

Polysyllable, a word of many syllables.

**2.** A small part of a sentence or discourse; something very concise. This account contains not a _syllable_ of truth.

Before a _syllable_ of the law of God was written.

**SYL'LABLE**, _verb transitive_ To utter; to articulate. \[Not used.\]
