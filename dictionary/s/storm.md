# Storm

**STORM**, _noun_ \[G., to disturb. Latin The primary sense of _storm_ is a rushing, raging or violent agitation.\[

**1.** A violent wind; a tempest. Thus a _storm_ of wind, is correct language, as the proper sense of the word is rushing, violence. It has primarily no reference to a fall of rain or snow. But as a violent wind is often attended with rain or snow, the word _storm_ has come to be used, most improperly, for a fall of rain or snow without wind.

O beat those storms, and roll the seas in vain.

**2.** A violent assault on a fortified place; a furious attempt of troops to enter ad take a fortified place by scaling the walls, forcing the gates and the like.
