# Stand

**STAND**, _verb intransitive_ _preterit tense_ and _participle passive_ stood. \[This verb, if from the root of G., is a derivative from the noun, which is formed from the participle of the original verb. In this case, the noun should properly precede the verb. It may be here remarked that if stan is the radical word, _stand_ and Latin Sto cannot be from the same stock. But _stand_ in the _preterit tense_ is stood, and sto forms steti. This induces a suspicion that stan is not the root of _stand_ but that n is casual. I am inclined however to believe these words to be from different roots. The Russ. Stoyu, to _stand_ is the Latin sto, but it signifies also to be, to exist, being the substantive verb.\]
