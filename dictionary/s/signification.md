# Signification

**SIGNIFICA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin significatio. See [[Signify]].\]

**1.** The act of making known, or of communicating ideas to another by signs or by words, by any thing that is understood, particularly by words. All speaking, or _signification_ of one's mind, implies an act or address of one man to another.

**2.** Meaning; that which is understood to be intended by a sign, character, mark or word; that idea or sense of a sign, mar, word or expression which the person using it intends to convey, or that which men in general who use it, understand it to convey. The _signification_ of words was originally arbitrary, and is dependent on usage. But when custom has annexed a certain sense to a letter or sound, or to a combination of letters or sounds, this sense is always to be considered the _signification_ which the person using the word intends to communicate. So by custom, certain signs or gestures have a determinate _signification_ Such is the fact also with figures, algebraic character, etc.
