# Science

**SCI'ENCE**, _noun_ \[Latin scientia, from scio, to know.\]

**1.** In a general sense, knowledge, or certain knowledge; the comprehension or understanding of truth or facts by the mind. The _science_ of God must be perfect.

**2.** In philosophy, a collection of the general principles or leading truths relating to any subject. Pure _science_ as the mathematics, is built on self-evident truths; but the term _science_ is also applied to other subjects founded on generally acknowledged truths, as metaphysics; or on experiment and observation, as chemistry and natural philosophy; or even to an assemblage of the general principles of an art, as the _science_ of agriculture; the _science_ of navigation. Arts relate to practice, as painting and sculpture.

A principle in _science_ is a rule in art.

**3.** Art derived from precepts or built on principles.

Science perfects genius.

**4.** Any art or species of knowledge.

No _science_ doth make known the first principles on which it buildeth.

**5.** One of the seven liberal branches of knowledge, viz grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music.

\[Note - Authors have not always been careful to use the terms art and _science_ with due discrimination and precision. Music is an art as well as a _science_ In general, an art is that which depends on practice or performance, and _science_ that which depends on abstract or speculative principles. The theory of music is a science; the practice of it an art.\]
