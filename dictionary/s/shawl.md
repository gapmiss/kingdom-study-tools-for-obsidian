# Shawl

**SHAWL**, _noun_ A cloth of wool, cotton, silk or hair, used by females as a loose covering for the neck and shoulders. Shawls are of various sizes from that of a hankerchief to that of a counterpane. Shawls were originally manufactured in the heart of India from the fine silky wool of the Thibet sheep, and the best shawls now come from Cashmere; but they are also manufactured in Europe. The largest kinds are used in train-dresses and for long scarfs.

**SHAWM**, _noun_ A hautboy or cornet; written also _shalm_, but not in use.
