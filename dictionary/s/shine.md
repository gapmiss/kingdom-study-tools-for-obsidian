# Shine

**SHINE**, _verb intransitive_ \[If _s_ is a prefix, this word accords with the root of Latin _canus_, _caneo_.

**1.** To emit rays of light; to give light; to beam with steady radiance; to exhibit lightness or splendor; as, the sun _shines_ by day; the moon _shines_ by night. _Shining_ differs from _sparkling, glistening, glittering_, as it usually implies a steady radiation or emission of light, whereas the latter words usually imply irregular or interrupted radiation. This distinction is not always not always observed, and we may say, the fixed stars _shine_, as well as they _sparkle_. But we never say the sun or the moon _sparkles_.
