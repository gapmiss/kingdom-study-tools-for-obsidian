# Sawyer

**SAW'YER**, _noun_

**1.** One whose occupation is to saw timber into planks or boards, or to saw wood for fuel.

**2.** In America, a tree which, being undermined by a current of water, and falling into the stream, lies with its branches above water, which are continually raised and depressed by the force of the current, from which circumstance the name is derived. The sawyers in the Mississippi render the navigation dangerous, and frequently sink boats which run against them.
