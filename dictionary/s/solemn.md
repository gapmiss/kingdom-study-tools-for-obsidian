# Solemn

**SOLEMN**, _adjective_ sol'em. \[Latin solennis, form soleo, to be accustomed, to use, that is, to hold on or continue, as we have wont.\]

**1.** Anniversary; observed once a year with religious ceremonies. The worship of this image was advanced and a _solemn_ supplication observed every year. \[I doubt the correctness of this definition of Johnson; or whether _solemn_ in out language, ever includes the sense of anniversary. In the passage cited, the sense of anniversary is expressed by every year, and if it is included in _solemn_ also the sentence is tautological. I should say the, that _solemn_ in this passage of Stillingfleet, has the sense given in the second definition below.\]
