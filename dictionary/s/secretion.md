# Secretion

**SECRE'TION**, _noun_.

**1.** The act of secerning; the act of the producing from the blood substances different from the blood itself, or from any of its constituents, as bile, saliva, mucus, urine, etc. This was considered 0by the older physiologists as merely separation from the blood of certain substances previously contained in it; the literal meaning of _secretion_. But this opinion is generally exploded. The organs of _secretion_ are of very various form and structure, but the most general are called _glands_.

**2.** The matter secreted, as mucus, perspirable matter, etc.
