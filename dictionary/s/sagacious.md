# Sagacious

**SAGA'CIOUS**, _adjective_ \[Latin sagax, from sagus, wise, foreseeing; saga, a wise woman; sagio, to perceive readily. The latter signifies wise, prudent, sage, and an essay, which unites this word with seek, and Latin sequor.\]

**1.** Quick of scent; as a _sagacious_ hound; strictly perhaps, following by the scent, which sense is connected with Latin sequor; with of; as _sagacious_ of his quarry.

**2.** Quick of thought; acute in discernment or penetration; as a _sagacious_ head; a _sagacious_ mind.

I would give more for the criticisms of one _sagacious_ enemy, than for those of a score of admirers.
