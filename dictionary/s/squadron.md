# Squadron

**SQUADRON**, _noun_ \[Latin , to square; four.\]

**1.** In its primary sense, a square or square form; and hence, a square body of troops; a body drawn up in a square. So Milton has used the word.

Those half rounding guards just met, and closing stood in _squadron_ joind.

\[This sense is probably obsolete, unless in poetry.\]

**2.** A body of troops, infantry or cavalry, indefinite in number.

**3.** A division of a fleet; a detachment of ships of war, employed on a particular expedition; or one third part of a naval armament.
