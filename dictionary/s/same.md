# Same

**SAME**, _adjective_ \[Latin simul, together. Gr. Shall we suppose then that s has passed into an aspirate in this word, as in salt, Gr. or has the Greek word lost s? The word _same_ may be the Latin idem or dem, dialectically varied. The primary sense is to set, to place, to put together.\]
