# Sin

**SIN**, _noun_

**1.** The voluntary departure of a moral agent from a known rule of rectitude or duty, prescribed by God; any voluntary transgression of the divine law, or violation of a divine command; a wicked act; iniquity. _sin_ is either a positive act in which a known divine law is violated, or it is the voluntary neglect to obey a positive divine command, or a rule of duty clearly implied in such command. _sin_ comprehends not action only, but neglect of known duty, all evil thoughts purposes, words and desires, whatever is contrary to God's commands or law. [[1 John 3#4|1 John 3:4]]. [[Matthew 12#31|Matthew 12:31]]. [[James 4#17|James 4:17]]. Sinner neither enjoy the pleasures of nor the peace of piety.

Among divines, _sin_ is original or actual. Actual _sin_ above defined, is the act of a moral agent in violating a known rule of duty. Original _sin_ as generally understood, is native depravity of heart to the divine will, that corruption of nature of deterioration of the moral character of man, which is supposed to be the effect of Adam's apostasy; and which manifests itself in moral agents by positive act of disobedience to the divine will, or by the voluntary neglect to comply with the express commands of God, which require that we should love God with all the heart and soul and strength and mind, and our neighbor as ourselves. This native depravity or alienation of affections from God and his law, is supposed to be what the apostle calls the carnal mind or mindedness, which is enmity against God, and is therefore denominated _sin_ or sinfulness.

Unpardonable _sin_ or blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, is supposed to be a malicious and obstinate rejection of Christ and the gospel plan of salvation, or a contemptuous resistance made to the influences and convictions of the Holy Spirit. [[Matthew 12#31|Matthew 12:31]].

**2.** A sin-offering; an offering made to atone for _sin_ He hath made him to be _sin_ for us, who knew no _sin_ [[2 Corinthians 5#21|2 Corinthians 5:21]].

**3.** A man enormously wicked. \[Not in use.\]

**4.** _sin_ differs from crime, not in nature, but in application. That which is a crime against society, is _sin_ against God.

**SIN**, _verb intransitive_

**1.** To depart voluntarily from the path of duty prescribed by God to man; to violate the divine law in any particular, by actual transgression or by the neglect or non-observance of its injunctions; to violate any known rule of duty.

All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. [[Romans 3#9|Romans 3:9]]. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned. [[Psalms 51#2|Psalms 51:2]].
