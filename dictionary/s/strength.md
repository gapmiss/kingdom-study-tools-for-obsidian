# Strength

**STRENGTH**, _noun_ \[See [[Strong]].\]

**1.** That property or quality of an animal body by which it is enabled to move itself or other bodies. We say, a sick man has not _strength_ to walk, or to raise his head or his arm. We say, a man has _strength_ to lift a weight, or to draw it. This quality is called also power and force. But force is also used to denote the effect of _strength_ exerted, or the quantity of motion. _strength_ in this sense, is positive, or the power of producing positive motion or action, and is opposed to weakness.

**2.** Firmness; solidity or toughness; the quality of bodies by which they sustain the application of force without breaking or yielding. Thus we speak of the _strength_ of a bone, the _strength_ of a beam, the _strength_ of a wall, the _strength_ of a rope. In this sense, _strength_ is a passive quality, and is opposed to weakness or frangibility.

**3.** Power or vigor of any kind.

This act shall crush the _strength_ of Satan.

**8.** Force of writing; vigor; nervous diction. The _strength_ of words, of style, of expression and the like, consists in the full and forcible exhibition of ideas, by which a sensible or deep impression is made on the mind of a hearer or reader.
