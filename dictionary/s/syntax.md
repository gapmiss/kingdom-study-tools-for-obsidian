# Syntax

**SYN'TAX**, _noun_ \[Latin syntaxis; Gr. together, and to put.\]

**1.** In grammar, the construction of sentences; the due arrangement of words in sentences, according to established usage. _syntax_ includes concord and regimen, or the agreement and government of words. Words, in every language, have certain connections and relations, as verbs and adjectives with nouns, which relations must be observed in the formation of sentences. A gross violation of the rules of _syntax_ is a solecism.

**2.** Connected system or order; union of things. \[Not in use.\]
