# Sluice

**SLUICE**, SLUSE, _noun_ \[Latin claudo, clausi, clausus; Low Latin exclusa. The most correct orthography is sluse.\]

**1.** The stream of water issuing through a flood-gate; or the gate itself. If the word had its origin in shutting; it denoted the frame of boards or planks which closes the opening of a mill dam; but I believe it is applied to the stream, the gate and channel. It is a common saying, that a rapid stream runs like a sluse.

**2.** An opening; a source of supply; that through which any thing flows. Each _sluice_ of affluent fortune open'd soon.

**SLUICE, SLUSE**, _verb transitive_ To emit by flood-gates. \[Little used\]
