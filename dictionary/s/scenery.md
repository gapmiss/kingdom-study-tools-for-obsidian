# Scenery

**SCE'NERY**, _noun_ The appearance of a place, or of the various objects presented to view; or the various objects themselves as seen together. Thus we may say, the _scenery_ of the landscape presented to the view from mount Holyoke, in Hampshire county, Massachusetts, is highly picturesque, and exceeded only by the _scenery_ of Boston and its vicinity, as seen from the State house.

Never need an American look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of natural _scenery_

**3.** The disposition and consecution of the scenes of a play.

**4.** The paintings representing the _scenery_ of a play.
