# Sake

**SAKE**, _noun_ \[Heb. to press or oppress. The primary sense is to strain, urge, press or drive forward, and this is from the same root as seek, essay and Latin sequor, whence we have pursue and prosecute. We have analogous words in cause, thing, and the Latin res.\]

**1.** Final cause; end; purpose; or rather the purpose of obtaining. I open a window for the _sake_ of air, that is, to obtain it, for the purpose of obtaining air. I read for the _sake_ of instruction, that is, to obtain it. _sake_ then signifies primarily effort to obtain, and secondarily purpose of obtaining. The hero fights for the _sake_ of glory; men labor for the _sake_ of subsistence or wealth.

**2.** Account; regard to any person or thing.

I will not again curse the ground any more for man's _sake_ [[Genesis 8#21|Genesis 8:21]].

Save me for thy mercies' _sake_ [[Psalms 6#4|Psalms 6:4]].
