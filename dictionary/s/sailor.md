# Sailor

**SA'ILOR**, _noun_ \[a more common spelling than sailer.\]

A mariner; a seaman; one who follows the business of navigating ships or other vessels, or one who understands the management of ships in navigation. The word however does not by itself express any particular skill in navigation. It denotes any person who follows the seas, and is chiefly or wholly applied to the common hands. \[See [[Seaman]].\]
