**SAL'LY**, _noun_ \[See the Verb.\] In a general sense, a spring; a darting or shooting. Hence,

**1.** An issue or rushing of troops from a besieged place to attack the besiegers.

**2.** A spring or darting of intellect, fancy or imagination; flight; sprightly exertion. We say, sallies of wit, sallies of imagination.
