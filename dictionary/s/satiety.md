# Satiety

**SATI'ETY**, _noun_ \[Latin satietas. See [[Sate]].\]

Properly, fullness of gratification, either of the appetite or any sensual desire; but it usually implies fullness beyond desire; an excess of gratification which excites wearisomeness or lothing; state of being glutted.

In all pleasures there is _satiety_

\- But thy words, with grace divine imbu'd, bring to their sweetness no _satiety_
