# Stilbite

**STILBITE**, _noun_ \[Gr., to shine.\] A mineral of a shining pearly luster, of a white color, or white shaded with gray, yellow or red. It has been associated with zeolite, and called foliated zeolite, and radiated zeolite. Werner and the French mineralogists divide zeolite into two kinds, mesotype and stilbite; the latter is distinguished by its lamellar structure.
