# Sympathize

**SYM'PATHIZE**, _verb intransitive_

**1.** To have a common feeling, as of bodily pleasure or pain.

The mind will _sympathize_ so much with the anguish and debility of the body, that it will be too distracted to fix itself in meditation.

**2.** To feel in consequence of what another feels; to be affected by feelings similar to those of another, in consequence of knowing the person to be thus affected. We _sympathize_ with our friends in distress; we fell some pain when we see them pained, or when we are informed of their distresses, even at a distance.

\[It is generally and properly used of suffering or pain, and not of pleasure or joy. It may be sometimes used with greater latitude.

**3.** To agree; to fit. \[Not in use.\]
