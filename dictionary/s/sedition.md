# Sedition

**SEDI''TION**, _noun_. \[Latin _seditio_. The sense of this word is the contrary of that which is naturally deducible from _sedo_, or _sedeo_, denoting a rising or raging, rather than an appeasing. But to _set_ is really to throw down, to drive, and _sedition_ may be a setting or rushing together.\] A factious commotion of the people, a tumultuous assembly of men rising in opposition to law or the administration of justice, and in disturbance of the public peace. _sedition_ is a rising or commotion of less extent than an _insurrection_, and both are less than _rebellion_; but some kinds of _sedition_ in Great Britain, amount to high treason. In general, _sedition_ is a local or limited insurrection in opposition to _civil_ authority, as mutiny is to _military_.
