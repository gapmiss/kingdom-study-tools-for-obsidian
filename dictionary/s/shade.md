# Shade

**SHADE**, _noun_ \[Latin _scutum_, a shield.\]

**1.** Literally, the interception, cutting of or interruption of the rays of light; hence, the obscurity which is caused by such interception. _Shad_ differs from _shadow_, as it implies no particular form or definite limit. whereas a _shadow_ represents in form the object which intercepts the light. Hence when we say, let us resort to the _shade_ of a tree, we have no reference to its form; but when we speak of measuring a pyramid or other object by its _shadow_, we have reference to its extent.

**2.** Darkness; obscurity; as the _shades_ of night.

**3.** An obscure place, properly in a grove or close wood, which precludes the sun's rays; an hence, a secluded retreat.

Let us seek out some desolate _shade_, and there

Weep our sad bosoms empty. _Shak_.

**4.** A screen; something that intercepts light or heat.

**5.** Protection; shelter. \[See _Shadow_.\]

**6.** In _painting_, the dark part of the picture.

**7.** Degree or gradation of light.

White, red, yellow, blue, with their several degrees, or _shades_ and mixtures, as green, come only in by the eyes. _Locke_.

**8.** A shadow. \[See _Shadow_.\]

Envy will merit, as its _shade_, pursue. _Pope_. \[This is allowable in poetry.\]

**9.** The soul, after its separation from the body; so called because the ancients supposed it to be perceptible to the sight, not to the touch; a spirit; aghost; as the _shades_ of departed heroes.

Swift as thought, the flitting _shade_\- _Dryden_.
