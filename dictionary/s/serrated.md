# Serrated

**SER'RATED**, edge, like a saw. In _botany_, having sharp notches about the edge, pointing towards the extremity; as a _serrate_ leaf.

When a serrate leaf has small serrature upon the large ones, it is said to by _doubly serrate_, as in the elm. We say also, a _serrate_ calyx, corol or stipule.

A _serrate-ciliate_ leaf, is one having fine hairs, like the eye lashes, on the serreatures.

A _serrature-toothed_ leaf, has the serratures toothed.

A _serrulate_ leaf, is one finely serrate, with very small notches or teeth.
