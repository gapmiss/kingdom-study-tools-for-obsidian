# Scripture

**SCRIP'TURE**, _noun_ \[Latin scriptura, from scribo, to write.\]

**1.** In its primary sense, a writing; any thing written.

**2.** Appropriately, and by way of distinction, the books of the Old and New Testament; the Bible. The word is used either in the singular or plural number, to denote the sacred writings or divine oracles, called sacred or holy, as proceeding from God and containing sacred doctrines and precepts.

There is not any action that a man ought to do or forbear, but the _scripture_ will give him a clear precept or prohibition for it.

Compared with the knowledge which the Scriptures contain, every other subject of human inquiry is vanity and emptiness.
