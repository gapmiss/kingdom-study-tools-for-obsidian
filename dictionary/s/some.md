# Some

**SOME**, _adjective_ sum.

**1.** Noting a certain quantity of a thing, but indeterminate; a portion greater or less. Give me _some_ bread; drink _some_ wine; bring _some_ water.

**2.** Noting a number of persons or things, greater or less, but indeterminate. _some_ theoretical writes allege that there was a time when there was no such thing as society.

**3.** Noting a person or thing, but not known, or not specific and definite. _some_ person, I know not who, gave me the information. Enter the city, and _some_ man will direct you to the house. Most gentlemen of property, as _some_ period or other of their lives, are ambitious of representing their country in parliament.

**4.** It sometimes precedes a word of number or quantity, with the sense of about or near, noting want of certainty as to the specific number of amount, but something near it; as a village or _some_ eighty houses; _some_ two or three persons; _some_ seventy miles distant; an object at _some_ good distance.

**5.** _some_ is often opposed to others. _some_ men believe one thing, and others another.

**6.** _some_ is often used without a noun, and then like other adjectives, is a substitute for a noun. We consumed _some_ of our provisions, and the rest was given to the poor. _some_ to the shores do fly, _some_ to the woods. Your edicts _some_ reclaim for sins, but most your life and blest example wins.

**7.** _some_ is used as a termination of certain adjectives, as in handsome, mettlesome, blithesome, fullsome, lonesome, gladsome, gamesome. In these words, _some_ has primarily the sense of little, or a certain degree; a little blithe or glad. But in usage, it rather indicates a considerable degree of the thing or quantity; as mettlesome, full of mettle or spirit; gladsome, very glad or joyous.
