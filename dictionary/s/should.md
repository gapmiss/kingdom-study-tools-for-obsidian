# Should

**SHOULD**. _shood_. The preterit of _shall_, but now used as an auxiliary verb, either in the past time or conditional present. 'He _should_ have paid the debt at the time the note became due.' _Should_ here denotes past time. 'I _should_ ride to town this day if the weather would permit.' Here _should_ expresses present or future time conditionally. In the second and third persons, it denotes obligation or duty, as in the first example above.

**1.** _I _should_ go_. When _should_ in this person is uttered without emphasis, it declares simply that an event would take place, on some condition or under circumstances.

But when expressed with emphasis, _should_ in this person denotes obligation, duty or determination.

**2.** _Thou shouldst_ _go_.

_You should_ Without emphasis, _should_, in the second person, is nearly equivalent to _ought_; you ought to go, it is your duty, you are bound to go. \[See _Shall_.\]

With emphasis, _should_ expresses determination in th espeaker conditionally to compel the person to act. 'If I had the care of you, you _should_ go, whether willing or not.'

**3.** _He _should_ go_. _should_, in the third person, has the same force as in the second.

**4.** If _I should_, if _you should_, if _he should_, etc. denote a figure contingent event.

**5.** After _should_, the principal verb is sometimes omitted, without obscuring the sense.

So subjects love just kings, or so they _should_. _Ktyden_.

That is, so they _should love_ them.

**6.** _should be_, ought to be; a proverbial phrase, conveying some censure, contempt or irony. Things are not as they _should be_.

The biys think their mother no better than they _should be_. _Addison_.

**7.** ' We think it strange that stones _should_ fall from the aerial regions.' In this use, _should_ implies that stones do fall. In all similar phrases, _should_ implies the actual existence of the fact, without a condition of supposition.
