# Sea

**SEA**, _noun_ see. \[This word, like _lake,_ signifies primarily a seat, set or lay, a repository, a bason.\]

**1.** A large bason, cisternor laver which Solomon made in the temple, so large as to contain more than six thousand gallons. This was called the _brazen sea_, and used to hold water for the priests to wash themselves. [[1 Kings 7#23|1 Kings 7:23]]. [[2 Chronicles 4#2|2 Chronicles 4:2]]

**2.** A large body of water, nearly inclosed by land, as the Baltic or the Mediterranean; as the _sea_ of Azof. _Seas_ are properly branches of the ocean, and upon the same level. Large bodies of water inland, and situated above the level of the ocean, are lakes. The appellation of _sea_, given to the Caspian lake, is an exception, and not very correct. So the lake of Galilee is called a _sea_, from the Greek.

**3.** The ocean; as, to go to _sea_. The fleet is at _sea_, or on the high _seas_.

**4.** A wave; a billow; a surge. The vessel shipped a _sea_.

**5.** The swell of the ocean in a tempest, or the direction of the waves; as, we head the _sea_.

**6.** Proverbially, a large quantity of liquor; as a _sea_ of blood.

**7.** A rough or agitated place or element.

In a troubled _sea_ of passion tost. _Milton_.
