# Shore

**SHORE**, the _old_. _pret_. of _shear_. _Obs_.

**SHORE**, _noun_ The coast or land adjacent to the sea, or to a large lake or river. This word is applied primarily to land contiguous to water; but it extends to the ground near the border of the sea or of a lake, which is covered with water. We also use the word to express the land near the border of the sea or of a great lake, to an indefinite extent; as when we say, a town stands on the _shore_. We do not apply the word to land contiguous to a small stream. This we call a bank.

**SHORE**, _noun_ \[The popular but corrupt pronunciation of _sewer_; a pronunciation that should be carefully avoided.\]

**SHORE**, _noun_ A prop; a butress; something that supports a building or other thing.

**SHORE**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To prop; to support by a post or butress; usually with_sup_; as, to _shore up_ a building.

**2.** To set on _shore_ \[_Not in use_.\]
