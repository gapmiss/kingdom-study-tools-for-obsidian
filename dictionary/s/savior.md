# Savior

**SAVIOR**, _noun_ savyur. One that saves or preserves; but properly applied only to Jesus Christ, the Redeemer, who has opened the way to everlasting salvation by his obedience and death, and who is therefore called the _savior_ by way of distinction, the _savior_ of men, the _savior_ of the world. General Washington may be called the saver, but not the _savior_ of his country.
