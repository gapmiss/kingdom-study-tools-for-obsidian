In England, the poor are supported by the parish where they have a _settlement_. In New England they are supported by the town. In England, the statutes 12 Richard II. and 19 Henry VII. seem to be the first rudiments of parish _settlements_. By statute 13 and 14 Ch. II. a legal _settlement_ is declared to be gained by birth, by inhabitancy, by apprenticeship, or by service for forty days. But the gaining of a _settlement_ by so short a residence produced great evils, which were remedied by statute 1 James II.

**14.** _Act of settlement_, in British history, the statute of 12 and 13 William III. by which the crowd was limited to his present majesty's house, or the house of Orange.
