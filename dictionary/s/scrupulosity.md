# Scrupulosity

**SCRUPULOS'ITY**, _noun_ \[Latin scrupulositas.\]

**1.** The quality or state of being scrupulous; doubt; doubtfulness respecting some difficult point, or proceeding from the difficulty or delicacy of determining how to act; hence, the caution or tenderness arising from the fear of doing wrong or offending.

The first sacrilege is looked upon with some horror; but when they have once made the breach, their _scrupulosity_ soon retires.

**2.** Nicety of doubt; or nice regard to exactness and propriety.

So careful, even to _scrupulosity_ were they to keep their sabbath.

**3.** Niceness; preciseness.
