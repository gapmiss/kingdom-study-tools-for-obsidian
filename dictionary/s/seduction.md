# Seduction

**SEDU'CTION**, _noun_. \[Latin _seductio_.\]

**1.** The act of seducing or of enticing from the path of duty.

**2.** _Appropriately_, the act or crime of persuading a female, by flattery or deception, to surrender her chastity. A woman who is above flattery, is least liable to _seduction_; but the best safeguard is principle, the love and purity of holiness, the fear of God and reverence forHis commandments.
