**SYM'METRY**, _noun_ \[Gr. with, together, and to measure.\] A due proportion of the several parts of a body to each other; adaptation of the dimensions of the several parts of a thing to each other; or the union and conformity of the members of a work to the whole. _symmetry_ arises from the proportion which the Greeks call analogy, which is the relation of conformity of all the parts to a certain measure; as the _symmetry_ of a building or an animal body.
