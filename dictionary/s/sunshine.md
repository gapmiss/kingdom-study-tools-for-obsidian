# Sunshine

**SUN'SHINE**, _noun_ \[sun and shine.\] The light of the sun, or the place where it shines; the direct rays of the sun, or the place where they fall.

But all _sunshine_ as when his beams at noon

Culminate from th' equator.

**1.** A place warmed and illuminated; warmth; illumination.

The man that sits within a monarch's heart,

And ripens in the _sunshine_ of his favor.
