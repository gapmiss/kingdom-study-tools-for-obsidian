# Sedulity

**SEDU'LITY**, _noun_. \[Latin _sedulitas_. See _Sedulous_.\] Diligent and assiduous application to business; constant attention; unremitting industry in any pursuit. It denotes _constancy_ and _perseverance_ rather than _intenseness_ of application.

Let there be but the same propensity and bent of will to religion, and there will be the same _sedulity_ and indefatigable industry in men's inquiries into it. _South_.
