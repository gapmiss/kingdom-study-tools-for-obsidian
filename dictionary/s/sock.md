# Sock

**SOCK**, _noun_ \[Latin soccus; \]

**1.** The shoe of the ancient actors of comedy. Hence the word is used for comedy, and opposed to buskin or tragedy. Great Fletcher never teads in buskin here, nor greater Jonson dares in socks appear.

**2.** A garment for the foot, like the foot of a stocking.

**3.** A plowshare.
