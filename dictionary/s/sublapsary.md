SUBLAPSARIAN, SUBLAPSARY _adjective_ \[Latin , fall.\] Done after the apostasy of Adam. \[See the Noun.\]

**SUBLAPSARIAN**, _noun_ One who maintains the sublapsarian doctrine, that the sin of Adams apostasy being imputed to all his posterity, God in compassion decreed to send his Son to rescue a great number from their lost state, and to accept of his obedience and death on their account. The decree of reprobation, according to the sublapsarians, is nothing but a preterition or non-election of persons, whom God left as he found, involved int he guilt of Adams transgression without any personal sin, when he withdrew some others as guilty as they.

Sublapsarian is opposed to supralapsarian.
