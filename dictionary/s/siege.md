# Siege

**SIEGE**, _noun_ \[Latin sigillum.\]

**1.** The setting of an army around or before a fortified place for the purpose of compelling the garrison to surrender; or the surrounding or investing of a place by an army, and approaching it by passages and advanced works, which cover the besiegers from the enemy's fire. A _siege_ differs from a blockade, as in a _siege_ the investing army approaches the fortified place to attach and reduce it by force; but in a blockade, the army secures all the avenues to the place to intercept all supplies, and waits till famine compels the garrison to surrender.

**2.** Any continued endeavor to gain possession. Love stood the _siege_ and would not yield his breast.

**3.** Seat; throne.

**4.** Rank; place; class.

**5.** Stool. \[Not in use.\]

**SIEGE**, _verb transitive_ To besiege. \[Not in use.\]
