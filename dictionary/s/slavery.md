**SLA'VERY**, _noun_ \[See [[Slave]].\]

**1.** Bondage; the state of entire subjection of one person to the will of another. _slavery_ is the obligation to labor for the benefit of the master, without the contract of consent of the servant. _slavery_ may proceed from crimes, from captivity or from debt. _slavery_ is also voluntary or involuntary; voluntary, when a person sells or yields his own person to the absolute command of another; involuntary, when he is placed under the absolute power of another without his own consent. _slavery_ no longer exists in Great Britain, not in the northern states of America.

**2.** The offices of a slave; drudgery.
