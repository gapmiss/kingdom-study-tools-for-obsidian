# Stigmatize

**STIGMATIZE**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To mark with a brand; in a literal sense; as, the ancients stigmatized their slaves and soldiers.

**2.** To set a mark of disgrace on; to disgrace with some not of reproach or infamy.

To find virtue extolled and vice stigmatized--

Sour enthusiasts affect to _stigmatize_ the finest and most elegant authors, ancient and modern, as dangerous to religion.
