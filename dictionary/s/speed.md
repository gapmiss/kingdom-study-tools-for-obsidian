We say, a man or a horse runs or travels with speed; a fowl flies with _speed_ We speak of the _speed_ of a fish in the water, but we do not speak of the _speed_ of a river, or of wind, or of a falling body. I think however I have seen the word applied to the lapse of time and the motion of lightning, but in poetry only.

[[Genesis 24#12|Genesis 24:12]].
