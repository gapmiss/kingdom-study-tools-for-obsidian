# Syllogism

**SYL'LOGISM**, _noun_ \[Latin syllogismus; Gr. with, and to speak; to think.\]

A form or reasoning or argument, consisting of three propositions, of which the two first are called the premises, and the last the conclusion. In this argument, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises; so that if the two first propositions are true, the conclusion must be true, and the argument amounts to demonstration. Thus,

A plant has not the power of locomotion;

An oak is a plant;

Therefore an oak has not the power of locomotion.

These propositions are denominated the major, the minor, and the conclusion.
