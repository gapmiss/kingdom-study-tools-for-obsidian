# Sympathy

**SYM'PATHY**, _noun_ \[Gr. with, and passion.\]

**1.** Fellow feeling; the quality of being affected by the affection of another, with feelings by the affection of another, with feelings correspondent in kind, if not in degree. We feel _sympathy_ for another when we see him in distress, or when we are informed of his distresses. This _sympathy_ is a correspondent feeling of pain or regret.

Sympathy is produced through the medium of organic impression.

I value myself upon sympathy; I hate and despise myself for envy.

**2.** An agreement of affections or inclinations, or a conformity of natural temperament, which makes two persons pleased with each other.

To such associations may be attributed most of the sympathies and antipathies of our nature.

**3.** In medicine, a correspondence of various parts of the body in similar sensations or affections; or an affection of the whole body or some part of it, in consequence of an injury or disease of another part, or of a local affection. Thus a contusion on the head will produce nausea and vomiting. This is said to be by _sympathy_ or consent of parts.

**4.** In natural history, a propension of inanimate things to unite, or to act on each other. Thus we say, there is a _sympathy_ between the lodestone and iron.
