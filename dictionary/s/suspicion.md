# Suspicion

**SUSPI'CION**, _noun_ \[Latin suspicio. See [[Suspect]].\] The act of suspecting; the imagination of the existence of something without proof, or upon very slight evidence, or upon no evidence at all. _suspicion_ often proceeds from the apprehension of evil; it is the offspring or companion of jealousy.

Suspicions among thoughts, are like bats among birds; they ever fly by twilight.
