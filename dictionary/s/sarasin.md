**SAR'ASIN**,

S'ARCASM, _noun_ \[Latin sarcasmus; Gr. from to deride or sneer at, primarily to fly or pluck off the skin.\]

A keen reproachful expression; a satirical remark or expression, uttered with some degree of scorn or contempt; a taunt; a gibe. Of this we have an example in the remark of the Jews respecting Christ, on the cross, 'He saved others, himself he cannot save.'
