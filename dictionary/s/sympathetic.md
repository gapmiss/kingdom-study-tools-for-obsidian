# Sympathetic

**SYMPATHET'IC**

**SYMPATHET'IC**AL, _adjective_ See [[Sympathy]].\]

**1.** Pertaining to sympathy.

**2.** Having common feeling with another; susceptible of being affected by feelings like those of another, or of feelings inconsequence of what another feels; as a _sympathetic_ heart.

**3.** Among physicians, produced by sympathy. A _sympathetic_ disease is one which is produced by sympathy, or by a remote cause, as when a fever follows a local injury. In this case, the word is opposed to idiopathetic, which denotes a disease produced by a proximate cause, or an original disease. Thus an epilepsy is _sympathetic_ when it is produced by some other disease.

**4.** Among chimists and alchimists, an epithet applied to a kind of powder, possessed of the wonderful property that if spread on a cloth dipped in the blood of a wound, the wound will be healed, though the patient is at a distance. This opinion is discarded as charlatanry.

This epithet is given also to a species of ink or liquor, with which a person may write letters which are not visible till something else is applied.

**5.** In anatomy, _sympathetic_ is applied to two nerves, from the opinion that their communications are the cause of sympathies. One of these is the great intercostal nerve; the other is the facial nerve.
