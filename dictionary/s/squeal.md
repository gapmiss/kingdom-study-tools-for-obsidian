# Squeal

**SQUEAL**, _verb intransitive_ \[See [[Squall]].\] To cry with a sharp shrill voice. It is used of animals only, and chiefly of swine. It agrees in sense with squeak, except that _squeal_ denotes a more continues cry than squeak, and the latter is not limited to animals. We say, a squealing hog or pig, a squealing child; but more generally a squalling child.
