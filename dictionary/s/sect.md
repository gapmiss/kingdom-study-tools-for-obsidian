# Sect

**SECT**, _noun_. \[Latin Sp. _secta_; from Latin _seco_, to cut off, to separate.\]

**1.** A body or number of persons united in tenets, chiefly in philosophy or religion, but constituting a distinct party by holding sentiments different from those of other men. Most _sects_ have originated in a particular person, who taught and propagated some peculiar notions in philosophy or religion, and who is considered to have been its founder. Among the jews, the principal _sects_ were the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. In Greece were the Cynic _sect_, founded by Antisthenes; and the Academic _sect_, by Plato. The Academic _sect_ gave birth to the Peripatetic, and a Cynic to the Stoic.

**2.** A cutting or coin. \[_Not used_.\]
