# Self

**SELF**, _adjective_. or _pron_. _plural_ _selves_; used chiefly in composition.

**1.** In old authors, this sometimes signifies particular, very, or same. 'And on tham _sylfan_ geare; ' in that same year, that very year. _Sax_. _Chron_. _adjective_ D. 1052, 1061.

Shoot another arrow that _self_ way. _Shak_.

On these _self_ hills. _Raleigh_.

At that _self_ moment enters Palamon. _Dryden_.

In this sense, _self_ is an adjective, and is now obsolete, except when followed by _same_; as on the _self-same_ day; the _self-same_ hour; the _self-same_ thing; which is tautology.

**2.** In present usage, _self_is united to certain personal pronouns and pronominal adjectives, to express emphasis or distinction; also when the pronoun is used reciprocally. thus, for emphasis, I _myself_ will write; I will examine for _myself_; Thou _thyself_ shalt go; thou shalt See [[for]] _thyself_; You _yourself_ shall write; you shall See [[for]] _yourself_. He _himself_ shall write; he shall examine for _himself_. She _herself_ shall write; she shall examine for _herself_. The child _itself_ shall be carried; it shall be present _itself_.

Reciprocally, I abhor _myself_; thou enrichest _thyself_; he loves _himself_; she admires _herself_; it pleases _itself_; we value _ourselves_; ye hurry _yourselves_; they see _themselves_. I did not hurt him, he hurt _himself_; he did not hurt me, I hurt _myself_.

Except when added to pronouns used reciprocally, _self_ serves to give emphasis to the pronoun, or to render the distinction expressed by it more emphatical. 'I _myself_ will decide, ' not only expresses my determination to decide, but the determination that no other shall decide.

_Himself_, _herself_, _themselves_, are used in the nomnative case, as well as in the objective.

Jesus _himself_ baptized not, but his disciples. See [[Matthew 23#4|Matthew 23:4]].

**3.** _Self_ is sometimes as a noun, noting the individual subject to his own contemplation or action, or noting identity of person. Consciousness makes everyone to be what he call _self_.

A man's _self_ may be the worst fellow to converse with in the world. _Pope_.

**4.** It also signifies personal interest, or love of private interest; selfishness.
