# Spray

**SPRAY**, _noun_ \[probably allied to sprig. The radical sense is a shoot.\]

**1.** A small shoot or branch; or the extremity of a branch. Hence in England, _spray_ faggots are bundles of small branches, used as fuel.

**2.** Among seamen, the water that is driven from the top of a wave in a storm, which spreads and flies in small particles. It differs from spoon-drift; as _spray_ is only occasional, whereas spoon-drift flies continually along the surface of the sea.
