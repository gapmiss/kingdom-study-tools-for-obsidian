# Sop

**SOP**, _noun_

**1.** Anything steeped or dipped and softened in liquor, but chiefly something thus dipped in broth or liquid food, and intended to be eaten. Sops in wine, quantity for quantity, inebriate more than wine itself.

**2.** Anything given to pacify; so called from the _sop_ given to Cerberus, in mythology. Hence the phrase, to give a _sop_ to Cerberus.
