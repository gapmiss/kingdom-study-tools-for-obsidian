# Summer

**SUM'MER**, _noun_ One who casts up an account.

**SUM'MER**, _noun_ With us, the season of the year comprehended in the months June, July and August; during which time, the sun being north of the equator, shines more directly upon this part of the earth, which, together with the increased length of the days, renders this the hottest period of the year. In latitudes south of the equator, just the opposite takes place, or it is _summer_ there when it is winter here.

The entire year is also sometimes divided into _summer_ and winter, the former signifying the warmer and the latter the colder part of the year.

**SUM'MER**, _verb intransitive_ To pass the _summer_ or warm season.

The fowls shall _summer_ upon them. [[Isaiah 18#6|Isaiah 18:6]].

**SUM'MER**, _verb transitive_ To keep warm. \[Little used.\]
