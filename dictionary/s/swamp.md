# Swamp

**SWAMP**, _noun_ Spungy land; low ground filled with water; soft wet ground. In New England, I believe this word is never applied to marsh, or the boggy land made by the overflowing of salt water, but always to low soft ground in the interior country; wet and spungy land, but not usually covered with water. This is the true meaning of the word. Swamps are often mowed. In England, the word is explained in books by boggy land, morassy or marshy ground.

**SWAMP**, _verb transitive_ To plunge, whelm or sink in a swamp; to plunge into difficulties inextricable.
