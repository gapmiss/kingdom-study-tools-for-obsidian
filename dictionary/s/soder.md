# Soder

**SOD'ER**, _verb transitive_ \[It has been taken for granted that this is a contracted word, from Latin solido, and hence written solder. The fact may be doubted; but if true, the settled pronunciation seems to render it expedient to let the contracted orthography remain undisturbed.\] To unite and make solid, as metallic substances; to join separate things or parts of the same thing by a metallic substance in a state of fustion, which hardens in cooling, and renders the joint solid.

**SOD'ER**, _noun_ Metallic cement; a metal or metallic composition used in uniting other metallic substances.
