# Sublimation

**SUBLIMATION**, _noun_

**1.** The operation of bringing a solid substance into the state of vapor by heat, and condensing it again into a solid by cold. _sublimation_ bears the same relation to a solid, that distillation does to a liquid. Both processes purify the substances to which they are severally applied, by separating them from the fixed and grosser matters with which they are connected.

**2.** Exaltation; elevation; act of highthening or improving.

Religion, the perfection, refinement and _sublimation_ of morality.
