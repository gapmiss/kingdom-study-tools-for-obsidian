# Solicit

**SOLIC'IT**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin solicito. I know not whether this word is somple or compound; probably the latter.\]

**1.** To ask with some degree of earnestness; to make petition to; to apply to for obtaining something. This word implies earnestness in seeking, but I think less earnestness in seeking, but I tinks less earnestness than beg, implore, entreat. and importune, and more than ask or request; as when we say, a man solicits the minister for an office; he solicits his father for a favor. Did I _solicit_ thee form darkness to promote me?

**2.** TO ask for with some degree of earnestness; to seek by petition; as, to _solicit_ an office; to _solicit_ a favor.

**3.** To awake or excite to action; to summon; to invite. That fruit solicited her longing eye. Sounds and some tangible qualities _solicit_ their proper senses, and force an entrance to the mind.

**4.** To attempt; to try to obtain. I view my crime, but kindle at the view, repeat old pleasures and _solicit_ nes.

**5.** TO disturb; to disquiet; a Latinism rarely used. But anxious fears _solicit_ my weak breast.
