# Value

**VALUE**, _noun_ val'u. \[Latin valor, from valeo, to be worth.\]

**1.** Worth; that property or those properties of a thing which render it useful or estimable; or the degree of that property or of such properties. The real _value_ of a thing is its utility, its power or capacity of procuring or producing good. Hence the real or intrinsic _value_ of iron, is far greater than that of gold. But there is, in many things, an estimated _value_ depending on opinion or fashion, such as the _value_ of precious stones. The _value_ of land depends on its fertility, or on its vicinity to a market, or on both.

**2.** Price; the rate of worth set upon a commodity, or the amount for which a thing is sold. We say, the _value_ of a thing is what it will bring in market.

**3.** Worth; applied to persons.
