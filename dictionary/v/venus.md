# Venus

**VE'NUS**, _noun_ \[Latin ventus, venenum; Eng. venom to poison, to fret or irritate. These affinities lead to the true origin of these words. The primary sense of the root is to shoot or rush, as light or wind. From light is derived the sense of white, fair, _venus_ or it is from opening, parting; and from rushing, moving, comes wind, and the sense of raging, fury, whence Latin venenum, poison, that which frets or causes to rage. These words all coincide with Latin venio, which signifies to rush, to fall, to happen; venor, to hunt, etc. The Greeks had the same idea of the goddess of love, viz. that her name signified fairness, whiteness, and hence the fable that she sprung from froth, whence her Green name.\]
