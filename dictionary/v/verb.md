# Verb

**VERB**, _noun_ \[Latin verbum, fero.\]

**1.** In grammar, a part of speech that expresses action, motion, being, suffering, or a request or command to do or forbear any thing. The _verb_ affirms, declares, asks or commands; as, I write; he runs; the river flows; they sleep; we see; they are deceived; depart; go; come; write; does he improve?

When the action expressed by a _verb_ is exerted on an object, or terminates upon it, the act is considered as passing to that object, and the _verb_ is called transitive; as, I read Livy. When the act expressed by the _verb_ terminates in the agent or subject, the _verb_ is called intransitive; as, I run; I walk, I sleep.

When the agent and object change places, and the agent is considered as the instrument by which the object is affected, the _verb_ is called passive; as, Goliath was slain by David.

**2.** A word.
