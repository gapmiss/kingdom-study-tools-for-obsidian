# Variety

**VARI'ETY**, _noun_ \[Latin varietas, from vario, to vary.\]

**1.** Intermixture of different things, or of things different in form; or a succession of different things.

Variety is nothing else but a continued novelty.

**3.** Difference; dissimilitude.

**4.** Variation; deviation; change from a former state. \[Little used.\]

**6.** In natural history, a difference not permanent or invariable, but occasioned by an accidental change; as a _variety_ of any species of plant.

Naturalists formerly erred very much in supposing an accidental _variety_ of plants, animals or minerals, to be a distinct species. Ray has established a good test for varieties in botany. A plant is distinct, which propagates itself in its own form by its seed; but when the difference disappears in the new plant, it is only a _variety_ _variety_ then is a difference between individuals, not permanent nor important enough to constitute a distinct species; such as in size, color, fullness, curling, etc.

**7.** Different sort; as varieties of soil or land.
