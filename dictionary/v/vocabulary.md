# Vocabulary

**VOCAB'ULARY**, _noun_ \[Latin vocabulum, a word.\]

A list or collection of the words of a language, arranged in alphabetical order and explained; a dictionary or lexicon. We often use _vocabulary_ in a sense somewhat different from that of dictionary, restricting the signification to the list of words; as when we say, the _vocabulary_ of Johnson is more full or extensive than that of Entick. We rarely use the word as synonymous with dictionary, but in the other countries the corresponding word is used and this may be so used in English.
