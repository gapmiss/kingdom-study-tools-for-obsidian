# V

**V** is the twenty second letter of the English Alphabet, and a labial articulation, formed by the junction of the upper teeth with the lower lip, as in pronouncing av, ev, ov, vain. It is not a close articulation, but one that admits of some sound. It is nearly allied to F, being formed by the same organs; but _v_ is vocal, and F is aspirate, and this constitutes the principal difference between them. _v_ and U were formerly the same letter, derived no doubt from the oriental vau or waw, but they have now as distinct uses as any two letters in the alphabet, and are therefore to be considered as different letters. _v_ has one sound only, as in ver, vote, lavish.

As a numeral, _v_ stand for 5. With a dash over it, in old books, it stands for 5000.

**V**.R. among the Romans, stood for uti rogas, as you desire; _v_ C. for vir consularis; _v_ G. for verbi gratia; _v_ Latin for videlicet.

In music for instruments, _v_ stands for violin; _v_ V. for violins.
