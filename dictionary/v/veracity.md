# Veracity

**VERAC'ITY**, _noun_ \[Latin verax, from verus, true.\]

**1.** Habitual observance of truth, or habitual truth; as a man of _veracity_ His _veracity_ is not called in question. The question of the court is, whether you know the witness to be a man of _veracity_ We rely on history, when we have confidence in the _veracity_ and industry of the historian.

'The _veracity_ of facts.' is not correct language. Truth is applicable to men and to facts; _veracity_ to men only, or to sentient beings.

**2.** Invariable expression of truth; as the _veracity_ of our senses.
