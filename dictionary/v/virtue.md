# Virtue

**VIRTUE**, _noun_ vur'tu. \[Latin virtus, from vireo, or its root. See [[Worth]].\] The radical sense is strength, from straining, stretching, extending. This is the primary sense of Latin vir, a man.\]

**1.** Strength; that substance or quality of physical bodies, by which they act and produce effects on other bodies. In this literal and proper sense, we speak of the _virtue_ or virtues of plants in medicine, and the virtues of drugs. In decoctions, the virtues of plants are extracted. By long standing in the open air, the virtues are lost.

**2.** Bravery valor. This was the predominant signification of virtus among the Romans.

\[This sense is nearly or quite obsolete.\]

**3.** Moral goodness; the practice of moral duties and the abstaining from vice, or a conformity of life and conversation to the moral law. In this sense, _virtue_ may be, and in many instances must be, distinguished from religion. The practice of moral duties merely from motives of convenience, or from compulsion, or from regard to reputation, is _virtue_ as distinct from religion. The practice of moral duties from sincere love to God and his laws, is _virtue_ and religion. In this sense it is true,

That _virtue_ only makes our bliss below.
