# Vehicle

**VE'HICLE**, _noun_ \[Latin vehiculum, from veho, to carry.\]

**1.** That in which any thing is or may be carried; any kind of carriage moving on land, either on wheels or runners. This word comprehends coaches, chariots, gigs, sullies, wagons, carts of every kind, sleighs and sleds. These are all vehicles. But the word is more generally applied to wheel carriages, and rarely I believe to water craft.

**2.** That which is used as the instrument of conveyance. Language is the _vehicle_ which conveys ideas to others. Letters are vehicles of communication.

A simple style forms the best _vehicle_ of thought to a popular assembly.
