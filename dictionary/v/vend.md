# Vend

**VEND**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin vendo.\]

To sell; to transfer a thing and the exclusive right of possessing it, to another person for a pecuniary equivalent; as, to _vend_ goods; to _vend_ meat and vegetables in market. Vending differs from barter. We _vend_ for money; we barter for commodities. _vend_ is applicable only to wares, merchandize, or other small articles, not to lands and tenements. We never say, to _vend_ a farm, a lease, or a bond, a right or a horse.
