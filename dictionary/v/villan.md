**1.** In feudal law, a villain or villein is one who holds lands by a base or servile tenure, or in villenage.

**2.** A vile wicked person; a man extremely depraved, and capable or guilty of great crimes. We call by the name of villain, the thief, the robber, the burglarian, the murderer, the incendiary, the ravisher, the seducer, the cheat, the swindler. etc.

Calm thinking villains, whom no faith could fix.
