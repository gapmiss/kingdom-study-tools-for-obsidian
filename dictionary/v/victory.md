# Victory

**VIC'TORY**, _noun_ \[Latin victoria, from vinco, victus, to conquer.\]

**1.** Conquest; the defeat of an enemy in battle, or of an antagonist in contest; a gaining of the superiority in war or combat. _victory_ supposes the power of an enemy or an antagonist to prove inferior to that of the victor. _victory_ however depends not always on superior skill or valor; it is often gained by the fault or mistake of the vanquished.

Victory may be honorable to the arms, but shameful to the counsels of a nation.

**2.** The advantage or superiority gained over spiritual enemies, over passions and appetites, or over temptations, or in any struggle or competition.

Thanks be to God, who giveth us the _victory_ through our Lord Jesus Christ. [[1 Corinthians 15#54|1 Corinthians 15:54]].
