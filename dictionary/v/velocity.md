# Velocity

**VELOC'ITY**, _noun_ \[Latin velositas, from velox, swift, allied to volo, to fly.\]

**1.** Swiftness; celerity; rapidity; as the _velocity_ of wind; the _velocity_ of a planet or comet in its orbit or course; the _velocity_ of a cannon ball; the _velocity_ of light. In these phrases, _velocity_ is more generally used than celerity. We apply celerity to animals; as, a horse or an ostrich runs with celerity, and a stream runs with rapidity or velocity; but bodies moving in the air or in etherial space, move with greater or less _velocity_ not celerity. This usage is arbitrary, and perhaps not universal.

**2.** In philosophy, _velocity_ is that affection of motion by which a body moves over a certain space in a certain time. _velocity_ is in direct proportion to the space over which a body moves. _velocity_ is absolute or relative; absolute, when a body moves over a certain space in a certain time; relative, when it has respect to another moving body. _velocity_ is also uniform or equal; or it is unequal, that is, retarded or accelerated.
