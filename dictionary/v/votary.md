Devoted; promised; consecrated by a vow or promise; consequent on a vow.

**VO'TARY**, _noun_ One devoted, consecrated or engaged by a vow or promise; hence more generally, one devoted, given or addicted to some particular service, worship, study or state of life. Every goddess of antiquity had her votaries. Every pursuit or study has now its votaries. One is a _votary_ to mathematics, another is a _votary_ to music, and alas, a great portion of the world are votaries of sensual pleasures.

It was the coldness of the _votary_ not the prayer, which was in fault.
