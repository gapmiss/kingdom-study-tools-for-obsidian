# Vogue

**VOGUE**, _noun_ vig. \[The sense of _vogue_ is way, or the going of the world.\]

The way or fashion of people at any particular time; temporary mode, custom or practice; popular reception for the time. We say, a particular form of dress is now in vogue; an amusing writer is now in vogue; such opinions are now in _vogue_ The phrase, the _vogue_ of the world, used by good writers formerly, is nearly or quite obsolete.

Use may revive the obsoletest word, and banish those that now are most in _vogue_
