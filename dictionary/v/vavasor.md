# Vavasor

**VAV'ASOR**, _noun_ \[This word in old books is variously written, valvasor, vavasour, valvasour. It is said to be from vassal. But qu.\]

Camden holds that the _vavasor_ was next below a baron. Du Cange maintains that there were two sorts of vavasors; the greater, who held of the king, such as barons and counts; and the lesser, called valvasini, who held of the former. The dignity or rank is no longer in use, and the name is known only in books.
