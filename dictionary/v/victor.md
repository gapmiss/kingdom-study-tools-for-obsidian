# Victor

**VIC'TOR**, _noun_ \[Latin from vinco, victus, to conquer, or the same root.\]

**1.** One who conquers in war; a vanquisher; one who defeats an enemy in battle. _victor_ differs from conqueror. We apply conqueror to one who subdues countries, kingdoms or nations; as, Alexander was the conqueror of Asia or India, or of many nations, or of the world. In such phrases, we cannot substitute _victor_ But we use _victor_ when we speak of one who overcomes a particular enemy, or in a particular battle; as, Cesar was _victor_ at Pharsalia. The duke of Wellington was _victor_ at Waterloo. _victor_ then is not followed by the possessive case; for we do not say, Alexander was the _victor_ of Darius, though we say, he was _victor_ at Arbela.

**2.** One who vanquishes another in private combat or contest; as a _victor_ in the Olympic games.

**3.** One who wins, or gains the advantage.

In love, the victors from the vanquish'd fly;

They fly that wound, and they pursue that die.

**4.** Master; lord.

These, _victor_ of his health, his fortune, friends. \[Not usual nor legitimate.\]
