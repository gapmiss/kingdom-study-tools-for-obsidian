# Viol

**VI'OL**, _noun_ A stringed musical instrument, of the same form as the violin, but larger, and having formerly six strings, to be struck with a bow. Viols are of different kinds. The largest of all is the base _viol_ whose tones are deep, soft and agreeable. The violin now takes the place of the old _viol_

Me softer airs befit, and softer strings of lute, or _viol_ still more apt for mournful things.
