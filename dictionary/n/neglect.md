# Neglect

**NEGLECT**, _verb transitive_ \[G. To let, to leave, to suffer to pass. The sense of the latter words then is to leave behind, or permit to remain; I suspect the Latin To be composed of the same prefix, as n is not radical in the latter. But of this I am not confident.\]

**1.** To omit by carelessness or design; to forbear to do, use, employ, promote or attend to; as, to _neglect_ duty or business; to _neglect_ to pay honest debts; to _neglect_ our interest or policy; to _neglect_ the means in our power.

**2.** To omit to receive or embrace; to slight.

How shall we escape, if we _neglect_ so great salvation? [[Hebrews 2#3|Hebrews 2:3]].

**3.** To slight; not to notice; to forbear to treat with attention or respect. Among people of good breeding, strangers seldom complain of being neglected.

**4.** To postpone. \[Not in use.\]
