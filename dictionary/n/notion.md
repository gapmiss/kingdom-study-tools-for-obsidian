# Notion

**NO'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin known; to know.\]

**1.** Conception; mental apprehension of whatever may be known or imagined. We may have a just _notion_ of power, or false notions respecting spirit.

Notion and idea are primarily different; idea being the conception of something visible, as the idea of a square or a triangle; and _notion_ the conception of things invisible or intellectual, as the _notion_ we have of spirits. But from negligence in the use of idea, the two words are constantly confounded.

What hath been generally agreed on, I content myself to assume under the _notion_ of principles.

Few agree in their notions about these words.

That _notion_ of hunger, bold, sound, color, thought, wish or fear, which is in the mind, is called the idea of hunger, cold, etc.

**2.** sentiment; opinion; as the extravagant notions they entertain of themselves.

**3.** Sense; understanding; intellectual power. \[Not used.\]

**4.** Inclination; in vulgar use; as, I have a _notion_ to do this or that.
