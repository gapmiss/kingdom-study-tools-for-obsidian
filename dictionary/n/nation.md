# Nation

**NATION**, _noun_ \[to be born\]

**1.** A body of people inhabiting the same country, or united under the same sovereign or government; as the English nation; the French _nation_ It often happens that many nations are subject to one government; in which case, the word _nation_ usually denotes a body of people speaking the same language, or a body that has formerly been under a distinct government, but has been conquered, or incorporated with a larger _nation_ Thus the empire of Russia comprehends many nations, as did formerly the Roman and Persian empires. _nation_ as its etymology imports, originally denoted a family or race of men descended from a common progenitor, like tribe, but by emigration, conquest and intermixture of men of different families, this distinction is in most countries lost.

**2.** A great number, by way of emphasis.
