# Nor

**NOR**, _conjunction_, connective \[ne and or.\]

**1.** A word that denies ro renders negative the second or subsequent part of a proposition, or a proposition following another negative proposition; correlative to neither or not.

I neither love no fear thee.

Fight neither with small _nor_ great. [[1 Kings 22#31|1 Kings 22:31]].

**2.** _nor_ sometimes begins a sentence, but in this case a negative proposition has preceded it in the foregoing sentence.

**3.** In some cases, usually in poetry, neither is omitted, and the negation which it would express is included in _nor_

Simois _nor_ Xanthus shall be wanting there. That is, neither Simois _nor_ Xanthus.

**4.** Sometimes in poetry, _nor_ is used for neither, in the first part of the proposition.

I whom _nor_ avarice _nor_ pleasures move.
