# Never

**NEVER**, _adverb_

**1.** Not ever; not at any time; at no time. It refers to the past or the future. This man was _never_ at Calcutta; he will _never_ be there.

**2.** It has a particular use in the following sentences.

Ask me _never_ so much dower and gift. [[Genesis 34#12|Genesis 34:12]].

Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming _never_ so wisely. [[Psalms 58#5|Psalms 58:5]].

A fear of battery-though _never_ so well grounded, is no duress.

This is a genuine English use of _never_ found in our Saxon authors, and it ought to be retained. Ask me so much dower as _never_ was done; that is, dower to any extent. The practice of using ever in such phrases, is corrupt. It not only destroys the force but the propriety of the phrase.

**3.** In no degree; not.

Whoever has a friend to guide him, may carry his eyes in another mans head and yet see _never_ the worse.

**4.** It is used for not. He answered him _never_ a word; that is, not ever. This use is not common.

**5.** It is much used in composition; as in never-ending, never-failing, never-dying, never-ceasing, never-fading; but in all such compounds, _never_ retains its true meaning.
