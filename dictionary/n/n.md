It is an imperfect mute or semi-vowel, and a nasal letter; the articulation being accompanied with a sound through the nose. It has one sound only, and after _m_ is silent or nearly so, as in _hymn_ and _condemn._ _n_ among the ancients, was a numeral letter signifying 900, and with a stroke over it, 9000. Among the lawyers, _n_ Latin stood for non liquet, the case is not clear. In commerce, No. Is an abbreviation of the French nombre, and stands for number. _n_ S. stands for New Style.
