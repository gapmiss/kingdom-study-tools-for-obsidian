# No

**NO**. an abbreviation of number.

**NO**, _adverb_

**1.** A word of denial or refusal, expressing a negative, and equivalent to nay and not. When it expresses a negative answer, it is opposed to yes or yea. Will you go? It is frequently used in denying propositions, and opposed to affirmation or concession. 'That I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or _no_ ' [[Exodus 16#4|Exodus 16:4]]. _no_ in this use, is deemed less elegant than not, but the use is very general.

**2.** After another negative, it repeats the negation with great emphasis.

There is none righteous, _no_ not one. [[Romans 3#9|Romans 3:9]]. I Corinthians 5.

Sometimes it follows an affirmative proposition in like manner, but still it denies with emphasis and gives force to the following negative.

To whom we gave place by subjection, _no_ not for an hour. [[Galatians 2#5|Galatians 2:5]].

Sometimes it begins a sentence with a like emphatical signification, strengthening the following negative.

**NO**, not the bow which so adorns the skies, so glorious is, or boasts so many dyes.

**3.** Not in any degree; as _no_ longer; _no_ shorter; _no_ more; _no_ less.

**4.** When _no_ is repeated, it expresses negation or refusal with emphasis; as _no_ _no_

**NO**, _adjective_

**2.** Not any; not one.

Thou shalt worship _no_ other God. [[Exodus 34#3|Exodus 34:3]].
