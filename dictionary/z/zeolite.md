# Zeolite

**ZEOLITE**, _noun_ \[Gr., to boil, to foam; stone.\] A mineral, so named by Cronstedt from its intumescence before the blowpipe. Many substances have been confounded under this name, particularly such as are fusible by the blowpipe without addition, and exhibit a phosphoric brilliancy at the moment of fusion. Hauy makes two species of _zeolite_ which he calls mesotype and stilbite. Werner makes four subspecies, which he calls maly _zeolite_ fibrous _zeolite_ radiated _zeolite_ and foliated _zeolite_ He makes _zeolite_ a generic name, and Jameson, who adopts this theory, arranges in this family prehnite, _zeolite_ apophyllite, cubicite, called by Hauy analcime, chabasite, cross-stone, laumonite, dipyre, natrolite, and wavellite. _zeolite_ commonly occurs in a four sided prism, terminated by a four sided pyramid; often in small fibrous masses.
