# Zeugma

**ZEUGMA**, _noun_ \[Gr., to join. See [[Yoke]].\] A figure in grammar by which an adjective or verb which agrees with a nearer word, is by way of supplement, referred to another more remote. Thus in Virgil, Hicillius arma, hic currus fuit; where fuit, which agrees directly with currus, is referred also to arma.
