**JUSTIFICA'TION**, _noun_

**1.** The act of justifying; a showing to be just or conformable to law, rectitude or propriety; vindication; defense. The court listened to the evidence and arguments in _justification_ of the prisoner's conduct. Our disobedience to God's commands admits no _justification_

**2.** Absolution.

I hope, for my brother's _justification_ he wrote this but as an essay of my virtue.
