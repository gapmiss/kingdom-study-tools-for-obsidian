**1.** The virtue which consists in giving to every one what is his due; practical conformity to the laws and to principles of rectitude in the dealings of men with each other; honesty; integrity in commerce or mutual intercourse. _justice_ is distributive or commutative. Distributive _justice_ belongs to magistrates or rulers, and consists in distributing to every man that right or equity which the laws and the principles of equity require; or in deciding controversies according to the laws and to principles of equity. Commutative _justice_ consists in fair dealing in trade and mutual intercourse between man and man.

**2.** Impartiality; equal distribution of right in expressing opinions; fair representation of facts respecting merit or demerit. In criticisms, narrations, history or discourse, it is a duty to do _justice_ to every man, whether friend or foe.

**3.** Equity; agreeableness to right; as, he proved the _justice_ of his claim. This should, in strictness, be justness.

**4.** Vindictive retribution; merited punishment. Sooner or later, _justice_ overtakes the criminal.

**5.** Right; application of equity. His arm will do him _justice_
