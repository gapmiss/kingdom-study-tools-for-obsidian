# Jealousy

**JEALOUSY**, _noun_ jel'usy.

**1.** That passion of peculiar uneasiness which arises from the fear that a rival may rob us of the affection of one whom we love, or the suspicion that he has already done it; or it is the uneasiness which arises from the fear that another does or will enjoy some advantage which we desire for ourselves. A man's _jealousy_ is excited by the attentions of a rival to his favorite lady. A woman's _jealousy_ is roused by her husband's attentions to another woman. The candidate for office manifests a _jealousy_ of others who seek the same office. The _jealousy_ of a student is awakened by the apprehension that his fellow will bear away the palm of praise. In short, jealousy is awakened by whatever may exalt others, or give them pleasures and advantages which we desire for ourselves. _jealousy_ is nearly allied to envy, for _jealousy_ before a good is lost by ourselves, is converted into envy, after it is obtained by others.

**JEALOUSY** is the apprehension of superiority.

Whoever had qualities to alarm our _jealousy_ had excellence to deserve our fondness.

**2.** Suspicious fear or apprehension.

**3.** Suspicious caution or vigilance, an earnest concern or solicitude for the welfare or honor of others. Such was Paul's godly _jealousy_ for the Corinthians.

**4.** Indignation. God's _jealousy_ signifies his concern for his own character and government, with a holy indignation against those who violate his laws, and offend against his majesty. [[Psalms 79#5|Psalms 79:5]].
