# Justify

**JUST'IFY**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin justus, just, and facio, to make.\]

**1.** To prove or show to be just, or conformable to law, right, justice, propriety or duty; to defend or maintain; to vindicate as right. We cannot _justify_ disobedience or ingratitude to our Maker. We cannot _justify_ insult or incivility to our fellow men. Intemperance, lewdness, profaneness and dueling are in no case to be justified.

**2.** In theology, to pardon and clear form guilt; to absolve or acquit from guilt and merited punishment, and to accept as righteous on account of the merits of the Savior, or by the application of Christ's atonement to the offender.

**3.** To cause another to appear comparatively righteous, or less guilty than one's self. [[Ezekiel 16#1|Ezekiel 16:1]].

**4.** To judge rightly of.

Wisdom is justified by her children. [[Matthew 11#1|Matthew 11:1]].

**5.** To accept as just and treat with favor. [[James 2#1|James 2:1]].

**JUST'IFY**, _verb intransitive_ In printing, to agree; to suit; to conform exactly; to form an even surface or true line with something else. Types of different sizes will not _justify_ with each other.
