**APPLAUSE**', _noun_ s as z. \[Latin applausus.\]

A shout of approbation; approbation and praise, expressed by clapping the hands, acclamation or huzzas; approbation expressed. in antiquity, _applause_ differed from acclamation; _applause_ was expressed by the hands, and acclamation by the voice. There were three species of _applause_ the bombus, a confused din made by the hands or mouth; the imbrices and testae, made by beating a sort of sounding vessels in the theaters. Persons were appointed for the purpose of applauding, and masters were employed to teach the art. The applauds were divided into choruses, and placed opposite to each other, like the choristers in a cathedral.
