# Admiralty

**AD'MIRALTY**, _noun_ In Great Britain, the office of Lord High Admiral. This office is discharged by one person, or by Commissioners, called Lords of the Admiralty; usually seven in number.

The _admiralty_ court, or court of _admiralty_ is the supreme court for the trial of maritime causes, held before the Lord High Admiral, or Lords of the _admiralty_

In general, a court of _admiralty_ is a court for the trial of causes arising on the high seas, as prize causes and the like. In the United States, there is no _admiralty_ court, distinct from others; but the district courts, established in the several states by Congress, are invested with _admiralty_ powers.
