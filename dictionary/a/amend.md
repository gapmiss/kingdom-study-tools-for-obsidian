# Amend

**AMEND**', _verb transitive_ \[Latin emendo, of e neg, and menda, mendum, a fault. See [[mend]].\]

**1.** To correct; to rectify by expunging a mistake; as, to _amend_ a law.

**2.** To reform, by quitting bad habits; to make better in a moral sense; as, to _amend_ our ways or our conduct.

**3.** To correct; to supply a defect; to improve or make better, by some addition of what is wanted, as well as by expunging what is wrong, as to _amend_ a bill before a legislature. Hence it is applied to the correction of authors, by restoring passages which had been omitted, or restoring the true reading.

**AMEND'**, _verb intransitive_ To grow or become better, by reformation, or rectifying something wrong in manners or morals. It differs from improve, in this, that to _amend_ implies something previously wrong; to improve, does not.

**AMEND'**, A pecuniary punishment, or fine. The amende honorable, in France, is an infamous punishment inflicted on traitors, parricides and sacrilegious persons. The offender, being led into court with a rope about his neck, begs pardon of his God, the court, etc. These words denote also a recantation in open court, or in presence of the injured person.
