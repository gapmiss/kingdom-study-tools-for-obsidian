# Aggravate

**AG'GRAVATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin aggravo, of ad and gravis, heavy. See [[Grave]], Gravity.\]

**1.** To make heavy, but not used in this literal sense. Figuratively, to make worse, more severe, or less tolerable; as, to _aggravate_ the evils of life; to _aggravate_ pain or punishment.

**2.** To make more enormous, or less excusable; as, to _aggravate_ a crime.

**3.** To exaggerate.

**4.** To give coloring in description; to give an exaggerated representation; as, to _aggravate_ a charge against an offender; to _aggravate_ circumstances.

The propriety of the word in the latter passage is questionable. _aggravate_ is generally used in reference to evils, or something improper or unnatural.
