# Alone

**ALO'NE**, _adjective_ \[all and one.\]

**1.** Single; solitary; without the presence of another; applied to a person or thing.

It is not good that man should be _alone_ [[Genesis 2#18|Genesis 2:18]].

\[This adjective follows its noun.\]

**2.** It is applied to two or more persons or things, when separate from others, in a place or condition by themselves; without company.

And when they were _alone_ he expounded all things to his disciples. [[Mark 4#10|Mark 4:10]].

**3.** Only.

Thou whose name _alone_ is Jehovah. [[Psalms 83#18|Psalms 83:18]].

This sense at first appears to be adverbial, but really is not; whose name single, solitary, without another, is Jehovah.

To let _alone_ is to suffer to rest; to forbear molesting or meddling with; to suffer to remain in its present state. _alone_ in this phrase, is an adjective, the word to which it refers being omitted; let me alone; let them alone; let it alone; that is, suffer it to be unmolested, or to remain as it is, or let it remain by itself.

**ALO'NE**, _adverb_ Separately; by itself.
