# Animosity

**ANIMOS'ITY**, _noun_ \[Latin animositas; animosus, animated, courageous, enraged; from animus, spirit, mind passion. Gr. wind, breath, is from flowing, swelling, rushing, which gives the sense of violent action and passion. See [[animal]].\]

Violent hatred accompanied with active opposition; active enmity. _animosity_ differs from enmity which may be secret and inactive; and it expresses a less criminal passion than malice. _animosity_ seeks to gain a cause or destroy an enemy or rival, from hatred or private interest; malice seeks revenge for the sake of giving pain.
