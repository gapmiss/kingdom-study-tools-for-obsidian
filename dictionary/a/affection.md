# Affection

**AFFEC'TION**, _noun_

**1.** The state of being affected. \[Little used.\]

**2.** Passion; but more generally,

**3.** A bent of mind towards a particular object, holding a middle place between disposition, which is natural, and passion, which is excited by the presence of its exciting object. _affection_ is a permanent bent of the mind, formed by the presence of an object, or by some act of another person, and existing without the presence of its object.

**4.** In a more particular sense, a settle good will, love or zealous attachment; as, the _affection_ of a parent for his child. It was formerly followed by to or towards, but is now more generally followed by far.

**5.** Desire; inclination; propensity, good or evil; as, virtuous or vile affections. [[Romans 1#31|Romans 1:31]]. [[Galatians 5#24|Galatians 5:24]].

**6.** In a general sense, an attribute, quality or property, which is inseparable from its object; as, love, fear and hope are affections of the mind; figure, weight, etc., are affections of bodies.

**7.** Among physicians, a disease, or any particular morbid state of the body; as, a gouty affection; hysteric _affection_

**8.** In painting, a lively representation of passion.

Shakespeare uses the word for affectation; but this use is not legitimate.
