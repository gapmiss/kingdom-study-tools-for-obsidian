**AMBIG'UOUS**, _adjective_ \[Latin ambiguus.\]

Having two or more meanings; doubtful; being of uncertain signification; susceptible of different interpretations; hence, obscure. It is applied to words and expressions; not to a dubious state of mind, though it may be to a person using words of doubtful signification.

The ancient oracles were _ambiguous_ as were their answers.
