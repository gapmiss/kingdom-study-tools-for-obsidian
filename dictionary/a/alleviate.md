# Alleviate

**ALLE'VIATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Low Latin allevio; ad and levo, to raise, levis, light.\]

**1.** To make light; but always in a figurative sense, as it is not applied to material objects. To remove in part; to lessen, mitigate, or make easier to be endured; applied to evils; as, to _alleviate_ sorrow, pain, care, punishment, a burden, etc.; opposed to aggravate.

**2.** To make less by representation; to lessen the magnitude or criminality; to extenuate; applied to moral conduct; as, to _alleviate_ an offense. \[This sense of the word is rare.\]
