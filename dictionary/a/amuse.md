# Amuse

**AMU'SE**, _verb transitive_ s as z. \[Gr. and Latin musso.\]

**1.** To entertain the mind agreeably; to occupy or detain attention with agreeable objects, whether by singing, conversation, or a show of curiosities. Dr.Johnson remarks, that _amuse_ implies something less lively than divert, and less important than please. Hence it is often said, we are amused with trifles.

**2.** To detain; to engage the attention by hope or expectation; as, to _amuse_ one by flattering promises.
