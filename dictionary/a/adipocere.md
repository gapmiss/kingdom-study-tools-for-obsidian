# Adipocere

**AD'IPOCERE**, _noun_ \[Latin adeps, fat, and cera.\]

A soft unctuous or waxy substance, of a light brown color, into which the muscular fibers of dead animal bodies are converted, when protected from atmospheric air, and under certain circumstances of temperature and humidity. This substance was first discovered by Fourcroy, in the burying ground of the Church des Innocens, when it was removed in 1787. It is speedily produced, when the body is immersed in running water.
