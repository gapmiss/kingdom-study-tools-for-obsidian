# Aristocracy

**ARISTO'CRACY**, _noun_ \[Gr. best, and to hold or govern.\]

A form of government, in which the whole supreme power is vested in the principal persons of a state; or in a few men distinguished by their rank and opulence. When the supreme power is exercised by a small number, the government is called an oligarchy. The latter word however is usually applied to a corrupted form of _aristocracy_
