# Accessory

**AC'CESSORY**, _adjective_ \[Latin Accessorius, from accessus, accedo. See [[Accede]]. This word is accented on the first syllable on account of the derivatives, which require a secondary accent on the third; but the natural accent of _accessory_ is on the second syllable, and thus it is often pronounced by good speakers.\]

**1.** Acceding; contributing; aiding in producing some effect, or acting in subordination to the principal agent. Usually, in a bad sense, as John was _accessory_ to the felony.

**2.** Aiding in certain acts or effects in a secondary manner, as _accessory_ sounds in music.

**AC'CESSORY**, _noun_

**1.** In law, one who is guilty of a felony, not by committing the offense in person or as principal, but by advising or commanding another to commit the crime, or by concealing the offender. There may be accessories in all felonies, but not in treason. An _accessory_ before the fact, is one who counsels or commands another to commit a felony, and is not present when the act is executed; after the fact, when one receives and conceals the offender.

**2.** That which accedes or belongs to something else, as its principal.
