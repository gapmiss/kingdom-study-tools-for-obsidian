# Accent

**AC'CENT**, _noun_ \[Latin accentus, from ad and cano, cantum, to sing; See [[Accend]].\]

**1.** The modulation of the voice in reading or speaking, as practiced by the ancient Greeks, which rendered their rehearsal musical. More strictly, in English,

**2.** A particular stress or force of voice upon certain syllables of words, which distinguishes them from the others. _accent_ is of two kinds, primary and secondary; as in as'pira'tion. In uttering this word, we observe the first and third syllables are distinguished; the third by a full sound, which constitutes the primary accent; the first by a degree of force in the voice which is less than that of the primary _accent_ but evidently greater than that which falls on the second and fourth syllables.

When the full _accent_ falls on a vowel, that vowel has its long sound, as in vo'cal; but when it falls on an articulation or consonant, the preceding vowel is short, as in hab'it. _accent_ alone regulates English verse.

**3.** A mark or character used in writing to direct the stress of the voice in pronunciation. Our ancestors borrowed from the Greek language three of these characters, the acute, the grave and circumflex. In the Greek, the first shows when the voice is to be raised; the second, when it is to be depressed; and the third, when the vowel is to be uttered with an undulating sound.

**4.** A modulation of the voice expressive of passions or sentiments.

The tender accents of a woman's cry.

**5.** Manner of speaking.

A man of plain _accent_ _obsolete_

**6.** Poetically, words, language, or expressions in general.

Words, on your wings, to heaven her accents bear,

Such words as heaven alone is fit to hear.

**7.** In music, a swelling of sounds, for the purpose of variety or expression. the principal _accent_ falls on the first note in the bar, but the third place in common time requires also an _accent_

**8.** A peculiar tone or inflection of voice.

**AC'CENT**, _verb transitive_ To express accent; to utter a syllable with a particular stress or modulation of the voice. In poetry, to utter or pronounce in general. Also to note accents by marks in writing.
