# Ass

**'ASS**, _noun_ \[Latin asinus; Gr. an ear.\]

**1.** A quadruped of the equine genus. This animal has long slouching ears, a short mane, and a tail covered with long hairs at the end. He is usually of an ash color, with a black bar across the shoulders. The tame or domestic _ass_ is patient to stupidity, and carries a heavy burden. He is slow, but very sure footed, and for this reason very useful on rough steep hills.

**2.** A dull, heavy, stupid fellow; a dolt.
