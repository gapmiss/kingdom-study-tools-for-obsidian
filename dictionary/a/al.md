# Al

**AL**, in Arabic, an adjective or inseparable prefix. Its use is to render nouns definite, like the English the; as, alkoran, the koran or the book by eminence; alcove, alchimy, alembic, almanac, etc.

**AL**, In English, is sometimes a contraction of the Saxon athel, noble or illustrious.

More generally _al_ in composition is a contraction of ald or alt, old, and it is prefixed to many names, as Alburg.

**AL**, in the composition of Latin words, is written before l for ad, for the ease of pronunciation; as, in allevo, alludo, for ad levo, ad ludo.
