# Agouty

**AGOUTY**, _noun_ \[Latin acutus.\]

A quadruped of the order Rodentia; arranged by naturalist in the genus Cavia. It is of the size of a rabbit. The upper part of the body is brownish, with a mixture of red and black; the belly yellowish. Three varieties are mentioned, all peculiar to South America and West Indies. It burrows in the ground, or in hollow trees; lives on vegetables; is voracious like a pig, and makes a similar grunting noise. It holds its meat in its fore paws, like a squirrel. When scared or angry, its hair is erect, and it strikes the ground with its hind feet. Its flesh is white and well tasted.
