# Agonist

**AG'ONIST**, _noun_ One who contends for the prize in public games. Milton has used Agonistes in this sense, and so called his tragedy, from the similitude of Sampson's exertions, in slaying the Philistines, to prize fighting. In church history, the disciples of Donatus are called agonistics.
