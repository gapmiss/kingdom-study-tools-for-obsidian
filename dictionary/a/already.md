# Already

**ALREAD'Y**, _adverb_ alred'dy. \[all and ready. See [[Ready]].\]

Literally, a state of complete preparation; but, by an easy deflection, the sense is, at this time, or at a specified time.

Elias is come _already_ [[Matthew 17#12|Matthew 17:12]].

Joseph was in Egypt _already_ [[Exodus 1#5|Exodus 1:5]].
