# Asylum

**ASY'LUM**, _noun_ \[Latin from Gr. safe from spoil, and spoil, to plunder.\]

**1.** A sanctuary, or place of refuge, where criminals and debtors shelter themselves from justice, and from which they cannot be taken without sacrilege. Temples and altars were anciently asylums; as were tombs, statues and monuments. The ancient heathens allowed asylums for the protection of the vilest criminals; and the Jews had their cities of refuge.

**2.** Any place of retreat and security.
