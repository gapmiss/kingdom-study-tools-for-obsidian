# Avener

**AV'ENER**,

AVENGE, _verb transitive_ avenj'. \[Latin vindex.\]

**1.** To take satisfaction for an injury by punishing the injuring party; to vindicate by inflicting pain or evil on the wrong doer.

Shall not God avenge his own elect. [[Luke 18#1|Luke 18:1]].

Avenge me of my adversary.

In these examples, avenge implies that the evil inflicted on the injuring party is a satisfaction or justice done to the injured, and the party vindicated is the object of the verb.

**2.** To take satisfaction for, by pain or punishment inflicted on the injuring party.

He will avenge the blood of his servants. [[Deuteronomy 32#1|Deuteronomy 32:1]].

Here the thing for which satisfaction is taken is the object of the verb.

**3.** To revenge. To avenge and revenge, radically, are synonymous. But modern usage inclines to make a valuable distinction in the use of these words, restricting avenge to the taking of just punishment, and revenge to the infliction of pain or evil, maliciously, in an illegal manner.

**4.** In the passive form this verb signifies to have or receive just satisfaction, by the punishment of the offender.

Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

[[Jeremiah 5#1|Jeremiah 5:1]].
