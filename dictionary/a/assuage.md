# Assuage

**ASSUA'GE**, _verb transitive_

To soften, in a figurative sense; to allay, mitigate, ease or lessen, as pain or grief; to appease or pacify, as passion or tumult. In strictness, it signifies rather to moderate, than to quiet, tranquilize or reduce to perfect peace or ease.

**ASSUA'GE**, _verb intransitive_ To abate or subside.

The waters assuaged. [[Genesis 8#1|Genesis 8:1]].

But I apprehend the sense is, the waters were checked; Hebrew.
