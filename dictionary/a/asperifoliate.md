# Asperifoliate

**ASPERIFO'LIATE**, _adjective_ \[Latin asper, rough, and folium, a leaf.\]

Having rough leaves. Plants of this kind are, by some authors, classified according to this character. They constitute the forty-first order of Linne's fragments of a natural method. In the methods of Herman, Boerhave, and Ray, this class consists of plants which have four naked seeds. Their leaves stand alternately on the stalks, and the flower is monopetalous in five divisions.
