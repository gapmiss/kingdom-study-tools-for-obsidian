# Anguish

**AN'GUISH**, _noun_ \[Latin angustia, narrowness, from pressure. See [[Anger]].\]

Extreme pain, either of body or mind. As bodily pain, it may differ from agony, which is such distress of the whole body as to cause contortion, whereas _anguish_ may be a local pain as of an ulcer, or gout. But _anguish_ and agony are nearly synonymous. As pain of the mind, it signifies any keen distress from sorrow, remorse, despair and kindred passions.

And they hearkened not to Moses, for _anguish_ of spirit, and for cruel bondage. [[Exodus 6#9|Exodus 6:9]].

**AN'GUISH**, _verb transitive_ To distress with extreme pain or grief.
