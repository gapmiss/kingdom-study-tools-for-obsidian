# Assets

**ASSETS**', _noun_ _plural_ \[Latin sat, satis, enough.\]

Goods or estate of a deceased person, sufficient to pay the debts of the deceased. But the word sufficient, though expressing the original signification of _assets_ is not with us necessary to the definition. In present usage, _assets_ are the money, goods or estate of a deceased person, subject by law to the payment of his debts and legacies. _assets_ are real or personal; real _assets_ are lands which descend to the heir, subject to the fulfillment of the obligations of the ancestor; personal _assets_ are the money or goods of the deceased, or debts due to him, which come into the hands of the executor or administrator, or which he is bound to collect and convert into money.
