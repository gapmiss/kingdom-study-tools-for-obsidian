# Amenable

**AME'NABLE**, _adjective_

**1.** In old law, easy to be led; governable, as a woman by her husband. \[This sense is obsolete.\]

**2.** Liable to answer; responsible; answerable; liable to be called to account; as, every man is _amenable_ to the laws.

We retain this idiom in the popular phrase, to bring in, to make answerable; as a man is brought in to pay the debt of another.
