# Another

**ANOTH'ER**, _adjective_ \[an, or one and other.\]

**1.** Not the same; different; as, we have one form of government; France, _another_

**2.** One more, in addition to a former number, indefinitely; as, grant one request, they will ask _another_ favor, _another_ and _another_

**3.** Any other; any different person, indefinitely; as, 'Let _another_ praise thee and not thy own mouth.' This word is often used without a noun, becoming a substitute for the name of the person or thing; as in the last example. It is also much used in opposition to one, as in the first and second passages cited. It is also frequently used with one, in a reciprocal sense; as, 'love one another; ' 'bear one another's burdens; ' that is, love one, or let one love _another_
