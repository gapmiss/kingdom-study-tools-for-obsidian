# Ambition

**AMBI'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin ambitio, from ambio, to go about, or to seek by making interest, of amb, about, and eo, to go. See [[Ambages]]. This word had its origin in the practice of Roman candidates for office, who went about the city to solicit votes.\]

A desire of preferment, or of honor; a desire of excellence or superiority. It is used in a good sense; as, emulation may spring from a laudable _ambition_ It denotes also an inordinate desire of power, or eminence, often accompanied with illegal means to obtain the object. It is sometimes followed by of; as, a man has an _ambition_ of wit. Milton has used the word in the Latin sense of going about, or attempting; but this sense is hardly legitimate.

**AMBI'TION**, _verb transitive_ Ambitiously to seek after. \[Little used.\]
