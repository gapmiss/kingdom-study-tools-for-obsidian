# Arminian

**ARMIN'IAN**, _adjective_ Pertaining to Arminius, or designating his principles.

**ARMIN'IAN**, _noun_ One of a sect or party of Christians, so called from Arminius or Harmansen, of Holland, who flourished at the close of the 16th century, and beginning of the 17th. The _arminian_ doctrines are,

**1.** conditional election and reprobation, in opposition to absolute predestination.

**2.** Universal redemption, or that the atonement was made by Christ for all mankind, though none but believers can be partakers of the benefit.

**3.** That man, in order to exercise true faith, must be regenerated and renewed by the operation of the Holy Spirit, which is the gift of God; but that this grace is not irresistible and may be lost; so that men may relapse from a state of grace and die in their sins.
