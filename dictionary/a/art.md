# Art

**'ART**, The second person, indicative mode, present tense, of the substantive veb am.

**'ART**, _noun_ \[Latin ars, artis.\]

**1.** The disposition or modification of things by human skill, to answer the purpose intended. In this sense _art_ stands opposed to nature.

**2.** A system of rules, serving to facilitate the performance of certain actions; opposed to science, or to speculative principles; as the _art_ of building or engraving. Arts are divided into useful or mechanic, and liberal or polite. The mechanic arts are those in which the hands and body are more concerned than the mind; as in making clothes, and utensils. These _art_ are called trades. The liberal or polite arts are those in which the mind or imagination is chiefly concerned; as poetry, music and painting.

In America, literature and the elegant arts must grow up side by side with the coarser plants of daily necessity.

**3.** Skill, dexterity, or the power of performing certain actions, acquired by experience, study or observation; as, a man has the _art_ of managing his business to advantage.
