# Amercement

**AMERCEMENT**, _noun_ amers'ment. A pecuniary penalty inflicted on an offender at the discretion of the court. It differs from a fine, in that the latter is, or was originally, a fixed and certain sum prescribed by statute for an offense; but an _amercement_ is arbitrary. Hence the practice of affeering. \[See [[Affeer]].\] But in America, the word fine is now used for a pecuniary penalty which is uncertain; and it is common in statutes, to enact that an offender shall be fined, at the discretion of the court. In England also, fines are now usually discretionary. Thus the word fine has, in a measure, superseded the use of _amercement_ This word, in old books, is written amerciament.

**AMERCEMENT** royal is a penalty imposed on an officer for a misdemeanor in his office.
