# Abib

**A'BIB**, _noun_ \[Heb. swelling, protuberant. To produce the first or early fruit; a full grown ear of corn.\]

The first month of the Jewish ecclesiastical year, called also Nisan. It begins at the spring equinox, and answers to the latter part of March and beginning of April. Its name is derived from the full growth of wheat in Egypt, which took place anciently, as it does now, at that season.
