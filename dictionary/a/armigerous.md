# Armigerous

**ARMIG'EROUS**, _adjective_ \[Latin armiger, arma and gero.\]

Literally, bearing arms. But in present usage, armiger is a title of dignity next in degree to a knight. In times of chivalry, it signified an attendant on a knight, or other person of rank, who bore his shield and rendered him other military services. so in antiquity, Abimilech, Saul, etc. had their armor bearers. [[Judges 9#1|Judges 9:1]]. [[1 Samuel 16#1|1 Samuel 16:1]]. as had Hector and Achilles. This title, under the French princes, in England, was exchanged, in common usage, for esquire, Latin scutum, a shield. Armiger is still retained with us as a title of respect, being the Latin word equivalent to esquire, which see.
