# Abomination

**ABOMINA'TION**, _noun_

**1.** Extreme hatred; detestation.

**2.** The object of detestation, a common signification in scripture.

The way of the wicked is an _abomination_ to the Lord. [[Proverbs 15#8|Proverbs 15:8]].

**3.** Hence, defilement, pollution, in a physical sense, or evil doctrines and practices, which are moral defilements, idols and idolatry, are called abominations. The Jews were an _abomination_ to the Egyptians; and the sacred animals of the Egyptians were an _abomination_ to the Jews. The Roman army is called the _abomination_ of desolation. [[Matthew 24#15|Matthew 24:15]]. In short, whatever is an object of extreme hatred, is called an _abomination_
