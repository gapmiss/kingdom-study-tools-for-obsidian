# Algebra

**AL'GEBRA**, _noun_ \[Ar. the reduction of parts to a whole, or fractions to whole numbers from the verb, which signifies to consolidate; Heb. to be strong.\]

The science of quantity in general, or universal arithmetic. _algebra_ is a general method computation, in which signs and symbols, which are commonly the letters of the alphabet, are made to represent numbers and quantities. It takes an known quantity sought, as if granted; and, by means of one or more quantities given, proceeds till the quantity supposed is discovered, by some other known quantity to which it is equal.

This science was of Oriental discovery; but whether among the Arabians or Indians, is uncertain.
