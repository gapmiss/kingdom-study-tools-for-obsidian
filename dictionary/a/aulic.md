# Aulic

**AU'LIC**, _adjective_ \[Latin audicus, from aula, a hall, court or palace; Gr.\]

Pertaining to a royal court. The epithet is probably confined to the German Empire, where it is used to designate certain courts or officers composing the courts. The _aulic_ council is composed of a president, who is a catholic, a vice-chancellor and eighteen counsellors, nine of whom are protestants, and nine catholics. They always follow the Emperor's court, and decide without an appeal. This council ceases at the death of the Emperor.

The _aulic_ in some European universities, is an act of a young divine, on being admitted a doctor of divinity. It begins by a harangue of the chancellor addressed to the young doctor, after which he receives the cap and presides at the _aulic_ or disputation.
