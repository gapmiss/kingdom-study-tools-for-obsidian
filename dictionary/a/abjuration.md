# Abjuration

**ABJURA'TION**, _noun_ \[See [[Abjure]].\]

**1.** The act of abjuring; a renunciation upon oath; as 'an _abjuration_ of the realm, ' by which a person swears to leave the country, and never to return. It is used also for the oath of renunciation. Formerly in England, felons, taking refuge in a church, and confessing their guilt, could not be arrested and tried, but might save their lives by abjuring the realm; that is by taking an oath to quit the kingdom forever.

**2.** A rejection or denial with solemnity; a total abandonment; as 'an _abjuration_ of heresy.'
