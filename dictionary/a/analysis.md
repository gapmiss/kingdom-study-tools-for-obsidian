# Analysis

**ANAL'YSIS**, _noun_ \[Gr. a loosing, or resolving, from to loosen. See [[Loose]].\]

**1.** The separation of a compound body into its constituent parts; a resolving; as, an _analysis_ of water, air or oil, to discover its elements.

**2.** A consideration of anything in its separate parts; an examination of the different parts of a subject, each separately; as the words which compose a sentence, the notes of a tune, or the simple propositions which enter into an argument. It is opposed to synthesis.

In mathematics, _analysis_ is the resolving of problems by algebraic equations. The _analysis_ of finite quantities is otherwise called algebra, or specious arithmetic. The _analysis_ of infinites is the method of fluxions, or the differential calculus.

In logic, _analysis_ is the tracing of things to their source, and the resolving of knowledge into its original principles.

**3.** A syllabus, or table of the principal heads of a continued discourse, disposed in their natural order.

**4.** A brief, methodical illustration of the principles of a science. In this sense, it is nearly synonymous with synopsis.
