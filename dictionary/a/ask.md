**'ASK**, _verb transitive_ \[Gr. In former times, the English word was pronounced ax, as in the royal style of assenting to bills in Parliament. 'Be it as it is axed.'\]

**'ASK**, _verb intransitive_

**1.** To request or petition, followed by for; as, _ask_ for bread; or without for.

Ask and it shall be given you. [[Matthew 7#7|Matthew 7:7]].

**2.** to inquire, or seek by request; sometimes followed by after.

Wherefore dost thou _ask_ after my name? [[Genesis 32#29|Genesis 32:29]].

This verb can hardly be considered as strictly intransitive, for some person or object is always understood.

Ask is not equivalent to demand, claim, and require, at least, in modern usage; much less, is it equivalent to beg and beseech. The first three words, demand, claim, require, imply a right or supposed right in the person asking, to the thing requested; and beseech implies more urgency, than _ask_ _ask_ and request imply no right, but suppose the thing desired to be a favor. The French demander is correctly rendered by _ask_ rather than by deman.
