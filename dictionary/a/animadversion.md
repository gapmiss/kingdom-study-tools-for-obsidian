# Animadversion

**ANIMADVER'SION**, _noun_ \[Latin animadversio.\]

Remarks by way of censure or criticism; reproof; blame. It may sometimes be used for punishment, or punishment may be implied in the word, but this is not common. In an ecclesiastical sense, it differs from censure, says Ayliffe; censure, respecting spiritual punishment, and _animadversion_ a temporal one. Glanville uses the word in the sense of perception, but this use is not authorized.
