# Altar

**AL'TAR**, _noun_ \[Latin altare, probably from the same root as altus, high.

**1.** A mount; a table or elevated place, on which sacrifices where anciently offered to some deity. Altars were originally made of turf, afterwards of stone, wood or horn; some were round, others square, others triangular. They differed also in height, but all faced the east. The principal altars of the Jews were, the _altar_ of incense, of burnt-offerings, and of shewbread; all of shittim wood, and covered with gold or brass.

**2.** In modern churches, the communion table; and, figuratively, a church; a place of worship.

**3.** In scripture, Christ is called the _altar_ of Christians, he being the atoning sacrifice for sin.

We have an _altar_ whereof they have no right to eat, who serve tabernacles. [[Hebrews 13#10|Hebrews 13:10]].
