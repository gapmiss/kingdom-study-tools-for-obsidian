# Adore

**ADO'RE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin adoro. In Heb. to honor, reverence or glorify to adorn; to be magnificent or glorious, to magnify, to glorify. This word is usually referred to the Latin ad orare, to carry to one's mouth; ad and os, oris; as, in order to kiss one's hand, the hand is carried to one's mouth. See _Calmet, ad verbum_, who cites, in confirmation of this opinion, the ancient practice of kissing the hand. See [[Job 31#27|Job 31:27]]. [[1 Kings 19#18|1 Kings 19:18]]. [[Psalms 2#12|Psalms 2:12]]. [[Genesis 45#15 |Genesis 45:15 ]]. Ainsworth supposes the word to be a compound of ad and oro, to pray; and if the word is compound, as I suspect, this opinion is most probably correct.\]

**1.** To worship with profound reverence; to address with exalted thoughts, by prayer and thanksgiving; to pay divine honors to; to honor as a god or as divine.

**2.** To love in the highest degree; to regard with the utmost esteem, affection and respect; as, the people _adore_ their prince.
