# Abut

**ABUT**', _verb intransitive_ To border upon; to be contiguous to; to meet; in strictness, to adjoin to at the end; but this distinction has not always been observed. The word is chiefly used in describing the bounds or situation of land, and in popular language, is contracted into but, as butted and bounded.
