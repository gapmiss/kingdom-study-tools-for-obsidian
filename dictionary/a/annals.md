# Annals

**AN'NALS**, _noun_ _plural_ \[Latin amnales, annalis, from annus, a year, the root of which may be the Celtic an, ain, a great circle. Varro says the word annus signifies a great circle.\]

**1.** A species of history digested in order of time, or a relation of events in chronological order, each event being recorded under the year in which it happened. _annals_ differ from history, in merely relating events, without observations on the motives, causes and consequences, which, in history, are more diffusively illustrated.

**2.** The books containing _annals_ as the _annals_ of Tacitus.
