# Assent

**ASSENT**', _noun_ \[Latin assensus, from assentior, to _assent_ of ad and sentio, to thing.\]

**1.** The act of the mind in admitting, or agreeing to, the truth of a proposition.

Faith is the _assent_ to any proposition, on the credit of the proposer.

**2.** Consent; agreement to a proposal, respecting some right or interest; as, the bill before the house has the _assent_ of a great majority of the members.

The distinction between _assent_ and consent seems to be this:_assent_ is the agreement to an abstract proposition. We _assent_ to a statement, but we do not consent to it. Consent is an agreement to some proposal or measure which affects the rights or interest of the consenter. We consent to a proposal of marriage. This distinction however is not always observed. \[See [[Consent]].\]

**3.** Accord; agreement. [[2 Chronicles 18#12|2 Chronicles 18:12]].

**ASSENT'**, _verb intransitive_ To admit as true; to agree, yield or concede, or rather to express an agreement of the mind to what is alleged, or proposed.

The Jews also assented, saying these things are so.

[[Acts 24#9|Acts 24:9]].

It is sometimes used for consent, or an agreement to something affecting the rights or interest of the person assenting. But to _assent_ to the marriage of a daughter is less correct than to consent.
