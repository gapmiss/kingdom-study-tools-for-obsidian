# Acme

**AC'ME**, _noun_ Ac'my \[Gr.\]

The top or highest point. It is used to denote the maturity or perfection of an animal. Among physicians, the crisis of a disease, or its utmost violence. Old medical writers divided the progress of a disease into four periods, the arche, or beginning, the anabasis, or increase, the _acme_ or utmost violence, and the paracme, or decline. But _acme_ can hardly be considered as a legitimate English word.
