# Albeit

**ALBE'IT**, \[This is supposed to be a compound of all, be and it, and is equivalent to admit, or grant it all.\]

Be it so; admit all that; although; notwithstanding.

Whereas ye say, the Lord saith it, _albeit_ I have not spoken. [[Ezekiel 8#1|Ezekiel 8:1]].

\[This word is not antiquated.\]
