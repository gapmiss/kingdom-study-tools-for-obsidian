# Athanasian

**ATHANA'SIAN**, _adjective_ Pertaining to Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, in the fourth century. The _athanasian_ creed is a formulary, confession or exposition of faith, supposed formerly to have been drawn up by Athanasius, but this opinion is now rejected, and the composition is ascribed by some to Hilary, bishop of Arles. It is a summary of what was called the orthodox faith.
