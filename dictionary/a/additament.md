# Additament

**ADDIT'AMENT**, _noun_ \[Latin additamentum, from additus and ment. See [[Add]].\]

An addition, or rather the thing added, as furniture in a house; any material mixed with the principal ingredient in a compound. Ancient anatomists gave the name to an epiphysis, or junction of bones without articulation. \[Little used in either sense.\]
