# Ancient

**AN'CIENT**, _adjective_ Usually pronounced most anomalously, _ancient_ The pronunciation of the first vowel ought to accord with that is antiquity, anger, anchor, etc. \[Lt. ante, antiquus.\] We usually apply _ancient_ and old to things subject to gradual decay. We say, an old man, an _ancient_ record; but never the old sun, old stars, an old river or mountain.

**1.** Old; that happened or existed in former times, usually at a great distance of time; as, _ancient_ authors, _ancient_ days. Old, says Johnson, relates to the duration of the thing itself, as an old coat; and _ancient_ to time in general, as an _ancient_ dress. But this distinction is not always observed. We say, in old times, as well as _ancient_ times; old customs, etc. In general, however, _ancient_ is opposed to modern, and old to new, fresh or recent. When we speak of a thing that existed formerly, which as ceased to exist, we commonly use _ancient_ as _ancient_ republics' _ancient_ heroes, and not old republics, old heroes. But when the thing which began or existed in former times, is still in existence, we use either _ancient_ or old; as, _ancient_ statues or paintings, or old statues or paintings; _ancient_ authors, or old authors, meaning books. But in these examples _ancient_ seems the most correct, or best authorized. Some persons apply _ancient_ to men advanced in years still living; but this use is not common in modern practice, though found in scripture.

With the _ancient_ is wisdom. Job.

**2.** Old; that has been of long duration; as, an _ancient_ forest; an _ancient_ city.

**3.** Known from _ancient_ times; as the _ancient_ continent, opposed to the new continent.
