# Attainable

**ATTA'INABLE**, _adjective_ That may be attained; that may be reached by efforts of the mind or body; that may be compassed or accomplished by efforts directed to the object; as, perfection is not _attainable_ in this life. From an inattention to the true sense of this word, as explained under attain, authors have very improperly used this word for obtainable, procurable; as in the following passages. 'The kind and quality of food and liquor; the species of habitation, furniture and clothing to which the common people of each country are habituated, must be _attainable_ with ease and certainty.' 'Gen. Howe would not permit them to be purchased in Philadelphia, and they (clothes and blankets) were not _attainable_ in the country.' Marshall's Life of Washington, 3, 428. Each of these words should be obtainable.
