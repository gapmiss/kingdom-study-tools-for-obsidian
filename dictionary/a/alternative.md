# Alternative

**ALTERN'ATIVE**, _adjective_ Offering a choice of two things.

**ALTERN'ATIVE**, _noun_ That which may be chosen or omitted; a choice of two things, so that if one is taken, the other must be left. Thus, when two things offer a choice of one only, the two things are called alternatives. In strictness, then, the word can not be applied to more than two things, and when one thing only is offered for choice, it is said there is no _alternative_

Between these alternatives there is no middle ground.
