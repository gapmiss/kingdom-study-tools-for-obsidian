# Abundant

**ABUND'ANT**, _adjective_ Plentiful; in great quantity; fully sufficient; as an _abundant_ supply. In scripture, abounding; having in great quantity; overflowing with.

The Lord God is _abundant_ in goodness and truth. [[Exodus 34#6|Exodus 34:6]].

Abundant number, in arithmetic, is one, the sum of whose aliquot parts exceeds the number itself. Thus 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, the aliquot parts of 12, make the sum of 16. This is opposed to a deficient number, as 14, whose aliquot parts are 1, 2, 7, the sum of which is 10; and to a perfect number, which is equal to the sum of its aliquot parts, as 6, whose aliquot parts are 1, 2, 3.
