**AVOCA'TION**, _noun_ \[See [[Vocation]], Voice, Vocal.\]

**1.** The act of calling aside, or diverting from some employment; as an _avocation_ from sin or from business.

**2.** The business which calls aside. The word is generally used for the smaller affairs of life, or occasional calls which summon a person to leave his ordinary or principal business. The use of this word for vocation is very improper.
