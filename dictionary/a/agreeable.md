# Agreeable

**AGREE'ABLE**, _adjective_

**1.** Suitable; conformable; correspondent; consistent with; as, the practice of virtue is _agreeable_ to the law of God and our own nature.

**2.** In pursuance of; in conformity with; as, _agreeable_ to the order of the day, the house took up the report of the committee. It is not correctly followed by with. In this sense, some writers use agreeably, for _agreeable_ but in violation of the true principles of construction; for the word is an adjective or attribute, in agreement with the last clause of the sentence. The house took up the report of a committee, (which taking up was) _agreeable_ to the order of the day. The use of agreeably in this sentence would pervert the sense.

**3.** Pleasing, either to the mind or senses; as, _agreeable_ manners; fruit _agreeable_ to the taste.
