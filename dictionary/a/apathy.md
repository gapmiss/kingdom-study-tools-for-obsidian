# Apathy

**AP'ATHY**, _noun_ \[Gr. passion.\]

Want of feeling; an utter privation of passion, or insensibility to pain; applied either to the body or the mind. As applied to the mind, it is stoicism, a calmness of mind incapable of being ruffled by pleasure, pain or passion. In the first ages of the church, the christians adopted the term to express a contempt of earthly concerns.

Quietism is _apathy_ disguised under the appearance of devotion.
