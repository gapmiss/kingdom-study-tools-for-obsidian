# Admixtion

**ADMIX'TION**, _noun_ admixchun, \[Latin admixtio, or admistio; of ad and misceo, to mix. See [[Mix]].\]

A mingling of bodies; a union by mixing different substances together. It differs from composition or chimical combination; for _admixtion_ does not alter the nature of the substances mixed, but merely blends them together; whereas in composition, the particles unite by affinity, lose their former properties, and form new compounds, with different properties.
