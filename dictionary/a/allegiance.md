# Allegiance

**ALLE'GIANCE**, _noun_ \[Latin alligo, of ad and ligo, to bind. See [[Liege and League]].\]

The tie or obligation of a subject to his Prince or government; the duty of fidelity to a king, government or state. Every native or citizen owes _allegiance_ to the government under which he is born. This is called natural or implied _allegiance_ which arises from the connection of a person with the society in which he is born, and his duty to be a faithful subject, independent of any express promise. Express _allegiance_ is that obligation which proceeds from an express promise, or oath of fidelity.

Local or temporary _allegiance_ is due from an alien to the government or state in which he resides.
