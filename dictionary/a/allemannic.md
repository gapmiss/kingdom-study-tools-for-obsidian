# Allemannic

**ALLEMAN'NIC**, _adjective_ Belonging to the Alemanni, ancient Germans, and to Alemannia, their country. The word is generally supposed to be composed of all and manni, all men. Cluver, p. 68. This is probably an error. The word is more probably composed of the Celtic all, other, the root of Latin alius and man, place; one of another place, a stranger. The Welsh allman is thus rendered, and this seems to be the original word.

The name, Alemanni, seems to have been first given to the Germans who invaded Gaul in the reign of Augustus.
