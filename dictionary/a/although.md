# Although

**ALTHO'UGH**, altho', _obsolete_ verb, or used only in the Imperative.

Grant all this; be it so; allow all; suppose that; admit all that; as, 'although the fig tree shall not blossom.' [[Habakkuk 3#17|Habakkuk 3:17]]. That is, grant, admit or suppose what follows - 'the fig tree shall not blossom.' It is a transitive verb, and admits after it the definitive that - _although_ that the fig tree shall not blossom; but this use of the verb, has been long obsolete. The word may be defined by notwithstanding, non obstante; as not opposing may be equivalent to admitting or supposing.
