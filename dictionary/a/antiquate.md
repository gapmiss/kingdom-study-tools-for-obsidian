# Antiquate

**AN'TIQUATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin antiquo. See [[Antiquary]].\]

To make old, or obsolete; to make old in such a degree as to put out of use. Hence, when applied to laws or customs, it amounts to make void or abrogate.

Christianity might reasonably introduce new laws and _antiquate_ or abrogate old ones.
