# Alkali

**AL'KALI**, _noun_ _plural_ Alkalies

In chemistry, a term applied to all bodies which possess the following properties:

**1.** a caustic taste;

**2.** volatilizable by heat;

**3.** capability of combining with acids, and of destroying their acidity;

**4.** solubility in water, even when combined with carbonic acid;

**5.** capability of converting vegetable blues to green.

The term was formerly confined to three substances:

**1.** potash or vegetable fixed _alkali_ generally obtained from the ashes of wood;

**2.** soda or mineral fixed _alkali_ which is found in the earth and procured from marine plants; and

**3.** ammonia or volatile _alkali_ an animal product.

Modern chemistry has discovered many new substances to which the term is now extended.

The alkalies were formerly considered as elementary substances; but it is now ascertained that they are all compounds.

The alkalies are used in the manufacture of glass and soap, in bleaching and in medicine.
