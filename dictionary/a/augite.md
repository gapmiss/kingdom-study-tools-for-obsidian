# Augite

**AU'GITE**, _noun_ \[Gr. brightness.\]

A mineral called by Hauy, pyroxene; often found in distinct crystals. Its secondary forms are all six or eight-sided prisms. Sometimes it appears in hemitrope crystals. It has a foliated structure, and is harder than hornblend. The varieties are common _augite_ sahlite, fassaite, and cocolite. The omphacite of Werner appears also to be a variety; and the common _augite_ found near the lake Baikal, has been called Baikalite.

Werner divides _augite_ into four sub-species; granular, foliated, conchoidal, and common; and there is a variety called slaggy _augite_
