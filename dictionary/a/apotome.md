# Apotome

**APOT'OME**,

APOT'OMY, _noun_ \[Gr. to cut off.\]

**1.** In mathematics, the difference between two incommensurable quantities.

**2.** In music, that portion of a tone major which remains after deducting from it an interval, less by a comma, than a semitone major.

The difference between a greater and lesser semitone, expressed by the ratio 128; 125. The Greeks supposing the greater tone could not be divided into two equal parts, called the difference, or smaller part, apotome; the other, limma.
