# Armor

**'ARMOR**, _noun_ \[from arm.\]

**1.** Defensive arms; any habit worn to protect the body in battle; formerly called harness. A complete _armor_ formerly consisted of a casque or helmet, a gorget, cuirass, gauntlets, tasses, brassets, crushes, and covers for the legs to which the spurs were fastened.

In English statutes, _armor_ is used for the whole apparatus of war; including offensive as well as defensive arms. The statutes of _armor_ directed what arms every man should provide, 27. Hen. II. and of Westminster. Hence _armor_ includes all instruments of war.
