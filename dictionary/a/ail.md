# Ail

**AIL**, _verb transitive_

To trouble; to affect with uneasiness, either of body or mind; used to express some uneasiness or affection, whose cause is unknown; as, what ails the man? I know not what ails him.

What aileth thee, Hagar? [[Genesis 21#17|Genesis 21:17]].

It is never used to express a specific disease. We never say, he ails a pleurisy; but it is unusual to say, he ails something; he ails nothing; nothing ails him.

**AIL**, _noun_ Indisposition, or morbid affection.
