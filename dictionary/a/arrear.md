# Arrear

**ARRE'AR**, _adverb_ \[Latin ad and retro.\]

Behind; at the hinder part. In this sense obsolete. But from this use, we retain the word as a noun in the phrase, in _arrear_ to signify behind in payment.

**ARRE'AR**, _noun_ That which is behind in payment, or which remains unpaid, though due. It is generally used in the plural, as the arrears of rent, wages and taxes; and supposes a part of the money already paid.
