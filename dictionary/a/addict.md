# Addict

**ADDICT**', _adjective_ Addicted. \[Not much used.\]

**ADDICT'**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin addico, to devote, from ad and dico, to dedicate.\]

To apply one's self habitually; to devote time and attention by customary or constant practice; sometimes in a good sense.

They have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints. [[1 Corinthians 16#15|1 Corinthians 16:15]].

More usually, in a bad sense, to follow customarily, or devote, by habitually practicing that which is ill; as, a man is addicted to intemperance.

To _addict_ one's self to a person, a sense borrowed from the Romans, who used the word for assigning debtors in service to their creditors, is found in Ben Jonson, but is not legitimate in English.
