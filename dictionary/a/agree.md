# Agree

**AGREE**', _verb intransitive_ \[Latin gratia. the primary sense is advancing, from the same root as Latin gradior.\]

**1.** To be of one mind; to harmonize in opinion.

**2.** To live in concord, or without contention; as, parents and children _agree_ well together.

**3.** To yield assent; to approve or admit; followed by to; as, to _agree_ to an offer, or to an opinion.

**4.** To settle by stipulation, the minds of parties being agreed, as to the terms; as,

**5.** To come to a compromise of differences; to be reconciled.

**AGREE** with thy adversary quickly. [[Matthew 5#25|Matthew 5:25]]

**6.** To come to one opinion or mind; to concur; as, to _agree_ on a place of meeting.

This sense differs not essentially from the fourth, and it often implies a resolving to do an act. [[John 9#22|John 9:22]].

**7.** To be consistent; to harmonize; not to contradict, or be repugnant.

Their witness agreed not together. [[Mark 14#56|Mark 14:56]].

**AGREE'**, _verb transitive_ To admit, or come to one mind concerning; as, to _agree_ the fact. Also, to reconcile or make friends; to put an end to variance; but these senses are unusual and hardly legitimate. Let the parties _agree_ the fact, is really elliptical; let them _agree_ on the fact.
