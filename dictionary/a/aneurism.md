# Aneurism

**AN'EURISM**, _noun_ \[Gr. to dilate, from broad.\]

A preternatural dilatation or rupture of the coats of an artery. This is encysted or diffused. The encysted _aneurism_ is when the coats of the artery being only dilated, the blood is confined to its proper coat. Of this kind is the varicose. The diffused _aneurism_ includes all those in which, from an aperture in the artery, the blood is spread about in the cellular membrane, out of its proper course.
