# Attraction

**ATTRAC'TION**, _noun_

**1.** The power in bodies which is supposed to draw them together; or the tendency or principle which inclines them to unite or cohere; called by Copernicus, appetence.

This power, principle or tendency in bodies to unite, is distinguished by philosophers into _attraction_ of gravity or gravitation, which extends to a sensible distance, such as the tendency of the planets to the sun, or of a stone, when raised in the air, to fall to the earth, and of which kind is the _attraction_ of magnetism, and of electricity; and into _attraction_ of cohesion, or that tendency which is manifested between small particles of matter, at insensible distances, or near the point of contact, to unite them in coherence.

The _attraction_ of gravity is supposed to be the great principle which confines the planets in their orbits. Its power or force is directly as the quantity of matter in a body, and inversely as the square of the distances of the attracting bodies.

**2.** The act of attracting; the effect of the principle of _attraction_

Attraction may be performed by impulse or other means.

**3.** The power or act of alluring, drawing to, inviting or engaging; as the _attraction_ of beauty or eloquence.

Contiguous _attraction_ is that which is exerted between minute particles or atoms, at insensible distances. When this principle unites particles of the same kind, it is called affinity of aggregation, cohesive affinity or cohesion. When it operates on dissimilar particles, producing union, it is distinguished as heterogeneous, and called chimical _attraction_ or affinity.

Elective _attraction_ in chemistry, is otherwise called affinity. It is that power in substances, which elects or selects from a mixture those elements with which they have the strongest tendency to combine.
