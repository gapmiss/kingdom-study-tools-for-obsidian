# Ape

**APE**, _noun_

**1.** A genus of quadrupeds, found in the torrid zone of both continents, of a great variety of species. In common use, the word extends to all the tribe of monkeys and baboons; but in zoology, _ape_ is limited to such of these animals as have no tails; while those with short tails are called baboons, and those with long ones, monkeys. These animals have four cutting teeth in each jaw, and two canine teeth, with obtuse grinders. The feet are formed like hands, with four fingers and a thumb, and flat nails. Apes are lively, full of frolic and chatter, generally untamable, thieving and mischievous. They inhabit the forests, and live on fruits, leaves and insects.

**2.** One who imitates servilely, in allusion to the manners of the ape; a silly fellow.

**APE**, _verb transitive_ To imitate servilely; to mimic, as an _ape_ imitates human actions. Weak persons are always prone to _ape_ foreigners.
