# A

**A** is the first letter of the Alphabet in most of the known languages of the earth; in the Ethiopic, however it is the thirteenth, and in the Runic the tenth. It is naturally the first letter, because it represents the first vocal sound naturally formed by the human organs; being the sound uttered with _a_ mere opening of the mouth without constraint, and without any effort to alter the natural position or configuration of the lips. The _a_ has been proven to be the first natural vocal sound, and entitled to the first place in alphabets.

**A** has in English, three sounds; the long or slender, as in place, fate; the broad, as in wall, fall, which is shortened in salt, what; and the open, as in father, glass, which is shortened in rather, fancy. Its primitive sound was probably aw. _a_ is also an abbreviation used before words beginning with an articulation; as _a_ table, instead of an table, or one table. This is _a_ modern change.

This letter serves as _a_ prefix to many English words, as in asleep; awake; afoot; aground; agoing. In some cases, this is _a_ contraction of Teutonic ge, as in asleep, aware, from the Saxon geslapan, to sleep, to beware. Sometimes it is _a_ corruption of the Saxon on, as again from ongean , awake from onwacian to watch or wake. Before participles, it may be _a_ contraction of the Celtic ag, the sign of the participle of the present tense; as, ag-radh, saying; _a_ saying, _a_ going. Or this may be _a_ contraction of on, or what is equally probable, it may have proceeded from _a_ mere accidental sound produced by negligent utterance. In some words, _a_ may be _a_ contraction of at, of, in, to, or an. In some words of Greek original, _a_ is privative, giving to them _a_ negative sense, as in anonymous.

**A**mong the ancients, **A** was _a_ numeral denoting 500, and with _a_ dash _a_ 5000. In the Julian Calendar, _a_ is the first of the seven dominical letters.

**A**mong logicians, **A**, as an abbreviation, stands for _a_ universal affirmative proposition. _a_ asserts; E denies. Thus in barbara, _a_ thrice repeated denotes so many of the propositions to be universal.

The Romans used **A** to signify _a_ negative or dissent in giving their votes; _a_ standing for antiquo, I oppose or object to the proposed law. Opposed to this letter were U R, uti rogas, be it as you desire - the words used to express assent to _a_ proposition. These letters were marked on wooden ballots, and each voter had an affirmative and _a_ negative put into his hands, one of which at pleasure he gave as his vote, - In criminal trials, _a_ stood for absolvo, I acquit, C for condemno, I condemn; and N L for non liquet, it is not evident; and the judges voted by ballots this marked. In inscriptions, **A** stands for Augustus; or for ager, aiunt, , aurum, argentum, etc.

**A** is also used for anno, or ante; as in Anno Domini, the year of our Lord; anno mundi, the year of the world; ante meridiem, before noon, and for arts, in artium magister, master of arts.

In algebra, **a** and first letters of the alphabet represent known quantities - the last letters are sometimes used to represent unknown quantities.

In music, **A** is the nominal of the sixth note in the natural diatonic scale - called by Guido la. It is also the name of one of the two natural moods; and it is the open note of the 2d string of the violin, by which the other strings are tuned and regulated.

In mathematics, letters are used as representatives of numbers, lines, angles and quantities.
