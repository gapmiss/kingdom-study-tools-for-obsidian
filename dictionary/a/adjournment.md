# Adjournment

**ADJOURN'MENT**, _noun_

**1.** The act of adjourning; as, in legislatures, the _adjournment_ of one house is not an _adjournment_ of the other.

**2.** The putting off till another day or time specified, or without day; that is, the closing of a session of a public or official body.

**3.** The time or interval during which a public body defers business; as, during an _adjournment_ but a suspension of business, between the forming of a house and an _adjournment_ for refreshment, is all a recess. In Great Britain, the close of a session of parliament is called a prorogation; as the close of a parliament is a dissolution. But in Great Britain, as well as in the United States, _adjournment_ is now used for an intermission of business, for any indefinite time; as, an _adjournment_ of parliament for six weeks.
