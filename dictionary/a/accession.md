**ACCESS'ION**, _noun_ \[Latin accessio.\]

**1.** A coming to; an acceding to and joining; as a king's _accession_ to a confederacy.

**2.** Increase by something added; that which is added; augmentation; as an _accession_ of wealth or territory.

**3.** In law, a mode of acquiring property, by which the owner of a corporeal substance, which receives an addition by growth, or by labor, has a right to the thing added or the improvement; provided the thing is not changed into a different species. Thus the owner of a cow becomes the owner of her calf.

**4.** The act of arriving at a throne, an office, or dignity.

The only _accession_ which the Roman Empire received, was the province of Britain.
