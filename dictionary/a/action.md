Actions are also civil or penal; civil, when instituted solely in behalf of private persons, to recover debts or damages; penal, when instituted to recover a penalty, imposed by way of punishment. The word is also used for a right of action; as, the law gives an _action_ for every claim.

A chose in _action_ is a right to a thing, in opposition to the possession. A bond or note is a chose in _action_ and gives the owner a right to prosecute his claim to the money, as he has an absolute property in a right, as well as in a thing, in possession.

In many cases _action_ and act are synonymous; but some distinction between them is observable. _action_ seems to have more relation to the power that acts, and its operation and process of acting; and act, more relation to the effect or operation complete. _action_ is also more generally used for ordinary transactions; and act, for such as are remarkable, or dignified; as, all our actions should be regulated by prudence; a prince is distinguished by acts of heroism or humanity.
