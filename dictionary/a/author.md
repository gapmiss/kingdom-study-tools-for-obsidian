# Author

**AU'THOR**, _noun_ \[Latin auctor. The Latin word is from the root of augeo, to increase, or cause to enlarge. The primary sense is one who brings or causes to come forth.\]

**1.** One who produces, creates, or brings into being; as, God is the _author_ of the Universe.

**2.** The beginner, former, or first mover of any thing; hence, the efficient cause of a thing. It is appropriately applied to one who composes or writes a book, or original work, and in a more general sense, to one whose occupation is to compose and write books; opposed to compiler or translator.

**AU'THOR**, _verb transitive_ To occasion; to effect. \[Not used.\]
