# Arpent

**'ARPENT**, _noun_

In Domesday, it is written arpennus, arpendus, and _arpent_ Columella mentions that the arepennis was equal to half the Roman juger. The word is supposed to be corrupted from arvipendium, or aripennium, the measuring of land with a cord.

A portion of land in France, ordinarily containing one hundred square rods or perches, each of 18 feet. But the _arpent_ is different in different parts of France. The _arpent_ of Paris contains 900 square toises. It is less than the English acre, by about one seventh.
