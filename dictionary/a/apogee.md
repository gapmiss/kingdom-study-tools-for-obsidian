# Apogee

**AP'OGEE**, _noun_ \[apogeon, apogeum; Gr. from, and the earth.\]

That point in the orbit of a a planet, which is at the greatest distance from the earth. The ancients regarded the earth as fixed in the center of the system, and therefore assigned to the sun, with the planets, an apogee; but the moderns, considering the sun as the center, use the terms perihelion and aphelion, to denote the least and greatest distance of the planets from that orb. The sun's _apogee_ therefore is in strictness, the earth's aphelion. _apogee_ is properly applicable to the moon.
