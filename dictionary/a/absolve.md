# Absolve

**ABSOLVE**', _verb transitive_ abzolv', \[Latin absolvo, from ab and solvo, to loose or release; to _absolve_ to finish; Heb. to loose or loosen. See [[Solve]].\]

To set free or release from some obligation, debt or responsibility; or from that which subjects a person to a burden or penalty; as to _absolve_ a person from a promise; to _absolve_ an offender, which amounts to an acquittal and remission of his punishment. Hence, in the civil law, the word was used for acquit; and in the canon law, for forgive, or a sentence of

remission. In ordinary language, its sense is to set free or release from an engagement. Formerly, good writers used the word in the sense of finish, accomplish; as to _absolve_ work, in Milton; but in this sense, it seems to be obsolete.
