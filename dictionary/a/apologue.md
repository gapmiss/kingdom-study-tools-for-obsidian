# Apologue

**AP'OLOGUE**, _noun_ ap'olog. \[Gr. a long speech, a fable.\]

A moral fable; a story or relation of fictitious events, intended to convey useful truths. An _apologue_ differs from a parable in this; the parable is drawn from events which pass among mankind, and is therefore supported by probability; an _apologue_ may be founded on supposed actions of brutes or inanimate things, and therefore does not require to be supported by probability. Esop's fables are good examples of apologues.
