# Acoustics

**ACOUS'TICS**, _noun_

**1.** The science of sounds, teaching their cause, nature and phenomena. This science is, by some writers, divided into diacoustics, which explains the properties of sounds coming directly from the sonorous body to the ear; and catacoustics, which treats of reflected sounds. But the distinction is considered of little real utility.

**2.** In medicine, this term is sometimes used for remedies for deafness, or imperfect hearing.
