# Auditor

**AUD'ITOR**, \[Latin\]

**1.** A hearer; one who attends to hear a discourse.

**2.** A person appointed and authorized to examine an account or accounts, compare the charges with the vouchers, examine the parties and witnesses, allow or reject charges, and state the balance. It is usual with courts to refer accounts, on which an action is brought, to auditors for adjustment, and their report, if received, is the basis of the judgment.

In England, there are officers who are auditors of courts; as the auditors of the Exchequer, of the receipts, etc.
