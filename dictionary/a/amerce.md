# Amerce

**AMERCE**, _verb transitive_ amers'. \[A verb formed from a for on or at, from Latin merces, reward.\]

**1.** To inflict a penalty at mercy; to punish by a pecuniary penalty, the amount of which is not fixed by law, but left to the discretion or mercy of the court; as, the court amerced the criminal in the sum of one hundred dollars.

**2.** To inflict a pecuniary penalty; to punish in general. Milton uses of after amerce; 'Millions of spirits amerced of heaven; ' but this use seems to be a poetic license.
