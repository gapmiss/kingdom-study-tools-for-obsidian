# Articulate

**ARTIC'ULATE**, _adjective_ \[Latin articulatus, jointed, distinct.\]

**1.** Formed by jointing or articulation of the organs of speech; applied to sound. An _articulate_ sound is made by closing and opening the organs of speech. The junction or closing of the organs forms a joint or articulation, as in the syllables ab, ad, ap; in passing from one articulation to another, the organs are, or may be opened, and a vowel is uttered, as in attune; and the different articulations, with the intervening vocal sounds, from what is called _articulate_ sounds; sounds distinct, separate, and modified by articulation or jointing. This articulation constitutes the prominent difference between the human voice and that of brutes. Brutes open the mouth and make vocal sounds, but have either not at all, or very imperfectly, the power of articulation.

**2.** Expressed in articles, or in separate particulars. \[Not used.\]

**3.** Jointed; formed with joints.
