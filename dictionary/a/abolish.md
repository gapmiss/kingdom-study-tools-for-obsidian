# Abolish

**ABOL'ISH**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin abolco; from ab and oleo, olesco, to grow.\]

**1.** To make void; to annul; to abrogate; applied chiefly and appropriately to established laws, contracts, rites, customs and institutions - as to _abolish_ laws by a repeal, actual or virtual.

**2.** To destroy, or put an end to; as to _abolish_ idols. [[Isaiah 2#18|Isaiah 2:18]]. To _abolish_ death [[2 Timothy 1#10|2 Timothy 1:10]]. This sense is not common. To _abolish_ posterity, in the translation of Pausanias, Lib. 3. Ca 6, is hardly allowable.
