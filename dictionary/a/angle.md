# Angle

**AN'GLE**, _noun_ \[Latin angulus, a corner. Gr.\]

In popular language, the point where two lines meet, or the meeting of two lines in a point; a corner.

In geometry, the space comprised between two straight lines that meet in a point, or between two straight converging lines which, if extended, would meet; or the quantity by which two straight lines, departing from a point, diverge from each other. The point of meeting is the vertex of the _angle_ and the lines, containing the _angle_ are its sides or legs.

In optics, the _angle_ of incidence is the _angle_ which a ray of light makes with a perpendicular to the surface, or to that point of the surface on which it falls.

The _angle_ of refraction is the _angle_ which a ray of light refracted makes with the surface of the refracting medium; or rather with a perpendicular to that point of the surface on which it falls.

A right _angle_ is one formed by a right line falling on another perpendicularly, or an _angle_ of 90 degrees, making the quarter of a circle.

An obtuse _angle_ is greater than a right _angle_ or more than 90 degrees.

A rectilineal or right-lined _angle_ is formed by two right lines.

A curvilineal _angle_ is formed by two curved lines.

A mixed _angle_ is formed by a right line with a curved line.

Adjacent or contiguous angles are such as have one leg common to both angles, and both together are equal to two right angles.

External angles are angles of any right-lined figure without it, when the sides are produced or lengthened.

Internal angles are those which are within any right-lined figure.

Oblique angles are either acute or obtuse, in opposition to right angles.

A solid _angle_ is the meeting of three or more plain angles at one point.

A spherical _angle_ is one made by the meeting of two arches of great circles, which mutually cut one another on the surface of the globe or sphere.

**AN'GLE**, _noun_ A hook; an instrument to take fish, consisting of a rod, a line and a hook, or a line and hook.

**1.** To fish with an _angle_ or with line and hook.
