**AB'STINENCE**, _noun_ \[Latin abstinentia. See [[Abstain]].\]

**1.** In general, the act or practice of voluntarily refraining from, or forbearing any action. 'Abstinence from every thing which can be deemed labor.

More appropriately,

**2.** The refraining from an indulgence of appetite, or from customary gratifications of animal propensities. It denotes a total forbearance, as in fasting, or a forbearance of the usual quantity. In the latter sense, it may coincide with temperance, but in general, it denotes a more sparing use of enjoyments than temperance. Besides, _abstinence_ implies previous free indulgence; temperance does not.
