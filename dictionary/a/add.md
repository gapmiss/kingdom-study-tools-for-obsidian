# Add

**ADD**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin addo, from ad and do, to give.\]

**1.** To set or put together, join or unite, as one thing or sum to another, in an agreegate; as, _add_ three to four, the sum is seven.

**2.** To unite in idea or consideration; to subjoin.

To what has been alledged, let this argument be added.

**3.** To increase number.

Thou shalt _add_ three cities more of refuge. [[Deuteronomy 19#9|Deuteronomy 19:9]].

**4.** To augment.

Rehoboam said, I will _add_ to your yoke. [[1 Kings 12#11|1 Kings 12:11]].

Ye shall not _add_ to the word which I command you. [[Deuteronomy 4#2|Deuteronomy 4:2]].

As here used, the verb is intransitive, but there may be an ellipsis.

To _add_ to, is used in scripture, as equivalent to give, or bestow upon. [[Genesis 30#24|Genesis 30:24]], [[Matthew 6#27|Matthew 6:27]]. In [[Galatians 2#6|Galatians 2:6]], the word is understood to signify instruction. 'In conference they added nothing to me.' In narration, he or they added, is elliptical; he added words, or what follows, or he continued his discourse.

In general, when used of things, _add_ implies a principal thing, to which a smaller is to be annexed, as a part of the whole sum, mass, or number.
