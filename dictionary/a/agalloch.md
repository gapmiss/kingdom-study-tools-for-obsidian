**AG'ALLOCH**,

AGAL'LOCHUM, _noun_ \[Of oriental origin.\]

Aloes-wood, the product of a tree growing in China, and some of the Indian isles. There are three varieties, the calambac, the common lignum aloes, and the calambour. The first variety is light and porous, and so filled with a fragrant resin, that it may be molded by the fingers; the second is denser and less resinous; and the third is the aloes-wood used by cabinet makers and inlayers.
