To _anoint_ the head with oil, [[Psalms 23#5|Psalms 23:5]]. seems to signify to communicate the consolations of the Holy Spirit.

The use of oil in consecrations, was of high antiquity. Kings, prophets and priests were set apart or consecrated to their offices by the use of oil. Hence the peculiar application of the term anointed to Jesus Christ.
