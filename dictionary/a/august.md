# August

**AUGUST**', _adjective_ \[Latin augustus. The first syllable of this word is probably from the root of augeo, or of awe.\]

Grand; magnificent; majestic; impressing awe; inspiring reverence.

The Trojan chief appeared, _august_ in visage.

It is related that this epithet was first conferred by the Roman senate upon Octavius, after confirming him in the sovereign power.

**AU'GUST**, _noun_ The eighth month of the year, containing thirty-one days. The old Roman name was Sextilis, the sixth month from March, the month in which the primitive Romans, as well as Jews, began the year. The name was changed to _august_ in honor of the Emperor Octavius Augustus, on account of his victories, and his entering on his first consulate in that month.
