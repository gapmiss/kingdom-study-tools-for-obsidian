# Appetite

**AP'PETITE**, _noun_ \[Latin appetitus, from appeto. See [[Appetence]].\]

**1.** The natural desire of pleasure or good; the desire of gratification, either of the body or of the mind. Appetites are passions directed to general objects, as the _appetite_ for fame, glory or riches; in distinction from passions directed to some particular objects, which retain their proper name, as the passion of love, envy or gratitude. Passion does not exist without an object; natural appetites exist first, and are then directed to objects.

**2.** A desire of food or drink; a painful sensation occasioned by hunger or thirst.

**3.** Strong desire; eagerness or longing.

**4.** The thing desired.

Power being the natural _appetite_ of princes.

Appetites are natural or artificial. Hunger and thirst are natural appetites; the appetites for olives, tobacco, snuff, etc. are artificial.

In old authors, _appetite_ is followed by to, but regularly it should be followed by for before the object, as an _appetite_ for pleasure.

To be given to _appetite_ is to be voracious or gluttonous. [[Proverbs 23#2|Proverbs 23:2]].
