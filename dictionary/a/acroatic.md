# Acroatic

**ACROAT'IC**, _adjective_ \[Gr.\]

Abstruse; pertaining to deep learning; and opposed to exoteric. Aristotle's lectures were of two kinds, _acroatic_ acroamatic, or esoteric, which were delivered to a class of select disciples, who had been previously instructed in the elements of learning; and exoteric, which were delivered in public. The former respected being, God, and nature; the principal subjects of the latter were logic, rhetoric, and policy. The abstruse lectures were called acroatics.
