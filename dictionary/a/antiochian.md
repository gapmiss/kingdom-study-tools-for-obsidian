# Antiochian

**ANTIO'CHIAN**, _adjective_ Pertaining to Antiochus, the founder of a sect of philosophers, contemporary with Cicero. This sect was a branch of the academics, though Antiochus was a stoic. He attempted to reconcile the doctrines of the different schools, and was the last preceptor of the Platonic school.

The _antiochian_ epoch was a method of computing time, from the proclamation of liberty granted to the city of Antioch, about the time of the battle of Pharsalia.
