# Alkoran

**AL'KORAN**, _noun_

The book which contains the Mohammedan doctrines of faith and practice. It was written by Mohammed, in the dialect of the Koreish, which is the purest Arabic; but the Arabian language has suffered such changes, since it was written, that the language of the _alkoran_ is not now intelligible to the Arabians themselves, without being learned like other dead languages.
