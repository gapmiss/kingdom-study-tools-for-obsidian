# As

**AS**, _adverb_ az. \[Gr. But more probably the English word is contracted from als.\]

**1.** Literally, like; even; similar. 'Ye shall be _as_ Gods, knowing good and evil.' 'As far _as_ we can see, ' that is, like far, equally far. Hence it may be explained by in like manner; _as_ do _as_ you are commanded.

**2.** It was formerly used where we now use that. _obsolete_

The relations are so uncertain _as_ they require a great deal of examination.

**3.** It was formerly used where we now use that. _obsolete_

He lies, _as_ he his bliss did know.

**4.** While; during; at the same time. 'He trembled _as_ he spoke.' But in most of its uses, it is resolvable into like, equal, even, or equally, in like manner. In some phrases, it must be considered a nominative word, or other words must be supplied. 'Appoint to office such men _as_ deserve public confidence.' This phrase may be elliptical for 'such men _as_ those who deserve public confidence.'

**AS** seems, in some cases, to imply the sense of proportion. 'In general, men are more happy, _as_ they are less involved in public concerns.'

**AS**, in a subsequent part of a sentence, answers to such; give us such things _as_ you please; and in a preceding part of a sentence, has so to answer to it; _as_ with the people, so with the priest.

**AS**, _noun_ \[Latin\]

**1.** A Roman weight of 12 ounces, answering to the libra or pound.

**2.** A Roman coin, originally of a pound weight; but reduced, after the first Punic war, to two ounces; in the second Punic war, to one ounce; and by the Papirian law, to half an ounce. It was originally stamped with the figure of a sheep, sow, or ox; and afterwards with a Janus, on one side, and on the reverse, a rostrum or prow of a ship.

**3.** An integer; a whole or single thing. Hence the English ace. Hence the Romans used the word for the whole inheritance; haeres ex asse, an heir to the whole estate.
