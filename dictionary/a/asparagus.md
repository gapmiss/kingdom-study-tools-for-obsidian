# Asparagus

**ASPAR'AGUS**, _noun_ \[Latin and Gr. probably from to tear, from its lacerated appearance, or from the root of a spire, from its stem.\]

Asparagus, sperage, vulgarly, sparrow-grass; a genus of plants. That which is cultivated in gardens, has an upright herbaceous stalk, bristly leaves, and equal stipulas. The roots have a bitterish mucilaginous taste; and the stalk is, in some degree, aperient and deobstruent, but not very efficacious.
