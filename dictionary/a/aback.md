# Aback

**ABACK**, _adverb_ \[At, on or towards the back. See [[Back]]\]

Towards the back; on the back part; backward. In seamen's language it signifies the situation of the sails, when pressed back against the mast by the wind.

Taken _aback_ is when the sails are carried back suddenly by the wind.

Laid _aback_ is when the sails are purposely placed in that situation to give the ship sternway.
