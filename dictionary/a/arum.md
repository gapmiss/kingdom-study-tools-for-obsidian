# Arum

**A'RUM**, _noun_ \[Latin See [[aurate]].\] Gold.

Aurum fulminans, fulminating gold, is gold dissolved in aqua-regia or nitro-muriatic acid, and precipitated by volatile alkali. This precipitate is of a brown yellow, or orange color, and when exposed to a moderate heat, detonizes with considerable noise. It is a compound of the oxyd of gold and ammonia.

Aurum mosaicum, or musivum, a sparkling gold-colored substance, from an amalgam of quick-silver and tin, mixed with sulphur and sal ammoniac, set to sublime. The mercury and part of the sulphur unite into a cinnabar, which sublimes with the salammoniac, and leaves the aurum mosaicum at the bottom. It is a sulphuret of tin, and is used as a pigment.
