# Allure

**ALLU'RE**, _verb transitive_

To attempt to draw to; to tempt by the offer of some good, real or apparent; to invite by something flattering or acceptable; as, rewards _allure_ men to brave danger. Sometimes used in a bad sense, to _allure_ to evil; but in this sense entice is more common. In [[Hosea 2#14|Hosea 2:14]], _allure_ is used in its genuine sense; [[2 Peter 2#18|2 Peter 2:18]], in the sense of entice.
