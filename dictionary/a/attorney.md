# Attorney

**ATTORN'EY**, _noun_ _plural_ attorneys.

One who is appointed or admitted in the place of another, to manage his matters in law. The word formerly signified any person who did business for another; but its sense is now chiefly or wholly restricted to persons who act as substitutes for the persons concerned, in prosecuting and defending actions before courts of justice, or in transacting other business in which legal rights are involved. The word answers to the procurator, (proctor, ) of the civilians.

Attorneys are not admitted to practice in courts until examined, approved, licensed and sworn, by direction of some court; after which they are proper officers of the court.

In G. Britain, and in some of the United States, attorneys are not permitted to be advocates or counsel in the higher courts; this privilege being confined to counsellors and sergeants. In other states, there is no distinction of rank, and attorneys practice in all the courts. And in general sense, the word _attorney_ comprehends counsellors, barristers and serjeants.

In Virginia, the duties of _attorney_ counsellor, conveyancer and advocate, are all performed by the same individual.

An _attorney_ may have general powers to transact business for another; or his powers may be special, or limited to a particular act or acts.

Attorney General is an officer appointed to manage business for the king, the state or public; and his duty, in particular, is to prosecute persons guilty of crimes.

A letter or warrant of _attorney_ is a written authority from one person empowering another to transact business for him.
