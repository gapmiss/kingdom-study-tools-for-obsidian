# Amphora

AM'PHOR, or AM'PHORA, _noun_ \[Latin amphora; Gr.\]

Among the Greeks and Romans, a liquid measure. The AMPHORA of the Romans contained about forty-eight sextaries, equal to seven gallons and a pint, English wine measure. The Grecian or Attic amphor contained about a third more. This was also, among the Romans, a dry measure of about three bushels. Among the Venetians, it is a liquid measure of sixteen quarts.

This name was formerly used in England; but the capacity of the Sax. ambra is not certainly known.
