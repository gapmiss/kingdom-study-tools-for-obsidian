Thus if a quantity of sugar, worth eight cents the pound, and another quantity worth ten cents, are mixed, the question to be solved by _alligation_ is, what is the value of the mixture by the pound. _alligation_ is of two kinds, medial and alternate; medial, when the rate of a mixture is sought from the rates and quantities of the simples; alternate, when the quantities of the simples are sought from the rates of the simples, and the rate of the mixture.
