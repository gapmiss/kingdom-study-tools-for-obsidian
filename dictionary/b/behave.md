# Behave

**BEHA'VE**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To restrain; to govern; to subdue.

He did _behave_ his anger e'er 'twas spent.

This sense is obsolete. Yet it often seems to be implied; for to _behave_ one's self, is really, to govern one's self; to have in command.

**2.** To carry; to conduct; used with the reciprocal pronoun; as, he behaves himself manfully. But the tendency of modern usage is to omit the pronoun; as, he behaves well.

**BEHA'VE**, _verb intransitive_ To act; to conduct; generally applied to manners, or to conduct in any particular business; and in a good or bad sense. He behaves well or will.
