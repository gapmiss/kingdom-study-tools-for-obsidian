# Barbel

**B'ARBEL**, _noun_ \[Latin barba.\]

**1.** A fish of the genus Cyprinus, of the order of abdominals. The mouth is toothless; the gill has three rays; the body is smooth and white. This fish is about three feet long, and weighs 18 pounds. It is a very coarse fish, living in deep still rivers and rooting like swine in the soft banks. Its dorsal fin is armed with a strong spine, sharply serrated, from which circumstance it probably received its name.

**2.** A knot of superfluous flesh, growing in the channels of a horse's mouth; written also barble, or barb.
