# Be

**BE**, _verb intransitive_ substantive, _participle present tense_ being; _participle passive_ been.\[The sense is to stand, remain or _be_ fixed; hence to continue. This verb is defective, and its defects are supplied by verbs from other roots, as, is, was, were, which have no radical connection with _be_ The case is the same with the substantive verb in most languages.\]

**1.** To _be_ fixed; to exist; to have a real state or existence, for a longer or shorter time.

Let this mind _be_ in you, which was in Christ Jesus. [[Philippians 2#1|Philippians 2:1]].

To _be_ contents his natural desire.

**2.** To _be_ made to be; to become.

And they twain shall _be_ one flesh. [[Matthew 19|Matthew 19]]. [[Jeremiah 32#4|Jeremiah 32:4]].

**3.** To remain. Let the garment _be_ as it was made.

**4.** To _be_ present in a place. Where was I at the time? When will you _be_ at my house?

**5.** To have a particular manner of being or happening; as, how is this affair? how was it? what were the circumstances?

This verb is used as an auxiliary in forming the tenses of other verbs, and particularly in giving them the passive form; as, he has been disturbed. It forms, with the infinitive, a particular future tense, which often expresses duty, necessity or purpose; as, government is to _be_ supported; we are to pay our just debts.

Let _be_ is to omit, or leave untouched; to let alone.

Let _be_ said he, my prey.

**BE**, a prefix, as in because, before, beset, bedeck, is the same word as by. It is common to the English, Saxon, Gothic, German, Dutch, Danish and Swedish languages. It occurs probably in the Russian, but is written po, as it is in possideo and a few other words in the Latin. It denotes nearness, closeness, about, or, at, from some root signifying to pass or to press. \[See [[By]].\]

That this word is the Shemitic, used as a prefix, is certain, not only from its general applications, which may _be_ seen by comparing the uses of the word, in the Heb. for instance, with those in the Saxon; but from its use in particular phrases, particularly in its use before the name of the Supreme being in swearing.
