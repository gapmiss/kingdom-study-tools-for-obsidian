In scripture, the term _brother_ is applied to a kinsman by blood more remote that a son of the same parents; as in the case of Abraham and Lot, Jacob and Laban. Persons of the same profession call each other _brother_ as judges, clergymen, professors of religion, members of societies united in a common cause, monks and the like.
