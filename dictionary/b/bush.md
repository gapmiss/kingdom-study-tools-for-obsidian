# Bush

**BUSH**, _noun_ \[Latin pasco, originally, to feed on sprouts.\]

**1.** A shrub with branches; a thick shrub; also, a cluster of shrubs. With hunters, a fox tail.

**2.** An assemblage of branches interwoven.

**3.** A branch of a tree fixed or hung out as a tavern sign. Hence, since the branch has been discontinued, a coronated frame of wood hung out as a tavern sign, is so called. Hence the English proverb, 'Good wine needs no _bush_ '

\[I know not that this word is thus used in the U. States.\]

**4.** A circle of metal let into the sheaves of such blocks as have iron pins, to prevent their wearing.

This word when applied to sheaves is called _bush_ but when applied to the circular iron of a cart wheel is, in America, called a box.

**BUSH**, _verb intransitive_ To grow thick or bushy.

**BUSH**, _verb transitive_ To furnish a block with a _bush_
