# Behoove

**BEHOOVE**, _verb transitive_ behoof'. To be necessary for; to be fit for; to be meet for, with respect to necessity, duty, or convenience.

And thus it behooved Christ to suffer. [[Luke 24#1|Luke 24:1]].

It may perhaps be used intransitively; as, let him behave as it behooveth; but I believe such use is rare.
