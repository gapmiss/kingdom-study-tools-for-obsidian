# Basilic

**BAS'ILIC**, _noun_ s as z. \[Latin basilica; Gr. a king.\]

Anciently, a public hall or court of judicature, where princes and magistrates sat to administer justice. It was a large hall, with aisles, porticoes, tribunes, and tribunals. The bankers also had a part allotted for their residence. These edifices, at first, were the palaces of princes, afterwards courts of justice, and finally converted into churches. Hence _basilic_ now signifies a church, chapel, cathedral, or royal palace.

**BAS'ILIC**, _noun_ \[See [[Basil]].\] The middle vein of the arm, or the interior branch of the axillary vein, so called by way of eminence.
