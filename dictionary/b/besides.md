# Besides

**BESI'DES**, _preposition_ Over and above; separate or distinct from.

And there was a famine in the land, _besides_ the first famine. [[Genesis 26#1|Genesis 26:1]].

Note. This word, though radically the same as beside, and a corruption of it, ought not to be confounded with it, for it is never used in the senses explained under beside, except in the second.
