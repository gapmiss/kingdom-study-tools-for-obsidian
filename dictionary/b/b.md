# B

**B** is the second letter, and the first articulation, or consonant, in the English, as in the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and most other alphabets. In the Ethiopic, it is the ninth letter, and its shape is that of a hut. Perhaps from this or other like figure, it received its Hebrew name, beth, a house. It is a mute and a labial, being formed by pressing the whole length of the lips together, as in pronouncing eb. It is less perfectly mute than p, as may be perceived by pronouncing the syllables ab and ap. It is convertible, 1st, with p, as in the Celtic, ben or pen, a mountain; in the English, beak and peak, beck and peck; 2d, with v, as in the German, silber for silver; and in Spanish, _b_ and v are used indifferently; 3d, with f, as in bore and perforo; Eng. bear, Latin fero; in the celtic bun, bunadh, bunait, stock, origin, foundation; English, found; Latin fundamentum; with the Gr.as Bilip; 4th, with the v and w; as, Ir.fior, Latin verus; fear, vir; Ir. buaic, the wick of a candle.

The Greek _b_ is always pronounced like the English V, and the Russian _b_ corresponds with the Greek.

In composition, the letter _b_ is changed into p before the letter p; as in opprimo, from ob and premo; oppono, from ob and pono; into f, before f, as in offero, from ob and fero; into c before c, as in occido, from ob and cado, and coedo.

As a numeral, _b_ was used by the Hebrews and Greeks, as now by the Arabians, for 2; by the Romans for 300, and with a dash over it thus _b_ for 3000. _b_ is used also as an abbreviation; thus _b_ _adjective_ stand for bachelor of arts; _b_ Latin for bachelor of laws; _b_ D. for bachelor of divinity; _b_ F. before the decrees of the old Romans, for bonum factum. In music, _b_ stands for the tone above A; for _b_ flat, or the semi-tone major above _adjective_ _b_ also stands for base, and

**B**.C. for basso continuo, or thorough base.
