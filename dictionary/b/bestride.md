# Bestride

**BESTRI'DE**, _verb transitive_ _preterit tense_ bestrid; _participle passive_ bestrid, bestridden. \[be and stride.\]

**1.** To stride over; to stand or sit with any thing between the legs, or with the legs extended across; as, to _bestride_ the world, like a colossus; to _bestride_ a horse.

**2.** To step over; as, to _bestride_ a threshold.

Bestriding sometimes includes riding, or defending, as Johnson remarks; but the particular purposes to the act, which depend on the circumstances of the case, can hardly be reduced to definition.
