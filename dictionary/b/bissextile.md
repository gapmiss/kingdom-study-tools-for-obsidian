# Bissextile

**BISSEX'TILE**, _noun_ \[Latin bissextilis, leap year, from bissextus, \[bis and sextus\] the sixth of the calends of March, or twenty-fourth day of February, which was reckoned twice every fourth year, by the interrelation of a day.\]

Leap year; every fourth year, in which a day is added to the month of February, on account of the excess of 6 hours, which the

civil year contains, above 365 days. This excess is 11 minutes 3 seconds too much; that is, it exceeds the real year, or annual revolution of the earth. Hence at the end of every century, divisible by 4, it is necessary to retain the _bissextile_ day, and to suppress it at the end of those centuries which are not divisible by 4.

**BISSEX'TILE**, _adjective_ Pertaining to the leap year.
