# Broom

**BROOM**,_noun_

**1.** A plant of several species, called dyer's weed, being used by dyers to give a yellow color, dyer's _broom_ green wood, or wood waxen, dwarf _broom_ all belonging to the genus Genista. _broom_ rape is Orobanche, and with large purple flowers, Lathroea.

Spanish _broom_ is a species of Spartium, and Butcher's _broom_ is the Ruscus.

**2.** A besom, or brush with a long handle for sweeping floors; so called from being originally made of the broom-plant. In America, brooms are made of the tops of broom-corn, or of some species of wood splintered, chiefly ash. The latter species of _broom_ is furnished by the natives of the country. The original _broom_ made of shrubs or twigs, is still used in stables.
