# Bass

**B'ASS**, _noun_ \[It has no plural.\] The name of several species of fish. In England, this name is given to a species of perch, called by some the sea-wolf, from its voracity, and resembling, in a degree, the trout in shape, but having a larger head. It weighs about fifteen pounds. In the northern states of America, this name is given to a striped fish which grows to the weight of 25 or 30 pounds, and which enters the rivers; the perca ocellata.

A species of striped fish, of a darker color, with a large head, is called sea-bass, as it is never found in fresh water. This fish grows to two or three pounds weight. Both species are well tasted, but the proper _bass_ is a very white and delicious food.

**B'ASS**, _noun_ The linden, lime or tiel tree; called also bass-wood. \[See [[Bast]].\]

**2.** \[pron.bas.\] A mat to kneel on in churches.

**BASS**, _noun_ In music, the base; the deepest or gravest part of a tune. This word is thus written in imitation of the Italian basso, which is the Eng. base, low; yet with the pronunciation of base and plural bases, a gross error that ought to be corrected; as the word used in pronunciation is the English word base.

**BASS**, _verb transitive_ To sound in a deep tone.
