**BY**, _preposition_

**1.** Near; close; as, sit _by_ me; that house stands _by_ a river.

\[Latin pressus.\]

**2.** Near, in motion; as, to move, go or pass _by_ a church. But it seems, in other phrases, or with a verb in the past time, to signify past, gone beyond. 'The procession is gone by; ' 'the hour is gone by; ' 'John went _by_ ' We now use past as an equivalent word. The procession is gone past. Gone _by_ is in strictness tautology, as now used; but I apprehend _by_ signifies primarily near.

**3.** Through, or with, denoting the agent, means, instrument or cause; as, 'a city is destroyed _by_ fire; ' 'profit is made _by_ commerce; ' 'to take _by_ force.' This use answers to that of the Latin per, through, denoting a passing, acting, agency, or instrumentality.

**4.** 'Day _by_ day; ' 'year _by_ year; ' 'article _by_ article.' In these phrases, _by_ denotes passing from one to another, or each particular separately taken.

**5.** 'By the space of seven years.' In this phrase, _by_ denotes through, passing or continuing, during.

**6.** 'By this time, the sun had risen.' The word here seems to denote, at, present or come to.

**7.** According to; as, 'this appears _by_ his own account; ' 'these are good rules to live _by_ '

**8.** On; as, 'to pass _by_ land or water; ' 'great battles _by_ sea and land.' In the latter phrase, at or on might be substituted for _by_

**9.** It is placed before words denoting quantity, measure or proportion; as, to sell _by_ the pound; to work _by_ the rod or perch; this line is longer _by_ a tenth.

**10.** It is used to represent the means or instrument of swearing, or affirming; as, to swear _by_ heaven, or _by_ earth; to affirm _by_ all that is sacred.

**11.** In the phrase, 'he has a cask of wine _by_ him, ' _by_ denotes nearness or presence.

**12.** 'To sit _by_ one's self, ' is to sit alone, or without company.

**13.** 'To be present _by_ attorney.' In this phrase, _by_ denotes means or instrument; through or in the presence of a substitute.

**14.** In the phrase, 'North _by_ West, ' the sense seems to be north passing to the west, inclining or going westward, or near west.

As an adverb, _by_ denotes also nearness, or presence; as, there was no person _by_ at the time. But some noun is understood. So in the phrase, 'to pass or go _by_ ' there is a noun understood.

**BY** and _by_ is a phrase denoting nearness in time; in a short time after; presently; soon.

**BY** in lullaby, and in the nursery, a word used in lulling infants to sleep, is evidently allied to words found in many languages, signifying to rest, or be quiet, or to appease; that is, to press, to stop. \[Latin paco.\]

In the common phrase, good-bye, bye signifies passing, going. The phrase signifies, a good going, a prosperous passage, and it is precisely equivalent to farewell.

**BY** is used in many compound words, in most of which we observe the sense of nearness, closeness, or a withdrawing or seclusion.
