# Barberry

**B'ARBERRY**, _noun_ \[Latin berberis.\]

**1.** A plant of the genus berberis, common in hedges; called in England, pipperidge bush. The berries are used in housewifery, and are deemed efficacious in fluxes and fevers. The bark dyes a fine yellow, especially the bark of the root. This plant is pernicious to wheat, the ears of which will not fill, if within the effluvia of the plant; and the influence of this has been known to extend three or four hundred yards.
