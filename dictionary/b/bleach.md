# Bleach

**BLEACH**, _verb transitive_ \[Eng. bleak.\]

To whiten; to make white or whiter; to take out color; applied to many things, but particularly to cloth and thread. Bleaching is variously performed, but in general by steeping the cloth in lye, or a solution of pot or pearl ashes, and then exposing it to the solar rays.

**BLEACH**ing is now generally performed, on the large scale, by means of chlorine or the oxymuriatic acid, which has the property of whitening vegetable substances.

**BLEACH**, _verb intransitive_ To grow white in any manner.
