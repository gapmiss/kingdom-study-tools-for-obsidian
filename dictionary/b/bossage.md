# Bossage

**BOSS'AGE**, _noun_

**1.** A stone in a building which has a projecture, and is laid rough, to be afterwards carved into moldings, capitals, coats of arms, etc.

**2.** Rustic work, consisting of stones which advance beyond the naked or level of the building, by reason of indentures or channels left in the joinings; chiefly in the corners of edifices, and called rustic quoins. The cavities are sometimes round, sometimes beveled or in a diamond form, sometimes inclosed with a cavetto, and sometimes with a listel.
