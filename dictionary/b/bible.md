**BI'BLE**, _noun_ \[Gr. a book.\]

**THE BOOK**, by way of eminence; the sacred volume, in which are contained the revelations of God, the principles of Christian faith, and the rules of practice. It consists of two parts, called the Old and New Testaments.

The _bible_ should be the standard of language as well as of faith.
