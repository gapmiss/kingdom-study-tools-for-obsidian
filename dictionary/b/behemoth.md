# Behemoth

**BE'HEMOTH**, _noun_ \]Heb. a beast or brute; from an Arabic vert, which signifies, to shut, to lie hid, to be dumb. In Eth.dumb.\]

Authors are divided in opinion as to the animal intended in scripture by this name; some supposing it to be an ox, others, an elephant; and Bochart labors to prove it the hippopotamus, or river horse. The latter opinion is most probably. \[See [[Hippopotamus]].\] The original word in Arabic signifies a brute or beast in general, especially a quadruped.

First Occurrence in the Bible(KJV): [[Job 40#15|Job 40:15]]
