# Born

**BORN**, _participle passive_ of bear. baurn. Brought forth, as an animal. A very useful distinction is observed by good authors, who, in the sense of produced or brought forth, write this word born; but in the sense of carried, write it borne. This difference of orthography renders obvious the difference of pronunciation.

**1.** To be _born_ is to be produced or brought into life. 'Man is _born_ to trouble.' A man _born_ a prince or a beggar. It is followed by of, before the mother or ancestors.

Man that is _born_ of woman is of few days and full of trouble. [[Job 14#1|Job 14:1]].

**2.** To be _born_ or _born_ again, is to be regenerated and renewed; to receive spiritual life. [[John 3#3|John 3:3]].
