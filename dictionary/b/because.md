# Because

**BECAUSE**, becauz' a compound word. \[ See [[By and Cause]].\]

By cause, or by the cause; on this account; for the cause which is explained in the next proposition; for the reason next explained. Thus, I fled, _because_ I was afraid, is to be thus resolved; I fled, by the cause, for the cause, which is mentioned in the next affirmation, viz. I was afraid. Hence, cause being a noun, _because_ may be regularly followed by of.

The spirit is life, _because_ of righteousness.

**BECAUSE** of these cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
