# Bigamy

**BIG'AMY**, _noun_ \[Latin bis, twice, and Gr. to marry, marriage.\]

The crime of having two wives at once. But the term is ordinarily used as synonymous with Polygamy, and may be more justly defined, the crime of having a plurality of wives.

In the canon law, _bigamy_ was the marrying a second wife after the death of the first, or once marrying a widow. This disqualified a man for orders, and holding ecclesiastical offices.
