# Breeches

**BREECHES**, _noun_ _plural_ brich'es. \[Low Latin braccoe.\]

A garment worn by men, covering the hips and thighs. It is now a close garment; but the word formerly was used for a loose garment, now called trowsers, laxoe braccoe.

To wear the _breeches_ is, in the wife, to usurp the authority of the husband.
