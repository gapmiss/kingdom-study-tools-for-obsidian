**4.** As _balance_ signifies equal weight, or equality, it is by custom used for the weight or sum necessary to make two unequal weights or sums equal; that which is necessary to bring them to a _balance_ or equipoise.

Hence, to pay a _balance_ is to pay the difference and make the two accounts equal.

**5.** _balance_ of trade is an equal exportation of domestic productions, and importation of foreign.

**BAL'ANCE**, _verb transitive_ To adjust the weights in the scales of a _balance_ so as to bring them to an equipoise. Hence,

**2.** To weigh reasons; to compare, by estimating the relative force, importance, or value of different things; as, to _balance_ good and evil.

**3.** To regulate different powers, so as to keep them in a state of just proportion; as, to _balance_ Europe, or the powers of Europe.
