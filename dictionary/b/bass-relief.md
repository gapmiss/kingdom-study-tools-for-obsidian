# Bass-relief

**BASS-RELIE'F**, _noun_ In English, base-relief. \[See [[Lift and Relief]].\]

Sculpture, whose figures do not stand out far from the ground or plane on which they are formed. When figures do not protuberate so as to exhibit the entire body, they are said to be done in relief; and when they are low, flat or little raised from the plane,

the work is said to be in low relief. When the figures are so raised as to be well distinguished, they are said to be bold, strong, or high, alto relievo. \[See Relief.\]
