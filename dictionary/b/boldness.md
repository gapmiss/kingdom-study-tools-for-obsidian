# Boldness

**BOLDNESS**, _noun_ Courage; bravery; intrepidity; spirit; fearlessness. I cannot, with Johnson, interpret this word by fortitude or magnanimity. _boldness_ does not, I think, imply the firmness of mind, which constitutes fortitude, nor the elevation and generosity of magnanimity.

**1.** Prominence; the quality of exceeding the ordinary rules of scrupulous nicety and caution; applied to style, expression, and metaphors in language; and to figures in painting, sculpture and architecture.

**2.** Freedom from timidity; liberty.

Great is my _boldness_ of speech towards you. [[2 Corinthians 7#4|2 Corinthians 7:4]].

**3.** Confidence; confident trust.

We have _boldness_ and access with confidence. [[Ephesians 3#12|Ephesians 3:12]].

**4.** Freedom from bashfulness; assurance; confident mien.

**5.** Prominence; steepness; as the _boldness_ of the shore.

**6.** Excess of freedom, bordering on impudence.
