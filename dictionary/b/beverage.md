# Beverage

**BEV'ERAGE**, _noun_ \[Latin bibo; \] Drink; liquor for drinking. It is generally used of a mixed liquor. Nectar is called the _beverage_ of the gods.

In the middle ages, _beverage_ beveragium, or biberagium was money for drink given to an artificer of other person over and above his hire or wages. The practice has existed, to a certain extent, in American, within my memory, and I know not but it still exists in some parts of this country. A person who had a new garment, was called onto pay _beverage_ that is, to treat with liquor. Hence,

**1.** A treat on wearing a new suit of clothes, or on receiving a suit from the tailor; also a treat on first coming into prison; a garnish.

In England, water-cider, a mixture of cider and water, made by putting water into pumice before it is pressed.
