# Bottle

**BOT'TLE**, _noun_

**1.** A hollow vessel of glass, wood, leather or other material, with a narrow mouth, for holding and carrying liquors. The oriental nations use skins or leather for the conveyance of liquors; and of this kind are the bottles mentioned in scripture. 'Put new wine into bottles.' In Europe and America, glass is used for liquors of all kinds; and farmers use small cags or hollow vessels of wood. The small kinds of glass bottles are called vials or phials.

**2.** The contents of a bottle; as much as a _bottle_ contains; but from the size of bottles used for wine, porter and cyder, a _bottle_ is nearly a quart; as a _bottle_ of wine or a porter.

**3.** A quantity of hay in a bundle; a bundle of hay.

**BOT'TLE**, _verb transitive_ To put into bottles; as, to _bottle_ wine or porter. This includes the stopping of the bottles with corks.
