# Bribe

**BRIBE**, _noun_

**1.** A price, reward, gift or favor bestowed or promised with a view to pervert the judgment, or corrupt the conduct of a judge, witness or other person. A _bribe_ is a consideration given or promised to a person, to induce him to decide a cause, give testimony, or perform some act contrary to what he knows to be truth, justice or rectitude. It is not used in a good sense, unless in familiar language.

**2.** That which seduces.

Not the bribes of sordid wealth can seduce to leave these ever blooming sweets.

**BRIBE**, _verb transitive_ To give or promise a reward or consideration, with a view to pervert the judgment, or corrupt the conduct. To hire for bad purposes; to purchase the decision of a judge, the testimony of a witness, or the performance of some act contrary to known truth, justice or rectitude.

**1.** To gain by a _bribe_

In familiar language, it is sometimes used in a good sense; as, to _bribe_ a child to take a medicine. Dryden has used the word in a good sense, in solemn language; but such use is rare, and hardly legitimate.
