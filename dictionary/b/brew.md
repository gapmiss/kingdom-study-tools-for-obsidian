# Brew

**BREW**, _verb transitive_

**1.** In a general sense, to boil, and mix; hence in Saxon, it signifies broth or pottage; Old. Eng. brewis.

**2.** In a more restricted sense, to make beer, ale or other similar liquor from malt; or to prepare a liquor from malt and hops, and in private families, from other materials, by steeping, boiling and fermentation.

**3.** To mingle.

**BREW** me a pottle of sack.

**4.** To contrive; to plot; as, to _brew_ mischief.

**5.** To put in a state of preparation.

**BREW**, _verb intransitive_ To be in a state of preparation; to be mixing, forming or collecting; as, a storm brews in the west. In this sense I do not recollect the use of the verb, in a transitive sense, and generally the participle only is used; as, a storm is brewing.

**1.** To perform the business of brewing or making beer; as, she can _brew_ wash and bake.

**BREW**, _noun_ The mixture formed by brewing; that which is brewed.
