# Blockade

**BLOCKA'DE**, _noun_ The siege of a place, formed by surrounding it with hostile troops or ships, or by posting them at all the avenues, to prevent escape, and hinder supplies of provisions and ammunition from entering, with a view to compel a surrender, by hunger and want, without regular attacks.

To constitute a _blockade_ the investing power must be able to apply its force to every point of practicable access, so as to render it dangerous to attempt to enter; and there is no _blockade_ of that port, where its force cannot be brought to bear.

**BLOCKA'DE**, _verb transitive_ To shut up a town or fortress, by posting troops at all the avenues, to compel the garrison or inhabitants to surrender by means of hunger and want, without regular attacks; also, to station ships of war to obstruct all intercourse with a town or nation.
