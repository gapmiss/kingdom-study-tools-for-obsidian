**1.** As a participle or perhaps more properly an adj., destined; tending; going, or intending to go; with to or for; as, a ship is _bound_ to Cadiz, or for Cadiz.

The application of this word, in this use, is taken from the orders given for the government of the voyage, implying obligation, or from tending, stretching. So destined implies being _bound_

**BOUND** is used in composition, as in ice-bound, wind-bound, when a ship is confined or prevented from sailing by ice or by contrary winds.
