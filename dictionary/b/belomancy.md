# Belomancy

**BEL'OMANCY**, _noun_ \[Gr.an arrow, and divination.\]

A kind of divination, practiced by the ancient Scythians, Babylonians, and other nations, and by the Arabians. A number of arrows, being marked, were put into a bag or quiver, and drawn out at random; and the marks or words on the arrow drawn determined what was to happen. See [[Ezekiel 21#21|Ezekiel 21:21]].
