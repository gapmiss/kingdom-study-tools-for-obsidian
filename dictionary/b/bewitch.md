# Bewitch

**BEWITCH**', _verb transitive_ \[be and witch.\] To fascinate; to gain an ascendancy over by charms or incantation; an operation which was formerly supposed to injure the person bewitched, so that he lost his flesh, or behaved in a strange unaccountable manner; ignorant people being inclined to ascribe to evil spirits what they could not account for.

Look, how I am bewitched; behold, mine arm

Is like a blasted sapling withered up.

**1.** To charm; to fascinate; to please to such a degree as to take away the power of resistance.

The charms of poetry our souls _bewitch_
