# Brief

**BRIEF**, _adjective_ \[Latin brevis, when brevio, so shorten abbreviate. Brevis, in Latin, is doubtless contracted from the Gr., whence to abridge. The Greek word coincides in elements with break.\]

Short; concise; it is used chiefly of language, discourses, writings and time; as a _brief_ space, a _brief_ review of a book. Shakespeare applies it to wars, to nature, etc. A little _brief_ authority is authority very limited.

In modern times, an apostolical _brief_ is a letter which the pope dispatches to a prince or other magistrate, relating to public affairs. A _brief_ is distinguished from a bull, in being more concise, written on paper, sealed with red wax, and impressed with the seal of the fisherman or Peter in a boat. A bull is more ample, written on parchment, and sealed with lead or green wax.

**2.** In law, an abridgment of a client's case, made out for the instruction of council on a trial at law.

Also, a writ summoning a man to answer to any action; or any precept of the king in writing, issuing from any court, whereby he commands a thing to be done.

In Scots law, a writ issuing from the chancery, directed to any judge ordinary, commanding and authorizing that judge to call a jury to inquire into the case, and upon their verdict to pronounce sentence.

**3.** A letter patent, from proper authority, authorizing a public collection or charitable contribution of money for any public or private purpose.

In music, the word, if I mistake not, is now written breve.
