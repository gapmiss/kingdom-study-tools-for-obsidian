# Romance

**ROMANCE**, _noun_ romans', ro'mans.

**1.** A fabulous relation or story of adventures and incidents, designed for the entertainment of readers; a tale of extraordinary adventures, fictitious and often extravagant, usually a tale of love or war, subjects interesting the sensibilities of the heart, or the passions of wonder and curiosity. _romance_ differs from the novel, as it treats of great actions and extraordinary adventures; that is, according to the Welch signification, it vaults or soars beyond the limits of fact and real life, and often of probability.

The first romances were a monstrous assemblage of histories, in which truth and fiction were blended without probability; a composition of amorous adventures and the extravagant ideas of chivalry.

**2.** A fiction.

**ROMANCE**, _verb intransitive_ romans', ro'mans. To forge and tell fictitious stories; to deal in extravagant stories.
