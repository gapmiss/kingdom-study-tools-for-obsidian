# Reprobation

**REPROBA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin reprobatio.\]

**1.** The act of disallowing with detestation, or of expressing extreme dislike.

**2.** The act of abandoning or state of being abandoned to eternal destruction.

When a sinner is so hardened as to feel no remorse or misgiving of conscience, it is considered as a sign of _reprobation_

**3.** A condemnatory sentence; rejection.

Set a brand of _reprobation_ on clipped poetry and false coin.
