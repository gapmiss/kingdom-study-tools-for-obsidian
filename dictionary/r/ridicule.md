# Ridicule

**RID'ICULE**, _noun_ \[Latin ridiculum, from rideo, to laugh or laugh at.\]

**1.** Contemptuous laughter; laughter with some degree of contempt; derision. It expresses less than scorn. _ridicule_ is aimed at what is not only laughable, but improper, absurd or despicable. Sacred subjects should never be treated with _ridicule_ \[See [[Ludicrous]].\]

Ridicule is too rough an entertainment for the polished and refined. It is banished from France, and is losing ground in England.

**2.** That species of writing which excites contempt with laughter. It differs from burlesque, which may excite laughter without contempt, or it may provoke derision.

Ridicule and derision are not exactly the same, as derision is applied to persons only, and _ridicule_ to persons or things. We deride the man, but _ridicule_ the man or his performances.

**RID'ICULE**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To laugh at with expressions of contempt; to deride.

**2.** To treat with contemptuous merriment; to expose to contempt or derision by writing.

**RID'ICULE**, _adjective_ Ridiculous. \[Not in use.\]
