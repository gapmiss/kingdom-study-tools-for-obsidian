# Remembrance

**REMEM'BRANCE**, _noun_

**1.** The retaining or having in mind an idea which had been present before, or an idea which had been previously received from an object when present, and which recurs to the mind afterwards without the presence of its object. Technically, _remembrance_ differs from reminiscence and recollection, as the former implies that an idea occurs to the mind spontaneously, or without much mental exertion. The latter imply the power or the act of recalling ideas which do not spontaneously recur to the

mind.

Remembrance is when the same idea recurs, without the operation of the like object on the external sensory.
