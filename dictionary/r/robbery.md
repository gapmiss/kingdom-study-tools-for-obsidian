# Robbery

**ROB'BERY**, _noun_

**1.** In law, the forcible and felonious taking from the person of another any money or goods, putting him in fear, that is, by violence or by menaces of death or personal injury. _robbery_ differs from theft, as it is a violent felonious taking from the person or presence of another; whereas theft is a felonious taking of goods privately from the person, dwelling, etc. of another. These words should not be confounded.

**2.** A plundering; a pillaging; a taking away by violence, wrong or oppression.
