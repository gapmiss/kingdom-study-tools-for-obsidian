# Rath

**RATH**, _noun_ A hill. _obsolete_

**RATH**, _adjective_ \[See [[Ready]].\]

Early; coming before others, or before the usual time.

Bring the _rath_ primrose, that forsaken dies.

We sometimes see the word rath-ripe, early ripe; but it is obsolete or nearly so. In the United States, I believe it is not used at all.
