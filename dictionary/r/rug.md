# Rug

**RUG**, _noun_ \[This belongs to the great family of rough, Latin ruga, raucus.\]

**1.** A coarse nappy woolen cloth used for a bed cover, and in modern times particularly, for covering the carpet before a fire-place. This name was formerly given to a coarse kind of frieze used for winter garments, and it may be that the poor in some countries still wear it. But in America, I believe the name is applied only to a bed cover for ordinary beds, and to a covering before a fire-place.

**2.** A rough, woolly or shaggy dog.
