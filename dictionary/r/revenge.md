# Revenge

**REVENGE**, _verb transitive_ revenj'. \[Latin vindex, vindico. See [[Vindicate]].\]

**1.** To inflict pain or injury in return for an injury received.

\[Note. this word and avenge were formerly used as synonymous, and it is so used in the common version of the Scripture, and applied to the Supreme Being. 'O Lord - _revenge_ me of my persecutors.' [[Jeremiah 15#15|Jeremiah 15:15]]. In consequence of a distinction between avenge and _revenge_ which modern usage has introduced, the application of this word to the Supreme Being appears extremely harsh, irreverent and offensive. _revenge_ is now used in an ill sense, for the infliction of pain maliciously or illegally; avenge for inflicting just punishment.\]

**2.** According to modern usage, to inflict pain deliberately and maliciously, contrary to the laws of justice and humanity, in return for injury, pain or evil received; to wreak vengeance spitefully on one who injures or offends. We say, to _revenge_ an injury or insult, or with the reciprocal pronoun, to _revenge_ ourselves on an enemy or for an injury, that is, to take vengeance or satisfaction.

**3.** To vindicate by punishment of an enemy.

The gods are just and will _revenge_ our cause.

\[According to modern usage, avenge should here be substituted for _revenge_ \]

**REVENGE**, _noun_ revenj'.

**1.** Return of an injury; the deliberate infliction of pain or injury or a person in return for an injury received from him.

**2.** According to modern usage, a malicious or spiteful infliction of pain or injury, contrary to the laws of justice and christianity, in return for an injury or offense. _revenge_ is dictated by passion; vengeance by justice.

**3.** The passion which is excited by an injury done or an affront given; the desire of inflicting pain on one who has done an injury; as, to glut _revenge_

**REVENGE**, as the word is now understood, is always contrary to the precepts of Christ.

The indulgence of _revenge_ tends to make men more savage and cruel.
