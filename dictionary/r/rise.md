This verb is written also arise, which see. In general, it is indifferent which orthography is used; but custom has, in some cases, established one to the exclusion of the other.

We never say, the ground arises to a certain altitude, and rarely, a man arises into an office or station. It is hardly possible to class or define the cases in which usage has established a difference in the orthography of this verb.
