# Reward

**REWARD**', _verb transitive_ a as aw. [[Latin re, denoting return.\]

To give in return, either good or evil.

Thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. [[1 Samuel 24#19|1 Samuel 24:19]].

Hence, when good is returned for good, _reward_ signifies to repay, to recompense, to compensate. When evil or suffering is return for injury or wickedness, _reward_ signifies to punish with just retribution, to take vengeance on, according to the nature of the case.

I will render vengeance to my enemies; and will _reward_ them that hate me. [[Deuteronomy 32#41|Deuteronomy 32:41]].

The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he shall _reward_ every man according to his works. [[Matthew 16#27|Matthew 16:27]].

In the latter passage, _reward_ signifies to render with good and evil.
