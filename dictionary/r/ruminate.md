# Ruminate

**RU'MINATE**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin rumino, from rumen, the cud.\]

**1.** To chew the cud; to chew again what has been slightly chewed and swallowed. Oxen, sheep, deer, goats, camels, hares and squirrels _ruminate_ in fact; other animals, as moles, bees, crickets, beetles, crabs, etc. only appear to _ruminate_

The only animals endowed with the genuine faculty of rumination, are the Ruminantia, or cloven-hoofed quadrupeds, but the hare, although its stomach is differently organized, is an occasional and partial ruminant.

**2.** To muse; to meditate; to think again and again; to ponder. It is natural to _ruminate_ on misfortunes.

He practices a slow meditation, and ruminates on the subject.
