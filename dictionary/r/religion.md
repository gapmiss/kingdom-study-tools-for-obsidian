# Religion

**RELIGION**, _noun_ relij'on. \[Latin religio, from religo, to bind anew; re and ligo, to bind. This word seems originally to have signified an oath or vow to the gods, or the obligation of such an oath or vow, which was held very sacred by the Romans.\]

**1.** _religion_ in its most comprehensive sense, includes a belief in the being and perfections of God, in the revelation of his will to man, in man's obligation to obey his commands, in a state of reward and punishment, and in man's accountableness to God; and also true godliness or piety of life, with the practice of all moral duties. It therefore comprehends theology, as a system of doctrines or principles, as well as practical piety; for the practice of moral duties without a belief in a divine lawgiver, and without reference to his will or commands, is not _religion_

**2.** _religion_ as distinct from theology, is godliness or real piety in practice, consisting in the performance of all known duties to God and our fellow men, in obedience to divine command, or from love to God and his law. [[James 1#26|James 1:26]].

**3.** _religion_ as distinct from virtue, or morality, consists in the performance of the duties we owe directly to God, from a principle of obedience to his will. Hence we often speak of _religion_ and virtue, as different branches of one system, or the duties of the first and second tables of the law.

Let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without _religion_

**4.** Any system of faith and worship. In this sense, _religion_ comprehends the belief and worship of pagans and Mohammedans, as well as of christians; any _religion_ consisting in the belief of a superior power or powers governing the world, and in the worship of such power or powers. Thus we speak of the _religion_ of the Turks, of the Hindoos, of the Indians, etc. as well as of the christian _religion_ We speak of false _religion_ as well as of true _religion_

**5.** The rites of religion; in the plural.
