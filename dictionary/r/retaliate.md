# Retaliate

**RETAL'IATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Low Latin retalio; re and talio, from talis, like.\]

To return like for like; to repay or requite by an act of the same kind as has been received. It is now seldom used except in a bad sense, that is, to return evil for evil; as, to _retaliate_ injuries. In war, enemies often _retaliate_ the death or inhuman treatment of prisoners, the burning of towns or the plunder of goods.

It is unlucky to be obliged to _retaliate_ the injuries of authors, whose works are so soon forgotten that we are in danger of appearing the first aggressors.
