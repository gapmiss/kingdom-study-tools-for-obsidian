# Ruddy

**RUD'DY**, _adjective_

**1.** Of a red color; of a lively flesh color, or the color of the human skin in high health. Thus we say, reddy cheeks, _ruddy_ lips, a reddy face or skin, a _ruddy_ youth; and in poetic language, _ruddy_ fruit. But the word is chiefly applied to the human skin.

**2.** Of a bright yellow color; as _ruddy_ gold. \[Unusual.\]
