# Resentment

**RESENT'MENT**, _noun_

**1.** The excitement of passion which proceeds from a sense of wrong offered to ourselves, or to those who are connected with us; anger. This word usually expresses less excitement than anger, though it is often synonymous with it. It expresses much less than wrath, exasperation, and indignation. In this use, _resentment_ is not the sense or perception of injury, but the excitement which is the effect of it.

Can heavenly minds such high _resentment_ show?

**2.** Strong perception of good. \[Not in use.\]
