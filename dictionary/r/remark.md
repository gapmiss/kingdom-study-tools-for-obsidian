# Remark

**REM'ARK**, _noun_ Notice or observation, particularly notice or observation expressed in words or writing; as the remarks of an advocate; the remarks made in conversation; the judicious or the uncandid remarks of a critic. A _remark_ is not always expressed, for we say, a man makes his remarks on a preacher's sermon while he is listening to it. In this case the notice is silent, a mere act of the mind.

**REM'ARK**, _verb transitive_

**1.** To observe; to note in the mind; to take notice of without expression. I remarked the manner of the speaker; I remarked his elegant expressions.

**2.** To express in words or writing what one thinks or sees; to express observations; as, it is necessary to repeat what has been before remarked.

**3.** To mark; to point out; to distinguish. \[Not in use.\]

His manacles _remark_ him.
