# Rectitude

**REC'TITUDE**, _noun_ \[Latin rectus, right, straight.\]

In morality, rightness of principle or practice; uprightness of mind; exact conformity to truth, or to the rules prescribed for moral conduct, either by divine or human laws. _rectitude_ of mind is the disposition to act in conformity to any known standard of right, truth or justice; _rectitude_ of conduct is the actual conformity to such standard. Perfect _rectitude_ belongs only to the Supreme Being. The more nearly the _rectitude_ of men approaches to the standard of the divine law, the more exalted and dignified is their character. Want of _rectitude_ is not only sinful, but debasing.

There is a sublimity in conscious _rectitude_ - in comparison with which the treasures of earth are not worth naming.
