**RENT**, _noun_

A sum of money, or a certain amount of other valuable thing, issuing yearly from lands or tenements; a compensation or return, in the nature of an acknowledgment, for the possession of a corporeal inheritance.

**RENT**s, at common law, are of three kinds; rent-service, rent-charge, and rent-seek. Rent-service is when some corporal service is incident to it, as by fealty and a sum of money; rent-charge is when the owner of the _rent_ has no future interest or reversion expectant in the land, but the _rent_ is reserved in the deed by a clause of distress for _rent_ in arrear; rent-seek, dry _rent_ is _rent_ reserved by deed, but without any clause of distress. There are also rents of assize, certain established rents of free-holders and copy-holders of manors, which cannot be varied; called also quit-rents. These when payable in silver, are called white rents, in contradistinction to rents reserved in work or the baser metals, called black rents, or black mail. Rack-rent is a _rent_ of the full value of the tenement, or near it. A fee farm _rent_ is a rent-charge issuing out of an estate in fee, of at least one fourth of the value of the lands at the time of its reservation.
