# Relinquish

**RELIN'QUISH**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin relinquo, re and linquo, to leave, to fail or faint; from the same root as liqueo, liquo, to melt or dissolve, deliquium, a fainting. Hence the sense is to withdraw or give way; to _relinquish_ is to recede from.\]

**1.** To withdraw from; to leave; to quit. It may be to forsake or abandon, but it does not necessarily express the sense of the latter. A man may _relinquish_ an enterprise for a time, or with a design never to resume it. In general, to _relinquish_ is to leave without the intention of resuming, and equivalent to forsake, but is less emphatical than abandon and desert.

**3.** To give up; to renounce a claim to; as, to _relinquish_ a debt.

To _relinquish_ back, or to, to give up; to release; to surrender; as, to _relinquish_ a claim to another.
