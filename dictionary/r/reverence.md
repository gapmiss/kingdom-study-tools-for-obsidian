# Reverence

**REV'ERENCE**, _noun_ \[Latin reverentia.\]

**1.** Fear mingled with respect and esteem; veneration.

When quarrels and factions are carried openly, it is a sign that the _reverence_ of government is lost.

The fear acceptable to God, is a filial fear, an awful _reverence_ of the divine nature, proceeding from a just esteem of his perfections, which produces in us an inclination to his service and an unwillingness to offend him.

Reverence is nearly equivalent to veneration, but expresses something less of the same emotion. It differs from awe, which is an emotion compounded of fear, dread or terror, with admiration of something great, but not necessarily implying love or affection. We feel _reverence_ for a parent, and for an upright magistrate, but we stand in awe of a tyrant. This distinction may not always be observed.

**2.** An act of respect or obeisance; a bow or courtesy. [[2 Samuel 9#6|2 Samuel 9:6]].

**3.** A title of the clergy.

**4.** A poetical title of a father.

**REV'ERENCE**, _verb transitive_ To regard with reverence; to regard with fear mingled with respect and affection. We _reverence_ superiors for their age, their authority and their virtues. We ought to _reverence_ parents and upright judges and magistrates. We ought to _reverence_ the Supreme Being, his word and his ordinances.

Those that I _reverence_ those I fear, the wise.

They will _reverence_ my son. [[Matthew 21#37|Matthew 21:37]].

Let the wife see that she _reverence_ her husband. [[Ephesians 5#33|Ephesians 5:33]].
