# Reck

**RECK**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin rego. See [[Rack and Reckon]].\]

To care; to mind; to rate at much; as we say, to reckon much of; followed by of. _obsolete_

Thou's but a lazy loorde, and recks much of thy swinke.

I _reck_ as little what betideth me, as much I wish all good befortune you.

Of night or loneliness it recks me not.

**RECK**, _verb transitive_ To heed; to regard; to care for.

This son of mine not recking danger.

\[This verb is obsolete unless in poetry. We observe the primary sense and application in the phrase, 'it recks me not, ' that is, it does not strain or distress me; it does not rack my mind. To _reck_ danger is a derivative form of expression, and a deviation from the proper sense of the verb.\]
