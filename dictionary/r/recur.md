# Recur

**RECUR**', _verb intransitive_ \[Latin recurro; re and curro, to run.\]

**1.** To return to the thought or mind.

When any word has been used to signify an idea, the old idea will _recur_ in the mind, when the word is heard.

**2.** To resort; to have recourse.

If to avoid succession in eternal existence, they _recur_ to the punctum stans of the schools, they will very little help us to a more positive idea of infinite duration.
