# Rain

**RAIN**, _verb intransitive_ \[It seems that _rain_ is contracted from regen. It is the Gr. to _rain_ to water, which we retain in brook, and the Latins, by dropping the prefix, in rigo, irrigo, to irrigate. The primary sense is to pour out, to drive forth. Heb.\]

**1.** To fall in drops from the clouds, as water; used mostly with it for a nominative; as, it rains; it will rain; it rained, or it has rained.

**2.** To fall or drop like rain; as, tears rained at their eyes.

**RAIN**, _verb transitive_ To pour or shower down from the upper regions, like _rain_ from the clouds.

Then said the Lord to Moses, behold I will _rain_ bread from heaven for you. [[Exodus 14#1|Exodus 14:1]].

God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall _rain_ it upon him while he is eating. [[Job 20#23|Job 20:23]].

Upon the wicked he shall _rain_ snares, fire and brimstone, and horrible tempest. [[Psalms 11#6|Psalms 11:6]].

**RAIN**, _noun_ The descent of water in drops from the clouds; or the water thus falling. _rain_ is distinguished from mist, by the size of the drops, which are distinctly visible. When water falls in very small drops or particles, we call it mist, and fog is composed of particles so fine as to be not only indistinguishable, but to float or be suspended in the air.
