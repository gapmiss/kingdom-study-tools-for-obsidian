**RECOLLEC'TION**, _noun_

**1.** The act of recalling to the memory, as ideas that have escaped; or the operation by which ideas that have escaped; or the operation by which ideas are recalled to the memory or revived in the mind. _recollection_ differs from remembrance, as it is the consequence of volition, or an effort of the mind to revive ideas; whereas remembrance implies no such volition. We often remember things without any voluntary effort. _recollection_ is called also reminiscence.

**3.** In popular language, _recollection_ is used as synonymous with remembrance.
