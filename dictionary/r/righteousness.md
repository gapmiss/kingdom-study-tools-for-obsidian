# Righteousness

**RIGHTEOUSNESS**, _noun_ ri'chusness.

**1.** Purity of heart and rectitude of life; conformity of heart and life to the divine law. _righteousness_ as used in Scripture and theology, in which it is chiefly used, is nearly equivalent to holiness, comprehending holy principles and affections of heart, and conformity of life to the divine law. It includes all we call justice, honesty and virtue, with holy affections; in short, it is true religion.

**2.** Applied to God, the perfection or holiness of his nature; exact rectitude; faithfulness.

**3.** The active and passive obedience of Christ, by which the law of God is fulfilled. [[Daniel 9#7|Daniel 9:7]].

**4.** Justice; equity between man and man. [[Luke 1#75|Luke 1:75]].

**5.** The cause of our justification.

The Lord our _righteousness_ [[Jeremiah 23#6|Jeremiah 23:6]].
