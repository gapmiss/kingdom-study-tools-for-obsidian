# Ratio

**RA'TIO**, _noun_ ra'sho. \[Latin from ratus, reor, to think or suppose, to set, confirm or establish. Reor is contracted from redor or retor, and primarily signifies to throw, to thrust, hence to speak, to set in the mind, to think, like Latin suppono; and setting gives the sense of a fixed rate or rule. See [[Reason]].\]

Proportion, or the relation of homogeneous things which determines the quantity of one from the quantity of another, without the intervention of a third.

The relation which one quantity has to another of the same kind, as expressed by the quotient of the one divided by the other. Thus the _ratio_ of 4 to 2 is 4/2, or 2; and the _ratio_ of 5 to 6 is 5/6. This is geometrical _ratio_ which is that signified when the term is used without distinction; but arithmetical _ratio_ is the difference between two quantities. Thus the arithmetical _ratio_ of 2 to 6 is 4.

Ratio respects magnitudes of the same kind only. One line may be compared with another line, but a line cannot be compared with a superficies, and hence between a line and a superficies there can be no _ratio_
