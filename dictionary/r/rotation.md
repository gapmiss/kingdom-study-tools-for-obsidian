# Rotation

**ROTA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin rotatio, from roto, to turn; rota, a wheel.\]

**1.** The act of turning, as a wheel or solid body on its axis, as distinguished from the progressive motion of a body revolving round another body or a distant point. Thus the daily turning of the earth on its axis, is a rotation; its annual motion round the sun is a revolution.
