# Refusal

**REFU'SAL**, _noun_ s as z.

**1.** The act of refusing; denial of any thing demanded, solicited or offered for acceptance. The first _refusal_ is not always proof that the request will not be ultimately granted.

**2.** The right of taking in preference to others; the choice of taking or refusing; option; pre-emption. We say, a man has the _refusal_ of a farm or a horse, or the _refusal_ of an employment.
