# Requisition

**REQUISI'TION**, _noun_ \[See [[Require]].\]

Demand; application made as of right. Under the old confederation of the American states, congress often made requisitions on the states for money to supply the treasury; but they had no power to enforce their requisitions, and the states neglected or partially complied with them.
