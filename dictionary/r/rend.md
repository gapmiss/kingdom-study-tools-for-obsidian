# Rend

**REND**, _verb transitive_ _preterit tense_ and _participle passive_ rent. \[Eng. cranny, Latin crena, Gr.\]

**1.** To separate any substance into parts with force or sudden violence; to tear asunder; to split; as, powder rends a rock in blasting; lightning rends an oak.

An empire from its old foundation rent.

I _rend_ my tresses, and by breast I wound.

Neither _rend_ your clothes, lest ye die. [[Leviticus 10#6|Leviticus 10:6]].

**2.** To separate or part with violence.

I will surely _rend_ the kingdom from thee. [[1 Kings 11#11|1 Kings 11:11]].

To _rend_ the heart, in Scripture, to have bitter sorrow for sin. [[Joel 2#13|Joel 2:13]].

To _rend_ the heavens, to appear in majesty. [[Isaiah 64#1|Isaiah 64:1]].

**REND** differs somewhat from lacerate. We never say, to lacerate a rock or a kingdom, when we mean to express splitting or division. Lacerate is properly applicable to the tearing off of small pieces of a thing, as to lacerate the body with a whip or scourge; or to the tearing of the flesh or other thing without entire separation.
