# Reside

**RESI'DE**, _verb intransitive_ s as z. \[Latin resideo, resido; re and sedeo, to sit, to settle.\]

**1.** to dwell permanently or for a length of time; to have a settled abode for a time. the peculiar uses of this word are to be noticed. When the word is appliced to the natives of a state, or others who dwell in it as permanent citizens, we use it only with reference to the part of a city or country in which a man dwells. We do not say generally that Englishmen _reside_ in England, but a particular citizen resides in London or York, or at such a house in such a street, in the Strand, etc.

When the word is applied to strangers or travelers, we do not say, a man resides in an inn for a night, but he resided in London or Oxford a month, or a year; or part of his life. A man lodges, stays, remains, abides, for a day or very short time, but _reside_ implies a longer time, though not definite.

**2.** To sink to the bottom of liquors; to settle. _obsolete_

\[In this sense, subside is now used.\]
