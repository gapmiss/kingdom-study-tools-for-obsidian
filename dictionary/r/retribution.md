# Retribution

**RETRIBU'TION**, _noun_

**1.** Repayment; return accommodated to the action; reward; compensation.

In good offices and due retributions, we may not be pinching and niggardly.

**2.** A gratuity or present given for services in the place of a salary.

**3.** The distribution of rewards and punishments at the general judgment.

It is a strong argument for a state of _retribution_ hereafter, that in this world virtuous persons are very often unfortunate, and vicious persons prosperous.
