# Repentance

**REPENT'ANCE**, _noun_

**1.** Sorrow for any thing done or said; the pain or grief which a person experiences in consequence of the injury or inconvenience produced by his own conduct.

**2.** In theology, the pain, regret or affliction which a person feels on account of his past conduct, because it exposes him to punishment. This sorrow proceeding merely from the fear of punishment, is called legal _repentance_ as being excited by the terrors of legal penalties, and it may exist without an amendment of life.

**3.** Real penitence; sorrow or deep contrition for sin, as an offense and dishonor to God, a violation of his holy law, and the basest ingratitude towards a Being of infinite benevolence. This is called evangelical _repentance_ and is accompanied and followed by amendment of life.

Repentance is a change of mind, or a conversion from sin to God.

Godly sorrow worketh _repentance_ to salvation. [[2 Corinthians 7#9|2 Corinthians 7:9]]. [[Matthew 3#8|Matthew 3:8]].

Repentance is the relinquishment of any practice, from conviction that it has offended God.
