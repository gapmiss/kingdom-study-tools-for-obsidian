# Rely

**RELY**', _verb intransitive_ \[re and lie, or from the root of lie, lay.\]

To rest on something, as the mind when satisfied of the veracity, integrity or ability of persons, or of the certainty of facts or of evidence; to have confidence in; to trust in; to depend; with on. We _rely_ on the promise of a man who is known to be upright; we _rely_ on the veracity or fidelity of a tried friend; a prince relies on the affections of his subjects for support, and on the strength of his army for success in war; above all things, we _rely_ on the mercy and promises of God. That which is the ground of confidence, is a certainty or full conviction that satisfies the mind and leaves it at rest, or undisturbed by doubt.

Because thou has relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the Lord thy God - [[2 Chronicles 16#8|2 Chronicles 16:8]].
