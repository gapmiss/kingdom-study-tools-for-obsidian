# Restrain

**RESTRA'IN**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin restringo; re and stringo, to strain. The letter g appears from the participle to be casual; stringo, for strigo. Hence strictus, strict, stricture. If the two letters st are removed, the word rigo coincides exactly, in primary sense, with Latin rego, rectus, right, and the root of reach, stretch, straight.\]

**1.** To hold back; to check; to hold from action, proceeding or advancing, either by physical or moral force, or by an interposing obstacle. Thus we _restrain_ a horse by a bridle; we _restrain_ cattle from wandering by fences; we _restrain_ water by dams and dikes; we _restrain_ men from crimes and trespasses by laws; we _restrain_ young people, when we can, by arguments or counsel; we _restrain_ men and their passions; we _restrain_ the elements; we attempt to _restrain_ vice, but not always with success.

**2.** To repress; to keep in awe; as, to _restrain_ offenders.

**3.** To suppress; to hinder or repress; as, to _restrain_ excess.

**4.** To abridge; to hinder from unlimited enjoyment; as, to _restrain_ one of his pleasure or of his liberty.

Not only a metaphysical or natural, but a moral universality is also to be restrained by a part of the predicate.

**6.** To withhold; to forbear.

Thou restrainest prayer before God. [[Job 15#8|Job 15:8]].
