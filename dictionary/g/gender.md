**3.** In grammar, a difference in words to express distinction of sex; usually a difference of termination in nouns, adjectives and participles, to express the distinction of male and female. But although this was the original design of different terminations, yet in the progress of language, other words having no relation to one sex or the other, came to have genders assigned them by custom. Words expressing males are said to be of the masculine gender; those expressing females, of the feminine gender; and in some languages, words expressing things having no sex, are of the neuter or neither _gender_

**GEN'DER**, _verb transitive_ To beget; but engender is more generally used.

**GEN'DER**, _verb intransitive_ To copulate; to breed. [[Leviticus 19#19|Leviticus 19:19]].
