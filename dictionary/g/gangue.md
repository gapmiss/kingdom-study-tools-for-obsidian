# Gangue

**GANGUE**, _noun_ gang. \[See [[Gang]].\] In mining, the earthy, stony, saline, or combustible substance, which contains the ore of metals, or is only mingled with it without being chimically combined, is called the _gangue_ or matrix of the ore. It differs from a mineralizer, in not being combined with the metal.
