# Guilt

**GUILT**, _noun_ gilt.

**1.** Criminality; that state of a moral agent which results from his actual commission of a crime or offense, knowing it to be a crime, or violation of law. To constitute _guilt_ there must be a moral agent enjoying freedom of will, and capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, and a wilful or intentional violation of a known law, or rule of duty. The _guilt_ of a person exists, as soon as the crime is committed; but to evince it to others, it must be proved by confession, or conviction in due course of law. _guilt_ renders a person a debtor to the law, as it binds him to pay a penalty in money or suffering. _guilt_ therefore implies both criminality and liableness to punishment. _guilt_ may proceed either from a positive act or breach of law, or from voluntary neglect of known duty.

**2.** Criminality in a political or civil view; exposure to forfeiture or other penalty.

A ship incurs _guilt_ by the violation of a blockade.

**3.** Crime; offense.
