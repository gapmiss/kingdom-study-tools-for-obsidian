# Gnat

**GNAT**, _noun_ nat. A small insect, or rather a genus of insects, the Culex, whose long cylindric body is composed of eight rings. They have six legs and their mouth is formed by a flexible sheath, inclosing bristles pointed like stings. The sting is a tube containing five or six spicula of exquisite fineness, dentated or edged. The most troublesome of this genus is the musketoe.

**1.** Any thing proverbially small.

Ye blind guides, who strain at a _gnat_ and swallow a camel. [[Matthew 23#24|Matthew 23:24]].
