# Gulf

**GULF**, _noun_

**1.** A recess in the ocean from the general line of the shore into the land, or a tract of water extending from the ocean or a sea into the land, between two points or promontories; a large bay; as the _gulf_ of Mexico; the _gulf_ of Venice; the _gulf_ of Finland. A _gulf_ and a bay differ only in extent. We apply bay to a large or small recess of the sea, as the bay of Biscay, the bay of Fundy; but _gulf_ is applied only to a large extent of water.

**2.** An abyss; a deep place in the earth; as the _gulf_ of Avernus.

**3.** A whirlpool; an absorbing eddy.

**4.** Any thing insatiable.
