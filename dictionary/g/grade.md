# Grade

**GRADE**, _noun_ \[Latin gradus, a step. gradior, to step to go, rota. We observe further that the Latin gradior forms gressus, by a common change of d to s; Heb. to descend.\]

**1.** A degree or rank in order or dignity, civil, military or ecclesiastical.

While questions, periods, and grades and privileges are never once formally discussed.

**2.** A step or degree in any ascending series; as crimes of every _grade_

When we come to examine the intermediate grades.
