# Genitive

**GEN'ITIVE**, _adjective_ \[Latin genitivus, from the root of gender.\]

In grammar, an epithet given to a case in the declension of nouns, expressing primarily the thing from which something else proceeds; as filius patris, the son of a father; aqua fontis, the water of a fountain. But by custom this case expresses other relations, particularly possession or ownership; as animi magnitudo, greatness of mind, greatness possessed by or inherent in the mind. This case often expresses also that which proceeds from something else; as pater septem filiorum, the father of seven sons.
