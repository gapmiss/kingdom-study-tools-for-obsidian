# Gurgle

**GUR'GLE**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin gurges. See [[Gargle]], which seems to be of the same family, or the same word differently applied.\]

To run as liquor with a purling noise; to run or flow in a broken, irregular, noisy current, as water from a bottle, or a small stream on a stony bottom.

Pure gurgling rills the lonely desert trace.
