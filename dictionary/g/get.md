# Get

**GET**, _verb transitive_ _preterit tense_ got. \[gat, _obsolete_ \] _participle passive_ got, gotten.

**1.** To procure; to obtain; to gain possession of, by almost any means. We _get_ favor by kindness; we _get_ wealth by industry and economy; we _get_ land by purchase; we _get_ praise by good conduct; and we _get_ blame by doing injustice. The merchant should _get_ a profit on his goods; the laborer should _get_ a due reward for his labor; most men _get_ what they can for their goods or for their services. _get_ differs from acquire, as it does not always express permanence of possession, which is the appropriate sense of acquire. We _get_ a book or a loaf of bread by borrowing, we do not acquire it; but we _get_ or acquire an estate.

**2.** To have.

Thou hast got the face of a man.

This is a most common, but gross abuse of this word. We constantly hear it said, I have got no corn, I have got no money, she has got a fair complexion, when the person means only, I have no corn, I have no money, she has a fair complexion.

**4.** To learn; as, to _get_ a lesson.
