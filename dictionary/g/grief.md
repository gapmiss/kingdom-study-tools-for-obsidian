# Grief

**GRIEF** ,_noun_ \[Latin gravis.\]

**1.** The pain of mind produced by loss, misfortune, injury or evils of any kind; sorrow; regret. We experience _grief_ when we lose a friend, when we incur loss, when we consider ourselves injured, and by sympathy, we feel _grief_ at the misfortunes of others.

**2.** The pain of mind occasioned by our own misconduct; sorrow or regret that we have done wrong; pain accompanying repentance. We feel _grief_ when we have offended or injured a friend, and the consciousness of having offended the Supreme Being, fills the penitent heart with the most poignant _grief_

**3.** Cause of sorrow; that which afflicts.

Who were a _grief_ of mind to Isaac and Rebekah. [[Genesis 26#35|Genesis 26:35]].

A foolish son is a _grief_ to his father. [[Proverbs 17#25|Proverbs 17:25]].
