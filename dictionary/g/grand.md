# Grand

**GRAND**, _adjective_ \[Latin grandis.\]

**1.** Great; but mostly in a figurative sense; illustrious; high in power or dignity; as a _grand_ lord.

**3.** Great; principal; chief; as Satan our _grand_ foe.

In general, we apply the epithet _grand_ to that which is great and elevated, or which elevates and expands our ideas. The ocean, the sky, a lofty tower are _grand_ objects. But to constitute a thing _grand_ it seems necessary that it should be distinguished by some degree of beauty.
