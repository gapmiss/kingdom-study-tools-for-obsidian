# Guaranty

**GUAR'ANTY**, _verb transitive_ gar'anty. \[Eng. to ward; allied to warren, etc. See [[Warrant]].\]

**1.** To warrant; to make sure; to undertake or engage that another person shall perform what he has stipulated; to oblige one's self to see that another's engagements are performed; to secure the performance of; as, to _guaranty_ the execution of a treaty.

**2.** To undertake to secure to another, at all events, as claims, rights or possessions. Thus in the treaty of 1778, France guarantied to the United States their liberty, sovereignty and independence, and their possessions; and the United States guarantied to France its possessions in America.

The United States shall _guaranty_ to every state in the Union a republican form of government.

**3.** To indemnify; to save harmless.

\[Note. This verb, whether written _guaranty_ or guarantee, forms an awkward participle of the present tense; and we cannot relish either guarantying or guaranteeing. With the accent on the first syllable, as now pronounced, it seems expedient to drop the y in the participle, and write guaranting.\]
