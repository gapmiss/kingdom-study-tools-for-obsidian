# Gut

**GUT**, _noun_ The intestinal canal of an animal; a pipe or tube extending, with many circumvolutions, from the pylorus to the vent. This pipe is composed of three coats, and is attached to the body by a membrane called the mesentery. This canal is of different sizes in different parts, and takes different names.

By this pipe, the undigested and unabsorbed parts of food are conveyed from the stomach and discharged. This word in the plural is applied to the whole mass formed by its natural convolutions in the abdomen.
