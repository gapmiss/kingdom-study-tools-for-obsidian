# Gale

**GALE**, _noun_ A current of air; a strong wind. The sense of this word is very indefinite. The poets use it in the sense of a moderate breeze of current of air, as a gentle _gale_ A stronger wind is called a fresh _gale_

In the language of seamen, the word _gale_ unaccompanied by an epithet, signifies a vehement wind, a storm or tempest. They say, the ship carried away her top-mast in a _gale_ or _gale_ of wind; the ship rode out the _gale_ But the word is often qualified, as a hard or strong _gale_ a violent _gale_ A current of wind somewhat less violent is denominated a stiff _gale_ A less vehement wind is called a fresh _gale_ which is a wind not too strong for a ship to carry single reefed top-sails, when close hauled. When the wind is not so violent but that a ship will carry her top-sails a-trip or full spread, it is called a loom-gale.

**GALE**, _verb intransitive_ In seamen's language, to sail, or sail fast.
