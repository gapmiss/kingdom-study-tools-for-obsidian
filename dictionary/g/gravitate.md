# Gravitate

**GRAV'ITATE**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin gravitas, from gravis, heavy.\]

To tend to the center of a body, or the central point of attraction. Thus a body elevated above the earth tends to fall, that is, it gravitates towards the center of the earth; and the planets are supposed to _gravitate_ towards the sun, or center of the solar system.
