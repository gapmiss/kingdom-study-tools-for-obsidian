**GREEN**, _verb transitive_ To make _green_ This is used by Thomson and by Barlow, but is not an elegant word, nor indeed hardly legitimate, in the sense in which these writers use it. 'Spring greens the year.' 'God greens the groves.' The only legitimate sense of this verb, if used, would be, to dye _green_ or to change to a _green_ color. A plant growing in a dark room is yellow; let this plant be carried into the open air, and the rays of the sun will _green_ it. This use would correspond with the use of whiten, blacken, redden.
