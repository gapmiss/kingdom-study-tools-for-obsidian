# Grove

**GROVE**, _noun_

**1.** In gardening, a small wood or cluster of trees with a shaded avenue, or a wood impervious to the rays of the sun. A _grove_ is either open or close; open, when consisting of large trees whose branches shade the ground below; close, when consisting of trees and underwood, which defend the avenues from the rays of the sun and from violent winds.

**2.** A wood of small extent. In America, the word is applied to a wood of natural growth in the field, as well as to planted trees in a garden, but only to a wood of small extent and not to a forest.

**3.** Something resembling a wood or trees in a wood.
