# Griffon

**GRIF'FON**, _noun_ \[Latin gryps, gryphus.\]

In the natural history of the ancients, an imaginary animal said to be generated between the lion and eagle. It is represented with four legs, wings and a beak, the upper part resembling an eagle, and the lower part a lion. This animal was supposed to watch over mines of gold and hidden treasures, and was consecrated to the sun. The figure of the _griffon_ is seen on ancient medals, and is still borne in coat-armor. It is also an ornament of Greek architecture.
