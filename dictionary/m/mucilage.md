# Mucilage

**MU'CILAGE**, _noun_ \[Latin mucus, the slimy discharges from the nose; Heb. to dissolve, to putrefy.\]

**1.** In chemistry, one of the proximate elements of vegetables. The same substance is a gum when solid, and a _mucilage_ when in solution.

Both the ingredients improve one another; for the _mucilage_ adds to the lubricity of the oil, and the oil preserves the _mucilage_ from inspissation.

Mucilage is obtained from vegetable or animal substances.

**2.** The liquor which moistens and lubricates the ligaments and cartilages of the articulations or joints in animal bodies.
