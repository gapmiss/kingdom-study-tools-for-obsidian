# Miraculous

**MIRAC'ULOUS**, _adjective_ Performed supernaturally, or by a power beyond the ordinary agency of natural laws; effected by the direct agency of Almighty power, and not by natural causes; as the _miraculous_ healing of the sick or raising the dead by Christ.

**1.** Supernatural; furnished supernaturally, or competent to perform miracles; as the _miraculous_ powers of the Apostles. _miraculous_ applied to the extraordinary powers of the Apostles, may mean conferred by supernatural agency, or competent to work miracles. I believe it is generally used in the latter sense.

**2.** In a less definite sense, wonderful; extra-ordinary.
