# Manifestation

**MANIFESTA'TION**, _noun_ The act of disclosing what is secret, unseen or obscure; discovery to the eye or to the understanding; the exhibition of any thing by clear evidence; display; as the _manifestation_ of God's power in creation, or of his benevolence in redemption.

The secret manner in which acts of mercy ought to be performed, requires this public _manifestation_ of them at the great day.
