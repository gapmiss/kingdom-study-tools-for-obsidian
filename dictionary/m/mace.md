# Mace

**MACE**, _noun_ An ensign of authority borne before magistrates. Originally, the _mace_ was a club or instrument of war, made of iron and much used by cavalry. It was in the shape of a coffee mill. Being no longer a weapon of war, its form is changed; it is made of silver or copper gilt, and ornamented with a crown, globe and cross.
