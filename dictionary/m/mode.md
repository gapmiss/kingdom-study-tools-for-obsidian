# Mode

**MODE**, _noun_ \[Latin modus, metior. The primary sense of _mode_ is measure hence form. Measure is from extending, the extent, hence a limit, and hence the derivative sense of restraining. See [[Meet and Measure]].\]

It is applicable to particular acts, or to a series of acts, or to the common usage of a city of nation. One man has a particular _mode_ of walking; another has a singular _mode_ of dressing his hair. We find it necessary to conform in some measure to the usual modes of dress.

**4.** In metaphysics, the dependence or affection of a substance. Such complex ideas as contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by themselves, but are considered as dependencies or affections of substances, Locke calls modes. Of these he makes two kinds; simple modes, which are only variations or different combinations of the same idea, as a dozen, which consists of so many units added together; and mixed modes, which are compounded of simple ideas of several kinds, as beauty, which is compounded of color and figure.

A _mode_ is that which cannot subsist in and of itself, but is esteemed as belonging to and subsisting by the help of some substance, which for that reason is called its subject.

**5.** In music, a regular disposition of the air and accompaniments relative to certain principal sounds, on which a piece of music is formed, and which are called the essential sounds of the _mode_

**6.** In grammar, a particular manner of conjugating verbs to express manner of action or being, as affirmation, command, condition and the like; usually and not very properly written mood. Mood is a word of different signification. \[See Mood.\]
