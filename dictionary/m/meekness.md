# Meekness

**MEE'KNESS**, _noun_ Softness of temper; mildness; gentleness; forbearance under injuries and provocations.

**1.** In an evangelical sense, humility; resignation; submission to the divine will, without murmuring or peevishness; opposed to pride, arrogance and refractoriness. [[Galatians 5#23|Galatians 5:23]].

I beseech you by the _meekness_ of Christ. [[1 Corinthians 10#1|1 Corinthians 10:1]].

Meekness is a grace which Jesus alone inculcated, and which no ancient philosopher seems to have understood or recommended.
