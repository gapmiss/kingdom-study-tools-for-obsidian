# Monarchy

**MON'ARCHY**, _noun_ \[Gr. See [[Monarch]].\]

**1.** A state or government in which the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a single person. Such a state is usually called an empire or a kingdom; and we usually give this denomination to a large state only. But the same name is sometimes given to a kingdom or state in which the power of the king or supreme magistrate is limited by a constitution, or by fundamental laws. Such is the British _monarchy_ Hence we speak of absolute or despotic monarchies, and of limited monarchies.

A free government has a great advantage over a simple _monarchy_

**2.** A kingdom; an empire.
