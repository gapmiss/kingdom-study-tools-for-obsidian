# Mother

**MOTHER**, _noun_ \[Latin mater, mother; matrix, the womb; materia, matter, stuff, materials of which any thing is made. We observe that in some other languages, as well as in English, the same word signifies a female parent, and the thick slime formed in vinegar; and in all the languages of Europe here cited, the orthography is nearly the same as that of mud and matter. The question then occurs whether the name of a female parent originated in a word expressing matter, mold; either the soil of the earth, as the producer, or the like substance, when shaped and fitted as a mold for castings; or whether the name is connected with the opinion that the earth is the _mother_ of all productions; whence the word mother-earth. We are informed by a fragment of Sanchoniathon, that the ancient Phenicians considered mud to be the substance from which all things were formed. See [[Mud]]. The word matter is evidently from the Ar. madda, to secrete, eject or discharge a purulent substance; and I think cannot have any direct connection with mud. But in the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, the same word madre signified _mother_ and a mold for castings; and the northern languages, particularly the German and Danish, seem to establish the fact that the proper sense of _mother_ is matrix. Hence _mother_ of pearl, the matrix of pearl. If this word had its origin in the name of the earth used for the forms of castings, it would not be a singular fact; for our word mold, in this sense, I suppose to be so named from mold, fine earth. The question remains sub judice.\]

Alas, poor country! it cannot

Be called our _mother_ but our grave.

So our native land is called _mother_ country, and a plant from which a slip or cion is taken, is called the _mother_ plant. In this use, _mother_ may be considered as an adjective.
