# Metalepsis

**METALEP'SIS**, _noun_ \[Gr. participation; beyond, and to take.\]

In rhetoric, the continuation of a trope in one word through a succession of significations, or the union of two or more tropes of a different kind in one word, so that several gradations or intervening senses come between the word expressed and the thing intended by it; as 'in one Caesar there are many Mariuses.' Here Marius, by a synecdoche or antonomasy, is put for any ambitious, turbulent man, and this, by a metonymy of the cause, for the ill effects of such a temper to the public.
