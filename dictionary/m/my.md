# My

**MY**, _pronoun_. _adjective_. \[contracted from migen, mine. Me was originally mig, and the adjective migen. So in Latin meus. See [[Mine]].\]

Belonging to me; as, this is _my_ book. Formerly, mine was used before a vowel, and _my_ before a consonant; _my_ is now used before both. We say, _my_ book; _my_ own book; _my_ old friend. Mine is still used after a verb; as, this book is mine.
