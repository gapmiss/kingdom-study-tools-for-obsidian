# Moment

**MO'MENT**, _noun_ \[Latin momentum. This word is contracted from motamentum, or some other word, the radical verb of which signified to move, rush, drive or fall suddenly, which sense gives that of force. The sense of an instant of time is from falling or rushing, which accords well with that of meet.\]

**1.** The most minute and indivisible part of time; an instant.

In a _moment_ in the twinkling of an eye. [[1 Corinthians 15#52|1 Corinthians 15:52]].

**2.** Force; impulsive power.

\--Touch with lightest _moment_ of impulse,

His free will.

Little used; but hence,

**3.** Importance in influence or effect; consequence; weight or value.

It is an abstruse speculation, but also of far less _moment_ to us than the others.
