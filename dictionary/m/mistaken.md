# Mistaken

**MISTA'KEN**. In the use of this participle, there is a peculiarity which ought to be carefully noticed. When used of persons, it signified to be in an error, to be wrong; as, I am _mistaken_ you are _mistaken_ he is _mistaken_ But when used of things, it signified misunderstood, misconceived; as, the sense of the passage is _mistaken_ that is, not rightly understood.
