# Monstrosity

**MONSTROS'ITY**, _noun_ The state of being monstrous, or out of the common order of nature.

We often read of monstrous births; but we see a greater _monstrosity_ in education, when a father begets a son and trains him up into a beast.

**1.** An unnatural production; that which is monstrous.

Fabri arranges distortions, gibbosities, tumors, etc. in the class of morbific monstrosities.

A _monstrosity_ never changes the name or affects the immutability of a species.
