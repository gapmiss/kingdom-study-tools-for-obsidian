# Morality

**MORAL'ITY**, _noun_ The doctrine or system of moral duties, or the duties of men in their social character; ethics.

The system of _morality_ to be gathered from the writings of ancient sages, falls very short of that delivered in the gospel.

**1.** The practice of the moral duties; virtue. We often admire the politeness of men whose _morality_ we question.

**2.** The quality of an action which renders it good; the conformity of an act to the divine law, or to the principles of rectitude. This conformity implies that the act must be performed by a free agent, and from a motive of obedience to the divine will. This is the strict theological and scriptural sense of _morality_ But we often apply the word to actions which accord with justice and human laws, without reference to the motives form which they proceed.
