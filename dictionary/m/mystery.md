**MYS'TERY**, _noun_ \[Latin mysterium; Gr. a secret. This word in Greek is rendered also murium latibulum; but probably both senses are from that of hiding or shutting; Gr. to shut, to conceal.

**1.** A profound secret; something wholly unknown or something kept cautiously concealed, and therefore exciting curiosity or wonder; such as the _mystery_ of the man with the iron mask in France.

**2.** In religion, any thing in the character or attributes of

God, or in the economy of divine providence, which is not revealed to man.

**3.** That which is beyond human comprehension until explained. In this sense, _mystery_ often conveys the idea of something awfully sublime or important; something that excites wonder.

Great is the _mystery_ of godliness. [[1 Timothy 3#9|1 Timothy 3:9]].

Having made known to us the _mystery_ of his will. [[Ephesians 1#9|Ephesians 1:9]].

We speak the wisdom of God in a _mystery_ [[1 Corinthians 2#7|1 Corinthians 2:7]].

**4.** An enigma; any thing artfully made difficult.

**5.** A kind of ancient dramatic representation.

**6.** A trade; a calling; any mechanical occupation which supposes skill or knowledge peculiar to those who carry it on, and therefore a secret to others.
