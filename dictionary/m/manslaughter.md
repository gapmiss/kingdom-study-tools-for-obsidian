# Manslaughter

**MAN'SLAUGHTER**, _noun_ \[man and slaughter. See [[Slay]].\]

**1.** In a general sense, the killing of a man or of men; destruction of the human species; murder.

**2.** In law, the unlawful killing of a man without malice, express or implied. This may be voluntary, upon a sudden heat or excitement of anger; or involuntary, but in the commission of some unlawful act. _manslaughter_ differs from murder in not proceeding from malice prepense or deliberate, which is essential to constitute murder. It differs from homicide excusable, being done in consequence of some unlawful act, whereas excusable homicide happens in consequence of misadventure.
