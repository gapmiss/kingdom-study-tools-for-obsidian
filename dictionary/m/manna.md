# Manna

**MAN'NA**, _noun_

**1.** A substance miraculously furnished as food for the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness of Arabia. [[Exodus 16#15|Exodus 16:15]].

Josephus, Ant.B.3.1. considers the Hebrew word man, to signify what. In conformity with this idea, the seventy translate the passage, [[Exodus 16#15|Exodus 16:15]]:15. what is this? which rendering seems to accord with the following words, for they knew not what it was. And in the Encyclopedia, the translators are charged with making Moses fall into a plain contradiction. Art. _manna_ But Christ and his apostles confirm the common version:'Not as your fathers ate _manna_ and are dead.' [[John 6#58|John 6:58]]. [[Hebrews 9#4|Hebrews 9:4]]. And we have other evidence, that the present version is correct; for in the same chapter, Moses directed Aaron to 'take a pot and put a homer full of _manna_ therein.' Now it would be strange language to say, put an homer full of what, or what is it. So also verse 35. 'The children of Israel ate _manna_ forty years, etc.' In both verses, the Hebrew word is the same as in verse 15.

**2.** In the materia medica, the juice of a certain tree of the ash-kind, the Fraxinus ornus, or flowering ash a native of Sicily, Calabria, and other parts of the south of Europe. It is either naturally concreted, or exsiccated and purified by art. The best _manna_ is in oblong pieces or flakes of a whitish or pale yellow color, light, friable, and somewhat transparent. It is a mild laxative.
