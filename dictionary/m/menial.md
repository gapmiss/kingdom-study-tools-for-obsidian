\[Johnson observes on this passage, that Swift seems not to have known the meaning of this word. But this is the only sense in which it is now used.\]

**2.** Belonging to the retinue or train of servants.

\[If this definition of Johnson is correct, it indicates that _menial_ is from meinez, many, rather than from mesnie, family. But the sense may be house-dogs.\]
