# Meal

**MEAL**, _noun_

**1.** A portion of food taken at one time; a repast. It is customary in the U. States to eat three meals in a day. The principal _meal_ of our ancestors was dinner, at noon.

**2.** A part; a fragment; in the word piece-meal.

**MEAL**, _noun_ \[Latin mola, mollis; Eng.mellow.\]

**1.** The substance of edible grain ground to fine particles, and not bolted or sifted. _meal_ primarily includes the bran as well as the flour. Since bolting has been generally practiced, the word _meal_ is not generally applied to the finer part, or flour, at least in the United States, though I believe it is sometimes so used. In New England, _meal_ is now usually applied to ground maiz, whether bolted or unbolted, called Indian _meal_ or corn-meal. The words wheat-meal, and rye-meal are rarely used, though not wholly extinct; and _meal_ occurs also in oatmeal.

**2.** Flour; the finer part of pulverized grain.

\[This sense is now uncommon.\]

**MEAL**, _verb transitive_ To sprinkle with _meal_ or to mix _meal_ with. \[Little used.\]
