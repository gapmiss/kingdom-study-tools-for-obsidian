# Mortification

**MORTIFICA'TION**, _noun_ \[See [[Mortify]].\]

**1.** In medicine and surgery, the death and consequent putrefaction of one part of any animal body, while the rest is alive; or the loss of heat and action in some part of a living animal, followed by a dissolution of organic texture; gangrene; sphacelus. _mortification_ is the local or partial death of a living animal body, and if not arrested, soon extinguishes life in the whole body. We usually apply _mortification_ to the local extinction of life and loss or organic texture in a living body. The dissolution of the whole body after death, is called putrefaction.

**2.** In Scripture, the act of subduing the passions and appetites by penance, abstinence or painful severities inflicted on the body. The _mortification_ of the body by fasting has been the practice of almost all nations, and the _mortification_ of the appetites and passions by self-denial is always a christian duty.

**3.** Humiliation or slight vexation; the state of being humbled or depressed by disappointment, vexation, crosses, or any thing that wounds or abases pride.

It is one of the vexatious mortifications of a studious man to have his thoughts disordered by a tedious visit.

We had the _mortification_ to lose sight of Munich, Augsburg and Ratisbon.

**4.** Destruction of active qualities; applied to metals. \[See [[Mortify]]; but I believe not used.\]
