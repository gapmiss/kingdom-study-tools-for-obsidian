Municipal law is properly defined to be a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state--

Municipal, as used by the Romans, originally designated that which pertained to a municipium, a free city or town. It still retains this limited sense; but we have extended it to what belongs to a state or nation, as a distinct, independent body. _municipal_ law or regulation respects solely the citizens of a state, and is thus distinguished from commercial law, political law, and the law of nations.
