# Modesty

**MOD'ESTY**, _noun_ \[Latin modestia.\] That lowly temper which accompanies a moderate estimate of one's own worth and importance. This temper when natural, springs in some measure from timidity, and in young and inexperienced persons, is allied to bashfulness and diffidence. In persons who have seen the world, and lost their natural timidity, _modesty_ springs no less from principle than from feeling, and is manifested by retiring, unobtrusive manners, assuming less to itself than others are willing to yield, and conceding to others all due honor and respect, or even more than they expect or require.

**2.** _modesty_ as an act or series of acts, consists in humble, unobtrusive deportment, as opposed to extreme boldness, forwardness, arrogance, presumption, audacity or impudence. Thus we say, the petitioner urged his claims with modesty; the speaker addressed the audience with _modesty_

**3.** Moderation; decency.

**4.** In females, _modesty_ has the like character as in males; but the word is used also as synonymous with chastity, or purity of manners. In this sense, _modesty_ results from purity of mind, or from the fear of disgrace and ignominy fortified by education and principle. Unaffected _modesty_ is the sweetest charm of female excellence, the richest gem in the diadem of their honor.
