**MA'NIHOC**

MA'NIHOT, _noun_ A plant of the genus Jatropha, or Cassada plant. It has palmated leaves, with entire lobes. Manioc is an acrid plant, but from its root is extracted a pleasant nourishing substance, called cassava. This is obtained by grating the root, and pressing out the juice, which is an acrid and noxious poison. The substance is then dried and baked, or roasted on a plate of hot iron.
