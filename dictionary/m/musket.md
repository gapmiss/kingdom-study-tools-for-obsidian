# Musket

**MUSK'ET**, _noun_ \[Latin musca, a fly.\]

**1.** A species of fire-arms used in war, and fired by means of a lighted match. This manner of firing was in use as late as the civil war in England. But the proper _musket_ is no longer in use. The name, however, in common speech, is yet applied to fusees or fire-locks fired by a spring lock.

**2.** A male hawk of a small kind, the female of which is the sparrow hawk.
