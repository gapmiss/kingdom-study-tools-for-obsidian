**3.** To have moral power; to have liberty, leave, license or permission; to be permitted; to be allowed. A man _may_ do what the laws permit. He _may_ do what is not against decency, propriety or good manners. We _may_ not violate the laws, or the rules of good breeding. I told the servant he might be absent.

**4.** It is used in prayer and petitions to express desire. O _may_ we never experience the evils we dread. So also in expressions of good will. _may_ you live happily, and be a blessing to your country. It was formerly used for can, and its radical sense is the same.

**MAY** be, it _may_ be, are expressions equivalent to perhaps, by chance, peradventure, that is, it is possible to be.
