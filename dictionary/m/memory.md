# Memory

**MEM'ORY**, _noun_ \[Latin memoria; Gr. to remember, from mind, or the same root. See [[Mind]].\]

**1.** The faculty of the mind by which it retains the knowledge of past events, or ideas which are past. A distinction is made between _memory_ and recollection. _memory_ retains past ideas without any, or with little effort; recollection implies an effort to recall ideas that are past.

Memory is the purveyor of reason.

**2.** A retaining of past ideas in the mind; remembrance. Events that excite little attention are apt to escape from _memory_

**3.** Exemption from oblivion.
