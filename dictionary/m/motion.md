# Motion

**MO'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin motio. See [[Move]].\] The act or process of changing place; change of local position; the passing of a body from one place to another; change of distance between bodies; opposed to rest.

Animal _motion_ is that which is performed by animals in consequence of volition or an act of the will; but how the will operates on the body in producing _motion_ we cannot explain.

Mechanical _motion_ is effected by the force or power of one body acting on another.

Perpetual _motion_ is that which is effected or supplied by itself, without the impulse or intervention of any external cause. Hitherto it has been found impossible to invent a machine that has this principle.

**8.** The effect of impulse; action proceeding from any cause, external or internal. In the growth of plants and animals, there must be a _motion_ of the component parts, though invisible. Attraction or chimical affinity produces sensible _motion_ of the parts of bodies. Motions of the mind ascribed to the invisible agency of the Supreme Being, are called good motions.

Let a good man obey every good _motion_ rising in his heart, knowing that every such _motion_ proceeds from God.
