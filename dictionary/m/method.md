# Method

**METH'OD**, _noun_ \[Latin methodus; Gr. with, and way.\]

**1.** A suitable and convenient arrangement of things, proceedings or ideas; the natural or regular disposition of separate things or parts; convenient order for transacting business, or for comprehending any complicated subject. Without _method_ business of any kind will fall into confusion. To carry on farming to advantage, to keep accounts correctly, _method_ is indispensable.

**2.** Way; manner. Let us know the nature of the disease, and the _method_ of cure.

**3.** Classification; arrangement of natural bodies according to their common characteristics; as the _method_ of Theophrast; the _method_ of Ray; the Linnean _method_

In natural arrangements a distinction is sometimes made between _method_ and system. System is an arrangement founded, throughout all its parts, on some one principle. _method_ is an arrangement less fixed and determinate, and founded on more general relations. Thus we say, the natural _method_ and the artificial or sexual system of Linne, though the latter is not a perfect system.
