# Money

**MONEY**, _noun_ _plural_ moneys.

**1.** Coin; stamped metal; any piece of metal, usually gold, silver or copper, stamped by public authority, and used as the medium of commerce. We sometimes give the name of _money_ to other coined metals, and to any other material which rude nations use a medium of trade. But among modern commercial nations, gold, silver and copper are the only metals used for this purpose. Gold and silver, containing great value in small compass, and being therefore of easy conveyance, and being also durable and little liable to diminution by use, are the most convenient metals for coin or _money_ which is the representative of commodities of all kinds, of lands, and of every thing that is capable of being transferred in commerce.

**2.** Bank notes or bills of credit issued by authority, and exchangeable for coin or redeemable, are also called money; as such notes in modern times represent coin, and are used as a substitute for it. If a man pays in hand for goods in bank notes which are current, he is said to pay in ready _money_

**3.** Wealth; affluence.

**MONEY** can neither open new avenues to pleasure, nor block up the passages of anguish.
