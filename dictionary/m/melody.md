# Melody

**MEL'ODY**, _noun_ \[Gr. a limb, or a song, an ode; Latin melos.\]

An agreeable succession of sounds; a succession of sounds so regulated and modulated as to please the ear. To constitute _melody_ the sounds must be arranged according to the laws of rhythms, measure, or the due proportion of the movements to each other. _melody_ differs from harmony, as it consists in the agreeable succession and modulation of sounds by a single voice; whereas harmony consists in the accordance of different voices or sounds. _melody_ is vocal or instrumental.

To make _melody_ in the heart, to praise God with a joyful and thankful disposition, ascribing to him the honor due to his name. [[Ephesians 5#19|Ephesians 5:19]].
