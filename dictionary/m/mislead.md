# Mislead

**MISLE'AD**, _verb transitive_ _preterit tense_ and _participle passive_ misled. \[See [[Lead]].\]

To lead into a wrong way or path; to lead astray; to guide into error; to cause to mistake; to deceive.

Trust not servants who _mislead_ or misinform you,

_But of the two, less dangerous is th' offense,_

To tire our patience, than _mislead_ our sense.
