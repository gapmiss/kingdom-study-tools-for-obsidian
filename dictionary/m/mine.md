# Mine

**MINE**, _adjective_ called sometimes a pronominal adj. \[Latin meus.\]

My; belonging to me. It was formerly used before nouns beginning with vowels. 'I kept myself from _mine_ iniquity.' [[Psalms 18#3|Psalms 18:3]]. But this use is no longer retained. We now use my before a vowel as well as before an articulation; as my iniquity. In present usage, my always precedes the noun, and _mine_ follows the noun, and usually the verb; as, this is my book; this book is mine; it is called my book; the book is called mine:it is acknowledged to be _mine_

**MINE** sometimes supplies the place of a noun. Your sword and _mine_ are different in construction.
