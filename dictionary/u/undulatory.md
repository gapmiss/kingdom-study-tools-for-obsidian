# Undulatory

**UN'DULATORY**, _adjective_ \[from undulate. Moving in the manner of waves; or resembling the motion of waves, which successively rise or swell and fall. We speak of the _undulatory_ motion of water, of air or other fluid, and this _undulatory_ motion of air is supposed to be the cause of sounds. This is sometimes called vibratory; but _undulatory_ seems to be most correct.
