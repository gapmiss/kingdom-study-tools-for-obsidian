# Unlucky

**UNLUCK'Y**, _adjective_

**1.** Unfortunate; not successful; as an _unlucky_ man.

**2.** Unfortunate; not resulting in success; as an _unlucky_ adventure; an _unlucky_ throw of dice; an _unlucky_ game.

\[This word is usually applied to incidents in which success depends on single events, to games of hazard, etc. rather than to things which depend on a long series of events, or on the ordinary course of providence. Hence we say, a man is _unlucky_ in play or in a lottery; but not that a farmer is _unlucky_ in his husbandry, or a commander _unlucky_ in the result of a campaign.\]

**3.** Unhappy; miserable; subject to frequent misfortunes.

**4.** Slightly mischievous; mischievously waggish; as an _unlucky_ boy; an _unlucky_ wag.

**5.** Ill omened; inauspicious.

Haunt me not with that _unlucky_ face.
