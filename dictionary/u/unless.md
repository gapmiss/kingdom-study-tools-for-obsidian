# Unless

**UNLESS**', _conjunction_

Except; that is, remove or dismiss the fact or thing stated in the sentence or clause which follows. 'We cannot thrive _unless_ we are industrious and frugal.' the sense will be more obvious with the clauses of the sentence inverted. _unless_ \[remove this fact, suppose it not to exist, \] we are industrious and frugal, we cannot thrive. _unless_ then answers for a negation. If we are not industrious, we cannot thrive.
