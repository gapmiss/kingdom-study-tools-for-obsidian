# Umbel

**UM'BEL**, _noun_ \[Latin umbella, a screen or fan.\]

In botany, a particular mode of inflorescence or flowering, which consists of a number of flower-stalks or rays, nearly equal in length, spreading from a common center, their summits forming a level, convex, or even globose surface, more rarely a concave one, as in the carrot. it is simple or compound; in the latter, each peduncle bears another little _umbel_ umbellet or umbellicle.

Umbel is sometimes called a rundle, from its roundness.
