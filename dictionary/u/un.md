# Un

**UN**, a prefix or inseparable preposition, _un_ or on, usually _un_ an, is the same word as the Latin in. It is a particle of negation, giving to words to which it is prefixed, a negative signification. We use _un_ or in indifferently for this purpose; and the tendency of modern usage is to prefer the use of in, in some words, where _un_ was formerly used. _un_ admits of no change of n into l, m or r, as in does, in illuminate, immense, irresolute. It is prefixed generally to adjectives and participles, and almost at pleasure. In a few instances, it is prefixed to verbs, as in unbend, unbind, unharness. As the compounds formed with _un_ are so common and so well known, the composition is not noticed under the several words. For the etymologies, see the simple words.
