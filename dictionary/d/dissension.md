# Dissension

**DISSENSION**, _noun_ \[Latin , to think.\] Disagreement in opinion, usually a disagreement which is violent, producing warm debates or angry words; contention in words; strife; discord; quarrel; breach of friendship and union.

Debates, dissensions, uproars are thy joy.

Paul and Barnabas had no small _dissension_ with them. [[Acts 15#2|Acts 15:2]].

We see dissensions in church and state, in towns, parishes, and families, and the word is sometimes applied to differences which produce war; as the dissensions between the houses of York and Lancaster in England.
