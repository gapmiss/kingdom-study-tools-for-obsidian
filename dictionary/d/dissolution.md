# Dissolution

**DISSOLUTION**, _noun_ \[Latin\] In a general sense, the separation of the parts of a body which, in the natural structure, are united; or the reduction of concrete bodies into their smallest parts, without regard to solidity or fluidity. Thus we speak of the _dissolution_ of salts in water, of metals in nitro-muriatic acid, and of ice or butter by heat; in which cases, the _dissolution_ is effected by a menstruum or particular agent. We speak so of the _dissolution_ of flesh or animal bodies, when the parts separate by putrefaction. _dissolution_ then is,

**1.** The act of liquefying or changing from a solid to a fluid state by heat; a melting; a thawing; as the _dissolution_ of snow and ice, which converts them into water.

**2.** The reduction of a body into its smallest parts, or into very minute parts, by a dissolvent or menstruum, as of a metal by nitro-muricatic acid, or of slats in water.

**3.** The separation of the parts of a body by putrefaction, or the analysis of the natural structure of mixed bodies, as of animal or vegetable substances; decomposition.

**4.** The substance formed by dissolving a body in a menstruum. \[This is now called a solution.\]

**5.** Death; the separation of the soul and body.

**6.** Destruction; the separation of the parts which compose a connected system, or body; as the _dissolution_ of the world, or of nature; the _dissolution_ of government.

**7.** The breaking up of an assembly, or the putting an end to its existence.

**DISSOLUTION** is the civil death of parliament.

**8.** Looseness of manners; dissipation. In this latter sense the word is obsolete, dissoluteness being substituted.

**9.** _dissolution_ of the blood, in medicine, that state of the blood, in which it does not readily coagulate, no its cooling out of the body, as in malignant fevers.
