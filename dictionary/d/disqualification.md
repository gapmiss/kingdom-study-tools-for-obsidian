# Disqualification

**DISQUALIFICATION**, _noun_ \[See [[Disqualify]].\]

**1.** The act of disqualifying; or that which disqualifies; that which renders unfit, unsuitable or inadequate; as, sickness is a _disqualification_ for labor or study.

**2.** The act of depriving of legal power or capacity; that which renders incapable; that which incapacitates in law; disability. Conviction of a crime is a _disqualification_ for office.

**3.** Want of qualification. It is used in this sense, though improperly. In strictness, _disqualification_ implies a previous qualification; but careless writers use it for the want of qualification, where no previous qualification is supposed. Thus, I must still retain the consciousness of those disqualifications, which you have been pleased to overlook.
