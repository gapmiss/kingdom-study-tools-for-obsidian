**DRESS**, _verb transitive_ _preterit tense_ and _participle passive_ dressed or drest. \[Latin\]

**1.** To make straight or a straight line; to adjust to a right line. We have the primary sense in the military phrase, _dress_ your ranks. Hence the sense, to put in order.

**3.** To put in good order, as a wounded limb; to cleanse a wound, and to apply medicaments. The surgeon dresses the limb or the wound.

**4.** To prepare, in a general sense; to put in the condition desired; to make suitable or fit; as, to _dress_ meat; to _dress_ leather or cloth; to _dress_ a lamp; but we, in the latter case, generally use trim. To _dress_ hemp or flax, is to break and clean it.

**5.** To curry, rub and comb; as, to _dress_ a horse; or to break or tame and prepare for service, as used by Dryden; but this is unusual.

To _dress_ up, is to clothe pompously or elegantly; as, to _dress_ up with tinsel.
