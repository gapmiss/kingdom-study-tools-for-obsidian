# Deism

**DEISM**, _noun_ \[Latin God.\] The doctrine or creed of a deist; the belief or system of religious opinions of those who acknowledge the existence of one God, but deny revelation: or _deism_ is the belief in natural religion only, or those truths, in doctrine and practice, which man is to discover by the light of reason, independent and exclusive of any revelation from God. Hence _deism_ implies infidelity or a disbelief in the divine origin of the scriptures.

The view which the rising greatness of our country presents to my eyes, is greatly tarnished by the general prevalence of _deism_ which, with me, is but another name for vice and depravity. P. Henry, Wirys Sketches.
