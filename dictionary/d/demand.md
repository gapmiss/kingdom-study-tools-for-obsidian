**1.** To ask or call for, as one who has a claim or right to receive what is sought; to claim or seek as due by right. The creditor demands principal and interest of his debt. Here the claim is derived from law or justice.

**2.** To ask by authority; to require; to seek or claim an answer by virtue of a right or supposed right in the interrogator, derived from his office, station, power or authority.

In French, demander generally signifies simply to ask, request, or petition, when the answer or thing asked for, is a matter of grace or courtesy. But in English, _demand_ is now seldom used in that sense, and rarely indeed can the French demander be rendered correctly in English by _demand_ except in the case of the seller of goods, who demands, \[asks, requires, \] a certain price for his wares. The common expression, a king sent to _demand_ another kings daughter in marriage, is improper.
