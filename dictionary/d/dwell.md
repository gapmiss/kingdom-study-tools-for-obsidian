# Dwell

**DWELL**, _verb intransitive_ _preterit tense_ dwelled, usually contracted into dwelt. \[See [[Dally]].\]

**1.** To abide as a permanent resident, or to inhabit for a time; to live in a place; to have a habitation for some time or permanence.

God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall _dwell_ in the tents of Shem. [[Genesis 9#27|Genesis 9:27]].

**DWELL** imports a residence of some continuance. We use abide for the resting of a night or an hour; but we never say, he dwelt in a place a day or a night. _dwell_ may signify a residence for life or for a much shorter period, but not for a day. In scripture, it denotes a residence of seven days during the feast of tabernacles.

Ye shall _dwell_ in booths seven days. [[Leviticus 23#42|Leviticus 23:42]].

The word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. [[John 1#38|John 1:38]].

**2.** To be in any state or condition; to continue.

To _dwell_ in doubtful joy.

**3.** To continue; to be fixed in attention; to hang upon with fondness.

The attentive queen dwelt on his accents.

They stand at a distance, dwelling on his looks and language, fixed in amazement.

**4.** To continue long; as, to _dwell_ on a subject, in speaking, debate or writing; to _dwell_ on a note in music.

**DWELL**, as a verb transitive, is not used. We who _dwell_ this wild, in Milton, is not a legitimate phrase.
