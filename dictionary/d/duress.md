# Duress

**DURESS**, _noun_ \[Latin See [[Durable]].\]

**1.** Literally, hardship; hence, constraint. Technically, _duress_ in law, is of two kinds; _duress_ of imprisonment, which is imprisonment or restraint of personal liberty; and _duress_ by menaces or threats \[per minas, \] when a person is threatened with loss of life or limb. Fear of battery is no _duress_ _duress_ then is imprisonment or threats intended to compel a person to do a legal act, as to execute a deed; or to commit an offense; in which cases the act is voidable or excusable.

**2.** Imprisonment; restraint of liberty.
