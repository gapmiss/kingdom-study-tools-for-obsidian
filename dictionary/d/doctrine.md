# Doctrine

**DOCTRINE**, _noun_ \[Latin , to teach.\]

**1.** In a general sense, whatever is taught. Hence, a principle or position in any science; whatever is laid down as true by an instructor or master. The doctrines of the gospel are the principles or truths taught by Christ and his apostles. The doctrines of Plato are the principles which he taught. Hence a _doctrine_ may be true or false; it may be a mere tenet or opinion.

**2.** The act of teaching.

He taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his _doctrine_ [[Mark 4#2|Mark 4:2]].

**3.** Learning; knowledge.

Whom shall he make to understand doctrine? [[Isaiah 28#9|Isaiah 28:9]].

**4.** The truths of the gospel in general.

That they may adorn the _doctrine_ of God our Savior in all things. [[Titus 2#1|Titus 2:1]].
