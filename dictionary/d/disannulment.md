# Disannulment

**DISANNULMENT**, _noun_ The act of making void; as the _disannulment_ of a law or decree.

Disannual differs from repeal, as the genus from the species. A repeal makes a law void by the same power that enacted it. Annulment or _disannulment_ destroys its force and authority by repeal or by other means.
