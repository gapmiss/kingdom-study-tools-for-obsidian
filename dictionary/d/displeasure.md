# Displeasure

**DISPLEASURE**, _noun_ Displezhur.

**1.** Some irritation or uneasiness of the mind, occasioned by any thing that counteracts desire or command, or which opposes justice and a sense of propriety. A man incurs the _displeasure_ of another by thwarting his views or schemes; a servant incurs the _displeasure_ of his master by neglect or disobedience; we experience _displeasure_ at any violation of right or decorum. _displeasure_ is anger, but it may be slight anger. It implies disaprobation or hatred, and usually expresses less than vexation and indignation. Thus, slighter offenses give _displeasure_ although they may not excite a violent passion.

**2.** Offense; cause of irritation.

Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a _displeasure_ [[Judges 15#3|Judges 15:3]].

**3.** State of disgrace or disfavor.

He went into Poland, being in _displeasure_ with the pope for overmuch familiarity.
