# Deformity

**DEFORMITY**, _noun_

**1.** Any unnatural state of the shape or form; want of that uniformity or symmetry which constitutes beauty; distortion; irregularity of shape or features; disproportion of limbs; defect; crookedness, etc. Hence, ugliness; as bodily _deformity_

**2.** Any thing that destroys beauty, grace or propriety; irregularity; absurdity; gross deviation from order, or the established laws of propriety. Thus we speak of _deformity_ in an edifice, or _deformity_ of character.
