**DOCK**, _noun_ A broad deep trench on the side of a harbor, or bank of a river, in which ships are built or repaired. A dry _dock_ has flood-gates to admit the tide, and to prevent the influx, as occasion may require. Wet docks have no flood-gates, but ships may be repaired in them during the recess of the tide. Wet docks are also constructed with gates to deep the water in at ebb tide, so that vessels may lie constantly afloat in them. In America, the spaces between wharves are called docks.
