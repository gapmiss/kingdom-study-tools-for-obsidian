# Death

**DEATH**, _noun_ deth.

**1.** That state of a being, animal or vegetable, but more particularly of an animal, in which there is a total and permanent cessation of all the vital functions, when the organs have not only ceased to act, but have lost the susceptibility of renewed action. Thus the cessation of respiration and circulation in an animal may not be _death_ for during hybernation some animals become entirely torpid, and some animals and vegetables may be subjected to a fixed state by frost, but being capable of revived activity, they are not dead.

**2.** The state of the dead; as the gates of _death_ [[Job 38#17|Job 38:17]].

**3.** The manner of dying.

Thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. [[Ezekiel 28#8|Ezekiel 28:8]].

Let me die the _death_ of the righteous. [[Numbers 23#10|Numbers 23:10]].

**4.** The image of mortality represented by a skeleton; as a death's head.

**5.** Murder; as a man of _death_

**6.** Cause of _death_

O thou man of God, there is _death_ in the pot. [[2 Kings 4#40|2 Kings 4:40]].

We say, he caught his _death_

**7.** Destroyer or agent of death; as, he will be the _death_ of his poor father.

**8.** In poetry, the means or instrument of death; as an arrow is called the feathered death; a ball, a leaden _death_

**DEATH**s invisible come winged with fire.

**9.** In theology, perpetual separation from God, and eternal torments; called the second _death_ [[Revelation 2#10|Revelation 2:10]].

**10.** Separation or alienation of the soul from God; a being under the dominion of sin, and destitute of grace or divine life; called spiritual _death_

We know that we have passed from _death_ to life, because we love the brethren. [[John 3#1|John 3:1]].

Civil _death_ is the separation of a man from civil society, or from the enjoyment of civil rights; as by banishment, abjuration of the realm, entering into a monastery, etc.
