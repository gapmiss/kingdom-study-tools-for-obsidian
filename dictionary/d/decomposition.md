# Decomposition

**DECOMPOSI'TION**, _noun_

**1.** Analysis; the act of separating the constituent parts of a substance, which are chimically combined. _decomposition_ differs from mechanical division, as the latter effects no change in the properties of the body divided, whereas the parts chimically decomposed have properties very different from those of the substance itself.

**2.** A second composition.
