# Damsel

**DAM'SEL**, _noun_ A young woman. Formerly, a young man or woman of noble or genteel extraction; as _damsel_ Pepin; _damsel_ Richard, prince of Wales. It is now used only of young women, and is applied to any class of young unmarried women, unless to the most vulgar, and sometimes to country girls.

With her train of damsels she was gone. Dryden.

Then Boaz said, whose _damsel_ is this? [[Ruth 2#5|Ruth 2:5]].

This word is rarely used in conversation, or even in prose writings of the present day; but it occurs frequently in the scriptures, and in poetry.
