# Demonstrate

**DEMONSTRATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin To show.\]

**1.** To show or prove to be certain; to prove beyond the possibility of doubt; to prove in such a manner as to reduce the contrary position to evident absurdity. We _demonstrate_ a problem in geometry, or a proposition in ethics, by showing that the contrary is absurd or impossible.

**2.** In anatomy, to exhibit the parts when disected.
