# Distinguish

**DISTINGUISH**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin Gr. The primary sense is, to prick, to pierce with a sharp point, to thrust in or on; and we retain the precise word in the verb, to stick, which see. The practice of making marks by puncturing, or sticking, gave rise to the applications of this word, as such marks were used to note and ascertain different things, to _distinguish_ them. See _distinguish_ \]
