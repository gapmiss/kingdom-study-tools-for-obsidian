# Dike

**DIKE**, _noun_ \[G. See [[Dig]]. It is radically the same word as ditch, and this is its primary sense; but by an easy transition, it came to signify also the bank formed by digging and throwing up earth. Intrenchment is sometimes used both for a ditch and a rampart.\]

**1.** A ditch; an excavation made in the earth by digging, of greater length than breadth, intended as a reservoir of water, a drain, or for other purpose.

**2.** A mound of earth, of stones, or of other materials, intended to prevent low lands, from being inundated by the sea or a river. The low countries of Holland are thus defended by dikes.

**3.** A vein of basalt, greenstone or other stony substance.

**DIKE**, _verb transitive_ To surround with a dike; to secure by a bank.

**DIKE**, _verb intransitive_ To dig. \[Not in use.\]
