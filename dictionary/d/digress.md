# Digress

**DIGRESS**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin , to step. See [[Grade]].\]

**1.** Literally, to step or go from the way or road; hence, to depart or wander from the main subject, design or tenor of a discourse, argument or narration; used only of speaking or writing.

In the pursuit of an argument there is hardly room to _digress_ into a particular definition, as often as a man varies the signification of any term.

**2.** To go out of the right way or common track; to deviate; in a literal sense. \[Not now in use.\]
