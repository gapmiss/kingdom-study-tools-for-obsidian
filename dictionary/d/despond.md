# Despond

**DESPOND**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin To promise; literally, to throw to or forward.\]

**1.** To be cast down; to be depressed or dejected in mind; to fail in spirits.

I should despair, or at least _despond_

**2.** To lose all courage, spirit or resolution; to sink by loss of hope.

Others depress their own mind, and _despond_ at the first difficulty.

Note. The distinction between despair and _despond_ is well marked in the foregoing passage from Scott. But although despair implies a total loss of hope, which _despond_ does not, at least in every case, yet despondency is followed by the abandonment of effort, or cessation of action, and despair sometimes impelss to violent action, even to rage.
