# Decussated

**DECUSSATED**, _adjective_ Crossed; intersected. In botany, _decussated_ leaves and branches, are such as grow in pairs which alternately cross each other at right angles, or in a regular manner.

In rhetoric, a _decussated_ period is one that consists of two rising and two falling clauses, placed in alternate opposition to each other. For example, If impudence could effect as much in courts of justice, as insolence sometimes does in the country, Caesina would now yield to the impudence of Ebutius, as he then yielded to his insolent assault.
