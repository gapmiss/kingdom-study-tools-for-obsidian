# Disengage

**DISENGAGE**, _verb transitive_ \[dis and engage.\]

**1.** To separate, as a substance from any thing with which it is in union; to free; to loose; to liberate; as, to _disengage_ a metal from extraneous substances.

Caloric and light must be disengaged during the process.

**2.** To separate from that to which one adheres, or is attached; as, to _disengage_ a man from a party.

**3.** To disentangle; to extricate; to clear from impediments, difficulties or perplexities; as, to _disengage_ one from broils or controversies.

**5.** To free from any thing that commands the mind, or employs the attention; as, to _disengage_ the mind from study; to _disengage_ ones self from business.

**6.** To release or liberate from a promise or obligation; to set free by dissolving an engagement; as, the men, who were enlisted, are now disengaged; the lady, who had promised to give her hand in marriage, is disengaged. Let it be observed that disengaged properly implies previous engagement; and is not to be confounded with unengaged, which does not always imply prior engagement. This distinction is sometimes carelessly overlooked.
