# Disappoint

**DISAPPOINT**, _verb transitive_ \[dis and appoint; properly, to unfix or unsettle.\]

**1.** To defeat of expectation, wish, hope, desire or intention; to frustrate; to balk; to hinder from the possession or enjoyment of that which was intended, desired, hoped or expected. We say, a man is disappointed of his hopes or expectations, or his hopes, desires, intentions or expectations are disappointed. A bad season disappoints the farmer of his crops; a defeat disappoints an enemy of his spoil The man promised me a visit, by he disappointed me.

Without counsel purposes are disappointed. [[Proverbs 15#22|Proverbs 15:22]].

**2.** To frustrate; to prevent an effect intended.

The retiring foe shrinks from the wound, and disappoints the blow.
