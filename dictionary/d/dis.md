# Dis

**DIS**, a prefix or inseparable preposition, from the Latin, whence Fr. Des, Sp. _dis_ and de may in some instances be the same word contracted. _dis_ denotes separation, a parting from; hence it has the force of a privative and negative, as in disarm, disoblige, disagree. In some cases, it still signifies separation, as in distribute, disconnect.
