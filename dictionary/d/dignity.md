# Dignity

**DIGNITY**, _noun_ \[Latin , worthy.\]

**1.** True honor; nobleness or elevation of mind, consisting in a high sense of propriety, truth and justice, with an abhorrence of mean and sinful actions; opposed to meanness. In this sense, we speak of the _dignity_ of mind, and _dignity_ of sentiments. This _dignity_ is based on moral rectitude; all vice is incompatible with true _dignity_ of mind. The man who deliberately injures another, whether male or female, has no true _dignity_ of soul.

**2.** Elevation; honorable place or rank of elevation; degree of excellence, either in estimation, or in the order of nature. Man is superior in _dignity_ to brutes.

**3.** Elevation of aspect; grandeur of mein; as a man of native _dignity_

**4.** Elevation of deportment; as _dignity_ of manners or behavior.

**5.** An elevated office, civil or ecclesiastical, giving a high rank in society; advancement; preferment, or the rank attached to it. We say, a man enjoys his _dignity_ with moderation, or without haughtiness. Among ecclesiastics, _dignity_ is office or preferment joined with power or jurisdiction.

**6.** The rank or title of a nobleman.

**7.** In oratory, one of the three parts of elocution, consisting in the right use of tropes and figures.

**8.** In astrology, an advantage which a planet has on account of its being in some particular place of the zodiac, or in a particular station in respect to other planets.

**9.** A general maxim, or principle. \[Not used.\]
