# Distinction

**DISTINCTION**, _noun_ \[Latin\]

**1.** The act of separating or distinguishing.

**2.** A note or mark of difference. \[Seldom used.\]

**3.** Difference made; a separation or disagreement in kind or qualities, by which one thing is known from another. We observe a _distinction_ between matter and spirit; a _distinction_ between matter and spirit; a _distinction_ between the animal and vegetable kingdoms; a _distinction_ between good and evil, right and wrong; between sound reasoning and sophistry.

**4.** Difference regarded; separation; preference; as in the phrase, without _distinction_ which denotes promiscuously, all together, alike.

Maids, women, wives, without _distinction_ fall.

**5.** Separation; division; as the _distinction_ of tragedy into acts.

\[In this sense, division would be preferable.\]

**6.** Notation of difference; discrimination; as a _distinction_ between real and apparent good.

In classing the qualities of actions, it is necessary to make accurate distinctions.

**7.** Eminence; superiority; elevation of rank in society, or elevation of character; honorable estimation. Men who hold a high rank by birth or office, and men who are eminent fro their talents, services or worth, are called men of _distinction_ as being raised above others by positive institutions or by reputation. So we say, a man of note.

**8.** That which confers eminence or superiority; office, rank or public favor.

**9.** Discernment; judgment.
