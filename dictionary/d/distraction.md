# Distraction

**DISTRACTION**, _noun_ \[Latin\]

**1.** The act of distracting; a drawing apart; separation.

**2.** Confusion from a multiplicity of objects crowding on the mind and calling the attention different ways; perturbation of mind; perplexity; as, the family was in a state of _distraction_ \[See [[1 Corinthians 7#35|1 Corinthians 7:35]]\]

**3.** Confusion of affairs; tumult; disorder; as political distractions.

Never was known a night of such _distraction_

**4.** Madness; a state of disordered reason; franticness; furiousness. \[We usually apply this word to a state of derangement which produces raving and violence in the patient.\]

On the supposition of the truth of the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, irreligion is nothing better than _distraction_
