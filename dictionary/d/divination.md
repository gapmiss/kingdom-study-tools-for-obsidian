# Divination

**DIVINATION**, _noun_ \[Latin , to foretell. See [[Divine]].\]

**1.** The act of divining; a foretelling future events, or discovering things secret or obscure, by the aid of superior beings, or by other than human means. The ancient heathen philosophers divided _divination_ into two kinds, natural and artificial. Natural _divination_ was supposed to be effected by a kind of inspiration or divine afflatus; artificial _divination_ was effected by certain rites, experiments or observations, as by sacrifices, cakes, flour, wine, observation of entrails, flight of birds, lots, verses, omens, position of the stars, etc.

**2.** Conjectural presage; prediction.
