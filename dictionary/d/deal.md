**DEAL**, n,

**1.** Literally, a division; a part or portion; hence, an indefinite quantity, degree or extent; as a _deal_ of time and trouble; a _deal_ of cold; a _deal_ of space. Formerly it was limited by some, as some deal; but this is now obsolete or vulgar. In general, we now qualify the word with great, as a great _deal_ of labor; a great _deal_ of time and pains; a great _deal_ of land. In the phrases, it is a great _deal_ better or worse, the words, great _deal_ serve as modifiers of the sense of better and worse. The true construction is, it is, by a great _deal_ better; it is better by a great _deal_ that is, by a great part or difference.
