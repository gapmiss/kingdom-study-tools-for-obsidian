# Dispensation

**DISPENSATION**, _noun_ \[Latin See [[Dispense]].\]

**1.** Distribution; the act of dealing out to different persons or places; as the _dispensation_ of water indifferently to all parts of the earth.

**2.** The dealing of God to his creatures; the distribution of good and evil, natural or moral, in the divine government.

Neither are Gods methods or intentions different in his dispensations to each private man.

**3.** The granting of a license, or the license itself, to do what is forbidden by laws or canons, or to omit something which is commanded; that is, the dispensing with a law or canon, or the exemption of a particular person from the obligation to comply with its injunctions. The pope has power to dispense with the canons of the church, but has no right to grant dispensations to the injury of a third person.

A _dispensation_ was obtained to enable Dr. Barrow to marry.

**4.** That which is dispensed or bestowed; a system of principles and rites enjoined; as the Mosaic dispensation; the gospel dispensation; including, the former the Levitical law and rites; the latter the scheme of redemption by Christ.
