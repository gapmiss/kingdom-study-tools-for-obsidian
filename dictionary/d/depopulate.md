# Depopulate

**DEPOPULATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin To ravage or lay waste.\] To dispeople; to unpeople; to deprive of inhabitants, whether by death, or by expulsion. It is not synonymous with laying waste or destroying, being limited to the loss of inhabitants; as, an army or a famine may _depopulate_ a country. It rarely expresses an entire loss of inhabitants, but often a great diminution of their numbers. The deluge nearly depopulated the earth.

**DEPOPULATE**, _verb intransitive_ To become dispeopled.
