# Discerpible

**DISCERPIBLE**, _adjective_ \[Latin , to seize, to tear. In some dictionaries it is written discerptible, on the authority of Glanville and More; and error indeed, but of little consequence, as the word is rarely or never used.\] That may be torn asunder; separable; capable of being disunited by violence.
