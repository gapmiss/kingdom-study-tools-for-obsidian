# Dispirit

**DISPIRIT**, _verb transitive_ \[dis and spirit.\]

**1.** To depress the spirits; to deprive of courage; to discourage; to dishearten; to deject; to cast down. We may be dispirited by afflictions, by obstacles to success, by poverty, and by fear. When fear is the cause, _dispirit_ is nearly equivalent to intimidate or terrify.

**2.** To exhaust the spirits or vigor of the body. \[Not usual.\]
