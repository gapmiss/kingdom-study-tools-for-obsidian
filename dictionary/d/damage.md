# Damage

**DAM'AGE**, _noun_ \[This word seems to be allied to the Greek, a fine or mulet.\]

**1.** Any hurt, injury or harm to one's estate; any loss of property sustained; any hinderance to the increase of property; or any obstruction to the success of an enterprise. A man suffers _damage_ by the destruction of his corn, by the burning of his house, by the detention of a ship which defeats a profitable voyage, or by the failure of a profitable undertaking. _damage_ then is any actual loss, or the prevention of profit. It is usually and properly applied to property, but sometimes to reputation and other things which are valuable. But in the latter case, injury is more correctly used.

**2.** The value of what is lost; the estimated equivalent for detriment or injury sustained; that which is given or adjudged to repair a loss. This is the legal signification of the word. It is the province of a jury to assess damages in trespass. In this sense, the word is generally used in the plural.

**DAM'AGE**, _verb transitive_ To hurt or harm; to injure; to impair; to lessen the soundness, goodness or value of. Rain may _damage_ corn or hay; a storm may _damage_ a ship; a house is often damaged by fire, when it is not destroyed; heavy rains _damage_ roads.

**DAM'AGE**, _verb intransitive_ To receive harm; to be injured or impaired in soundness, or value; as, green corn will _damage_ in a mow or stack.
