# Disabuse

**DISABUSE**, _verb transitive_ disabuze. \[See [[Abuse]].\] To free from mistake; to undeceive; to disengage from fallacy or deception; to set right. It is our duty to _disabuse_ ourselves of false notions and prejudices.

If men are now sufficiently enlightened to _disabuse_ themselves of artifice, hypocrisy and superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their history.
