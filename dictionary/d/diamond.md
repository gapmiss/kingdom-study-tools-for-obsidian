# Diamond

**DIAMOND**, _noun_ Dimond. \[Latin , Gr. See [[Adamant]].\]

**1.** A mineral, gem or precious stone, of the most valuable kind, remarkable for its hardness, as it scratches all other minerals. When pure, the _diamond_ is usually clear and transparent, but it is sometimes colored. In its rough state, it is commonly in the form of a roundish pebble, or of octahedral crystals. It consists of carbon, and when heated to 14 degrees Wedgewood, and exposed to a current of air, it is gradually, but completely combustible. When pure and transparent, it is said to be of the first water.

**2.** A very small printing letter.

**3.** A figure, otherwise called a rhombus.
