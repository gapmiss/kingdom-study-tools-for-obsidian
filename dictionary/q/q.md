# Q

**Q** is the seventeenth letter of the English Alphabet; an articulation borrowed from the oriental koph or qoph, Hebrew. It is supposed to be an articulation more deeply guttural than that of K; indeed it might have been pronounced as we pronounce qu; for we observe that in the Latin language, from which the moderns have borrowed the letter, it is always followed by u, as it is in English. This letter is not in the Greek alphabet. This letter is superfluous; for ku or koo, in English, have precisely the same sounds as qu. It is alleged that in expressing _q_ the cheeks are contracted, and the lips put into a canular form, for the passage of the breath; circumstances which distinguish it from k. This appears to be a mistake. This position of the organs is entirely owing to the following letter u; and kuestion and question are pronounced precisely alike, and with the same configuration of the organs. It appears then that _q_ is precisely k, with this difference in use, that _q_ is always followed by u in English, and k is not. _q_ never ends an English word.

As a numeral, _q_ stands for 500, and with a dash above the _q_ for 500, 000.

Used as an abbreviation, _q_ stands for quantity, or quantum; as among physicians, _q_ pl. quantum placet, as much as you please; _q_ s quantum sufficit, as much as is required, or as is sufficient.

Among mathematicians, _q_ E.D. stands for quod erat demonstrandum, which was to be demonstrated; _q_ E.F. quod erat faciendum, which was to be done.

In English, _q_ is an abbreviation for question.
