**QUICK'LIME**, _noun_ \[See [[Lime]].\] Any calcarious substance deprived of its fixed or carbonic air, or an earthy substance calcined; as chalk, limestone, oyster-shells, etc.; unslaked lime. Calcarious stones and shells are reduced to _quicklime_ by being subjected for a considerable time to intense heat, which expels the carbonic and aqeuous matter.
