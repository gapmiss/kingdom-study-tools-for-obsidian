# Quoth

**QUOTH**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin inquio, contracted.\]

To say; to speak. This verb is defective, being used only in the first and third persons in the present and past tenses, as _quoth_ I, _quoth_ he, and the nominative always follows the verb. It is used only in ludicrous language, and has no variation for person, number or tense.
