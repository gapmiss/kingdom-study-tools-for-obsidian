# Qualification

**QUALIFICA'TION**, _noun_

**1.** Any natural endowment or any acquirement which fits a person for a place, office or employment, or enables him to sustain any character with success. Integrity and talents should be considered as indispensable qualifications for men entrusted with public affairs; but private interest and party-spirit will often dispense with these and all other qualifications.

There is no _qualification_ for government but virtue and wisdom, actual or presumptive.

**2.** Legal power or requisite; as the qualifications of electors.

**3.** Abatement; diminution.

**4.** Modification; restriction; limitation. words or expressions may be used in a general sense, without any _qualification_
