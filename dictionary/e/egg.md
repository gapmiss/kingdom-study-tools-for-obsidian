# Egg

**EGG**, _noun_ \[Latin ovum, by a change of g into v.\] A body formed in the females of fowls and certain other animals, containing an embryo or fetus of the same species, or the substance from which a like animal is produced. The eggs of fowls when laid are covered with a shell, and within is the white or albumen, which incloses the yolk or yellow substance. The eggs of fish and some other animals are united by a viscous substance, and called spawn. Most insects are oviparous.

**EGG**, to incite, is a more blunder. \[See [[Edge]].\]
