**EXPLO'RE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin exploro; ex and ploro, to cry out, to wail, to bawl. The compound appears to convey a very different sense from the simple verb ploro; but the primary sense is to stretch, strain, drive; applied to the voice, it is to strain or press out sounds or words; applied to the eyes, it is to stretch or reach, as in prying curiosity.\]

**1.** To search for making discovery; to view with care; to examine closely by the eye.

Moses sent spies to _explore_ the land of Canaan.

**2.** To search by any means; to try; as, to _explore_ the deep by a plummet or lead.

**3.** To search or pry into; to scrutinize; to inquire with care; to examine closely with a view to discover truth; as, to _explore_ the depths of science.
