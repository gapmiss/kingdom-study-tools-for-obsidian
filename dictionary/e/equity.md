# Equity

**EQ'UITY**, _noun_ \[Latin oequitas, from oequus, equal, even, level.\]

**1.** Justice; right. In practice, _equity_ is the impartial distribution of justice, or the doing that to another which the laws of God and man, and of reason, give him a right to claim. It is the treating of a person according to justice and reason.

The Lord shall judge the people with _equity_ [[Psalms 98#9|Psalms 98:9]].

With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with _equity_ [[Isaiah 11#4|Isaiah 11:4]].

**2.** Justice; impartiality; a just regard to right or claim; as, we must, in _equity_ allow this claim.

**3.** In law, an equitable claim. 'I consider the wife's _equity_ to be too well settled to be shaken.'

**4.** In jurisprudence, the correction or qualification of law, when too severe or defective; or the extension of the words of the law to cases not expressed, yet coming within the reason of the law. Hence a court of _equity_ or chancery, is a court which corrects the operation of the literal text of the law, and supplies its defects, by reasonable construction, and by rules of proceeding and deciding, which are not admissible in a court of law. _equity_ then is the law of reason, exercised by the chancellor or judge, giving remedy in cases to which the courts of law are not competent.

**5.** _equity_ of redemption, in law, the advantage, allowed to a mortgager, of a reasonable time to redeem lands mortgaged, when the estate is of greater value than the sum for which it was mortgaged.
