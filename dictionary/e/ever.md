# Ever

**EV'ER**, _adverb_ At any time; at any period or point of time, past or future. Have you _ever_ seen the city of Paris, or shall you _ever_ see it?

No man _ever_ yet hated his own flesh. [[Ephesians 5#29|Ephesians 5:29]].

**1.** At all times; always; continually.

He shall _ever_ love, and always be

The subject of my scorn and cruelty.

He will _ever_ by mindful of his covenant. [[Psalms 111#3|Psalms 111:3]].

Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. [[2 Timothy 3#7|2 Timothy 3:7]].

**2.** Forever, eternally; to perpetuity; during everlasting continuance.

This is my name forever. [[Exodus 3#15|Exodus 3:15]].

In a more lax sense, this word signifies continually, for an indefinite period.

His master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him forever. [[Exodus 21#6|Exodus 21:6]].

These words are sometimes repeated, for the sake of emphasis; forever and _ever_ or forever and forever.

**3.** _ever_ and anon, at one time and another; now and then.

**4.** In any degree. No man is _ever_ the richer or happier for injustice.

Let no man fear that creature _ever_ the less, because he sees the apostle safe from his poison.

In modern usage, this word is used for never, but very improperly.

_And all the question, wrangle e'er so long,_

Is only this, if God has placed him wrong.
