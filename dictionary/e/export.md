# Export

**EXPO'RT**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin exporto; ex and porto, to carry. Porto seems allied to fero, and Eng. bear.\]

To carry out; but appropriately, and perhaps exclusively, to convey or transport, in traffic, produce and goods from one country to another, or from one state or jurisdiction to another, either by water or land. We _export_ wares and merchandize from the United States to Europe. The Northern States _export_ manufactures to South Carolina and Georgia. Goods are exported from Persia to Syria and Egypt on camels.

**EX'PORT**, _noun_ A commodity actually conveyed from one country or state to another in traffic, or a commodity which may be exported; used chiefly in the plural, exports. We apply the word to goods or produce actually carried abroad, or to such as are usually exported in commerce.
