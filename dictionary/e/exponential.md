**EXPONEN'TIAL**, _adjective_ _exponential_ curves are such as partake both of the nature of algebraic and transcendental ones. They partake of the former, because they consist of a finite number of terms, though these terms themselves are indeterminate; and they are in some measure transcendental, because they cannot be algebraically constructed.
