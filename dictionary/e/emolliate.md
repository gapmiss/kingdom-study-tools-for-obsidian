# Emolliate

**EMOL'LIATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin emollio, mollio, to soften; mollis, soft; Eng. mellow, mild.\]

To soften; to render effeminate.

Emolliated by four centuries of Roman domination, the Belgic colonies had forgotten their pristine valor.

\[This is a new word, though well formed and applied; but what connection is there between softening and forgetting? Lost is here the proper word for forgotten.\]
