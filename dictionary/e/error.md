# Error

**ER'ROR**, _noun_ \[Latin _error_ from erro, to wander.\] A wandering or deviation from the truth; a mistake in judgment, by which men assent to or believe what is not true. _error_ may be voluntary, or involuntary. Voluntary, when men neglect or pervert the proper means to inform the mind; involuntary, when the means of judging correctly are not in their power. An _error_ committed through carelessness or haste is a blunder.
