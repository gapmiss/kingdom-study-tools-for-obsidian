# Ebullition

**EBULLI'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin ebullitio, from ebullio, bullio; Eng. to boil, which see.\]

**1.** The operation of boiling; the agitation of a liquor by heat, which throws it up in bubbles, or more properly, the agitation produced in a fluid by the escape of a portion of it, converted into an aeriform state by heat. _ebullition_ is produced by the heat of fire directly applied, or by the heat or caloric evolved by any substance in mixture. Thus, in slaking lime, the caloric set at liberty by the a absorption of water, produces _ebullition_

**2.** Effervescence, which is occasioned by fermentation, or by any other process which causes the extrication of an aeriform fluid, as in the mixture of an acid with a carbonated alkali.
