# Elixir

**ELIX'IR**, _noun_

**1.** In medicine, a compound tincture, extracted from two or more ingredients. A tincture is drawn from one ingredient; an _elixir_ from several. But tincture is also applied to a composition of many ingredients. An _elixir_ is a liquid medicine made by a strong infusion, where the ingredients are almost dissolved in the menstruum, and give it a thicker consistence than that of a tincture.

**2.** A liquor for transmuting metals into gold.

**3.** Quintessence; refined spirit.

**4.** Any cordial; that substance which invigorates.
