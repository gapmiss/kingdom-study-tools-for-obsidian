# Envoy

**EN'VOY**, _noun_ \[Latin via; Eng. way, contracted from viag, vag, or wag.\]

**1.** A person deputed by a prince or government, to negotiate a treaty, or transact other business, with a foreign prince or government. We usually apply the word to a public minister sent on a special occasion, or for one particular purpose; hence an _envoy_ is distinguished from an embassador or permanent resident at a foreign court, and is of inferior rank. But envoys are ordinary and extraordinary, and the word may sometimes be applied to resident ministers.

**2.** A common messenger. \[Not in use.\]

**3.** Formerly, a postscript sent with compositions, to enforce them.
