# Eternity

**ETER'NITY**, _noun_ \[Latin oeternitas.\] Duration or continuance without beginning or end.

By repeating the idea of any length of duration, with the endless addition of number, we come by the idea of _eternity_

The high and lofty one who inhabiteth _eternity_ [[Isaiah 57#15|Isaiah 57:15]].

We speak of eternal duration preceding the present time. God has existed from _eternity_ We also speak of endless or everlasting duration in future, and dating from present time or the present state of things. Some men doubt the _eternity_ of future punishment, though they have less difficulty in admitting the _eternity_ of future rewards.
