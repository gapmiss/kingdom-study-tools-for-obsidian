# Expectation

**EXPECTA'TION**, _noun_ \[Latin expectatio.\] The act of expecting or looking forward to a future event with at least some reason to believe the event will happen. _expectation_ differs from hope. Hope originates in desire, and may exist with little or no ground of belief that the desired event will arrive. _expectation_ is founded on some reasons which render the event probably. Hope is directed to some good; _expectation_ is directed to good or evil.

The same weakness of mind which indulges absurd expectations, produces petulance in disappointment.

**1.** The state of expecting, either with hope or fear.

**2.** Prospect of good to come.

My soul, wait thou only on God, for my _expectation_ is from him. [[Psalms 62#5|Psalms 62:5]],

**3.** The object of expectation; the expected Messiah.

**4.** A state or qualities in a person which excite expectations in others of some future excellence; as a youth of _expectation_

We now more generally say, a youth of promise.

**5.** In chances, _expectation_ is applied to contingent events, and is reducible to computation. A sum of money in _expectation_ when an event happens, has a determinate value before that event happens. If the chances of receiving or not receiving a hundred dollars, when an event arrives, are equal; then, before the arrival of the event, the _expectation_ is worth half the money.
