# Enchant

**ENCH'ANT**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin incanto; in and canto, to sing. See [[Chant and Cant]].\]

**1.** To practice sorcery or witchcraft on any thing; to give efficacy to any thing by songs of sorcery, or fascination.

_And now about the cauldron sing,_

Like elves and fairies in a ring,

Enchanting all that you put in.
