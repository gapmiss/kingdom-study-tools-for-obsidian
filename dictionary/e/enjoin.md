# Enjoin

**ENJOIN**', _verb transitive_ \[Latin injungo. See [[Join]]. We observe that the primary sense of join is to set, extend or lay to, to throw to or on; otherwise the sense of order or command could not spring from it.To _enjoin_ is to set or lay to or on.\]

**1.** To order or direct with urgency; to admonish or instruct with authority; to command. Says Johnson, 'this word is more authoritative than direct, and less imperious than command.' It has the force of pressing admonition with authority; as, a parent enjoins on his children the duty of obedience. But it has also the sense of command; as the duties enjoined by God in the moral law.

**2.** In law, to forbid judicially; to issue or direct a legal injunction to stop proceedings.

This is a suit to _enjoin_ the defendants from disturbing the plaintiffs.
