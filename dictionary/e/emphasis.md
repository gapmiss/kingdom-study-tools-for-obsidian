# Emphasis

**EM'PHASIS**, _noun_ In rhetoric, a particular stress of utterance, or force of voice, given to the words or parts of a discourse, whose signification the speaker intends to impress specially upon his audience; or a distinctive utterance of words, specially significant, with a degree and kind of stress suited to convey their meaning in the best manner.

The province of _emphasis_ is so much more important than accent, that the customary seat of the latter is changed, when the claims of _emphasis_ require it.
