# Explode

**EXPLO'DE**, _verb intransitive_ \[Latin explodo; ex and plaudo, to utter a burst of sound, from the root of loud.\]

Properly, to burst forth, as sound; to utter a report with sudden violence. Hence, to burst and expand with force and a violent report, as an elastic fluid. We say, gun powder explodes, on the application of fire; a volcano explodes; a meteor explodes.

**EXPLO'DE**, _verb transitive_ To decry or reject with noise; to express disapprobation of, with noise or marks of contempt; as, to _explode_ a play on the state. Hence,

**1.** To reject with any marks of disapprobation or disdain; to treat with contempt, and drive from notice; to drive into disrepute; or in general, to condemn; to reject; to cry down. Astrology is now exploded.

**2.** To drive out with violence and noise. \[Little used.\]

The kindled powder exploded the ball.
