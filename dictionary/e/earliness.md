# Earliness

**EARLINESS**, _noun_ er'liness. \[See [[Early and Ere]].\]

A state of advance or forwardness; a state of being before anything, or at the beginning; as the _earliness_ of rising in the morning is a rising at the dawn of the morning, or before the usual time of rising. So we speak of the _earliness_ of spring, or the _earliness_ of plants, to express a state somewhat in advance of the usual time of spring, or growth of plants.
