# Efflorescence

**EFFLORES'CENCE**, _noun_ In botany, the time of flowering; the season when a plant shows its first blossoms.

**1.** Among physicians, a redness of the skin; eruptions; as in rash, measles, small pox, scarlatina, etc.

**2.** In chemistry, the formation of small white threads, resembling the sublimated matter called flower, on the surface of certain bodies, as salts. This is properly a shooting out of minute spicular crystals, called sometimes a saline vegetation, as that of the sulphate of magnesia on the deserts of Siberia, and of natron in Egypt. In butter much salted, the salt shoots in spiculae, and an _efflorescence_ is often seen on walls formed with plaster. In some species of salts, as in sulphate and carbonate of soda, the _efflorescence_ consists of a fine white dust. This kind of _efflorescence_ is the contrary of deliquescence. In the latter, the saline crystals decompose the air, or rather abstract moisture from it; in the former, the atmosphere decomposes the saline crystals, and the water of crystallization is abstracted from the salts.
