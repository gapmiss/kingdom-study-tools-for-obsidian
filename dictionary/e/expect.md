# Expect

**EXPECT**', _verb transitive_ \[Latin expecto; ex and specto, to look, that is, to reach forward, or to fix the eyes.\]

**1.** To wait for.

The guards,

By me encamp'd on yonder hill, expect

Their motion.

\[This sense, though often used by Gibbon, seems to be obsolescent.\]

**2.** To look for; to have a previous apprehension of something future, whether good or evil; to entertain at least a slight belief that an event will happen. We _expect_ a visit that has been promised. We _expect_ money will be paid at the time it is due, though we are often disappointed.

**EXPECT**, in its legitimate sense, always refers to a future event. The common phrase, I _expect_ it was, is a vulgar as it is improper.
