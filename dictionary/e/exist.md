# Exist

**EXIST**', _verb intransitive_ egzist'. \[Latin existo; ex and sisto, or more directly from Gr. to set, place or fix; Latin sto, to stand. The primary sense is to set, fix or be fixed, whence the sense of permanence, continuance.\]

**1.** To be; to have an essence or real being; applicable to matter or body, and to spiritual substances. A supreme being and first cause of all other beings must have existed from eternity, for no being can have created himself.

**2.** To live; to have life or animation. Men cannot _exist_ in water, nor fishes on land.

**3.** To remain; to endure; to continue in being. How long shall national enmities exist?
