# Elasticity

**ELASTIC'ITY**, _noun_ The inherent property in bodies by which they recover their former figure or state, after external pressure, tension or distortion. Thus elastic gum, extended, will contract to its natural dimensions, when the force is removed. Air, when compressed, will, on the removal of the compressing force, instantly dilate and fill its former space.
