# Elephantiasis

**ELEPHANTI'ASIS**, _noun_ \[Latin and Gr. from elephant.\]

A species of leprosy, so called from covering the skin with incrustations, like those of an elephant. It is a chronic and contagious disease, marked by a thickening and greasiness of the legs, with loss of hair and feeling, a swelling of the face, and a hoarse, nasal voice. It affects the whole body; the bones, as well as the skin, are covered with spots and tumors, at first red, but afterwards black.
