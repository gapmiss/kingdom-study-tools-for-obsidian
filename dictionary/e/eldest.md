# Eldest

**ELD'EST**, _adjective_ Oldest; most advanced in age; that was born before others; as the _eldest_ son or daughter. It seems to always applied to persons or at least to animals, and not to things. If ever applied to things, it must signify, that was first formed or produced, that has existed the longest time. But applied to things we use oldest.
