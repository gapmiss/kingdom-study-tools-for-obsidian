# Excepting

**EXCEPT'ING**, _participle present tense_ Taking or leaving out; excluding.

**1.** This word is also used in the sense of except, as above explained. The prisoners were all condemned, except in three. This is an anomalous use of the word, unless, in some cases, it may be referred to a pronoun. Excepted would be better: three excepted; three being excepted.
