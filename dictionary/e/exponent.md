# Exponent

**EXPO'NENT**, _noun_ \[Latin exponens; expono, to expose or set forth; ex and pono, to place.\]

**1.** In algebra, the number or figure which, placed above a root at the right hand, denotes how often that root is repeated, or how many multiplications are necessary to produce the power. Thus a\[2\] denotes the second power of the root a, or aa: a\[4\] denotes the fourth power. The figure is the _exponent_ or index of the power.

**2.** The _exponent_ of the ratio or proportion between two numbers or quantities, is the quotient arising when the antecedent is divided by the consequent. Thus six is the _exponent_ of the ratio of thirty to five.
