# Extricate

**EX'TRICATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin extrico. The primary verb trico is not in the Latin. We probably see its affinities in the Gr. hair, or a bush of hair, from interweaving, entangling. I suspect that three is contracted from this root; three for threg, folded, or a plexus. The same word occurs in intricate and intrigue; Eng. trick.

**1.** Properly, to disentangle; hence, to free from difficulties or perplexities; to disembarrass; as, to _extricate_ one from complicated business, from troublesome alliances or other connections; to _extricate_ one's self from debt.

**2.** To set out; to cause to be emitted or evolved.
