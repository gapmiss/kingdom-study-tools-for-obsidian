# Expatriate

**EXPAT'RIATE**, _verb transitive_ \[Latin ex and patria, country.\]

In a general sense, to banish.

To _expatriate_ one's self, is to quit one's country, renouncing citizenship and allegiance in that country, to take residence and become a citizen in another country. The right to _expatriate_ one's self is denied in feudal countries, and much controverted in the U. States.
