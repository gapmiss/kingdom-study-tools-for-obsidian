# Epitaph

**EP'ITAPH**, _noun_ \[Gr. a sepulcher.\]

**1.** An inscription on a monument, in honor or memory of the dead.

The epitaphs of the present day are crammed with fulsome compliments never merited.

Can you look forward to the honor of a decorated coffin, a splendid funeral, a towering monument--it may be a lying _epitaph_

**2.** An eulogy, in prose or verse, composed without any intent to be engraven on a monument, as that on Alexander:

'Sufficit huic tumulus, cui non sufficeret orbis.'
