# Evening

**E'VENING**, _noun_ \[See [[Eve]], Even.\] The latter part and close of the day, and the beginning of darkness or night; properly the decline or fall of the day, or of the sun.

The _evening_ and the morning were the first day. [[Genesis 1#5|Genesis 1:5]].

The precise time when _evening_ begins, or when it ends, is not ascertained by usage. The word often includes a part at least of the afternoon, and indeed the whole afternoon; as in the phrase, 'The morning and _evening_ service of the sabbath.' In strictness, _evening_ commences at the setting of the sun, and continues during twilight, and night commences with total darkness. But in customary language, the _evening_ extends to bed-time, whatever that time may be. Hence we say, to spend an _evening_ with a friend; an _evening_ visit.

**1.** The decline or latter part of life. We say, the _evening_ of life, or of one's days.

**2.** The decline of any thing; as the _evening_ of glory.

**E'VENING**, _adjective_ Being at the close of day; as the _evening_ sacrifice.

**E'VENING HYMN**,

**E'VENING SONG**, _noun_ A hymn or song to be sung at _evening_
