# Escurial

**ESCU'RIAL**, _noun_ The palace or residence of the King of Spain, about 15 miles North West of Madrid. This is the largest and most superb structure in the kingdom, and one of the most splendid in Europe. It is built in a dry barren spot, and the name itself is said to signify a place full of rocks.

The _escurial_ is a famous monastery built by Philip II in the shape of a gridiron, in honor of St. Laurence. It takes its name from a village near Madrid. It contains the king's palace, St. Laurence's church, the monastery of Jerenomites, and the free schools.
