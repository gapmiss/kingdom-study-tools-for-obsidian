# Ex

**EX**. A Latin preposition or prefix, Gr. signifying out of, out, proceeding from. Hence in composition, it signifies sometimes out of, as in exhale, exclude; sometimes off, from or out, as in Latin excindo, to cut off or out; sometimes beyond, as in excess, exceed, excel. In some words it is merely emphatical; in others it has little effect on the signification.
