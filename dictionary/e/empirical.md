# Empirical

**EMPIR'ICAL**, _adjective_ Pertaining to experiments or experience.

**1.** Versed in experiments; as an empiric alchimist.

**2.** Known only by experience; derived from experiment; used and applied without science; as empiric skill; empiric remedies.

I have avoided that _empirical_ morality that cures one vice by means of another.
