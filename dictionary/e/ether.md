# Ether

**E'THER**, _noun_ \[Latin oether; Gr. to burn, to shine; Eng. weather.\]

**1.** A thin, subtil matter, much finer and rarer than air, which, some philosophers suppose, begins from the limits of the atmosphere and occupies the heavenly space.

There fields of light and liquid _ether_ flow.

**2.** In chemistry, a very light, volatile and inflammable fluid, produced by the distillation of alcohol or rectified spirit of wine, with an acid. It is lighter than alcohol, of a strong sweet smell, susceptible of great expansion, and of a pungent taste. It is so volatile, that when shaken it is dissipated in an instant.
