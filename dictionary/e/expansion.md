# Expansion

**EXPAN'SION**, _noun_ \[Latin expansio.\] The act of expanding or spreading out.

**1.** The state of being expanded; the enlargement of surface or bulk; dilatation. We apply _expansion_ to surface, as the _expansion_ of a sheet or of a lake, and to bulk, as the _expansion_ of fluids or metals by heat; but not to a line or length without breadth.

**2.** Extent; space to which any thing is enlarged; also, pure space or distance between remote bodies.

**3.** Enlargement; as the _expansion_ of the heart or affections.
