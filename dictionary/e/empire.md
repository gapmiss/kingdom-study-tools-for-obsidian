# Empire

**EM'PIRE**, _noun_ \[Latin imperium; See [[Emperor]].\]

**1.** Supreme power in governing; supreme dominion; sovereignty; imperial power. No nation can rightfully claim the _empire_ of the ocean.

**2.** The territory, region or countries under the jurisdiction and dominion of an emperor. An _empire_ is usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, which may be and often is a territory of small extent. Thus we say, the Russian empire; the Austrian empire; the sovereigns of which are denominated emperors. The British dominions are called an _empire_ and since the union of Ireland, the parliament is denominated the imperial parliament, but the sovereign is called king. By custom in Europe, the _empire_ means the German empire; and in juridical acts, it is called the holy Roman _empire_ Hence, we say, the diet of the empire; the circles of the empire; etc. But the German _empire_ no longer exists; the states of Germany now form a confederacy.

**3.** Supreme control; governing influence; rule; sway; as the _empire_ of reason, or of truth.

**4.** Any region, land or water, over which dominion is extended; as the _empire_ of the sea.
