# Except

**EXCEPT**', _verb transitive_ \[Latin excipio; ex and capio, to take. See [[Caption]], Capture.\]

**1.** To take or leave out of any number specified; to exclude; as, of the thirty persons present and concerned in a riot, we must _except_ two.

**2.** To take or leave out any particular or particulars, from a general description.

When he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted who did put all things under him. [[1 Corinthians 14#5|1 Corinthians 14:5]].

**EXCEPT'**, _verb intransitive_ To object; to make an objection or objections; usually followed by to; sometimes by against. I _except_ to a witness, or to his testimony, on account of his interest or partiality.

**EXCEPT'**, _participle passive_ Contracted from excepted. Taken out; not included. All were involved in this affair, _except_ one; that is, one excepted, the case absolute or independent clause. _except_ ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish; that is, _except_ this fact, that ye repent, or this fact being excepted, removed, taken away, ye shall all likewise perish. Or _except_ may be considered as the imperative mode. _except_ thou or ye, this fact, ye shall all likewise perish. Hence _except_ is equivalent to without, unless, and denotes exclusion.
