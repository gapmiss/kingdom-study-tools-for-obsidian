# Emir

**E'MIR**, _noun_ \[Heb. to speak.\] A title of dignity among the Turks, denoting a prince; a title at first given to the Caliphs, but when they assumed the title of Sultan, that of _emir_ remained to their children. At length it was attributed to all who were judged to descend from Mohammed, by his daughter Fatimah.
