# Empiric

**EM'PIRIC**, _noun_ \[Gr. to attempt; Latin empiricus.\]

Literally, one who makes experiments. Hence its appropriate signification is, a physician who enters on practice without a regular professional education, and relies on the success of his own experience. Hence, the word is used also for a quack, an ignorant pretender to medical skill, a charlatan.
