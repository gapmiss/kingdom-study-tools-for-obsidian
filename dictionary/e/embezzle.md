# Embezzle

**EMBEZ'ZLE**, _verb transitive_ \[Heb. signifies to plunder.\]

**1.** To appropriate fraudulently to one's own use what is entrusted to one's care and management. It differs from stealing and robbery in this, that the latter imply a wrongful taking of another's goods, but embezzlement denotes the wrongful appropriation and use of what came into possession by right. It is not uncommon for men entrusted with public money to _embezzle_ it.

**2.** To waste; to dissipate in extravagance.

When thou hast embezzled all thy store.
