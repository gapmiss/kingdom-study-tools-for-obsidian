**2.** A person sent on a private message or business; a secret agent, employed to sound or ascertain the opinions of others, and to spread reports or propagate opinions favorable to his employer, or designed to defeat the measures or schemes of his opposers or foes; a spy; but an _emissary_ may differ from a spy. A spy in war is one who enters an enemy's camp or territories to learn the condition of the enemy; an _emissary_ may be a secret agent employed not only to detect the schemes of an opposing party, but to influence their councils. A spy in war must be concealed, or he suffers death; an _emissary_ may in some cases be known as the agent of an adversary, without incurring similar hazard.
