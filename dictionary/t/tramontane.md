**TRAMON'TANE**, _adjective_ \[Latin trans, beyond, and mons, mountain.\] Lying or being beyond the mountain; foreign; barbarous. The Italian painters apply this epithet to all such as live north of the Alps, as in Germany and France; and a north wind is called a _tramontane_ wind. The French lawyers call certain Italian canonists _tramontane_ or ultramontane doctors; considering them as favoring too much the court of Rome.
