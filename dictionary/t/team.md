# Team

**TEAM**, _noun_

**1.** Two or more horses, oxen or other beasts harnessed together to the same vehicle for drawing, as to a coach, chariot, wagon, cart, sled, sleigh and the like. It has been a great question whether teams of horses or oxen are most advantageously employed in agriculture. In land free from stones and stumps and of easy tillage, it is generally agreed that horses are preferable for teams.

**2.** Any number passing in a line; a long line.

Like a long _team_ of snowy swans on high.

\[This is the primary sense, but is rarely used.\]
