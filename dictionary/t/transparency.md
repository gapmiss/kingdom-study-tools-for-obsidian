**TRANSPA'RENCY**, _noun_ \[See [[Transparent]].\] That state or property of a body by which it suffers rays of light to pass through it, so that objects can be distinctly seen through it; diaphaneity. This is a property of glass, water and air, which when clear, admit the free passage of light. _transparency_ is opposed to opakeness.
