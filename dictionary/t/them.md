# Them

**THEM**, _pronoun_ the objective case of they, and of both genders. \[In our mother tongue, _them_ is an adjective, answering to the, in the dative and ablative cases of both numbers. The common people continue to use it in the plural number as an adjective, for they say, bring _them_ horses, or _them_ horses are to be led to water.\]

Go ye to _them_ that sell, and buy for yourselves. [[Matthew 25#2|Matthew 25:2]].

Then shall the king say to _them_ on his right hand, come, ye blessed of my Father-- [[Matthew 25#2|Matthew 25:2]].
