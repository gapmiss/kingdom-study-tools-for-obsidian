# Triangle

**TRI'ANGLE**, _noun_ \[Latin triangulum; tres, tria, three, and angulus, a corner.\] In geometry, a figure bounded by three lines, and containing three angles. The three angles of a _triangle_ are equal to two right angles, or the number of degrees in a semicircle.

If the three lines or sides of a _triangle_ are all right, it is a plane or rectilinear _triangle_

If all the three sides are equal, it is an equilateral _triangle_

If two of the sides only are equal, it is an isosceles or equicrural _triangle_

If all the three sides are unequal, it is a scalene or scalenous _triangle_

If one of the angles is a right angle, the _triangle_ is rectangular.

If one of the angles is obtuse, the _triangle_ is called obtusangular or amblygonous.

If all the angles are acute, the _triangle_ is acutangular or oxygonous.

If the three lines of a _triangle_ are all curves, the _triangle_ is said to be curvilinear.

If some of the sides are right and others curve, the _triangle_ is said to be mixtilinear.

If the sides are all arcs of great circles of the sphere, the _triangle_ is said to be spherical.
