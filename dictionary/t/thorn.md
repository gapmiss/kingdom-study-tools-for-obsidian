# Thorn

**THORN**, _noun_

**1.** A tree or shrub armed with spines or sharp ligneous shoots; as the black thorn; white _thorn_ etc. The word is sometimes applied to a bush with prickles; as a rose on a _thorn_

**2.** A sharp ligneous or woody shoot from the stem of a tree or shrub; a sharp process from the woody part of a plant; a spine. _thorn_ differs from prickle; the latter being applied to the sharp points issuing from the bark of a plant and not attached to the wood, as in the rose and bramble. But in common usage, _thorn_ is applied to the prickle of the rose, and in fact the two words are used promiscuously.

**3.** Any thing troublesome. St. Paul had a _thorn_ in the flesh. [[2 Corinthians 12#7|2 Corinthians 12:7]]. [[Numbers 33#55|Numbers 33:55]].

**4.** In Scripture, great difficulties and impediments.

I will hedge up thy way with thorns. Hosea 2.

**5.** Worldly cares; things which prevent the growth of good principles. [[Matthew 13#7|Matthew 13:7]].
