**TI'AR**

TIA'RA, _noun_ \[Latin tiara.\]

**1.** An ornament or article of dress with which the ancient Persians covered their heads; a kind of turban. As different authors describe it, it must have been of different forms. The kings of Persia alone had a right to wear it straight or erect; the lords and priests wore it depressed, or turned down on the fore side. Xenophon says the tiara was encompassed with the diadem, at least in ceremonials.

**2.** An ornament worn by the Jewish high priest. [[Exodus 28#1|Exodus 28:1]].

**3.** The pope's triple crown. The tiara and keys are the badges of the papal dignity; the tiara of his civil rank, and the keys of his jurisdiction. It was formerly a round high cap. It was afterward encompassed with a crown, then with a second and a third.
