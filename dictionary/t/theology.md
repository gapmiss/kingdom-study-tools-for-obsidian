# Theology

**THEOL'OGY**, _noun_ \[Gr. God, and discourse.\]

Divinity; the science of God and divine things; or the science which teaches the existence, character and attributes of God, his laws and government, the doctrines we are to believe, and the duties we are to practice. Theology consists of two branches, natural and revealed. _Natural theology_ is the knowledge we have of God from his works, by the light of nature and reason. _Revealed theology_ is that which is to be learned only from revelation.

_Moral theology_ teaches us the divine laws relating to our manners and actions, that is, our moral duties.

_Speculative theology_, teaches or explains the doctrines of religion, as objects of faith.

_Scholastic theology_ is that which proceeds by reasoning, or which derives the knowledge of several divine things from certain established principles of faith.
