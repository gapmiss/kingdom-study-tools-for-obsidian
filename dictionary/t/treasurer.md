**TREASURER**, _noun_ trezh'urer. One who has the care of a treasure or treasury; an officer who receives the public money arising from taxes and duties or other sources of revenue, takes charge of the same, and disburses it upon orders drawn by the proper authority. Incorporated companies and private societies have also their treasurers.

In England, the lord high _treasurer_ is the principal officer of the crown, under whose charge is all the national revenue.

The _treasurer_ of the household, in the absence of the lord-steward, has power with the controller and other officers of the Green-cloth, and the steward of the Marshalsea, to hear and determine treasons, felonies and other crimes committed within the king's palace. There is also the _treasurer_ of the navy, and the treasurers of the county.
