# Tall

**TALL**, _adjective_ \[Eng. dally; Latin tollo.\]

**1.** High in stature; long and comparatively slender; applied to a person, or to a standing tree, mast or pole. _tall_ always refers to something erect, and of which the diameter is small in proportion to the highth. We say, a _tall_ man or woman, a _tall_ boy for his age; a _tall_ tree, a _tall_ pole, a _tall_ mast; but we never say, a _tall_ house or a _tall_ mountain. The application of the word to a palace or its shadow, in Waller, is now improper.

Dark shadows cast, and as his palace _tall_

**2.** Sturdy; lusty; bold. \[Unusual.\]
