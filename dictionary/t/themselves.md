# Themselves

**THEMSELVES**, a compound of them and selves, and added to they by way of emphasis or pointed distinction. Thus we say, they _themselves_ have done the mischief; they cannot blame others. In this case, _themselves_ is in the nominative case, and maybe considered as an emphatical pronoun.

In some cases, _themselves_ is used without they, and strands as the only nominative to the following verb. _themselves_ have done the mischief.

This word is used also in the objective case after a verb or preposition. Things in _themselves_ innocent, may under certain circumstances cease to be so.

They open to _themselves_ at length the way.
