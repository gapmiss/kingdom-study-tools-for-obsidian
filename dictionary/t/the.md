# The

**THE**, an adjective or definitive adjective.

**1.** This adjective is used as a definitive, that is, before nouns which are specific or understood; or it is used to limit their signification to a specific thing or things, or to describe them; as _the_ laws of _the_ twelve tables. _the_ independent tribunals of justice in our country, are _the_ security or private rights, and _the_ best bulwark against arbitrary power. _the_ sun is _the_ source of light and heat.

This he calls _the_ preaching of _the_ cross.

**2.** _the_ is also used rhetorically before a noun in _the_ singular number, to denote a species by way of distinction; a single thing representing _the_ whole. _the_ fig tree putteth forth her green figs; _the_ almond tree shall flourish; _the_ grasshopper shall be a burden.

**3.** In poetry, _the_ sometimes loses _the_ final vowel before another vowel.

Th' adorning thee with so much art,

Is but a barb'rous skill.

**4.** _the_ is used before adjectives in _the_ comparative and superlative degree. _the_ longer we continue in sin, _the_ more difficult it is to reform. _the_ most strenuous exertions will be used to emancipate Greece. _the_ most we can do is to submit; _the_ best we can do; _the_ worst that can happen.
