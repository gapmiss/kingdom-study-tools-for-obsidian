# Theme

**THEME**, _noun_ \[Latin thema; Gr. to set or place.\]

**1.** A subject or topic on which a person writes or speaks. The preacher takes a text for the _theme_ of his discourse.

When a soldier was the _theme_ my name

Was not far off.

**2.** A short dissertation composed by a student.

**3.** In grammar, a radical verb, or the verb in its primary absolute sense, not modified by inflections; as the infinitive mode in English. But a large portion of the words called themes in Greek, are not the radical words, but are themselves derivative forms of the verb. The fact is the same in other languages.

**4.** In music, a series of notes selected as the text or subject of a new composition.
