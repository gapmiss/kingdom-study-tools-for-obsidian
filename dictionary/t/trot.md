**TROT**, _noun_ The pace of a horse or other quadruped, when he lifts one fore foot and the hind foot of the opposite side at the same time. This pace is the same as that of a walk, but more rapid. The _trot_ is often a jolting hard motion, but in some horses, it is as easy as the amble or pace, and has a more stately appearance.

**1.** An old woman; in contempt.
