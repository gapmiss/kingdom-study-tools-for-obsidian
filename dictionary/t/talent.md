# Talent

**TAL'ENT**, _noun_ \[Latin talentum; Gr. to bear, allied to Latin tollo. The word is said to have originally signified a balance or scales.\]

**1.** Among the ancients, a weight, and a coin. The true value of the _talent_ cannot well be ascertained, but it is known that it was different among different nations. The Attic _talent_ the weight, contained 60 Attic minae, or 6000 Attic drachmae, equal to 56 pounds, eleven ounces, English troy weight. The mina being reckoned equal to f3 4s.7d. sterling, or fourteen dollars and a third nearly, the _talent_ was of the value of f193 15s sterling, about $861 dollars. Other computations make it f225 sterling.

The Romans had the great _talent_ and the little talent; the great _talent_ is computed to be equal to f99 6s. 8d. sterling, and the little _talent_ to f75 sterling.

**2.** _talent_ among the Hebrews, was also a gold coin, the same with a shekel of gold; called also stater, and weighing only four drachmas.

But the Hebrew _talent_ of silver, called cicar, was equivalent to three thousand shekels, or one hundred and thirteen pounds, ten ounces and a fraction, troy weight.

**3.** Faculty; natural gift or endowment; a metaphorical application of the word, said to be borrowed from the Scriptural parable of the talents. [[Matthew 25#24|Matthew 25:24]].

He is chiefly to be considered in his three different talents, as a critic, a satirist, and a writer of odes.

'Tis not my _talent_ to conceal my thoughts.

**4.** Eminent abilities; superior genius; as, he is a man of talents.

\[Talent, in the singular, is sometimes used in a like sense.\]

**5.** Particular faculty; skill. He has a _talent_ at drawing.
