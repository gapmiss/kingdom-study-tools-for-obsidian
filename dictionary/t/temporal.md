**TEM'PORAL**, _adjective_ \[Latin temporalis, from tempus, time.\]

**1.** Pertaining to this life or this world or the body only; secular; as _temporal_ concerns; _temporal_ affairs. In this sense, it is opposed to spiritual. Let not _temporal_ affairs or employments divert the mind from spiritual concerns, which are far more important.

In this sense also it is opposed to ecclesiastical; as _temporal_ power, that is, secular, civil or political power; _temporal_ courts, those which take cognizance of civil suits. _temporal_ jurisdiction is that which regards civil and political affairs.

The things which are seen are _temporal_ but the things which are not seen are eternal. [[2 Corinthians 4#18|2 Corinthians 4:18]].
