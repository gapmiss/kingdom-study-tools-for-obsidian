# Theriac

**THE'RIAC**, _noun_ \[Latin theriaca; Gr. treacle.\] A name given by the ancients to various compositions esteemed efficacious against the effects of poison, but afterwards restrained chiefly to what has been called Theriaca Andromachi, or Venice-treacle, which is a compound of sixty four drugs, prepared, pulverized, and reduced by means of honey to an electuary.
