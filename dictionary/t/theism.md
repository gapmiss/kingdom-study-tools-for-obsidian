# Theism

**THE'ISM**, _noun_ \[from Gr. God.\] The belief or acknowledgment of the existence of a God, as opposed to atheism. _theism_ differs from deism, for although deism implies a belief in the existence of a God, yet it signifies in modern usage a denial of revelation, which _theism_ does not.
