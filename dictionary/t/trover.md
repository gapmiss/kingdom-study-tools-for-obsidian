# Trover

**TRO'VER**, _noun_ _trover_ is properly the finding of any thing. Hence,

**1.** In law, the gaining possession of any goods, whether by finding or by other means.

**2.** An action which a man has against another who has found or obtained possession of any of his goods, and who refuses to deliver them on demand. This is called an action of _trover_ and conversion. In this case, the _trover_ or finding is an immaterial fact, but the plaintiff must prove his own property, and the possession and conversion of the goods by the defendant.
