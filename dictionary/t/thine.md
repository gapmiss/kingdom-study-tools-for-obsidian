# Thine

**THINE**, pronominal adj. Thy; belonging to thee; relating to thee; being the property of thee. It was formerly used for thy, before a vowel.

Then thou mightest eat grapes thy fill, at _thine_ own pleasure. [[Deuteronomy 32#1|Deuteronomy 32:1]].

But in common usage, thy is now used before a vowel in all cases.

The principal use of _thine_ now is when a verb is interposed between this word and the noun to which it refers. I will not take any thing that is _thine_ _thine_ is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory.

In the following passage, _thine_ is used as a substitute for thy righteousness.

I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of _thine_ only. [[Psalms 71#2|Psalms 71:2]].

In some cases, it is preceded by the sign of the possessive case, like nouns, and is then also to be considered as a substitute.

If any of _thine_ be driven out to the utmost parts of heaven-- [[Deuteronomy 30#2|Deuteronomy 30:2]].

It is to be observed that _thine_ like thou, is used only in the solemn style. In familiar and common language, your and yours are always used in the singular number as well as the plural.
