# Theft

**THEFT**, _noun_ The act of stealing. In law, the private, unlawful, felonious taking of another person's goods or movables, with an intent to steal them. To constitute _theft_ the taking must be in private or without the owner's knowledge, and it must be unlawful or felonious, that is, it must be with a design to deprive the owner of his property privately and against his will. _theft_ differs from robbery, as the latter is a violent taking from the person, and of course not private.

**1.** The thing stolen. [[Exodus 22#3|Exodus 22:3]].

**THEFT'-BOTE**, _noun_ In law, the receiving of a man's goods again from a thief; or a compensation for them, by way of composition, and to prevent the prosecution of the thief. This in England subjects a person to a heavy fine, as by this means the punishment of the criminal is prevented.
