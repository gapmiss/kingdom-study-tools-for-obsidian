# Theory

**THE'ORY**, _noun_ \[Latin theoria; Gr. to see or contemplate.\]

**1.** Speculation; a doctrine or scheme of things, which terminates in speculation or contemplation, without a view to practice. It is here taken in an unfavorable sense, as implying something visionary.

**2.** An exposition of the general principles of any science; as the _theory_ of music.

**3.** The science distinguished from the art; as the _theory_ and practice of medicine.

**4.** The philosophical explanation of phenomena, either physical or moral; as Lavoisier's _theory_ of combustion; Smith's _theory_ of moral sentiments.

Theory is distinguished from hypothesis thus; a _theory_ is founded on inferences drawn from principles which have been established on independent evidence; a hypothesis is a proposition assumed to account for certain phenomena, and has no other evidence of its truth, than that it affords a satisfactory explanation of those phenomena.
