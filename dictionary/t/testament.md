# Testament

**TEST'AMENT**, _noun_ \[Latin testamentum, from testor, to make a will.\]

**1.** A solemn authentic instrument in writing, by which a person declares his will as to the disposal of his estate and effects after his death. This is otherwise called a will. A _testament_ to be valid, must be made when the testator is of sound mind, and it must be subscribed, witnessed and published in such manner as the law prescribes.

A man in certain cases may make a valid will by words only, and such will is called nuncupative.

**2.** The name of each general division of the canonical books of the sacred Scriptures; as the Old Testament; the New _testament_ The name is equivalent to covenant, and in our use of it, we apply it to the books which contain the old and new dispensations; that of Moses, and that of Jesus Christ.
