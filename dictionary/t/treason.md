# Treason

**TREASON**, _noun_ tree'zn. \[Latin traho. See [[Draw and Drag]].\]

**TREASON** is the highest crime of a civil nature of which a man can be guilty. Its signification is different in different countries. In general, it is the offense of attempting to overthrow the government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance, or of betraying the state into the hands of a foreign power. In monarchies, the killing of the king, or an attempt to take his life, is _treason_ In England, to imagine or compass the death of the king, or of the prince, or of the queen consort, or of the heir apparent of the crown, is high treason; as are many other offenses created by statute.

In the United States, _treason_ is confined to the actual levying of war against the United States, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.

**TREASON** in Great Britain, is of two kinds, high _treason_ and petit _treason_ High _treason_ is a crime that immediately affects the king or state; such as the offenses just enumerated. Petit _treason_ involves a breach of fidelity, but affects individuals. Thus for a wife to kill her husband, a servant his master or lord, or an ecclesiastic his lord or ordinary, is petit _treason_ But in the United States this crime is unknown; the killing in the latter cases being murder only.
