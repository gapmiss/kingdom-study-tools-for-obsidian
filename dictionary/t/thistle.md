# Thistle

**THISTLE**, _noun_ this'l. The common name of numerous prickly plants of the class Syngenesia, and several genera; as the common corn _thistle_ or Canada _thistle_ of the genus Serratula or Cnicus; the spear _thistle_ of the genus Cnicus; the milk _thistle_ of the genus Carduus; the blessed _thistle_ of the genus Centaurea; the globe _thistle_ of the genus Echinops; the cotton _thistle_ of the genus Onopordon; and the sow _thistle_ of the genus Sonchus. The name is also given to other prickly plants not of the class Syngenesia; as the fuller's _thistle_ or teasel of the genus Dipsacus, and the melon _thistle_ and torch _thistle_ of the genus Cactus.

One species of _thistle_ (Cnicus arvensis, ) grows in fields among grain, and is extremely troublesome to farmers. It is called in America the Canada _thistle_ as it first appeared in Canada, where it was probably introduced from France, as it abounds in Normandy, and also in England. A larger species in America (Cnicus lanceolatus, ) is indigenous, but it spreads slowly and gives no trouble.

Thorns also and thistles shall it bring froth to thee. [[Genesis 3#18|Genesis 3:18]].
