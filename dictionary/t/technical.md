# Technical

**TECH'NICAL**, _adjective_ \[Latin technicus; Gr. art, artifice; to fabricate, make or prepare.\]

**1.** Pertaining to art or the arts. A _technical_ word is a word that belongs properly or exclusively to an art; as the verb to smelt, belongs to metallurgy. So we say, _technical_ phrases, _technical_ language. Every artificer has his _technical_ terms.

**2.** Belonging to a particular profession; as, the words of an indictment must be _technical_

It is of the utmost importance clearly to understand the _technical_ terms used by the eastern theologians.
