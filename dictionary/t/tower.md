# Tower

**TOW'ER**, _noun_ \[Latin turris.\]

**1.** A building, either round or square, raised to a considerable elevation and consisting of several stories. When towers are erected with other buildings, as they usually are, they rise above the main edifice. They are generally flat on the top, and thus differ from steeples or spires. Before the invention of guns, places were fortified with towers and attacked with movable towers mounted on wheels, which placed the besiegers on a level with the walls.

**2.** A citadel; a fortress. [[Psalms 61#3|Psalms 61:3]].

**3.** A high head dress.

**4.** High flight; elevation.

Tower bastion, in fortification, a small _tower_ in the form of a bastion, with rooms or cells underneath for men and guns.

Tower of London, a citadel containing an arsenal. It is also a palace where the kings of England have sometimes lodged.

**TOW'ER**, _verb intransitive_ To rise and fly high; to soar; to be lofty.
