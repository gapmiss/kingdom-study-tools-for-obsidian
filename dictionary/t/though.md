# Though

**THOUGH**, _verb intransitive_ tho.

**1.** Grant; admit; allow. 'If thy brother be waxen poor--thou shalt relieve him; yea, _though_ he be a stranger.' Grant or admit the fact that he is stranger, yet thou shalt relieve him. [[Leviticus 25#35|Leviticus 25:35]].

**THOUGH** he slay me, yet will I trust in him. [[Job 13#15|Job 13:15]].

That is, grant or admit that he shall slay me, yet will I trust in him.

**THOUGH** hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished. [[Proverbs 11#21|Proverbs 11:21]].

That is, admit the fact that the wicked unite their strength, yet this will not save them from punishment.

Not that I so affirm, _though_ so it seem.

That is, grant that it seems so, yet I do not so affirm.

**2.** Used with as.

In the vine were three branches, and it was as _though_ it budded. [[Genesis 40#10|Genesis 40:10]].

So we use as if; it was as if it budded; and if is gif, give. The appearance was like the real fact, if admitted or true.

**3.** It is used in familiar language, at the end of a sentence.

A good cause would do well _though_

This is generally or always elliptical, referring to some expression preceding or understood.

**4.** It is compounded with all, in although, which see.
