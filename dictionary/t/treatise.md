# Treatise

**TRE'ATISE**, _noun_ \[Latin tractatus.\] A tract; a written composition on a particular subject, in which the principles of it are discussed or explained. A _treatise_ is of an indefinite length; but it implies more form and method than an essay, and less fullness or copiousness than a system.
