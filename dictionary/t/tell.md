We say, to _tell_ this, that or what, to _tell_ a story, to _tell_ a word, to _tell_ truth or falsehood, to _tell_ a number, to _tell_ the reasons, to _tell_ something or nothing; but we never say, to _tell_ a speech, discourse or oration, or to _tell_ an argument or a lesson. It is much used in commands. _tell_ me the whole story; _tell_ me all you know, or all that was said. _tell_ has frequently the sense of narrate; which speak and say have not.

**TELL**, _verb intransitive_ To give an account; to make report.

\--That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and _tell_ of all thy wondrous works. [[Psalms 36#1|Psalms 36:1]].

To _tell_ of

To _tell_ on - to inform. You must not disobey; I will _tell_ of you if you do. This is a common popular use of the word. To _tell_ on, is quite vulgar as well as improper.
