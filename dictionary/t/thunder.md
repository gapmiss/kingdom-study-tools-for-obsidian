# Thunder

**THUN'DER**, _noun_ \[Latin tonitru, from tono, to sound.\]

**1.** The sound which follows an explosion of electricity or lightning; the report of a discharge of electrical fluid, that is, of its passage from one cloud to another, or from a cloud to the earth, or from the earth to a cloud. When this explosion is near to a person, the _thunder_ is a rattling or clattering sound, and when distant, the sound is heavy and rumbling. The fact is in some degree the same with the report of a cannon. This sharpness or acuteness of the sound when near, and the rumbling murmur when distant, are the principal distinctions in _thunder_ \[Thunder is not lightning, but the effect of it. See [[Johnson]]'s Dictionary, under _thunder_ \]

There were thunders and lightnings. [[Exodus 19#16|Exodus 19:16]].
