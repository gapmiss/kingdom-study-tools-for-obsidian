# Tole

**TOLE**, _verb transitive_ To draw or cause to follow by presenting something pleasing or desirable to view; to allure by some bait. Thus our farmers _tole_ sheep and make them follow, by holding to them a measure of corn or some portion of fodder. In New England, it is applied only to the alluring of beasts. Locke has applied it to men.
