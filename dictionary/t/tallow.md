# Tallow

**TAL'LOW**, _noun_ A sort of animal fat, particularly that which is obtained from animals of the sheep and ox kinds. We speak of the _tallow_ of an ox or cow, or of sheep. This substance grows chiefly about the kidneys and on the intestines. The fat of swine we never call _tallow_ but lard or suet. I see in English books, mention is made of the _tallow_ of hogs, \[See Cyclopedia, article Tallow; \] but in America I never heard the word thus applied. It may be applied to the fat of goats and deer. The fat of bears we call bear's grease. _tallow_ is applied to various uses, but chiefly to the manufacture of candles.

**TAL'LOW**, _verb transitive_ To grease or smear with _tallow_

**1.** To fatten; to cause to have a large quantity of tallow; as, to _tallow_ sheep.
