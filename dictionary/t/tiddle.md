Which, at the appointed tide,

Each one did make his bride.

\[This sense is obsolete.\]

There is a tide in the affairs of men,

Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.

**7.** Current; flow of blood.

And life's red tide runs ebbing from the wound.

**TIDE**, _verb transitive_ To drive with the stream.

**TIDE**, _verb intransitive_ To work in or out of a river or harbor by favor of the tide, and anchor when it becomes adverse.
