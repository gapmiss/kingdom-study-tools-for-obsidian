# Thought

**THOUGHT**, _preterit tense_ and _participle passive_ of think; pronounced thaut.

**THOUGHT**, _adjective_ thaut. \[primarily the passive participle of think, supra.

**1.** Properly, that which the mind thinks. _thought_ is either the act or operation of the mind, when attending to a particular subject or thing or it is the idea consequent on that operation.

We say, a man's thoughts are employed on government, on religion, on trade or arts, or his thoughts are employed on his dress or his means of living. By this we mean that the mind is directed to that particular subject or object; that is, according to the literal import of the verb think, the mind, the intellectual part of man, is set upon such an object, it holds it in view or contemplation, or it extends to it, it stretches to it.

**THOUGHT** cannot be superadded to matter, so as in any sense to render it true that matter can become cogitative.
