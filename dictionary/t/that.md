# That

**THAT**, an adjective, pronoun or substitute.

**1.** _that_ is a word used as a definitive adjective, pointing to a certain person or thing before mentioned, or supposed to be understood. 'Here is _that_ book we have been seeking this hour.' 'Here goes _that_ man we were talking of.'

It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for _that_ city. [[Matthew 10#14|Matthew 10:14]].

**2.** _that_ is used definitively, to designate a specific thing or person emphatically.

The woman was made whole from _that_ hour. [[Matthew 9#6|Matthew 9:6]].

In these cases, _that_ is an adjective. In the two first examples, the may be substituted for it. 'Here is the book we have been seeking.' 'Here goes the man we were talking of.' But in other cases, the cannot supply its place, and _that_ may be considered as more emphatically definite than the.

**3.** _that_ is used as the representative of a noun, either a person or a thing. In this use, it is often a pronoun and a relative. When it refers to persons, it is equivalent to who, and when it refers to a thing, it is equivalent to which. In this use, it represents either the singular number or the plural.

He _that_ reproveth a scorner, getteth to himself shame. [[Proverbs 9#4|Proverbs 9:4]].

They _that_ hate me without a cause, are more than the hairs of my head. [[Psalms 63#9|Psalms 63:9]].

A judgment _that_ is equal and impartial, must incline to the greater probabilities.

They shall gather out of his kingdom all things _that_ offend. Mat 13.

**4.** _that_ is also the representative of a sentence or part of a sentence, and often of a series of sentences. In this case, _that_ is not strictly a pronoun, a word standing for a noun; but is, so to speak, a pro-sentence, the substitute for a sentence, to save the repetition of it.

And when Moses heard _that_ he was content. [[Leviticus 10#3|Leviticus 10:3]].

**THAT** here stands for the whole of what Aaron had said, or the whole of the preceding verse.

I will know your business, that I will.

Ye defraud, and _that_ your brethren. [[1 Corinthians 6#2|1 Corinthians 6:2]].

**THAT** sometimes in this use, precedes the sentence or clause to which it refers.

**THAT** be far from thee, to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked. [[Genesis 18#5|Genesis 18:5]].

**THAT** here represents the clause in italics.

**5.** _that_ sometimes is the substitute for an adjective. You allege _that_ the man is innocent; _that_ he is not.

**6.** _that_ in the following use, has been called a conjunction. 'I heard _that_ the Greeks had defeated the Turks.' But in this case, _that_ has the same character as in No.4. It is the representative of the part of the sentence which follows, as may be seen by inverting the order of the clauses. 'The Greeks had defeated the Turks; I heard _that_ ' 'It is not _that_ I love you less.' _that_ here refers to the latter clause of the sentence, as a kind of demonstrative.

**7.** _that_ was formerly used for _that_ which, like what.

We speak _that_ we do know, and testify _that_ we have seen. [[John 3#2|John 3:2]]. \[This use is no longer held legitimate.\]

**8.** _that_ is used in opposition to this, or by way of distinction.

**9.** When this and _that_ refer to foregoing words, this, like the Latin hie, and French ceci, refers to the latter, and _that_ to the former. It is the same with these and those.

_Self-love and reason to one end aspire,_

Pain their aversion, pleasure their desire,

But greedy _that_ its object would devour,

This taste the honey, and not wound the flow'r.
