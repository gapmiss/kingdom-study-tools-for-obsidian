# G4811 συκοφαντέω

## sykophantéō

_(soo-kof-an-teh'-o | soo-koh-fahn-TEH-oh | syoo-koh-fahn-TAY-oh)_

### Definition

from a compound of G4810 and a derivative of G5316; to be a fig-informer (reporter of the law forbidding the exportation of figs from Greece), "sycophant", i.e., (genitive and by extension) to defraud (exact unlawfully, extort); accuse falsely, take by false accusation; 

- to accuse wrongfully, to calumniate, to attack by malicious devices
- to exact money wrongfully
  - to extort from, defraud

### Note

At Athens those were συκοφάντης whose business it was to inform against any one whom they might detect exporting figs out of Attica, and as sometimes they seemed to extort money from those loath to be exposed, the name "συκοφάντης" from the time of Aristophanes down was a general term of opprobrium to designate, a malignant and base accuser for love of gain.
