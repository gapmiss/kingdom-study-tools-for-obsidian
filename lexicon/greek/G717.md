_(ar-mag-ed-dohn' | ar-ma-geth-THONE | ar-ma-gayth-THONE)_

### Definition

the hill, city of Megiddo; of Hebrew origin (H2022 and H4023); Armageddon (or Har-Meggiddon), a symbolic name; Armageddon; 

- A city in northern Israel where many battles were fought
- a battle field

### Note

In Revelation 16:16, the scene of the struggle of good and evil is suggested by that battle plain of Esdraelon, which was famous for two great victories, of Barak over the Canaanites, and of Gideon over the Midianites; and for two great disasters, the deaths of Saul and Josiah. Hence in Revelation a place of great slaughter, the scene of a terrible retribution upon the wicked.
