## Balaám

_(bal-ah-am' | va-la-AM | va-la-AM)_

### Definition

perhaps; of Hebrew origin (H1109); Balaam, a Mesopotamian (symbolic of a false teacher); Balaam; 

- The prophet Balaam

### Note

Balaam was native of Pethor a city in Mesopotamia and endued by Jehovah with prophetic power. He was hired by Balak to curse the Israelites; and influenced by the love of reward, he wished to gratify Balak; but he was compelled by Jehovah's power to bless them. Hence later the Jews saw him as a most abandoned deceiver. See Numbers 22 and following.
