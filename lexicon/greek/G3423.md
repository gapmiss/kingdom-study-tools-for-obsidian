# G3423 μνηστεύω

## mnēsteúō

_(mnace-tyoo'-o | m-nay-STEV-oh | m-nay-STAVE-oh)_

### Definition

from a derivative of G3415; to give a souvenir (betrothal present), i.e., betroth; espouse; 

- to be promised in marriage, be betrothed

### Note

Unlike modern day engagement, betrothal always ends in marriage. Consider how Joseph intended to put Mary away privately instead of calling off the marriage (Matthew 1:19).
