# G5594 ψύχω

## psýchō

_(psoo'-kho | PSOO-hoh | PSYOO-hoh)_

### Definition

a primary verb; to breathe (voluntarily but gently, thus differing on the one hand from G4154, which denotes properly a forcible respiration; and on the other from the base of G0109, which refers properly to an inanimate breeze), i.e., (by implication, of reduction of temperature by evaporation) to chill (figuratively); wax cold; 

- to breathe, blow, cool by blowing
- to be made or grow cool or cold
- metaphorically of waning love
