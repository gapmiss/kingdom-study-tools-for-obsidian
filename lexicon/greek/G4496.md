# G4496 ῥίπτω

## rhíptō

_(hrip'-to | REE-ptoh | REE-ptoh)_

### Definition

a primary verb (perhaps rather akin to the base of G4474, through the idea of sudden motion); to fling (properly, with a quick toss, thus differing from G0906, which denotes a deliberate hurl; and from τείνω (see in G1614), which indicates an extended projection); by qualification, to deposit (as if a load); by extension, to disperse; cast (down, out), scatter abroad, throw; 

- to cast, throw
- throw down
- to cast forward or before
- to set down (with the suggestion of haste and want of care)
- to throw to the ground, prostrate
