# G2762 κεραία

## keraía

_(ker-ah'-yah | keh-REH-ah | kay-RAY-ah)_

### Definition

feminine of a presumed derivative of the base of G2768; something horn-like, i.e., (specially) the apex of a Hebrew letter (figuratively, the least particle); tittle; 

- a little horn
- extremity, apex, point
  - used by grammarians of the accents and diacritical points, i.e., the smallest distinguishing stroke of a Hebrew letter

### Note

The title is analogous to the dot of an "i" in English. Jesus used it to refer to the little lines by which the Hebrew letters, in other respects similar, differ from one another; the meaning is, "not even the minutest part of the law shall perish."
