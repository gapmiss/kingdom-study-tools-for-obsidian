# G4441 πυνθάνομαι

## pynthánomai

_(poon-than'-om-ahee | poon-THA-noh-meh | pyoon-THA-noh-may)_

### Definition

middle voice prolonged from a primary πύθω (which occurs only as an alternate in certain tenses); to question, i.e., ascertain by inquiry (as a matter of information merely; and thus differing from G2065, which properly means a request as a favor; and from G0154, which is strictly a demand for something due; as well as from G2212, which implies a search for something hidden; and from G1189, which involves the idea of urgent need); by implication, to learn (by casual intelligence); ask, demand, enquire, understand; 

- to enquire, ask
- to ascertain, by enquiry
