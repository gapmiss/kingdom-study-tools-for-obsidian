# G4623 σιωπάω

## siōpáō

_(see-o-pah'-o | see-oh-PA-oh | see-oh-PA-oh)_

### Definition

from σιωπή (silence, i.e. a hush; properly, muteness, i.e. involuntary stillness, or inability to speak; and thus differing from G4602, which is rather a voluntary refusal or indisposition to speak, although the terms are often used synonymously); to be dumb (but not deaf also, like 2974 properly); figuratively, to be calm (as quiet water); dumb, (hold) peace; 

- to be silent, hold one's peace
  - used of one's silence because dumb
- metaphorically of a calm, quiet sea
