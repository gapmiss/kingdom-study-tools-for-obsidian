He was consul in 12 BC and was made governor of Syria after the banishment of Archelaus in AD 6. He was probably twice governor of Syria; his first governorship extended from 4 BC (the year of Christ's birth) to 1 BC. It was during this time that he was sent to make a census which caused Joseph and Mary to visit Bethlehem. The second census is mentioned in Acts 5:37. "Cyrenius" is the Greek form of the Roman name "Quirinus."
