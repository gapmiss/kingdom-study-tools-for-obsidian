## ptōchós

_(pto-khos' | ptoh-HOSE | ptoh-HOSE)_

### Definition

from πτώσσω (to crouch); akin to G4422 and the alternate of G4098); a beggar (as cringing), i.e., pauper (strictly denoting absolute or public mendicancy, although also used in a qualified or relative sense; whereas G3993 properly means only straitened circumstances in private), literally (often as noun) or figuratively (distressed); beggar(-ly), poor; 

- reduced to beggary, begging, asking alms
- destitute of wealth, influence, position, honor
  - lowly, afflicted, destitute of the Christian virtues and eternal riches
  - helpless, powerless to accomplish an end
  - poor, needy
- lacking in anything
  - as respects their spirit
    - destitute of wealth of learning and intellectual culture which the schools afford (men of this class most readily give themselves up to Christ's teaching and proved them selves fitted to lay hold of the heavenly treasure)
