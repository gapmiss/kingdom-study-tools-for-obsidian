- to dissolve, disunite
  - (what has been joined together), to destroy, demolish

      - of institutions, forms of government, laws, etc., to deprive of force, annul, abrogate, discard
  - of travellers, to halt on a journey, to put up, lodge (the figurative expression originating in the circumstance that, to put up for the night, the straps and packs of the beasts of burden are unbound and taken off; or, more correctly from the fact that the traveller's garments, tied up when he is on the journey, are unloosed at it end)
