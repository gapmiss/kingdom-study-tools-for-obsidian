## rhḗgnymi

_(hrayg'-noo-mee | RAY-gnoo-mee | RAY-gnyoo-mee)_

### Definition

both prolonged forms of ῥήκω (which appears only in certain forms, and is itself probably a strengthened form of agnumi (see in G2608)); to "break," "wreck" or "crack", i.e., (especially) to sunder (by separation of the parts; G2608 being its intensive (with the preposition in composition), and G2352 a shattering to minute fragments; but not a reduction to the constituent particles, like G3089) or disrupt, lacerate; by implication, to convulse (with spasms); figuratively, to give vent to joyful emotions; break (forth), burst, rend, tear; 

- to rend, burst or break asunder, break up, break through
  - to tear in pieces
  - to break forth
    - into joy, of infants or dumb persons beginning to speak
  - to distort, convulse
    - of a demon causing convulsions in a man possessed
    - to dash down, hurl to the ground (a common occurrence in cases of demon possession and epilepsy)
