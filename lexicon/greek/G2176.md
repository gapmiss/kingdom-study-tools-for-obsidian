# G2176 εὐώνυμος

## euṓnymos

_(yoo-o'-noo-mos | ev-OH-noo-mose | ave-OH-nyoo-mose)_

### Definition

from G2095 and G3686; properly, well-named (good-omened), i.e., the left (which was the lucky side among the pagan Greeks); neuter as adverbial, at the left hand; (on the) left; 

- of good name and of good omen
  - in the latter sense used in taking auguries; but those omens were euphemistically called &quot;euonumos&quot; which in fact were regarded as unlucky, i.e., which came from the left, sinister omens, (for which a good name was desired)
- left, on the left hand
