# G3032 Λιβερτῖνος

## Libertînos

_(lib-er-tee'-nos | lee-ver-TEE-nose | lee-vare-TEE-nose)_

### Definition

of Latin origin; a Roman freedman; Libertine; 

- one who has been liberated from slavery, a freedman, or the son of a freed man
- Libertine, denotes Jews (according to Philo) who had been made captives of the Romans under Pompey but were afterwards set free

### Note

The Libertine Jews had built, at their own expense, a synagogue at Jerusalem which they frequented when in that city, even though they had fixed their abode in Rome. The name "Libertines" adhered to them to distinguish them from free born Jews who had subsequently taken up their residence at Rome. Evidence seems to have been discovered of the existence of a "synagogue of the Libertines" at Pompeii.
