# G2218 ζυγός

## zygós

_(dzoo-gos' | zoo-GOSE | zyoo-GOSE)_

### Definition

from the root of ζεύγνυμι (to join, especially by a "yoke"); a coupling, i.e., (figuratively) servitude (a law or obligation); also (literally) the beam of the balance (as connecting the scales); pair of balances, yoke; 

- a yoke
  - a yoke that is put on draught cattle
  - metaphorically, used of any burden or bondage
    - as that of slavery
    - of troublesome laws imposed on one, especially of the Mosaic law, hence the name is so transferred to the commands of Christ as to contrast them with the commands of the Pharisees which were a veritable 'yoke'; yet even Christ's commands must be submitted to, though easier to be kept
- a balance, pair of scales
