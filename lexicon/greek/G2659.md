## katányxis

_(kat-an'-oox-is | ka-TA-noo-ksees | ka-TA-nyoo-ksees)_

### Definition

from G2660; a prickling (sensation, as of the limbs asleep), i.e., (by implication, (perhaps by some confusion with G3506 or even with G3571)) stupor (lethargy); slumber; 

- a pricking, piercing
- severe sorrow, extreme grief
- insensibility or torpor of mind, such as extreme grief easily produces
  - hence a &quot;spirit of stupor&quot;, which renders their souls torpid so insensible that they are not affected at all by the offer made them of salvation through the Messiah
