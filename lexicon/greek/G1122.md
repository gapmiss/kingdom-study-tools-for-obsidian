# G1122 γραμματεύς

## grammateús

_(gram-mat-yooce' | grahm-ma-TEVS | grahm-ma-TAYFS)_

### Definition

from G1121. a writer, i.e. (professionally) scribe or secretary; a professional writer; scribe, town-clerk; 

- a clerk, scribe, especially a public servant, secretary, recorder, whose office and influence differed in different states
- a man learned in the Mosaic law and in the sacred writings, an interpreter, teacher
- a religious teacher: so instructed that from his learning and ability to teach advantage may redound to the kingdom of heaven

### Note

Scribes examined the more difficult and subtle questions of the law; added to the Mosaic law decisions of various kinds thought to elucidate its meaning and scope, and did this to the detriment of religion. Since the advice of men skilled in the law was needed in the examination in the causes and the solution of the difficult questions, they were enrolled in the Sanhedrin, and are mentioned in connection with the priests and elders of the people.
