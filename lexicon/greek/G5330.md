# G5330 Φαρισαῖος

## Pharisaîos

_(far-is-ah'-yos | fa-ree-SEH-ose | fa-ree-SAY-ose)_

### Definition

of Hebrew origin (compare H6567); a separatist, i.e., exclusively religious; a Pharisean, i.e., Jewish sectary; Pharisee; 

- A Jewish sect (which seems to have started after the Jewish exile) that focused on outward forms of piety, enemies of Jesus Christ

### Note

In addition to Old Testament books, the Pharisees recognized in oral tradition a standard of belief and life. They sought for distinction and praise by outward observance of external rites and by outward forms of piety, and such as ceremonial washings, fastings, prayers, and alms giving; and, comparatively negligent of genuine piety, they prided themselves on their fancied good works. They held strenuously to a belief in the existence of good and evil angels, and to the expectation of a Messiah; and they cherished the hope that the dead, after a preliminary experience either of reward or of penalty in Hades, would be recalled to life by him, and be requited each according to his individual deeds. In opposition to the usurped dominion of the Herods and the rule of the Romans, they stoutly upheld the theocracy and their country's cause and possessed great influence with the common people. According to Josephus they numbered more than 6000. They were bitter enemies of Jesus and his cause; and were in turn severely rebuked by him for their avarice, ambition, hollow reliance on outward works, and affection of piety in order to gain popularity.
