### Note

Synagogues seem to date their origin from the Babylonian exile. In the times of Jesus and the apostles, every town, not only in Palestine but also among the Gentiles if it contained a considerable number of Jewish inhabitants, had at least one synagogue; the larger towns had several. These were also used for trials and inflicting punishment.
