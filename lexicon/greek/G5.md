# G5 Ἀββᾶ

## Abbâ

_(ab-bah' | av-VA | av-VA)_

### Definition

father; of Chaldee origin (H0002); father as a vocative; Abba; 

- father, customary title used of God in prayer

### Note

Whenever it occurs in the New Testament it has the Greek interpretation joined to it, that is apparently to be explained by the fact that the original Chaldee word through frequent use in prayer, gradually acquired the nature of a most sacred proper name, to which the Greek speaking Jews added the name from their own tongue.
