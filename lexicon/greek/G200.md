# G200 ἀκρίς

## akrís

_(ak-rece' | ah-KREES | ah-KREES)_

### Definition

apparently from the same as G0206; a locust (as pointed, or as lighting on the top of vegetation); locust; 

- a locust, particularly that species which especially infests Middle Eastern countries, stripping fields and trees

### Note

Numberless swarms of them almost every spring are carried by the wind from Arabia into Palestine, and having devastated that country, migrate to regions farther north, until they perish by falling into the sea. Middle Easterners were accustomed to feed upon locusts, either raw or roasted and seasoned with salt (or prepared in other ways), and the Israelites also were permitted to eat them.
