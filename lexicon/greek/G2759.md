# G2759 κέντρον

## kéntron

_(ken'-tron | KEN-trone | KANE-trone)_

### Definition

from κεντέω (to prick); a point ("center"), i.e., a sting (figuratively, poison) or goad (figuratively, divine impulse); prick, sting; 

- a sting, as that of bees, scorpions, locusts
- an iron goad, for urging on oxen, horses and other beasts of burden
  - hence the proverb, &quot;to kick against the goad&quot;, i.e., to offer vain and perilous or ruinous resistance

### Note

Since animals wound by their sting and even cause death, Paul attributes death, personified as a sting, i.e., a deadly weapon.
