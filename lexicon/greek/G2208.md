the same as G2207; a Zealot, i.e., (specially) partisan for Jewish political independence; Zelotes;

### Note

From the time of the Maccabees, there existed among the Jews a class of men called Zealots, who vigorously adhered to the Mosaic law and endeavoring even by a resort to violence, after the example of Phinehas, to prevent religion from being violated by others; but in the latter days of the Jewish commonwealth they used their holy zeal as a pretext for the basest crimes.
