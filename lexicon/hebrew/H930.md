# H930 בְּהֵמוֹת / בהמות

## bᵉhêmôwth

_(be-hay-mohth' | beh-hay-MOTE | beh-hay-MOTE)_

## Definition

in form a plural or H0929, but really a singular of Egyptian derivation; a dinosaur; Behemoth; n-m

- a dinosaur
  - most likely a sauropod, such as the Diplodocus or Brachiosaurus

## Note

Some translate this as elephant or hippopotamus, but from the description in Job 40:15-24, this is patently absurd. With a "tail like a cedar," certainly this creature must have been much larger than any animal known today; however it is clear from the text that Job was aware of this giant beast.

## Verse(s)

[[Job 40#15|Job 40:15]]
