# H3999 מַבּוּל / מבול

## mabbûwl

_(mab-bool' | mahb-BOOL | ma-BOOL)_

## Definition

from H2986 in the sense of flowing; a deluge; flood; n-m

- flood, deluge.
  - Noah's flood that submerged the entire planet earth under water for about a year

## Note

Some think Noah's flood was only local; however the description of it found in Genesis 6 through 8 makes this patently absurd. With the possible exception of Psalm 29:10, this word always refers to Noah's flood.
